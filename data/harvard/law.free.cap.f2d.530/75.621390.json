(Four Winds). The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 211 N.L.R.B. No. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">1. <em>PROCEEDING BELOW:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">Four Winds was charged with five unfair labor practices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Administrative Law Judge found in favor of Four Winds on all charges. The Board reversed the Administrative Law Judge in part and found that Four Winds had: (1) violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), by statements which evidenced a refusal to bargain about a union-security clause and which threatened permanent replacement of strikers; (2) violated Section 8(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3), and 8(a)(1) of the Act by discharging employees Joe Rodarte and Jay Cormier because of their union activities; (3) violated Section 8(a)(5), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5), of the Act as well as Section 8(a)(1) by its refusal to bargain about a union-security clause. The Board ordered Four Winds to reinstate the employees with back pay and to bargain with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">II. <em>SUMMARY OF FACTS:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">Four Winds manufactures and sells campers and mobile homes at its plant in Santa Ana, California. At times material herein, it employed from 40 to 47 employees. Rodarte contacted William Miller, Union Representative of the Orange County District Council of Carpenters, and received authorization cards which Rodarte, Cormier, and other employees distributed during breaks at Four Winds. Miller received by mail and hand-delivery at least 24 cards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Between October 24, 1972, and October 26, 1972, Miller contacted Lee Walters, President of Four Winds, in person and by mail and requested recognition of the Union as the employees\u2019 bargaining agent. On October 27, 1972, Miller met with Four Winds\u2019 counsel who informed Miller that Four Winds would not recognize the Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ion. He suggested that Miller should pursue Board processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">On November 13, 1972, the Union filed a petition for certification as a bargaining representative. On November 17, 1972, Rodarte and Cormier were discharged. On October 30, 1972, January 3, 1973, and January 9, 1973, Four Winds distributed anti-union literature. On January 12, 1973, the election was held. The Union lost 26 to 3 with 4 votes challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">III. <em>STATEMENTS IN PRE-ELECTION LITERATURE:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Section 8(a)(1) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">\u201c(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer \u2014 (1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 [organization and collective bargaining] of this title;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">This is modified, however, by the so-called \u201cfree speech\u201d clause of Section 8(c), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">\u201cThe expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this subchapter, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">This section protects the right of both employers and employees. Because of the importance freedom of speech has under our Constitution alleged unfair labor practices in the form of speech must be carefully scrutinized. Unless the speech contains a \u201cthreat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit\u201d it is privileged. A mere prediction of what effect unionization would have is not an unfair labor practice. <em>N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). In making a prediction the employer must be careful to base his statements on an eventuality that is capable of proof, and not on an implication that his own initiative will cause economic detriment. <em>Gissell, supra </em>at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918. The interpretation of the speech in issue must take place in a setting which balances the rights of both parties but recognizes the economically dependent relationship of the employee to the employer. <em>Gissell, supra </em>at 617, 89 S.Ct. 1918. The choice of proper words is not an exercise in \u201cbrinkmanship.\u201d <em>Gissell, supra </em>at 620, 89 S.Ct. 1918. We look not for certain words that are allowed and others that are forbidden. Rather, we are to view the statements in their entirety and consider their total effect on the receiver. <em>Gissell, supra </em>at 619, 89 S.Ct. 1918; <em>N.L.R.B. v. Tommy\u2019s Spanish Foods, Inc., </em>463 F.2d 116 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">Substantial portions of the preelection literature at issue here, General Counsel Exhibits 6(a), (b), and (c), are set out in an appendix to this opinion. We conclude that the literature as a whole conveys an <em>inevitability </em>that a union shop and other unrealistic demands will result from unionization; that these demands will be unacceptable to Four Winds; that the vote of the employees will have caused this; and that a strike with job loss, i. e., permanent replacement, of striking employees the only possible outcome. This is less than a prediction of the effect of unionization capable of proof. Rather it is a thinly veiled threat from the employer that voting in the Union would inevitably result in ultimate job loss for its supporters. We hold this to be a violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. The use of the phrase \u201cbargaining in good faith\u201d does not dissipate the coercive tone of the entirety. We do not attach the special distinctions to the words \u201cmoral right\u201d that underlay the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision. Nor do we consider this language different in tone from that used in <em>Tommy\u2019s Spanish Foods, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Four Winds argues that its language in the present case is similar to that in <em>Adco Advertising, Inc., </em>206 N.L.R.B. No. 58 (1973) and <em>O\u2019Neil Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., </em>209 N.L.R.B. No. 82 (1974) which was upheld by the Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Four Winds argues that it is entitled to consistency from the Board. Those cases, however, are not before us. Four Winds, the Board, and the Union all are entitled to consistency from this court. <em>Tommy\u2019s Spanish Foods </em>controls because the effect of the language in it and this case was to convey to the workers that unionization would unalterably result in a stand-off between the employer and the union. In the inevitable loyalty contest which would follow, union supporters would lose their jobs. To an employee in a position of economic dependence the message is received as a threat of reprisal. Since there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusion upon this ground, the order calling for cessation of this type of violation should be and is enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">IV. <em>DISCHARGE OF RODARTE AND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">\n<em>CORMIER:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">We do not, however, affirm the Board\u2019s order with respect to the discharge of employees Rodarte and Cormi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>er. The issue here is largely determined by the credibility of the witnesses. Great weight is given to the findings in this area of the Administrative Law Judge who heard the testimony and observed the demeanor of the witnesses. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Walton Mfg. Co., </em>369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829 (1962). This is especially true when the findings of the Board are different from those of the Administrative Law Judge. <em>Universal Camera, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The Administrative Law Judge made explicit findings against the credibility of the employees. He found that Rodarte and Cormier deliberately misstated the facts. He gave no credit to their testimony. He was unfavorably impressed by the demeanor and testimony of Granneman, a co-employee who testified for Rodarte and Cormier. Although Rodarte and Cormier were granted wage increases during their employment, the Administrative Law Judge found specifically that their employment records (Respondent\u2019s Exhibits 3 and 4) showing tardiness, poor work, violations of rules, and repeated warnings were made \u201con the job\u201d and were not created for purposes of the hearing. He considered the timing of the discharges but did not find it determinative. Discharges had been recommended earlier but were delayed because Four Winds\u2019 counsel had advised against terminating employees during a union campaign. The Administrative Law Judge explicitly credited the testimony of Walters, Four Winds\u2019 President, and McAfee, Four Winds\u2019 Shop Supervisor. He found that Rodarte and Cormier were discharged for the reasons shown in their employment records. There is additional evidence in the record concerning the adverse effect this poor work was having on the production and the other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">There is little evidence that Walters knew of the union activities of Rodarte and Cormier. Miller introduced Rodarte and Cormier, along with others, as the union organizing committee to the Plant Manager and Plant Supervisor. There is no substantial evidence the employees were introduced in this capacity to Walters nor that the Plant Manager\u2019s account to Walters of the introduction included anything more than the generalities of the episode. The most that can be said is that Walters walked up to Miller on company property one day when Miller was speaking to Rodarte, Cormier and others, and that Walters was aware the two employees were among the plant employees who ate lunch together because they favored the union. There is no substantial evidence that Walters had knowledge of any union activity on either employee\u2019s part beyond membership on the \u201cin plant committee\u201d and a favorable attitude toward the Union, both of which they shared with other employees. In the absence of substantial evidence of such knowledge, it will not be presumed. <em>N.L.R.B. v. Klaue, </em>523 F.2d 410 (9th Cir. 1975). We hold there was substantial evidence to support the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s finding that Rodarte and Cormier were discharged because of their poor work performance. There is a lack of substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusion on this matter. As a result, we reverse the order of the Board requiring reinstatement and back pay of these two.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">V. <em>BARGAINING ORDER:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Because of our finding that the pre-election statements violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, we affirm the Board\u2019s order setting aside the election. We question, however, the propriety of the bargaining order, especially in view of our finding that the discharges of Rodarte and Cormier were justified. The Board gave considerable weight to the effect of these discharges on the election in its decision to order Four Winds to bargain with the Union. A bargaining order is clearly proper where there are extraordinary violations, and may even be upheld where there are lesser practices which still \u201cundermine majority strength and impede the election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>processes.\u201d <em>Gissell, supra </em>395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. There are less extensive unfair labor practices which will not sustain a bargaining order. <em>Gis-sell, supra </em>at 615, 89 S.Ct. 1918. The commission of an unfair labor practice does not automatically result in an order to bargain. <em>Id. </em>In choosing a remedy <em>Gissell </em>has directed the Board to consider the extensiveness of the unfair labor practices, their effect on the election, the likelihood that they will reoccur, and whether a fair election could be held. In the present case the authorization cards entered into evidence amounted to a bare majority, although there was testimony that a greater number were signed. The language in the pre-election statements, though considered improper by this court, was not greatly dissimilar from <em>Adco Advertising </em>and <em>O\u2019Neil Moving &amp; Storage </em>which had been approved by the Board. The discharges of Rodarte and Cormier under our findings cannot be considered to have influenced the election. We are mindful that the Board\u2019s choice of a remedy is given special respect by reviewing courts but we remand this case to the Board in light of the above considerations to reconsider whether Four Winds should be required to bargain or a new election be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Certain portions of the letters which follow have been summarized, others have been quoted in detail. All emphasis was in the original.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>General Counsel Exhibit 6(a) </em>\u2014 a letter dated October 30, 1972, and addressed \u201cTO: ALL PRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES AT FOUR WINDS INDUSTRIES\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The first four paragraphs are a general introduction concerning the contacts the Union had made with Four Winds, Four Winds\u2019 unfavorable attitude toward the Union, the significance of authorization cards, and the possibility of an election supervised by the N.L.R.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Paragraph five, page one, continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayi-dedup-2\">\u201cWe want to make our position clear at this time so you will be fully informed regarding all the issues involved in any decision by you. The simple fact is that we are opposed to the Carpenters, or any union. Some of the reasons are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">\u201c1. The Carpenters Union, to our knowledge, never signs a contract without a union shop provision which requires that all employees be members of the union and pay their monthly dues in order to be able to work. This would force your company to fire anyone who refuses to become a member of the union and pay dues. <em>We are opposed to this and do not believe we have any moral right to force any of our people to join any union to keep their jobs.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">\u201cWould our employees want us to force them into the union and pay dues against their wishes? We think not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">\u201c2. We are convinced that the Carpenters will make other demands on us, such as higher wages and benefits, because they have made <em>promises </em>to you and they will feel compelled to deliver on those promises. We will review for you our record to show you that you are now getting the highest wages and benefits in our industry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX_\">A recital of wages and benefits and a paragraph on Union promises in general complete page two. Page three begins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">\u201cThe Union will be telling you that once it wins representation rights, your company will have to sit down at the bargaining table and we will be forced to sign the contract the union will be insisting on. This is not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">\n<em>\u201cBear in mind that while you have the right to decide for yourselves whether you want this union to represent you, we also have the absolute right, under the law, to decide for ourselves on what kind of a contract we will be willing to sign. We have the absolute right under the law to make the final decision of what is good for the company and no union can force us to sign any contract that is not acceptable to us.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>APPENDIX \u2014 Continued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">\u201cYou are cautioned to look ahead and realize that if we cannot do business with the Carpenters, should you vote them into our operation, because their demands are unrealistic, as they inevitably will be, the only way the union can enforce its demands is by calling our employees out on a strike. This is the history of unions and this union is quite prepared to play with your futures since it costs the union no money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cOn the other hand, we want you to know that in the event the union prevails upon you to go out on a strike, you will get no benefits from the union. What is more, if there is a strike we are not going to close down our operation for even one day. We would expect that a good percentage of our employees would continue working and we would hire other employees permanently to replace the present employees who would refuse to cross any union picket line. This is our right under the law. We tell you this not as any threat, but to make sure you are well informed before you bring the union in and it\u2019s too late.\u201d The last two paragraphs emphasize</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5a\">Four Winds\u2019 interest in its employees, recognize the right of both sides to a free choice, remind the employees that there can be no strikes or loss of income if there is no union and that the law permits their permanent replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"AGi\"><em>General Counsel Exhibit 6(b) </em>\u2014 letter dated January 3, 1973, and addressed \u201cTO: ALL PRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The two introductory paragraphs concern the election to be held on Friday, January 12, 1973, and its importance. Paragraph three continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201cHere are several facts which should convince you to vote \u2018NO\u2019 on January 12th and reject the Carpenters by an overwhelming margin:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201c1. Don\u2019t be misled by the Carpenters that Four Winds Industries has to sign whatever contract the union demands, once it wins the election. Nothing could be further from the truth. <em>We have the absolute right under the law to decide what is good for Four Winds and no union can force us to sign any contract which is not acceptable to us.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">\u201c2. In other words, if the union were to win the election, we at Four Winds Industries would be influenced primarily with what is good for the company and our employees and not what the union\u2019s demands were. Once we have negotiated in good faith and the union\u2019s demands are not acceptable to us, then the only thing the union can do is try to enforce its demands by striking. <em>As we told you before, if the union prevails upon you to go out on a strike, you will get absolutely no benefits from the Carpenters. What is more, if there is a strike, we\u2019re not going to close down our operation for even one single day. We would expect that a good percentage of our employees would continue working and we would hire other employees permanently to replace the present employees, who would refuse to cross any union picket line.

What is more, if there is a strike we would not close down our operation for even one day. We would expect that most of our employees would continue working but in any event we would hire employees permanently to replace our present employees who strike. This is our right under the law. We tell you this not as any threat, but to make sure you are well informed before you bring this union in and it is too late.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-20\">Pertinent passages from <em>O\u2019Neil Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., </em>209 N.L.R.B. No. 82 (1974) are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-21\">\u201cHere\u2019s what you can expect from Teamsters\u2019 representation: The only contract that the Teamsters will agree to, if they win the election, is the industry-wide Southern California area contract, for the moving and storage industry. This includes the union shop, among many other objectionable provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-22\">\u201cA union shop would require each and every one of you, as well as any future employee, to be a member of the Teamsters. This would force us to fire anyone who refused to become a member and pay dues, assessments and fines which are totally controlled by the Teamsters. We are opposed to this and do not believe we have any right to force any of our people to join any union to keep their jobs.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
