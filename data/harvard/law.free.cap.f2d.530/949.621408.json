We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">The articles, invoiced as C-9V4 type, 120 volt \u201cChristmas Light Bulbs\u201d or \u201cChristmas Bulbs,\u201d are small, 10-watt, intermediate-base bulbs, specifically designed to produce colored light. These bulbs (hereafter referred to as \u201cC \u2014 9\u201d bulbs or lamps) are primarily sold during the Christmas season.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-18\">\n<em>Statutory Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-19\">The pertinent portions of the tariff schedules are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-20\">Electric filament lamps and electric discharge lamps, Including ultra-violet and Infra-red lamps and photo-flash lamps; electric luminescent lamps; and arc lamps:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-21\">Filament lamps:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-22\">686.30 Christmas-tree lamps * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-23\"># # # * rt #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-24\">Other:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-25\">686.90 Designed for operating at 100 volts or more ~ *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-27\">\n<em>Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-28\">The imported C \u2014 9 lamps were classified on entry as \u201cChristmas-tree lamps,\u201d under TSUS item 686.30. Appellant pleaded that they are properly classifiable under TSUS item 686.90, as modified by Presidential Proclamation, T.D. 68-9, as \u201cother electric filament lamps, designed for operating at 100 volts or more.\u201d In pleading erroneous classification under item 686.30, appellant alleged said item to be a use provision governed by TSUS General Interpretative Rule 10(e)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-30\">The Customs Court found that appellant had failed to overcome the presumption that the imported C \u2014 9 bulbs were properly classified. Considering item 686.30 as if it were governed by General Interpretative Rule 10(e)(i), i. e., as it would be if it were a classification \u201ccontrolled by use (other than actual use),\u201d the Customs Court held that appellant had not established \u201cthat the <em>class </em>or <em>kind </em>of merchandise imported was not chiefly used on Christmas trees.\u201d Pointing out that the slightly smaller C \u2014 7 lamp was concededly a \u201cChristmas-tree lamp\u201d within the meaning of item 686.-30, the court found the C \u2014 9 lamp to be of the same class or kind. In so finding, the court noted that both lamps \u201cwere marketed and sold in the same manner during the Christmas season and through the same channels of distribution,\u201d that the predominant use by far for both \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>in Christmas lighting strings for decorative purposes at Christmastime,\u201d that both \u201cbelong to the same product line and were displayed, advertised and uniformly referred to in the same manner,\u201d that both were constructed in the same manner, except for size, and that the decorative effect of both \u201cis the same.\u201d As a consequence of its finding, the court stated that \u201cit was incumbent upon plaintiff to establish that the predominant use of the class as a whole, i. e., C \u2014 7 and C-9 lamps combined, was not for the decoration of Christmas trees,\u201d and concluded that it had not done so since \u201con this score, plaintiff presented no evidence whatever.\u201d It stated further that \u201ceven though it were to be assumed that plaintiff had proven that the C \u2014 9 lamps <em>per se </em>were not chiefly used to decorate Christmas trees, this would still not be sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">The court next considered the question before it on the basis that item 686.30 was not a so-called \u201cclassification by use,\u201d noting that the Customs Court had earlier indicated that item to be an eo nomine provision in <em>Mobilite, Inc. v. United States, </em>70 Cust.Ct. 359, C.R.D. 73-11, 358 F.Supp. 267 (1973). The court, referring to testimony by appellant\u2019s witnesses, stated: \u201cThe fact, however, that C \u2014 7 lamps, as well as C \u2014 9 lamps, were not usually referred to as Christmas-tree lamps does not mean that they were not commonly <em>known </em>as such.\u201d The court pointed to a 1939 report of the Tariff Commission entitled <em>Incandescent Electric Lamps </em>(T.C.Rept. No. 133, 2d series) which, in listing some representative flange-seal, miniature lamps, included \u201cthe larger Christmas-tree lamps designed for outdoor use.\u201d The court concluded that the Commission was referring \u201csolely to the C \u2014 9 bulb [for] as the record shows, this is the only bulb in the industry that fits the above description.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Appellant argues that item 686.30 can be considered from only one point of view, as a so-called \u201cclassification by use.\u201d As to the Customs Court\u2019s consideration of the classification as eo no-mine, appellant concedes only that it may be an \u201ceo nomine by use\u201d designation, but that even if it is, \u201cthe issue is still one of chief use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">Further, appellant argues that the Customs Court did not properly apply General Interpretative Rule 10(e)(i) because it failed to interpret the phrase \u201cclass or kind to which the imported articles belong\u201d as being defined by the physical characteristics of the imported article itself. Defining the \u201cclass or kind\u201d of article here as <em>\u201cC </em>\u2014 9Vi electric filament lamps,\u201d appellant argues that \u201cthe weight of the evidence establishes * * * that the subject lamps are not chiefly used on Christmas trees,\u201d stating that \u201cOf the six witnesses who testified as to observations of the use of the lamps in issue, five were in strong agreement that their predominate use, exceeding all other uses combined, was not on outdoor trees or other vegetation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">We agree with the decision of the Customs Court. The fundamental inquiry is the determination of the meaning of \u201cChristmas-tree lamps\u201d at the time TSUS item 686.30 was enacted. In determining such meaning, it is to be kept in mind that in a tariff statute Congress ordinarily employs terms in their commercial sense. The record here indicates that the term \u201cChristmas-tree lamps\u201d as employed in item 686.30 does include the imported C \u2014 9 lamps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">Appellee\u2019s witness Lehmann, whom the record shows to be singularly qualified to speak on the subject, testified that, in the lighting industry, there is an article of commerce known \u00e1s a \u201cChristmas-tree lamp,\u201d and that his company (General Electric Co.) has been making such lamps since 1899. He described \u201cChristmas-tree lamps\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-14\">Any one of several small light bulbs designed specifically to produce color. They are low wattage. They are designed to fit into the Christmas tree light sets. They must be compatible\u2014 the lamps must be compatible to the sockets and marketed under a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Christmas sales plan. They have a filament which is designed to burn extra white hot to give good colors particularly in the blue and green areas, and therefore are shorter life lamps. There are other general purpose lamps, night lights, chandeliers \u2014 and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-4\">* # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-5\">A Christmas tree lamp is characterized by its shape, size, and the fact that it\u2019s primarily colored. The coating on a Christmas lamp is a critical part of its manufacture, whether domestic or overseas. The filament has to be especially designed so it will create colored light through the outer shell. It is a short life lamp, shorter than a standard lamp, and has a smaller than normal base with respect to household lamps and it is used primarily in Christmas tree strings at Christmas time and is marketed by General Electric and other organizations at Christmas time as Christmas lamps.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">As to the C-9 lamp itself, Lehmann testified that it was introduced in 1932, that it is known interchangeably as a \u201cChristmas lamp\u201d or \u201cChristmas-tree lamp,\u201d and that it is larger than the previously introduced C-6 lamp and the subsequently introduced C \u2014 7 lamp. Leh-mann\u2019s testimony clearly supports the conclusion of the Customs Court that the \u201clarger Christmas-tree lamps\u201d referred to in the 1939 Tariff Commission report were C-9 lamps. Further, it is undisputed that the C-9 lamp is primarily used outdoors and is manufactured with a flange seal, characteristics which the Tariff Commission report mentions as being possessed by the \u201clarger Christmas-tree lamps.\u201d It is also not disputed that the imported C \u2014 9 lamps are specifically designed to produce color, are of low wattage, have bases smaller than those of ordinary household lamps, and fit into Christmas tree light sets \u2014 characteristics which the witness Lehmann testified are possessed by \u201cChristmas-tree lamps.\u201d Thus, there is ample support in the record for the view that at least since 1899 the term \u201cChristmas-tree lamp\u201d has referred to a certain article of commerce, that the C \u2014 9 lamp has the characteristics of such article, and has itself been considered to be a \u201cChristmas-tree lamp\u201d since at least 1939. In arguing against this view, appellant states that \u201cthere was no provision in the Tariff Act for Christmas-tree lamps until 1962,\u201d referring to T.D. 55615, 97 Treas.Dec. 157 (1962), which set out the following provision, carved out of paragraph 229 of the Tariff Act of 1930 by reciprocal trade agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-8\">Incandescent electric-light bulbs and lamps (except miniature Christmas tree) with metal filaments</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axkh\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, this provision supports the view that the meaning of the term \u201cChristmas-tree lamp\u201d was the same in 1962, on the eve of the enactment of the TSUS, as it was in 1939, when the Tariff Commission report was published, since the provision refers to Christmas-tree lamps as a type of miniature lamp, just as they were referred to in the 1939 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">We find it unnecessary to decide whether item 686.30 is a \u201cclassification by use\u201d or an eo nomine provision, since we conclude that Congress intended that C \u2014 9 lamps, the particular goods at bar, be classified under this item. Where the intent of Congress is apparent, rules of construction may not be employed to narrow, limit, or circumscribe the statute. <em>Sandoz Chemical Works, Inc. v. United States, </em>50 CCPA 31, C.A.D. 815 (1963). To control the result herein by labelling item 686.30 either a \u201cuse\u201d or eo nomine provision would generate, not eliminate, ambiguity contrary to the Congressional intent. Appellant\u2019s arguments do not suffice to overcome the presumption of correctness attaching to the Government\u2019s classification, especially in light of the evidence supporting the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">The judgment of the Customs Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
