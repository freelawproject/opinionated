On April 4, 1975, the district court granted Laclede\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the EEOC appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">The facts relevant to this appeal are essentially undisputed. A black employee of Laclede, Frank C. Pettis, filed a complaint with the EEOC in 1971, claiming that he had been discharged because of his race. The EEOC\u2019s district director in St. Louis issued a reasonable cause determination on December 20, 1972.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, conciliation efforts did not succeed as Laclede advised the EEOC that it did not wish to pursue conciliation. The EEOC, by letter, then advised Laclede that the matter was being referred to the general counsel\u2019s office for possible litigation. The EEOC did not, however, as required by its own regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.23, advise Laclede that conciliation had failed but that it [Laclede] could request a resumption within a specified time if it so desired. Pursuant to an authorization by the Commission, the EEOC filed suit on May 9, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">In its motion for summary judgment before the district court, Laclede argued primarily that the EEOC\u2019s violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.23 concerning conciliation mandated dismissal. In addition, Laclede claimed that another EEOC regulation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.19b(d), is invalid for authorizing district directors to make unreviewable reasonable cause determinations and to approve conciliation agreements without Commission concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">The district court in its order of April 4, 1975, granting Laclede\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>summary judgment, relied on the decision of <em>EEOC v. Raymond Metal Products Co., </em>385 F.Supp. 907 (D.Md.1974). That decision resolved favorably to the employer the same two issues contested on this appeal by the EEOC. During the pendency of this appeal, the Fourth Circuit reversed the <em>Raymond Metal </em>case. <em>EEOC v. Raymond Metal Products Co., </em>530 F.2d 590, No. 75-1007 (4th Cir., Jan. 26, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The validity of the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment for Lac-lede has been undercut by the foregoing reversal in <em>Raymond Metal. </em>We believe that the Fourth Circuit opinion of Judge John D. Butzner, Jr., in <em>Raymond Metal </em>is sound. The factual circumstances there and in this case are substantially similar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we are compelled to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">1. <em>Conciliation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The relevant EEOC regulation on conciliation provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">Should a respondent fail or refuse to confer with the Commission or its representative, or fail or refuse to make a good faith effort to resolve any dispute, the Commission may terminate its efforts to conciliate the dispute. In such event, <em>the respondent shall be notified promptly, in writing, that such efforts have been unsuccessful and will not be resumed except upon the respondent\u2019s written request within the time specified in such notice. </em>[29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.23 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">In response to conciliation efforts by the EEOC, Laclede on January 22, 1973, sent a letter to the EEOC in which it declined to pursue conciliation on the basis that the determination of reasonable cause issued by the EEOC was \u201cunfair and illegal.\u201d Laclede expressly denied any discrimination in violation of Title VII. The letter, in part, recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">Laclede\u2019s actions with regard to Mr. Pettis were not, in our judgment, discriminatory in any way or in violation of any law. We believe that our recruitment and hiring practices are entirely consistent with both the spirit and the letter of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. We reject the action of the District Director in finding to the contrary. We feel that there are no substantive issues amenable to conciliation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">The EEOC district director replied to Laclede, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">We note in your letter to Mr. Lorenz [Equal Employment Officer of EEOC] that you have declined to pursue the Conciliation procedure required in our Regulations. Our next step, therefore, is to refer the case to our Commission Headquarters for evaluation as a possible referral to our General Counsel to take into litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-16\">We are informing Mr. Pettis of this next stage in the processing of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">The EEOC letter to Laclede, stating that the case would be forwarded to headquarters for evaluation for possible litigation, does not mention resumption of conciliation upon the employer\u2019s request as contained in the language of \u00a7 1601.23. However, Laclede\u2019s January 22 letter clearly and emphatically had rejected any conciliation alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">The Fourth Circuit considered a nearly identical factual situation in <em>Raymond Metal. </em>The employer, Raymond Metal Company, consistently denied discrimination, as did Laclede. It asserted, as did Laclede, that the original charge made by the aggrieved employee had been unlawfully expanded. Raymond Metal Company stated in the district court that it did not want to engage in conciliation. Laclede made a similar assertion in its January 22nd letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-19\">The Fourth Circuit in <em>Raymond Metal </em>rejected the employer\u2019s legal defense premised on the EEOC\u2019s violation of \u00a7 1601.23, determining that the employer sustained no prejudice from the EEOC\u2019s failure to precisely follow its regulation. We agree with this determination and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>adopt the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">The commission\u2019s statutory duty to attempt conciliation is among its most essential functions. It is, therefore, important that it follow its own regulations, especially when it intends to cease administrative efforts and resort to the courts. But not every relaxation of an agency\u2019s rules merits dismissal. The imposition of this extreme sanction generally depends on whether the party dealing with the agency was prejudiced. <em>American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, </em>397 U.S. 532, 537-39, 90 S.Ct. 1288, 25 L.Ed.2d 547 (1970); <em>McCourt v. Hampton, </em>514 F.2d 1365, 1370 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>EEOC v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>511 F.2d 1352, 1360-61 (6th Cir. 1975).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">Raymond Metal\u2019s initial refusal to enter into conciliation discussions does not establish lack of prejudice. The regulation expressly allows even a recalcitrant respondent one last chance to settle the dispute. <em>See EEOC v. Hickey-Mitchell Co., </em>507 F.2d 944, 948 (8th Cir. 1974). We believe, however, that Raymond Metal\u2019s actions after receiving the commission\u2019s letter show that it was not prejudiced by the commission\u2019s failure to state that an opportunity to resume conciliation would be available for a limited time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">The initial charge, which Raymond Metal has consistently denied, dealt with discrimination on account of national origin. During the course of the investigation, the district director determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that Raymond Metal had discriminated on the basis of race and sex, and he notified the company of his findings. In response, it denied the factual basis of these allegations and asserted that as a matter of law the original charge could not be expanded. The company stated in the district court that it did not want to engage in conciliation discussions, and it has not wavered from this position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">Finally, while the commission did not fully comply with \u00a7 1601.23, its notice acknowledged the company\u2019s refusal to conciliate and advised that suit might follow. Its letter did not say that the commission would no longer negotiate. If Raymond Metal had changed its mind about conciliation or if the commission had been mistaken about the firmness of Raymond Metal\u2019s stand, the company could have contacted the commission any time before suit was filed. In contrast to the procedure followed here, no letter was sent in <em>Hickey-Mitchell </em>or <em>Western Electric, supra, [EEOC v. Western Electric Co., </em>382 F.Supp. 787 (D.Md.1974)], so those employers did not know that the commission was planning to move from an administrative to a judicial forum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">Because the commission\u2019s letter fairly warned Raymond Metal that suit might be brought and because the company\u2019s position after receipt of the notice indicated that it had no interest in conciliation, it is apparent that an offer to attempt conciliation at the option of the company would have been futile. The district court made no finding that Raymond Metal had been prejudiced, and the facts affirmatively disclose that no such finding could be made. We hold, therefore, that the case should not have been dismissed because the commission did not comply in every respect with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.23. <em>[EEOC </em>v. <em>Raymond Metal Products, Inc., </em>530 F.2d 590, No. 75-1007 (4th Cir., Jan. 26, 1976 (footnote omitted)).]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>See also EEOC v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>511 F.2d 1352, 1360-61 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>EEOC v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R., </em>505 F.2d 610 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Accordingly, we hold the action should not have been dismissed because of the EEOC\u2019s failure to follow with exactness its regulation \u00a7 1601.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">II. <em>Validity of Commission\u2019s Delegation of Important Functions to District Director.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In Laclede\u2019s motion for summary judgment which the district court granted, Laclede charged that the Commission impermissibly delegates to subordinate district directors the power to make reasonable cause determinations and approve conciliation agreements which are unreviewable by the Commission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The court below agreed with Laclede, relying, as we have already noted, upon the <em>Raymond Metal </em>decision at the trial court level. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit reversed on this issue (as well as upon the procedural defect which we have discussed in part I of this opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The Fourth Circuit agreed with the district court determination that the regulation was procedural<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but rejected the district court\u2019s further analysis finding that regulation flawed \u201cbecause the determination of probable cause was not reviewable by the commission and because the district directors\u2019 implicit , power to disapprove a conciliation agreement gave them \u2018de facto power\u2019 to commence civil actions.\u201d <em>EEOC v. Raymond Metal Products, supra, </em>530 F.2d at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">In determining the regulation to be procedural, the Fourth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">The regulation under attack does not define the rights and duties of the parties. Instead, it prescribes the methods by which the agency acts. The administrative actions of the commission do not in themselves enforce any rights or impose any obligations. This can be done only by a voluntary conciliation agreement or by a court after a trial <em>de novo. </em>Therefore, we agree with the district court that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.19b(d) conforms to the statutory requirement that it be procedural. <em>EEOC v. Raymond Metal Products, supra, </em>530 F.2d at 593 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">Further, it found no invalid delegation of agency powers to the district director:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahq\">In <em>Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking &amp; Lumber Co., </em>331 U.S. Ill, 67 S.Ct. 1129, 91 L.Ed. 1375 (1947), the Court considered whether the Emergency Price Control Act permitted the administrator to delegate his authority to issue subpoenas. Relying on the statutory authority for the administrator to make regulations to carry out the purpose of the Act, the Court approved the delegation. It said, \u201cSuch a rule-making power may itself be an adequate source of authority to delegate a particular function, unless by express provision of the Act or by implication it has been withheld.\u201d 331 U.S. at 121, 67 S.Ct. 1129. * * * ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>[T]he magnitude of the task militates strongly against a decision that Congress intended not to allow the commission to delegate these functions. In fiscal year 1974, a total of 9,035 reasonable cause determinations were issued and 5,198 were denied. Were the commission forced to decide or review each of these determinations as they were made, it would be hard pressed for time to make policy, consider charges that present novel and difficult issues, and decide which cases to litigate. Nor could it thoroughly treat the reasonable cause determinations themselves. These calculations do not take into account the failure of endeavors to conciliate that also would have to be reviewed. Like the Court in <em>Fleming, </em>331 U.S. Ill, 67 S.Ct. 1129 (1947), we are unwilling, without evidence of congressional intent to the contrary, to read the rule-making regulation so narrowly as to render the agency ineffective. <em>EEOC v. Raymond Metal Products, supra, </em>530 F.2d at 594.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Moreover, the Fourth Circuit found no delegation of agency authority with respect to institution of the suit against Raymond Metal. The EEOC had submitted an affidavit to the district court reciting that \u201cthe Commission has never delegated the authority under the statute to file suits to anyone * * * . It is the formal policy of the Commission that no suit may be filed in any case without Commission approval.\u201d <em>EEOC v. Raymond Metal Products, supra, </em>530 F. 2d at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The Fourth Circuit with respect to this \u201cunlawful delegation\u201d contention said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ascf\">We need not decide whether the commission can delegate its authority to file a civil action, because it is clear that it has not done so. It is also apparent that a civil action is not automatically triggered by the district director\u2019s decision that an acceptable conciliation agreement cannot be obtained. Since the commission has not delegated its statutory duty to decide whether to institute suit, the absence of a regulation on this subject is of no consequence. <em>EEOC v. Raymond Metal Products, supra, </em>530 F.2d at 595.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">An EEOC attorney has filed an affidavit in this case similar to that referred to in <em>Raymond Metal </em>attesting to its \u201cformal policy * * * that no suit may be filed in any case without approval by the members of the Commission and the Commissioners have never delegated the authority under the statute to file suits to anyone, not even to the General Counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Accordingly, on the authority of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s perceptive analysis and resolution in <em>Raymond Metal </em>that no unlawful delegation of agency authority existed under the circumstances there presented, we reject Laclede\u2019s contrary contention urged upon and adopted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Since the grant of summary judgment by the district court rested upon an invalid legal basis, we reverse and direct reinstatement of the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-11\">. Laclede claims it discharged Pettis because of excessive absenteeism. The Union filed a grievance on Pettis\u2019 behalf and he was subsequently reinstated with backpay and no loss of seniority. The district director\u2019s reasonable cause determination concluded that Laclede had discharged Pettis, in part, because of his race, but that his remedy through the grievance procedure had been adequate. The district director\u2019s reasonable cause determination focused on statistical evidence supporting his finding that \u201c[Laclede] has failed or refused to grant Negroes and other minorities employment opportunities\u201d in violation of Title VII. The EEOC thereupon invited the parties to join in a collective effort toward a \u201cjust resolution of the matter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-11\">. The unpublished district court opinion in this case observed that the factual situation here was like that in <em>EEOC v. Raymond Metal Co., </em>385 F.Supp. 907 (D.Md.1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\">. Although here Laclede did not expressly state in district court, as was the case with Raymond Metals Company, that it did not wish to conciliate, Laclede\u2019s actions belied any intention of resolving the suit through conciliation. However, if on remand Laclede in good faith desires to pursue conciliation, the trial court has power to stay proceedings for not more than 60 days during which the parties may engage in conciliation efforts. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\">. The Commission\u2019s regulation here attacked is contained in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.19b(d), which reads, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">(d) The District Directors, or other designated officers, on behalf of the Commissioner, may, upon completion of an investigation, dismiss charges, make and issue determinations as to reasonable cause, and serve a copy thereof upon the parties, and make and approve conciliation agreements in those cases where such authority has been delegated to them by the Commission. The determination is final when issued; therefore, requests for reconsideration will not be granted. The District Directors, or other designated officers, may, however, on their own motion, reconsider their determination at any time and, when they do so, they shall promptly notify the aggrieved person, the person making the charge on behalf of the aggrieved person, where applicable, and the respondent, or in the case of a charge filed under \u00a7 1601.10, the person aggrieved, if known, and the respondent of their subsequent decision on reconsideration.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b355-16\">.
