No literature was taken away from any employee, and the employer did not interfere with the distribution. The employer had no posted rule against distribution of literature in working areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-16\">This case is not controlled, as the employer claims, by <em>Patio Foods v. N.L.R.B., </em>415 F.2d 1001 (CA5 1969). There we held that, absent a rule against distribution of literature in working areas, the employer\u2019s interest in cleanliness and order in a working area justified a prohibition on handbilling. The record in the present case adequately supports the Board\u2019s finding that the employer\u2019s objective was not the protection of its property interests as in <em>Patio Foods </em>but rather to discourage union activity. In view of that finding the Order of the Board is ENFORCED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
