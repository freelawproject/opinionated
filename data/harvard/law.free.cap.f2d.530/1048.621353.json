The board deemed it unnecessary to decide that issue, stating: \u201cIt is agreed that the reference to \u2018pilot seniority list\u2019 in the letter does not include furloughed pilots, but is limited to those pilots on the active roster.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This \u201cagreement\u201d was allegedly arrived at between the company and union representatives during the board\u2019s first executive session.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the district court found, and it is essentially undisputed, that in fact \u201cno such agreement was made.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-19\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-20\">We think that granting relief in this case would not undermine the established policy of settling labor disputes through arbitration by opening up the merits of arbitration decisions to judicial review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board\u2019s opinion does not rest on an allegedly erroneous determination of an issue of fact or law on the record before it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It rests, instead, on the removal of a dispositive issue of fact from the board\u2019s jurisdiction, based on a nonexistent stipulation between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>Courts retain power to set aside arbitration awards \u201cfor failure of the order to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of the [board\u2019s] jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When an arbitration board ventures outside the scope of the authority conferred on it by the collective bargaining agreement, it lacks power to bind the parties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similar considerations mandate court intervention when an arbitration panel mistakenly assumes that certain issues are not before it. There too the board\u2019s award does not derive its force from the agreement between the parties, since the board\u2019s resolution of the controversy is fatally flawed by a misunderstanding of its assigned task.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">This is not to say that courts may lightly disturb interpretations by arbitrators as to what disputes are arbitrable under the language of a contract. The arbitrator made no such determination here, and the policies which mandate deference to substantive decisions by arbitrators are inapplicable if a mistake of fact has led the arbitrator not to resolve the issues tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">We hold only that where, as here, an undisputed mistake of fact causes an arbitrable issue to be removed from arbitration, a court has both the power and the duty to refuse to enforce the award. We therefore reverse and remand to the district court with directions to set aside the award of the System Board of Adjustment and remand this matter for reopening in further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (1970) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-9\">In 1936, Congress brought air carriers under the statute, 49 Stat. 1189, as amended, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 181 (1970) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">Pursuant to 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 184, Northwest Airlines (\u201cthe company\u201d) and the Air Line Pilots Association (\u201cthe union\u201d) have established by agreement a System Board of Adjustment with authority to settle disputes arising out of their collective bargaining agreement.

At the court\u2019s suggestion, a formal stipulation was filed to the effect that the union-appointed board members \u201cdo not recall and are not aware of any stipulation made during the executive sessions.\u201d J.A. 119, 125. Moreover, the \u201cpilot seniority list\u201d apparently referred to was itself admitted into evidence and was the subject of testimony before the board. J.A. 25, 42^5, 131. Contrary to the alleged \u201cagreement,\u201d it contains the names of both active and furloughed pilots.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-22\">It has been suggested in this court, however, that simply because the union-appointed board members \u201cdo not recall\u201d an agreement, it does not follow that none was reached. No binding agreement can exist between a party who strenuously denies it was ever made and another who is unaware of its existence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1119-23\">. <em>See, e. g., United Steelworkers of America v.

[H]is award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. When the arbitrator\u2019s words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\"><em>United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., supra, </em>note 7, 363 U.S. at 597, 80 S.Ct. at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">The district court was not unaware of this line of authority, but construed it narrowly as applying only to the types of remedies available. Noting that the remedy in this case was of a type \u201cclearly contemplated by the contract and designed to further its aims,\u201d the district court concluded that therefore the arbitrators had not exceeded their jurisdiction. 385 F.Supp. at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-17\">Although remedies were at issue in the <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car </em>case itself, we do not think the principle that the arbitrator\u2019s authority must derive from the agreement can be so limited. <em>See also Gateway Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, </em>414 U.S. 368, 374, 94 S.Ct. 629, 38 L.Ed.2d 583 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1120-18\">. Arbitration proceedings by their nature are not generally amenable to the remedy of a remand. <em>See Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild v. Washington Post Co., </em>143 U.S. App.D.C. 210, 442 F.2d 1234, 1238-39 (1971). There a decision had already been rendered on the record before the arbitrator. Because the parties had agreed to private arbitration, in which the subpoena power is lacking, certain evidence was not originally available. We concluded that to remand for additional evidence would be to give one side \u201cmore than the benefit of its bargain.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-19\">In this case, however, remand is necessary if the parties are to receive what they bargained for \u2014 a board decision resolving their arguments and evidence one way or the other, as opposed to relying on a non-existent stipulation of dispositive fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
