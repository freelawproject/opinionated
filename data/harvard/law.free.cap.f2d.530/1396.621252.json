During the ten years prior to initiation of this proceeding, appellant spent $800,-000 on advertising and had sales of $38,-000,000. Appellee spent $2,250,000 on advertising from 1964 through 1972, with sales of $13,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-14\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-15\">The board decided that appellee\u2019s use of BLU \u2014 BOY on toilet bowl cleaner was not likely to cause confusion or mistake because its product and appellant\u2019s canned vegetables, fruits, and soft drinks \u201care non-competitive, differ significantly in utility, and have nothing in common with respect to their essential characteristics, uses or sales appeal.\u201d To appellant\u2019s argument that its mark was famous and thus entitled to a broad scope of protection, the board stated that \u201cthe record falls far short of establishing that \u2018BLUE BOY\u2019 is in the category of famous marks. Contrariwise, respondent has expended more money in advertising its mark and there can be no doubt that nationwide its \u2018BLU \u2014 BOY\u2019 toilet bowl cleaner is better known than any of petitioner\u2019s food products which are sold under its mark.\u201d In reaching its decision, the board did not consider appellant\u2019s pleaded ownership of several registrations of BLUE BOY because they bore names other than appellant\u2019s, and appellant, faced with appellee\u2019s general denial, had produced no evidence of such ownership. The board discounted testimony on a single incident of actual confusion because the circumstances were \u201cnot of sufficient probative value to show why the person involved was actually confused\u201d and because \u201cone isolated instance of this nature is insufficient to establish actual confusion in the marketplace.\u201d As to the testimony on likelihood of confusion, the board concluded that it was mere opinion and not bind<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>ing. In so concluding, the board noted that two of the four witnesses, all of whom were grocery store managers, acknowledged that they did not handle ap-pellee\u2019s products, while the other two testified that they were not directly aware of any instance of actual confusion, and that one of the latter two witnesses testified that \u201cthere is no confusion but customers might think differently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">On reconsideration, the board adhered to its original decision and refused appellant\u2019s request to consider the validity of appellee\u2019s registration because of an aspect of its prosecution, since \u201cthis is a matter outside of the issues raised and tried by the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-6\">Appellant pins its substantive arguments on what it claims is a finding by the board that at least one person was actually confused by appellee\u2019s mark. Appellant states that such a finding is expressed in the following sentence of the board\u2019s opinion: \u201cThe circumstances surrounding this incident are not of sufficient probative value to show why the person involved was actually confused.\u201d Presupposing a finding of actual confusion, appellant alleges the board erred in not giving that finding effect, arguing that \u201ca single act of confusion is confusion and nothing more is required.\u201d Appellant argues that noncompetition between the products involved, on which the board relied, \u201cis not necessarily relevant to the determination of likelihood of confusion\u201d; indeed, appellant would ignore product distinctions, calling its mark \u201cfamous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-7\">As to the testimony on likelihood of confusion, appellant argues that the board erred in \u201carbitrarily excluding\u201d it, stating that it \u201cwas not rebutted.\u201d Complaint is also made of the board\u2019s refusal to treat appellant as the owner of prior registrations of BLUE BOY. Appellant declares that the board must accept the statement in its registration No. 811,784 that it is \u201cOwner of Reg. Nos. 209,904, 402,666 and 566,055,\u201d since \u201cPursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 1057(b),\u201d the law is that statements in a registration are to be given \u201cprima facie\u201d effect, and appellee \u201coffered no evidence to attack the presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-9\">Finally, appellant argues that the board should have considered the issue of invalidity of appellee\u2019s registration, even though the issue was first brought up on reconsideration, because the board has a duty to consider validity whether or not raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-10\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-11\">Appellant is mistaken in contending that the board made a finding of actual confusion. The board specifically said that there was an \u201cabsence of credible evidence of actual confusion\u201d and that the single incident relied on by appellant \u201cis insufficient to establish actual confusion in the marketplace.\u201d The board was correct in so holding since the testimony offered did not indicate that the single person allegedly confused (who did <em>not </em>testify) had ever seen appellee\u2019s mark on any of its products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-12\">The board was also correct in not giving binding effect to the testimony of the four grocery store managers on likelihood of confusion, even though appellant states that such testimony was undisputed. In the first place, that testimony is conflicting; one of the witnesses testified that \u201cthere is no confusion but customers might think differently.\u201d In the second place, that testimony <em>is </em>in effect disputed by the evidence of the noncompetitive nature of the products involved, a relevant factor in this case, as it is in all cases, even though it may not be dispositive. We cannot say that the board erred in finding that factor to outweigh the testimony offered by appellant; it is manifest that toilet bowl cleaner is not competitive with canned fruits or vegetables or with carbonated soft drinks. Nor does the record show that appellant\u2019s mark is any more \u201cfamous\u201d than that of appellee, whose products enjoy a geographically larger market and on which appellee spends more for advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>We see no merit in appellant\u2019s argument that the board should have given \u201cprima facie\u201d effect to the statement in his registration No. 811,784 that he is the \u201cOwner of Reg. Nos. 209,904, 402,666 and 566,055.\u201d The statute on which appellant relies, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1057(b), does not accord \u201cprima facie effect\u201d to every statement in a certificate of registration; as to ownership, it accords prima facie effect only to the statement of ownership of the mark for which the certificate is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-4\">Finally, the board did not err when it refused appellant\u2019s request, first made on reconsideration, to consider the invalidity of appellee\u2019s registration. This issue was not pleaded, nor was it tried,\u2019 although it could have been, since the documents relied on to support it are found in the file history of appellee\u2019s mark. Appellant failed to bring the matter up when it had ample opportunity to do so; it cannot be heard to complain now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-5\">Appellant has placed some emphasis on our decision in <em>Hunt Foods and Industries, Inc. v. The Gerson Stewart Corp., </em>367 F.2d 431, 54 CCPA 751, 151 USPQ 350 (1966). Its first reliance thereon is to support its contention that the fact the parties\u2019 goods \u201care not directly competitive is not necessarily relevant to the determination of likelihood of confusion.\u201d No such statement is to be found in our <em>Hunt </em>opinion. Any fact bearing on likelihood of confusion is \u201crelevant\u201d to its determination. In discussing third-party registrations in <em>Hunt </em>we expressly stated that \u201cthe nature of the products covered by the third-party registrations is a factor to be considered * * * We did say, \u201cThe fact that the goods are not of the same descriptive properties is also not <em>controlling </em>under the terms of the Trademark Act of 1946.\u201d The legal concepts of \u201crelevance\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d are fundamentally disparate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-7\">Secondly and primarily, appellant relies on <em>Hunt </em>to show that the facts here as to the parties\u2019 marks and products parallel those in <em>Hunt, </em>which is not the case, on which precedential basis we are asked to find likelihood of confusion, as we did in <em>Hunt. </em>We said in <em>Industrial Nucleonics Corp. v. Hinde, </em>475 F.2d 1197, 177 USPQ 386 (CCPA 1973), as we shall evidently have to continue saying ad nauseam:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-9\">As we have said innumerable times, prior decisions on other marks for other goods are of very little help one way or the other in cases of this type. Each case must be decided on its own facts and the differences are often subtle ones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-10\">Here the differences from the <em>Hunt </em>facts are not even subtle. In <em>Hunt </em>the marks were identical, here they differ; evidence in <em>Hunt </em>showed the mark to be famous, here there is no such evidence; in <em>Hunt </em>there was evidence of a consumer survey, here there is none; and there are other differences, including some subtle ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-11\">Finally, what is briefed to us under the statement \u201cthis court said\u201d is in fact a quotation (containing distorting ellipses) from the opinion of the dissenting member of the TTAB with which we expressed neither agreement nor disagreement. In quoting it (in full) in our <em>Hunt </em>opinion, we said: <em>\u201cAppellant\u2019s case </em>is well summarized in the opinion of the dissenting board member * * * (Emphasis ours.) There appears to be no excuse for mistaking the quotation as a statement by us. The <em>Hunt </em>opinion contains nothing persuasive of error by the TTAB herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-13\">\n<em>Taxation of Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-14\">Appellant requests that we charge ap-pellee with the costs of printing certain items in appellee\u2019s designation of additional parts of the record for inclusion in the printed transcript. These items are: appellee\u2019s two memoranda to the board dealing with appellant\u2019s petition for reconsideration, dated January 23, 1975, and February 14, 1975; the depositions of the four grocery store managers, McCrea, Hanover, Borreggini, and Stag-nitta, dated June 15 and June 22, 1973; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>the depositions of appellant\u2019s employee Gregory dated May 15, 1973, and February 12, 1974; the depositions of appel-lee\u2019s officers, Williamson and Hocker, dated December 20, 1973; and appellee\u2019s exhibits D and E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">The motion is granted only as to appellee\u2019s memoranda to the board; the May 15, 1973, deposition of appellant\u2019s employee Gregory; the depositions of appellee\u2019s officers; and appellee\u2019s exhibits D and E. The two memoranda were not necessary to an understanding of the board\u2019s disposition of appellant\u2019s petition for reconsideration. The May 15, 1973, deposition of appellant\u2019s employee Gregory, the depositions of appellee\u2019s officers, and appellee\u2019s exhibits D and E deal with marketing, advertising, and sales of the products involved, matters not in issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion is denied with respect to the other items. The depositions of the four grocery store managers were relied on by appellant to show likelihood of confusion and the February 12, 1974, deposition of appellant\u2019s employee Gregory was relied on by appellant to show actual confusion. The board\u2019s treatment of this testimony was a significant issue on this appeal, requiring the court to refer to these depositions for its resolution. Under these circumstances, we do not feel that appellee should be assessed the cost of printing these depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-6\">The decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1470-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
