The only one meriting discussion is that of Calvin Wright. He had been elected president of the unaffiliated local union on March 2. Shortly thereafter Kent officials characterized that election as illegal and called for a new election, which was held. Supervisory employees opposed Wright but he was elected again. Soon thereafter, on March 23, Wright was laid off on the asserted ground that his job as day shift janitor was abolished because of a materials shortage. A third election was held a few days later and another person chosen as president. On April 3 or 4, Wright was recalled for a job as flight shift janitor. That job also had been \u201cabolished\u201d on March 23 but had been \u201creinstated.\u201d There was credited testimony that Wright was told the night job required him to drive a \u201chighster\u201d [Hyster], or forklift, to pick up trash and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>scrap metal. He responded that he had never been on such a machine in his life, could not drive it, and would not want to take a chance on tearing up something. Kent treated this as a quit. The Board finding that this sequence of events was part of a plan to rid the company permanently of Wright was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">M The Board ordered back pay for Roy Glass. There was testimony by former employee Ralph Wilson that Glass had suggested to him that he make bomb threat calls to the plant. Wilson acknowledged having made such a call, and it is stated that he pleaded guilty to a felony for having done so. The ALJ did not make a credibility determination rejecting Wilson\u2019s testimony but rather stated his understanding that Wilson\u2019s testimony had been offered for a different issue than Glass\u2019 eligibility for back pay, that Glass\u2019 eligibility for back pay had not been made an issue by Kent, and that the Board had not recalled Glass as a witness to respond to Wilson\u2019s testimony. We agree with Kent that the evidence concerning the bomb threat is relevant to Glass\u2019 right to back pay. However, the precise positions of the parties are hazy. We are unsure whether the Board claims that Glass\u2019 entitlement' to back pay has been adjudicated adversely to Kent or that it has not been adjudicated and remains to be determined in a compliance proceeding. We are also unsure whether Kent claims that we are required to decide on this record that Glass is not entitled to back pay and that the back pay issue is then foreclosed, or only that the issue remains open, to be later determined with consideration given to the Wilson testimony. We\u201e therefore, hold that the issue of back pay for Glass remains open to be determined in such procedural context as is appropriate, upon consideration of the Wilson testimony and such other evidence as the company and the Board wish to adduce.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">ENFORCED in part.
