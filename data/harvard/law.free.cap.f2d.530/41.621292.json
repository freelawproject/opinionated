We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-27\">Chittenden has been President of Local Union 1418 in New Orleans, and Secretary-Treasurer of Local Union 1833 in Baton Rouge, of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association for a number of years. In a 70 count indictment he was charged with 62 counts of embezzlement of union funds and 8 counts of failure to maintain adequate records. He was acquitted on a number of embezzlement counts and a mistrial was ordered on the remainder of the embezzlement counts. He was convicted on the 8 counts for record-keeping violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-28\">Upon appeal Chittenden raises as he did in the district court a threshold objection that he is not a \u201cperson\u201d with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>in the meaning of the statutory provision. Section 436 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">Every person required to file any report under this subchapter shall maintain records on the matters required to be reported which will provide in sufficient detail the necessary basic information and data from which the documents filed with the Secretary may be verified, explained or clarified, and checked for accuracy and completeness, and shall include vouchers, worksheets, receipts, and applicable resolutions, and shall keep such records available for examination for a period of not less than five years after the filing of the documents based on the information which they contain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 439(a) provides that any person who wilfully violates this provision shall be imprisoned for not more than one year, or shall be fined not more than $10,000, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Chittenden argues he cannot be treated as a Section 436 \u201cperson required to file any report\u201d because Section 431(b) of the LMRDA requires only labor organizations to file these financial reports:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqUd\">Every labor organization shall file annually with the Secretary a financial report signed by its president and treasurer .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Because Section 431(b) does not require individuals to file these reports, Chitten-den concludes that Congress criminally imposed the record-keeping requirement only on the labor organizations, not the individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">We disagree. This contention has been rejected by the Second Circuit. <em>United States v. Ottley, 2 </em>Cir. 1975, 509 F.2d 667, 672, n. 8. The district court here, in following <em>Ottley, </em>correctly ana-lysed the flaw in this interpretation of the statutory record-keeping requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">Conspicuously missing from Chitten-den\u2019s argument, however is any reference to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 439(d): \u2018[e]ach individual required to sign reports under sections 431 and 433 of this title shall be personally responsible for the filing of such reports and for any statement contained therein which he knows to be false.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Section 431(b) requires that the report <em>filed </em>by the labor organization be <em>signed </em>by the president and treasurer of that organization. Because these officials are required to sign the reports, it is clear that the president and treasurer of a union are \u201cpersonally responsible for the filing of such reports\u201d within the language of Section 439(d). Hence, it is obvious that as persons responsible for the filing of the reports, both the president and treasurer fall squarely within the ambit of Section 436. We agree with the district court that Chittenden, as both president and treasurer, was a person subject to the record keeping requirement of Section 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">Finally Chittenden argues that even if he can \u201clegitimately be charged with omitting to maintain the said required records,\u201d nevertheless the government failed to prove (1) that the records maintained by the unions were in fact inadequate for the purposes stated in Section 436; (2) that, even if the records maintained were inadequate, the failure to maintain the records was \u201cwillfully\u201d done. He argues that the cancelled checks merely showing total disbursements constituted adequate records of how the unions\u2019 monies were expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">It is true that Section 436 requires no particular bookkeeping system; nevertheless, that provision specifically requires \u201cin sufficient detail\u201d (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 436) the maintenance of whatever records are necessary to establish accurate \u201cdisclosure of financial operations of the unions to their members.\u201d <em>United States v. Budzanozki, </em>3 Cir. 1972, 462 F.2d 443, 450, <em>cert. denied </em>1972, 409 U.S. 949, 93 S.Ct. 271, 34 L.Ed.2d 220. Chittenden\u2019s retention of cancelled checks without specific expense receipts and itemization is a form of \u201crecord keeping\u201d woefully insufficient to achieve</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aed\">the purpose of the LMRDA [which] is not just to prevent embezzlement and fraud; as we have noted, it is to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>vide information for the members so that they can control their leaders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAZ\"><em>Budzanoski, supra, </em>at 452. The Second Circuit in <em>Ottley, supra, </em>observed, \u201cThe voucher slips he submitted were minimal. They contained only the date, the amount received from the union, his signature and the notation \u2018for reimbursed expenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674, n. 11. The court refused to consider such records sufficient as a matter of law and submitted the issue to the jury. Similarly here the district court correctly declined to give the jury instructions urged by the defendant, that the cancelled checks were adequate as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Chittenden assigns as error the district court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that good faith reliance on prior inspections by Compliance Officers of the Department of Labor would preclude a finding of the requisite \u201cwillful\u201d intent to fail to keep records. But, the evidence fails to provide a foundation for such a charge. On the contrary, the inspection performed in 1970 was for specific shortcomings only, and was not a complete financial examination. Compliance Officer Victoria testified at length that there was no doubt that his examination in no way entailed an approval of the Union\u2019s system of bookkeeping; he said he \u201cwasn\u2019t looking for anything beyond the allegations made and the complaint.\u201d He looked at records only for one year, 1968. He did not have full access to union records. Moreover, he testified that he did tell Chittenden that he had found certain deficiencies even within this narrow scope of his inspection. Such an inspection could not be relied upon in good faith as government approval of the union\u2019s overall pattern of maintenance of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Indeed, other evidence refutes any contention of good faith reliance by Chittenden. Compliance Officer Ryan testified that after his examination of these unions\u2019 records in 1962 he warned Chittenden of their inadequacy under the legal requirements contained in Section 436. Officer Ryan pointed out to Chittenden where the records were inadequate to verify disbursements. He read the law to Chittenden and explained what records were necessary. He informed him how the union books should be adjusted in order to comply with Section 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">We find no evidentiary support for Chittenden\u2019s argument that a \u201cwillful\u201d violation was not proven because of good faith reliance. The court\u2019s refusal to give Chittenden\u2019s submitted charge was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
