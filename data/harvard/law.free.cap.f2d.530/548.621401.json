The agreement provided for severance pay upon the closing of the bakery for each employee actively employed by Nolde for at least three years,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and also contained an all-encompassing arbitration clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">On August 21, 1973, following several months of fruitless negotiations over proposed changes in the contract, the Union gave the seven days written notice required to terminate the agreement. Negotiations continued for a few days after the termination, but on August 31, the company, faced with the Union\u2019s threats to strike over certain contract demands, permanently closed the bakery. Nolde subsequently paid wages and vacation pay accrued through the date of the contract termination, and in addition paid wages for the few days between contract termination and the August 31 closing. But the company rejected the Union\u2019s demand that it either give severance pay to all its employees or arbitrate its duty to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">The Union then instituted this suit under Section 301 of the Labor Manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ment Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, to compel arbitration of the severance pay issue or, in the alternative, for an award of the severance pay. The district court granted the company\u2019s motion for summary judgment on both counts, holding (1) that \u201cthe union\u2019s voluntary termination of its collective bargaining agreement with the company . . . destroyed any right to severance pay created by the collective bargaining agreement for displaced employees; \u201d (2) that there was thus no severance pay issue to arbitrate; and (3) that even if there had been an arbitrable issue there was no duty to arbitrate, for it had died with the contract that created it.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We disagree. In our view, the district court approached the issues backwards when it first determined whether the company\u2019s obligation for severance pay survived the contract. This is a question more suitable for arbitration than judicial decision, as we explain below. Thus, the first question for the district court was whether the company\u2019s duty to arbitrate this particular issue survived the expiration of the contract. We believe it did, and accordingly we reverse and remand with instructions that the district court order the company to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The Union and the company apparently presented to the district court, as they have to us, contrasting views of the nature of severance pay. The Union argued that severance pay is an \u201cearned\u201d or \u201cvested\u201d right accruing to employees over a period of time, whose benefits cannot be denied them regardless when they come to fruition. The company, on the other hand, characterized severance pay as \u201ca creation of the collective bargaining agreement,\u201d with the right to it contingent upon the occurrence of the triggering event \u2014 here the bakery closing \u2014 during the term of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">The district court erred in choosing one characterization \u2014 the company\u2019s\u2014 over the other, for in fact severance pay has no immutable nature. It is indeed a creature of contract, but this means no more nor less than that it is in a given case exactly what the parties intended to make it when they bargained. In one case the parties may intend it to be available only if a triggering event occurs during the contract term. But as the Supreme Court has noted, there is \u201cno reason why parties could not if they so chose agree to the accrual of rights during the term of an agreement and their realization after the agreement had expired.\u201d <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 555, 84 S.Ct. 909, 917, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964). Thus the nature of the employees\u2019 right to severance pay in the-circumstances here depends entirely upon the intent of the Union and the company when they wrote the relevant provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">Any question of the intent behind a collective bargaining term must be referred to arbitration if it is available. This is in accord with the national labor policy expressed by Congress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">Final adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes arising over the application or <em>interpretation </em>of an existing collective-bargaining agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">LMRA \u00a7 203(d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 173(d) (emphasis added). This is also the clear teaching of the <em>Steelworkers Trilogy,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and is based on the sound principle that an arbitrator, familiar as he is with both the parties and the industry, is better positioned than a court to divine their intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-16\">The labor arbitrator\u2019s source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract, as the industrial common law \u2014 the practices of the industry and the shop \u2014 is equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>although not expressed in it. The labor arbitrator is usually chosen because of the parties\u2019 confidence in his knowledge of the common law of the shop and their trust in his personal judgment to bring to bear considerations which are not expressed in the contract as criteria for judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4xq\"><em>United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 581-82, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1352, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The arbitrator\u2019s absolute authority in such a matter, and a court\u2019s corresponding lack of power, was affirmed in another passage from the <em>Steelworkers Trilogy:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">[T]he question of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is a question for the arbitrator. It is the arbitrator\u2019s construction which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\"><em>United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 599, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1362, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960). The district court below pre-empted the arbitrator rather than overruling him. But he may do neither under the labor law.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The company argues most strenuously, however, that it cannot be ordered to arbitrate the severance pay issue because the collective bargaining agreement containing its duty to arbitrate had been terminated before the instant dispute arose. In support of its position the company cites several Supreme Court statements to the effect that a party cannot be required to arbitrate any issue unless it has agreed to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think the statements do not support the company\u2019s contention that a duty to arbitrate cannot survive the termination or expiration of a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">First, the Supreme Court has itself undercut the apparent premise that arbitration must rest upon contract by holding that in some circumstances a new employer who takes over a unionized business can be compelled to arbitrate under the arbitration clause of its predecessor\u2019s agreement, even though the new employer \u2014 a stranger to the bargaining \u2014 never agreed to such arbitration. <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, supra. </em>Although the potential implications of the <em>Wiley </em>case have since been narrowed, <em>see Howard Johnson Co. v. Hotel Employees, </em>417 U.S. 249, 94 S.Ct. 2236, 41 L.Ed.2d 46 (1974); <em>NLRB v. Burns Security Services, Inc., </em>406 U.S. 272, 92 S.Ct. 1571, 32 L.Ed.2d 61 (1972), the Court has not retreated from its recognition that in some instances the national labor policy can impose an arbitration duty upon an unconsenting party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\">While the principles of law governing ordinary contracts would not bind to a contract an unconsenting successor to a contracting party, a collective bargaining agreement is not an ordinary contract. \u201c. . . [I]t is a generalized code to govern a myriad of cases which the draftsmen cannot wholly anticipate. . . . The collective agreement covers the whole employment relationship. It calls into being a new common law \u2014 the common law of a particular industry or of a particular plant.\u201d . . . Central to the peculiar status and function of a collective bargaining agreement is the fact, dictated both by circumstance, and by the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>it is not in any real sense the simple product of a consensual relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY1s\"><em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, supra, </em>376 U.S. at 550, 84 S.Ct. at 914 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">It is true that in <em>Wiley </em>there was a contract with an arbitration clause in existence when the union filed suit to compel arbitration,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> whereas here there was none either when the dispute arose or when suit was filed. But we believe the Supreme Court has indicated that the principle of <em>Wiley </em>requires arbitration in the latter circumstance as well. In <em>Piano &amp; Musical Instrument Workers v. W. W. Kimball Co., </em>221 F.Supp. 461 (N.D.Ill. 1963), the district court held that a union-employer dispute over rehiring of discharged employees, centering on the employees\u2019 seniority rights, was arbitrable even though the dispute arose several days after termination of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that arbitration could not be required in such circumstances. 333 F.2d 761, 765 (1964). The Supreme Court granted certiorari and summarily reversed the Seventh Circuit. 379 U.S. 357, 85 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.Ed.2d 541 (1964). Significantly, the Supreme Court cited only the first <em>Steelworkers Trilogy </em>case<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>Wiley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We believe <em>Wiley </em>and its use by the Supreme Court in <em>Piano Workers </em>support our view that a dispute that turns on whether parties intended certain accruable rights to be enjoyable, even after contract expiration, must be arbitrated if the contract provided for arbitration of such disputes, even if the contingency giving rise to the dispute itself transpired after expiration of the contract. <em>Accord, Steelworkers v. H. K. Porter Co., </em>64 L.R.R.M. 2201 (W.D.Pa. 1966); <em>cf. IAM v. Howe Sound Co., </em>350 F.2d 508 (3d Cir. 1965). <em>But see U.A.A. &amp; A.I.W. v. Robertshaw Controls Co., </em>405 F.2d 29 (2d Cir. 1968) (en banc); <em>Ward Foods, Inc. v. Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers, </em>360 F.Supp. 1310 (S.D. N.Y.1973); <em>cf. Milk Drivers v. Thompson\u2019s Dairy, Inc., </em>80 L.R.R.M. 3403 (D.D. C.1972), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>489 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The company does not deny that the contract by its terms contemplated arbitration of any dispute over severance pay. Thus it is clear that the company literally agreed to arbitrate any issue of its obligation for severance pay. <em>See </em>note 4, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Judge Widener, concurring and dissenting, advances an argument that the employer rejects. The battle was not joined here or in the district court over whether the court or the arbitrator should decide that the question was arbitrable. What the fight is about, as stated in appellee\u2019s brief, is whether the duty to arbitrate can survive contract termination. We think the issue to which our brother Widener has addressed himself is not before us, but because of our respect for his viewpoint, we would add that we read the cases upon which he relies as being consistent with the general rule that the initial question of arbitrability is a matter to be determined by the court. An exception to the rule is where a clause in a labor contract purporting to exclude some matters from arbitration is vague and ambiguous. In such a case an arbitrator may be expressly empowered to not only adjudge grievances but also to decide whether the instrument gives him the power to do so. That is all that we held in <em>A. S. Abell Co. v. Baltimore Typographical Union No. 12, </em>338 F.2d 190 (4th Cir. 1964). Indeed, Judge Sobeloff said in that case that if the meaning of the exclusionary section \u201cwere entirely clear it would become the duty of the court to declare the meaning.\u201d Again, in <em>Winston-Salem Printing Pressmen &amp; Assistants\u2019 Union No. 818 v. Piedmont Publishing Co., </em>393 F.2d 221 (4th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>1968), Judge Sobeloff writing for the court, acknowledged that \u201csubmission to arbitration cannot precede judicial determination that the collective bargaining agreement does in fact create such a duty.\u201d Only then did he conclude that the contract in that case specifically provided that the construction to be placed upon any clause, including the clause authorizing arbitration, was to be resolved through the grievance procedure and by the arbitrator himself. Judge Winter, sitting as a district judge, has written to the same effect. <em>Local 24, IBEW v. Wm. C. Bloom &amp; Co., </em>242 F.Supp. 421, 428-29 (D.Md.1965). Indeed, the rule and its exception are now so well settled that both have found expression in one of the encyclopedias:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">Since the duty to arbitrate is of contractual origin, a compulsory submission to arbitration cannot precede judicial determination that the collective bargaining agreement does in fact create such a duty. The questions whether a party to a collective bargaining agreement must arbitrate, and what issues he must arbitrate, must be determined by the court on the basis of the contract entered into by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">However, the arbitrability of a dispute may itself be subject to arbitration if the parties have clearly so provided in the agreement. Of course, the court must decide the threshold question whether the parties have in fact conferred this power on the arbitrator. If they have, the court should stay proceedings pending the arbitrator\u2019s determination of his own jurisdiction, unless it is clear that the claim of arbi-trability is wholly groundless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">48 Am.Jur.2d \u201cLabor and Labor Relations\u201d \u00a7 1257 at 783-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">We simply hold that the company must abide by that agreement even after the contract embodying it has terminated. Not only the decisions in <em>Wiley </em>and <em>Piano Workers, </em>but also policy considerations indicate such a result. The company s obligation for severance pay depends upon the parties\u2019 intent behind the contract provision for severance pay. A court, after the <em>Steelworkers Trilogy, </em>is not the proper forum in which to inquire into that intent. If the expiration of the contract were held to strip the arbitrator of power, the best means of determining the true content of the parties\u2019 original agreement would not be available\u2014 which would increase the possibility of the parties\u2019 resorting to economic warfare in support of their respective interpretations. But this is precisely the kind of industrial unrest that collective bargaining, coupled with arbitration of difference over contract terms, is intended to avert. <em>See </em>LMRA \u00a7 101, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. Our holding that arbitration is still available serves the most basic policy of our labor laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Our decision should not be read as disapproving those cases that hold arbitration unavailable for resolution of individual employee grievances, or disputes involving nonaccruable rights, that arise after expiration of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>See, e. g., OGAW v. American Maize Prods. Co., </em>492 F.2d 409 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 969, 94 S.Ct. 3173, 41 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1974); <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Indep. Union v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., </em>312 F.2d 181 (2d Cir. 1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 U.S. 830, 83 S.Ct. 1872, 10 L.Ed.2d 1053 (1963); <em>Garlick Funeral Homes v. Service Employees, </em>85 L.R.R.M. 2749 (E.D.N.Y.1974). We consider those cases different. To hold that a company had to arbitrate an employee discharge or a lockout that occurred after expiration of a contract providing for arbitration would mean that an employer who once agreed to submit its managerial actions to potential arbitration would in effect have agreed to do so for all time. That we do not hold. Our decision affects only those rights, like severance pay, that employees earn and that may or may not \u201cvest\u201d for future enjoyment \u2014 contingent upon a particular event.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The best way to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>whether the union and the employer meant for employees to enjoy those rights regardless of when the contingency occurs is to arbitrate.

But the contract there did not on its face grant employees an absolute right to severance pay, as does the contract in the instant case. Instead, the contractual duty of the employer was to \u201cnegotiate the terms of discontinuance regarding severance pay.\u201d Under that contract there was no room for an argument that the parties <em>at the time of original bargaining </em>had intended employees to receive severance pay upon a post-termination shutdown. The contract contemplated only that the parties would discuss the <em>possibility </em>of severance pay <em>at the time of shutdown. </em>Nothing could accrue, and the obligation to negotiate simply died with the contract. An agreement to negotiate does not last forever.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b624-5\">ALDRICH, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A6d\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">With great respect, I am not entirely sure of the full extent that my brethren are in disagreement, and perhaps I am being over-simplistic. However, it seems to me that what the parties are disputing \u2014 whether the claim for compensation vested while the contract was in force, and therefore survived its termination\u2014 is plainly a grievance within the meaning of the arbitrability clause, and neither we, nor the arbitrator, face the issue of arbitrability. The only issue, in other words, is whether the grievance is sound, which, of course, is for the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">I see three possibilities open to court decision in this area: that there is an arbitrable issue of substance; that there is an arbitrable issue of whether the issue of substance is one subject to arbitration; or there is no arbitrable issue at all. If Judge Widener denies this first possibility, then I must disagree with him. At the same time, I think I see what troubles him. If the arbitrator, when appointed, rendered a decision to the effect that he saw no arbitrable issue, I don\u2019t know what a court could do about it. We do not face that question and I doubt if a court ever would. However, I do not see how, in theory, a court that can, in the proper circumstances, rule that there is no question to be arbitrated, cannot equally rule that there is one. Indeed, that is what it does every time it instructs the arbitrator that there is an arbitrable issue whether the arbitration clause covers the substantive matter sought to be arbitrated.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b624-10\">WIDENER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AAX7\">(concurring and dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">While I agree that this case calls for referral to arbitration, I do not agree that <em>Piano &amp; Musical Instrument Workers v. W. W. Kimball, </em>379 U.S. 357, 85 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.Ed.2d 541 (1964), forecloses an objection to arbitration being lodged before the arbitrator. I, therefore, respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">In <em>Piano Workers, </em>the defendant Kim-ball had entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Piano &amp; Musical Workers Local 2549. The contract period ran from October 1, 1960 to October 1, 1961. In August 1961, the defendant decided to discontinue operations at its Melrose Park Plant in Illinois and began the process of discharging all employees at that location. On October 9 of that year, eight days after the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, Kimball opened a new plant at French Lick, Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">Despite the fact the union contract had been terminated, the union claimed its members had a right to priority in employment at the new plant. It based its claim on Article II, Section 2, Paragraph 6 of the contract, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-14\">\u201cWhen reemployment occurs employees will be called back to work in order of their seniority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">When the company refused to follow the rehiring procedure desired by the union or submit the dispute to arbitration, the union brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The district court in that action determined that the question of whether the issues raised by the complaint were arbi-trable following termination of the contract was a subject for arbitration. As the court pointed out, it was \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s construction of that [arbitration] clause and not the Court\u2019s that was bargained for.\u201d 221 F.Supp. 463. The court did not, therefore, in that holding, go so far as to hold that the union-employer dispute over rehiring was, in fact, arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">On appeal, the Seventh Circuit held that the lower court\u2019s determination that the question of arbitrability was for the arbitrator was in error. But it went on to conclude that arbitration could not be ordered under the circumstances since the record failed to show that Kimball, during the term of the agreement, had in any way violated the contract rights of any of its employees. 333 F.2d 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The Supreme Court subsequently granted certiorari and summarily reversed the Seventh Circuit. The question presented to the Supreme Court, however, did not include the issue of whether the court or the arbitrator was to determine the threshold question of arbitrability under these circumstances. Rather, the issue before the Court in that case was the propriety of the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of the appellant\u2019s claim based upon the merits of the dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">I am of the opinion, therefore, that <em>Piano Workers </em>does not require that the substantive dispute in the present case be deemed arbitrable. Nor do I believe that the conclusion is mandated by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>United Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co. </em>or <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The question before us is a very narrow one: Is the arbitration clause susceptible of an interpretation that necessarily covers the asserted dispute? While doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage, <em>United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Co., </em>363 U.S. 564, 582-83, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960); <em>A. S. Abell Co. v. Baltimore Typographical Union No. 12, </em>338 F.2d 190, 193 (4th Cir. 1964), the court should ever be mindful of Mr. Justice Douglas admonishment in <em>United Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., </em>363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">\u201cThe courts . . . have no business weighing the merits of the grievance, considering whether there is equity in a particular claim, or determining whether there is particular language in the written instrument which will support the claim.\u201d 363 U.S. 564, 568, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 1346, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">Thus, where the determination of the arbitrability of a dispute would necessarily require consideration of the merits of the underlying disagreement, both issues should be submitted to the arbitrator. <em>A. S. Abell Co. v. Baltimore Typographical Union No. 12, </em>338 F.2d 190 (4th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">Our decision in <em>Winston-Salem Printing Pressmen &amp; Assistants\u2019 Union No. 318 v. Piedmont Publishing Co., </em>393 F.2d 221 (4th Cir. 1968),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is precisely in point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>here on facts which are indistinguishable for. all practical purposes. The majority, however, fails to follow that case. There, we scrupulously avoided any expression as to how the question of arbi-trability should be resolved where the application of the arbitration clause itself was subject to dispute. In that case, an employer sought to avoid arbitration on the grounds that the duty to arbitrate ceased With the expiration of the contract when the request to arbitrate came subsequent thereto. The district court concluded that the contract in question did not state that notice to arbitrate had to be given prior to expiration of the agreement, but that should settlement of contract disputes prove impossible, the differences would be arbitrated. On appeal, we held that where the issue of arbitrability involved interpretation of the contract, the entire matter, including the question of arbitrability should be submitted -to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">This conclusion is consistent with our earlier holding in <em>A. S. Abell Co. v. Baltimore Typographical Union No. 12, </em>388 F.2d 190 (4th Cir. 1964), where we stated that where it is not \u201cclear beyond rational debate\u201d that the litigants intended the dispute to be submitted to arbitration, the entire matter, including the question of arbitrability, should be referred to the arbitrator. To conclude otherwise would be to foreclose any opportunity to establish, by way of bargaining history, the intent of the parties to exclude certain matters from arbitration, for it is firmly established in this circuit that bargaining history is of no legitimate use in determining whether to order the submission of a grievance to arbitration. Id. at 194. See also <em>Local No. 1434 IBEW v. E. I. duPont deNemours &amp; Co., </em>350 F.Supp. 462, 466-67 (E.D.Va.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">In the instant case, it is by no means \u201cclear beyond rational debate\u201d that the dispute over severance pay after contract termination constitutes a \u201cgrievance\u201d within the meaning of the contract. The contract itself merely provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">\u201cIn the event any grievance cannot be satisfactorily adjusted ... either of the parties hereto may demand arbitration. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Nowhere within the agreement have the parties attempted to define \u201cany grievance.\u201d Since the phrase \u201cany grievance\u201d is left undefined, whether the parties intended that disputes arising after the termination of the contract be subject to arbitration may well call for a detailed examination of the bargaining history leading up to the contract, a task uniquely suited to the arbitrator. I am of opinion either party should be allowed to offer bargaining history to explain the undefined phrase, which, being unde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>fined, and subject to bargaining history, is not \u201cclear beyond rational debate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The majority, without the benefit of any evidence as to the parties\u2019 intent, has chosen to foreclose further inquiry into the question of arbitrability. In essence, it holds that the courts must conclusively decide the question of arbitra-bility, even where it is not \u201cclear beyond rational debate\u201d what the intent of the parties might have been. In so doing, the majority opinion extends an open invitation, indeed a command, to the courts to entangle themselves in the construction of both procedural and substantive provisions of labor agreements. This I consider to be improvident, clearly contrary to the law which has prevailed in this circuit, and not in keeping with the rule as stated in <em>Warrior and Gulf, </em>363 U.S. at p. 585, 80 S.Ct. 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Moreover, whether the parties in the instant case intended for the dispute over severance pay to be subject to arbitration after the termination of the contract seems to me to be inextricably intertwined with the substantive problem of whether or not it was the intent of the parties that severance pay provided for in the contract survive its termination. Certainly, no dispute can arise under the terms of the expired contract unless some substantive right survives its expiration.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Even assuming that there be doubt that the dispute is arbitrable, given the standard to be applied, it is clear that this matter must be submitted to arbitration at least for threshold consideration. To go further, however, and hold that the controversy is so clearly arbitra-ble under the contract as to foreclose the introduction of any evidence before the arbitrator as to the intent of the parties is, in my opinion, to substitute the views of this court for that of the arbitrator as to the merits of the dispute. This would create a \u201ccurious rule which required that intertwined issues . . . growing out of a single dispute and raising the same question on the same facts had to be carved up between two different forums, one deciding after the other. Neither logic nor considerations of policy compel such a result.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">I would accordingly remand with instructions that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-15\">(1) The whole dispute should be referred to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-16\">(2) At the arbitration, the company may make the objection that the dispute over severance pay under the facts presented was not intended by the parties to be subject to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-17\">(3) If the arbitrator should decide the dispute is subject to arbitration, then he should go on and decide, under the facts presented, the substantive question of whether or not \u201cthe parties intended . . . [severance pay] rights to be enjoyable, even after contract expiration.\u201d Opinion, p. 552.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-20\">Since the Supreme Court in <em>Piano Workers </em>did not decide the question of whether the question of arbitrability of the dispute was subject to arbitration, the majority here has obviously chosen to follow the Seventh Circuit in <em>Piano Workers </em>rather than our own cases. Not only do I prefer the logic of <em>Cardwell Mfg. Co. </em>and our cases of <em>A. S. Abell Co. </em>and <em>Winston-Salem Printing Pressmen, </em>for they give a more liberal reading to arbitration provisions, which I think consistent with national labor policy, I submit we are bound by our own decisions absent an en banc court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-21\">\u201cWhether contracting out [arbitration] in the present case violated the agreement is the question. It is a question for the arbiter, not the courts.\u201d 363 U.S. at 585, 80 S.Ct. at 1354. This final conclusion of'the Supreme Court in <em>Warrior and Gulf </em>is equally applicable here and no more than a following of the statute, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 173(d), as it declares that settlement of labor disputes by arbitration is the \u201cdesirable method\u201d for set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>tling \u201cgrievance disputes\u201d arising not only from the \u201cinterpretation\u201d of collective bargaining agreements, but also their \u201capplication.\u201d Typical of the majority opinion is its placing of italics on <em>interpretation </em>in its quotation of the statute, opinion p. 550, while not acknowledging anywhere in the opinion the equal emphasis Congress placed on <em>application. </em>That is its fundamental error.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Thus, the majority has fallen into the same trap for which it chides the district court at p. 551 of the opinion. It \u201cpreempted the arbitrator rather than overruling him.\u201d It \u201cmay do neither under the labor law.\u201d This court has no more authority to pre-empt the arbitrator than has the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">. The second opinion of the district court which establishes what the Supreme Court decided in its own case was not considered by the majority here. It is reported in 239 F.Supp. 523 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">. The <em>Steelworkers Trilogy </em>and <em>John Wiley and Sons </em>were specifically discussed and construed in our opinion in <em>Winston-Salem Printing Pressmen &amp; Assistants\u2019 Union No. 318 v. Piedmont Publishing Co., </em>393 F.2d 221 (4th Cir. 1968), which case is later discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">. An examination of the contract in that case shows that the phrase construed was \u201cany dispute\u201d over wages, hours, working conditions, and shop practices. 393 F.2d 221, n. 1. I submit the difference between \u201cany dispute\u201d in <em>Winston-Salem Printing Pressmen, </em>and \u201cany grievance\u201d in question here', is more theoretical than real. It is true that in the <em>Winston-Salem Printing Pressmen </em>case the contract provided for arbitration of \u201cthe construction to be placed upon any clause of . [the] agreement,\u201d but that is what a grievance is, a dispute between employee and employer over the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement. A case directly in point and consistent with my viewpoint is <em>U. A. W. et al v. Cardwell Mfg. Co., </em>304 F.2d 801 (10th Cir. 1962), where the matter to be submitted to arbitration was a \u201cgrievance\u201d which was defined in the contract as \u201cany dispute between the Company and the Union.\u201d Here, the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u201cany grievance\u201d is undefined by contract is all the more reason to submit to arbitration the applicability of the phrase to the dispute at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">It is generally held that the term \u201cgrievance\u201d is not a term of art, and has no connotation different from its meaning in ordinary use. <em>Forrest Industries, Inc. v. Local No. 3-436 Int. Woodworkers, </em>266 F.Supp. 265 (D.Or.1966), aff'd 381 F.2d 144 (9th Cir. 1967); <em>Butte Miners\u2019 Union No. 1, etc. v. Anaconda Co., </em>159 F.Supp. 431, 435 (D.Mont.1958); <em>Petition of Labor Mediation Board, </em>365 Mich. 645, 114 N.W.2d 183, 187 (1962); <em>Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. NLRB, </em>161 F.2d 949, 955 (6th Cir. 1947). And the teaching of the Supreme Court in its decision in <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf </em>is to the effect that a liberal and broad construction should be given the term in the interest of encouraging the use of machinery which the parties themselves have set up for the peaceful settlement of disputes. <em>Forrest Industries, Inc. v. Local No. 3</em>\u2014436, <em>Int. Woodworkers, </em>381 F.2d 144, 146 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\"><em>Warrior &amp; Gulf </em>states the rule we should follow now, as we have in the past:</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">\u201cSince any attempt by a court to infer such a purpose necessarily comprehends the merits, the court should view with suspicion an attempt to persuade it to become entangled in the construction of the substantive provisions of a labor agreement, even through the back door of interpreting the arbitration clause, when the alternative is to utilize the services of an arbitrator.\u201d * * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">\u201cThe judiciary sits in these cases to bring into operation an arbitral process which substitutes a regime of peaceful settlement for the older regime of industrial conflict. Whether contracting out in the present case violated the agreement is the question. It is a question for the arbiter, not for the courts.\u201d 363 U.S. at 585, 80 S.Ct. at 1354.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">. <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons v.

While the Court was dealing with a question of procedural arbitrability, the logic employed there appears equally applicable to the facts of this case for the majority here has taken \u201cintertwined issues . . . growing out of a single dispute\u201d and carved them up between two different forums.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
