They ask this court to modify the challenged wage order, which establishes rates ranging from $1.28 to $1.45 an hour for most employees, and up to $1.60 an hour for certain skilled employees, by raising all the minimum wage rates to $1.60 an hour, the 1974 statutory minimum for continental agricultural employees. Petitioners contend that the mandate of the 1974 Amendments has not been followed. We find substantial compliance with the statutory requirements and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AOXx\">A. <em>The Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-12\">In order to avoid major dislocations to the economy of Puerto Rico that could result from automatic application to the generally faltering industries on the island, of the wage standards set under the Act for the continental United States, Congress provided special standards and machinery. It delegated minimum wage-setting responsibility to <em>ad hoc </em>industry committees, convened by the Secretary under \u00a7 8(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(a). In accordance with \u00a7 5, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 205, the Secretary appoints to these tripartite bodies an equal number of members representing the public, employers in the industry, and employees in the industry, and aids in securing the information and witnesses necessary to committee deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-14\">The mandate of \u00a7 8(a) is \u201cto reach as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment\u201d the ultimate objective of parity with the mainland rates. Section 8(b), as amended in 1974, requires the special industry committee, after investigating conditions in the industry, hearing witnesses and receiving all necessary evidence, to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK8T\">recommend to the Administrator the highest minimum wage rates for the industry which it determines, having due regard to economic and competitive conditions, will not substantially curtail employment in the industry, and will not give any industry in Puer-to Rico or in the Virgin Islands a competitive advantage over any industry in the United States outside of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; except that the committee shall recommend to the Secretary the minimum wage rate prescribed in section 206(a) or 206(b) of this title, which would be applicable but for section 206(c) of this title, unless there is substantial documentary evidence, including pertinent unabridged profit and loss statements and balance sheets for a representative period of years or in the case of employees of public agencies other appropriate information, in the record which establishes that the industry, or a predominant portion thereof, is unable to pay that wage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-15\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-16\">After the committee has made its findings of fact and recommendations, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>is required by \u00a7 8(d) to file with the Secretary its report, which the Secretary \u201cshall publish ... in the Federal Register and shall provide by order that the recommendations contained in such report shall take effect upon the expiration of 15 days after the date of such publication.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(d). Any person aggrieved by such an order may obtain review by a court of appeals, which \u201cshall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify (including provisions for the payment of an appropriate minimum wage rate), or set aside such order in whole or in part, so far as is applicable to the petitioner. The review by the court shall be limited to questions of law, and findings of fact by such industry committee when supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive.\u201d \u00a7 10(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 210(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">This process is repeated every two years until the wage rates in Puerto Rico meet the minimum standards for the mainland United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">B. <em>The 1974 Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEC\">The 1974 wage order under review was set by Industry Committee No. 122, which had been appointed on February 12, 1974, for the purpose of reviewing the 1972 wage orders for the agriculture industry of Puerto Rico. The latter established rates for general agriculture of $1.05 and $1.15 an hour and for sugar cane of 70 cents and $1 an hour, with higher rates for certain skilled employees in general agriculture ($1.30) and in sugar cane ($1.20).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1974 Amendments, passed April 8, 1974, and effective May 1, 1974, required all such rates under $1.40 to be increased by 12 cents an hour.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Industry Committee No. 122 met from June 24, 1974 through June 28, 1974. The record it developed comprised three and one-half days of testimony and 36 exhibits. It voted to increase the wage rates further, so as to establish parity with the mainland rate of $1.60 for the relatively skilled workers in general agriculture and sugar cane farming. But it set rates ranging from $1.28 to $1.45 for the other classifications.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>report was submitted on June 29, 1974,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Secretary\u2019s wage order issued on August 28, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">While the Committee voted unanimously to approve the recommended rates, the three labor members did so reluctantly, \u201cin the interest of securing minimum wage rate recommendations at levels as nearly approaching $1.60 as obtainable. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The labor members filed a separate statement setting forth their legal objections to the fixing of rates below the $1.60 mainland minimum.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">C. <em>Petitioners\u2019 Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">Petitioners claim a failure to comply with \u00a7 8(b) of the Act, insofar as it was modified by the 1974 Amendments to require the industry committee to recommend the mainland rate \u201cunless there is substantial documentary evidence, including pertinent unabridged profit and loss statements and balance sheets for a representative period of years . in the record which establishes that the industry, or a predominant portion thereof, is unable to pay that wage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">Petitioners\u2019 first challenge goes to the form of the evidence \u2014 the absence of profit and loss statements. We shall discuss this in part III, but state the contention here to add perspective. Reading the phrase added to \u00a7 8(b) in 1974 as requiring profit and loss statements establishing inability to pay the mainland rates on the part of \u201ca predominant portion\u201d of the industry as a precondition to the consideration of lower rates, the labor members asserted that the employers failed \u201cto adduce evidence legally sufficient to rebut the statutory presumption that the mainland minimum wage rate for this industry should apply,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and therefore \u201cno course is legally permissible . . . except to go to $1.60.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">II. FINDING ON INABILITY TO PAY</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-11\">We begin with petitioners\u2019 second contention which appears for the first time in their briefs and at argument. Petitioners argue that this court must institute the mainland rate of $1.60 because the Committee failed to address in specific terms the threshold issue of inability to pay, and therefore left standing the statutory presumption in favor of the mainland minimum, depriving the Committee of authority to set a lower rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-12\">We hold this contention barred by \u00a7 10(a) which prevents this court from considering an objection to the Secretary\u2019s wage order \u201cunless such objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>shall have been urged before such industry committee or unless there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 210(a). We discern no indication, in the separate statement of the labor members of the Committee or in other parts of the record as filed, that this particular objection was raised before the Committee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The thrust of the labor members\u2019 statement, and of the debate and voting within the Committee, was to the absence of profit and loss statements for a predominant part of the industry. Indeed, Thomas Harris, spokesman for the labor members, conceded the inability of the farmers to pay the mainland rate, but stood on the ground that the absence of the requisite profit and loss statements rendered no other course \u201clegally permissible.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">We discern no reasonable grounds for petitioners\u2019 failure to raise their second objection before the Committee,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> particularly since it was one that could readily have been righted, on the basis of the record evidence had there been timely assertion. While there was no formal finding on inability to pay,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> such a determination was made in substance, and was certainly an implicit premise of the Committee\u2019s report, the labor members\u2019 statement and the debate on their objections. The Committee justified its recommendations for rates below the mainland minimum with respect to non-sugar cane farms in terms of generally slim or non-existent profit margins obtaining there and the continuing need for the Commonwealth Government to subsidize previous increases in farm worker minimum wages,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and with respect to sugar cane farms in terms of the losses sustained in previous crop years.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Mr. Harris agreed \u201cthat the farmers probably can\u2019t afford to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>more\u201d without \u201csome kind of emergency Government program\u201d to provide further subsidies.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The labor members conspicuously avoided any debate on the merits of establishing parity with the mainland, focusing on the nature of the evidence required by \u00a7 8(b) to rebut the statutory presumption.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">No challenge was raised either by the labor members or the petitioners to the substantiality of the evidence underlying the Committee\u2019s recommendations, and, as we shall later develop, there was no infirmity in the nature of the evidence relied upon. In the review of administrative agencies, courts require formal findings, tracking the language of the pertinent statutory criteria, in the belief that insistence on proper form assures that agencies will focus on the exact issues and think through matters more clearly. Even in the case of conventional agencies, however, courts do not always require agencies to dot their \u201ci\u2019s\u201d and cross their \u201ct\u2019s\u201d. \u201cCourts are indulgent toward administrative action to the extent of affirming an order where the agency\u2019s path can be \u2018discerned\u2019 even if the opinion \u2018leaves much to be desired.\u2019 \u201d <em>WAIT Radio v. F. C. C., </em>135 U.S.App. D.C. 317, 320, 418 F.2d 1153, 1156 (1969). The present setting, moreover, involves the deliberations of an <em>ad hoc </em>administrative body of laymen generally unfamiliar with administrative procedures, and we do not think it appropriate to insist on strictest adherence to procedural formality. The Committee was dealing with an amendment passed only a few months before it began its deliberation,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and while a determination of inability to pay was made a prerequisite the amendment did not set forth in terms the requirement that this inability be the subject of a formal \u201cfinding.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, we find substantial compliance with the statutory requirement, and do not think the public interest in sound administration or any other aspect of the interest of justice, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106, requires a remand to recast the language of the report to make explicit its abundantly apparent operative premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-12\">III. THE PROFIT AND LOSS DATA REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-13\">We turn to the more difficult contention: that the participial \u201cincluding\u201d phrase added to \u00a7 8(b) in 1974 requires that the threshold inability to pay determination be based on profit and loss statements for the predominant part of the agriculture industry of Puerto Rico.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Committee did not have before it data in this form for a predominant part of the industry. Indeed, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>one farmer provided the Committee with profit and loss statements for his farm.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\">We hold that the clause beginning with the participle \u201cincluding\u201d was intended to identify the kind of information that Congress required, not to impose a mandate regarding the exclusive competency of accountant-type profit and loss statements. The Act does not require profit and loss statements as such. Indeed, counsel for petitioners, when pressed at oral argument, conceded as much, but argued that the permissible substitute must be \u201csomething equivalent,\u201d with the \u201csame level of detail.\u201d What Congress intended by the 1974 Amendment of \u00a7 8(b), which perpetuated our decision in <em>Sindicato Puertorriqueno de Trabajadores v. Hodgson, </em>145 U.S. App.D.C. 238, 448 F.2d 1161 (1971) <em>(Sindicato I), </em>remanding an earlier wage order for further proceedings, was that the Committee\u2019s inability to pay finding be based on reliable evidence that would be documentary rather than subjective and impressionistic. Congress was aware of the difficulties in obtaining profit and loss statements from the many uneducated, marginal farmers on the island, and it did not intend to prohibit the use of material that could fairly be regarded as a reasonable equivalent of profit and loss data. In our view, the kind of evidence relied upon by Industry Committee No. 122 was such a reasonable equivalent, and constituted \u201csubstantial documentary evidence\u201d in support of its rebuttal of the statutory presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">In <em>Sindicato I, </em>we specifically rejected the argument that profit and loss statements were required. Finding that \u201cmost farmers simply do not have this type of information and . . . about two-thirds of the farmers have attended schools for less than six years,\u201d the court held that \u201cthe Committee is not precluded from making recommendations on the. basis of evidence which is available.\u201d 145 U.S.App.D.C. at 243, 448 F.2d at 1166. The legislative history reflects no dissatisfaction with that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">What prompted the court\u2019s remand was not the form of the evidence, but rather its conclusion that there was an absence of any evidence or intermediate findings on why the recommended rates were the highest wage rates which would not substantially curtail employment or give Puerto Rican industry an undue competitive advantage over the mainland.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court\u2019s remand was a response to the hopelessness of its reviewing task when the record is \u201cbarren of a.ny economic analysis or rationalization of the situation in the industry which justifies the conclusion that the rates are the highest \u2022 minimum,\u201d when \u201c[w]hy the rates fixed rather than others were recommended cannot be discerned from the report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 448 F.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-12\">Congress, in amending \u00a7 8(b), sought \u201cto correct the fault which the <em>Sindicato </em>decision exposed,\u201d and considered the amendment to be \u201cconsistent with the rationale of that case.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Congress\u2019 aim was to ensure that industry committee determinations \u201cbe based on record-evidence adequate to reveal the financial and economic condition of the covered employers,\u201d so that these proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>would no longer \u201cdegenerate into a process by which a majority of the members work their will knowing that the record is bare of the facts necessary to controvert their argument that higher wages would substantially curtail employment.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is significant that the proponents of the amendment did not identify the problem exposed by <em>Sindica-to I </em>as bearing on the form of the evidence, and that none of the committee reports require reliance on profit and loss statements <em>per se, </em>but rather show concern with the overall adequacy and reliability of the evidence, amending \u00a7 8(b) to \u201cprovide a spur to insure that the industry committees will be in a position to act rationally rather than arbitrarily.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Harsh consequences would flow from a-contrary reading. As the <em>Sindicato I </em>opinion specifically found, profit and loss statements are simply not obtainable from most farmers in Puerto Rico.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The greater number of Puerto Rican farmers are simply too uneducated, their enterprises too marginal, their accounting practices too rudimentary to expect detailed financial statements from them.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Congress did not indicate any intention to abandon its general approach of gradualism in achieving minimum wage parity between Puerto Rico and the States, or to penalize Puerto Ri-can farmers and their employees<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> because of the state of education and accounting practice on the island.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cThe word \u2018including\u2019 does not lend itself to such destructive significance.\u201d <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, </em>313 U.S. 177, 189, 61 S.Ct. 845, 850, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">IV. SUBSTANTIAL DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">To avoid misunderstanding, we think it right to emphasize that our ruling is limited to a rejection of the particular objection raised, and is not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>taken as an approval for the future of the kind of evidence and findings in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">The Committee essentially relied upon three sources of data. The most often cited was an April, 1974 study by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. The Division\u2019s survey was based on the selection of farms that had been made for an earlier industry committee in 1971 and covered what it believed to be a representative sample of the universe farms subject to the Act.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> While the Division sought financial information from each of the farms surveyed in 1971, many of the farms had gone out of business or were otherwise unable to be contacted, had been leased to the Commonwealth Government, or had become exempt from the Act.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Data for fiscal years 1972 and 1973, received from 30% of the non-sugar cane farms surveyed and 60% of the sugar cane farms surveyed,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> indicated either losses or slim profit margins which would not yield any net profits once salaries were imputed for work done by the farm owners and their immediate families.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">A second source was the testimony of Mr. Hector Rosa-Rosa, Director of the Guaranteed Income Program of the Commonwealth Government. He testified to the Commonwealth\u2019s extensive wage supplement program, initially instituted to guarantee wages higher than the minimum set by the Act for Puerto Rico, but then expanded to absorb industry committee recommendations above the Commonwealth guaranteed rates.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> He testified, further, to the continuing need for these wage supplement payments^ \u2014 reflecting an inability of the agriculture industry to absorb increases in wage costs.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">A third source was the testimony of officials of the Puerto Rico Farm Bureau, an organization representing about 69% of the universe of farms subject to the Act. Referring to updated studies by the Department of Agriculture of Puerto Rico (1972 sugar cane survey) and the Agricultural Experiment Station <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>of the University of Puerto Rico (1969 survey of dairy farms), as well as to Commonwealth Government wage subsidy policies (with respect to coffee farms), the Farm Bureau officials testified to dwindling numbers of farms, declining production and employment figures, and nonexistent profit margins.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Mr. Luis R. Berrios, president of the Farm Bureau, also submitted the only profit and loss data in the record, an individual statement for his substantial dairy enterprise. Notwithstanding the fact that he operated one of the more successful dairies on the island, he testified that his operating profit in 1972 was only $49,209, a figure which did not include any adjustment for taxes or salary for himself and his family.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">The bleak picture painted by the various surveys and testimony \u2014 of declining production and rising unemployment, slim profit margins, and extensive wage subsidies \u2014 amply supports a determination of inability to pay the mainland rates for farm workers generally. But there are problems with the proof and the report that may present legal deficiencies unless addressed by the Department of Labor and future committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">First, the Committee failed to deal with the significance of the Commonwealth\u2019s income supplement program for the threshold inability to pay determination. Is it the Committee\u2019s approach that the very existence of the subsidies indicates an inability to pay, at least at existing employment levels? Or that the Commonwealth\u2019s policy makes inability to pay irrelevant? All the Committee did was refer to the existence of the subsidy program and comment that if the increases resulting from its recommendations \u201cwill not be absorbed by the Commonwealth Government, it must be borne in mind that these would be the first increases absorbed by the farmers as employers in more than four (4) years.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Does this betoken an approach that past subsidies could properly be included in the gross income available to farmers to meet their payrolls, but that further subsidies could not be presumed? The problem is a difficult one, and future committees may require assistance from the Department of Labor, but administrative law is not generally hospitable to an ostrich approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">There is a further problem in that the surveys relied upon by the Committee were not explicitly identified as representative of the industry or a predominant part thereof. The surveys cover a substantial portion but less than a predominant part of the industry. In the circumstances of this case, given the fact the Committee was taking action so soon after the new amendments,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> the exhib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>its and assumption of the Committee may be taken as resting on the premise that the surveys were fairly representative of the industry (or perhaps as even reflecting more ability to pay than the industry as a whole \u2014 in the thought that Mr. Berrios and the farmers responding to the Wage and Hour Division survey were more organized, and probably more successful, than those incapable of producing any financial information).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">In future years, this matter should be addressed explicitly \u2014 by the committees, and by survey officials of the Department of Labor. There would be time to obtain documentary material as to those farms that are substantial business enterprises, not to be confused with those owned by the marginal and less educated farmers. If profit and loss data, or documentation of similar probative value, cannot be secured for a predominant part of the industry, an alternative may lie in a reasoned submission that the surveys and materials proferred are fairly representative of a predominant portion of the industry. An allowance for lack of conventional mainland accounting data would not necessarily excuse failure to produce reliable, representative documentary evidence which timely and adequate preparation, by the Department of Labor or other sources, can realistically yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Furthermore, much of the Commission\u2019s proof is in the form of a recitation of the survey results as to net operating income figures. There is no meaningful address to the issue of the impact of going to the mainland minimum. The court cannot itself reconstruct the exhibits annexed, <em>e.g., </em>adjustments for salary imputed to the owner. The intention of the 1974 amendments is to require the report itself to relate in a logical fashion how the data supports the particular recommendations made. Hopefully, future committees will be aided by the Department of Labor so that their recommendations can be presented as the product of reasoned decisionmaking, susceptible to the judicial review provided by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">In sum, we affirm the minimum wage order for the agriculture industry in Puerto Rico, issued August 23, 1974, in rejecting the only contention properly raised before Industry Committee No. 122: the 1974 Amendments to the Act do not require individual profit and loss statements as the exclusive mode of rebutting the statutory presumption in favor of the mainland minimum, but permit rebuttal by \u201csubstantial documentary evidence\u201d bearing similar indicia of reliability. No objection was presented before the Committee to the absence of formal findings on inability to pay or the substantiality of the record evidence, and we accordingly have no authority under \u00a7 10(a) to disturb the minimum wage order on these grounds. We contemplate that the Department of Labor will take a more active role in aiding industry committee deliberations so that future reports and recommendations will more clearly evidence reasoned decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1093-23\">.

The Committee members understood their dissenting colleagues to be objecting to the absence of profit and loss statements, rather than to any failure to make specific findings on inability to pay, see App. A48, A56-59, A66-69, and the labor members did not attempt to dispel this impression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">.

The fact is that on this record it appears that the farm workers probably can\u2019t live on the wage they are getting paid, and we have a vague suspicion that the farmers probably can\u2019t afford to pay more. The fact that the Island Commonwealth Government is paying this wage subsidy at least suggests that the Commonwealth Government feels that. I am sure than an increase to $1.60 might have a very upsetting effect on the farmers of Puerto Rico, and it might very likely have to be met by some kind of emergency Government program to take care of the situation, to provide an additional supplement, or whatever else the Government wanted to do.

Petitioners were not dependent on the labor members of the Committee to raise their particular objections. Section 511.8 of the Labor Department Regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 511.8 (revised eff. May 22, 1974), permits any employer or employee, individual or group, in the agriculture industry of Puerto Rico who wishes to participate on his own behalf or by counsel to file a prehearing statement, and if the statement contains the information required by \u00a7 511.8(b) he is accorded party status. Even if a prehearing statement has not been filed, \u00a7 511.8(d) gives the committee discretion to permit the offering of testimony in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d And even after the industry committee submits its report and recommendations, and the Secretary has published the recommendations and provided by order for their effectuation, under \u00a7 511.19 \u201c[a]ny interested person may at any time file a petition ... for an amendment to a wage order applicable to him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1097-13\">. It should be noted that the Committee did in its formulation of its ultimate conclusion restate the language of \u00a7 8(b), as amended. See App. A36. Ordinarily, however, a concluding paragraph merely restating the statutory language is not an adequate substitute for required findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1097-14\">.

App. A40-42, A64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-10\">Section 511.10(a) merely restates the statutory language. Section 511.13 requires that Testimony on behalf of an employer or group of employers as to inability to pay the minimum wage rates specified in paragraph (1) or (5) of section 6(a) or 6(b) of the Act, whichever would be applicable, or as to inability to adjust to a higher minimum wage rate than prescribed by any applicable wage order of the Secretary, shall be supported by tangible objective data filed as part of a pre-hearing statement under \u00a7 511.8, including pertinent unabridged profit and loss statements and balance sheets for a representa-five period of years for the individual firm or firms involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-15\">Section 511.8(b) provides that \u201c[a]ny interested person who wishes to participate on his own behalf or by counsel shall file a written prehearing statement,\u201d which shall contain certain specified information, \u201cincluding all tangible objective data to be submitted pursuant to \u00a7 511.13. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-16\">These regulations are not particularly helpful to petitioners\u2019 cause.
