Although not all of the petitioners challenged the same regulations for the same reasons, there was sufficient similarity in their claims to consolidate the petitions and hear argument together.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The specific regulations challenged by the private petitioners<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">Employer\u2019s Provision for Mass Transit Priority Incentives \u2014 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1105; Management of Parking Supply \u2014 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1111;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">Control and Prohibition of Sources of Photochemically Reactive Organic Materials \u2014 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1112; and Control of Evaporative Losses from Vehicular Tanks \u2014 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1102.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The State of Maryland challenges the right of, as well as the justification for, the EPA to require that it enact programs calling for retrofit of pollution control devices on certain classes of vehicles and the establishment of bikeways. 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 52.1095-52.1100, 52-1106. Maryland has also called for a complete reevaluation of the Baltimore Transportation Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857 et seq., provides that the Administrator of the EPA shall publish national standards for air quality as to those pollutants which have been determined by EPA, based on the latest scientific data, to be harmful to the public health or welfare. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857c-3, 1857c-4. For each pollutant, a primary standard is to be established to protect the public health and a secondary standard to protect the public welfare. On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated such regulations for sulfur oxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, photochemical oxidants, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen dioxide. 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 50.4r-50.ll (April 30, 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The statute provides that the states shall have the primary responsibility for achieving and maintaining these air quality standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-2. Each state was given the opportunity to submit to the EPA, not later than January 1, 1972 (nine months after the promulgation of the standards), implementation plans which would achieve the primary standards within three years and the secondary standards within a specified reasonable time. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857c \u2014 5(a)(1), 1857c-5(a)(2)(A). Such plans were to include, among other requirements, \u201cemission limitations, schedules, and timetables for compliance with such limitations, and such other measures as may be necessary to insure attainment and maintenance of such primary and secondary standard, including, but not limited to, land-use and transportation controls.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(B). On application by the governor of a state, the EPA may grant an extension of time, not to exceed two years, within which to achieve the primary standard, provided the state has shown that it is unable to meet the standard with available or alternative technology. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e). After review of a state\u2019s plan, the EPA may accept it, or reject it and issue its own implementation plan for the area. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Maryland submitted its regional plan on January 28, 1972. On May 31, 1972, the EPA also permitted several states, including Maryland, until February 15, 1973 to amend their implementation plans. 37 Fed.Reg. at 10844. In addition, the EPA granted Maryland an extension of two years in its attainment dates for the national carbon monoxide standards. 37 Fed.Reg. 10871.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Subsequently, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, </em>154 U.S.App.D.C. 384, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>475 F.2d 968 (1973), held that a blanket delay in the submission of plans or a similar blanket extension of achievement dates was not permitted. Based on that decision, the EPA notified Maryland that its extension was canceled and that complete plans were to be filed by April 15, 1973. 38 Fed.Reg. 7323 (March 20, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Maryland then filed its plan on April 16, 1973, along with a request for a two-year extension. The EPA denied the extension and disapproved portions of Maryland\u2019s April 16th plan on June 15, 1973. 38 Fed.Reg. 16558-16559, 16565-16566 (June 22, 1973). On August, 2, 1973, the EPA published proposed regulations to supplement the Maryland plan. 38 Fed.Reg. 20769-20779 (August 2, 1973). Following public hearings held in Baltimore on September 5, 1973, the EPA promulgated the balance of the regulations in issue here. 38 Fed.Reg. 34230-34257 (December 12, 1973). These included provisions which provided that the \u201cstate of Maryland shall\u201d establish automobile inspection and maintenance programs as well as retrofit programs. Taken in view of the preamble published at 38 Fed.Reg. 30626 (November 6, 1973), the EPA obviously took the position that these regulations constituted a comprehensive plan for implementation of the Clean Air Act in the Baltimore area, and would produce reductions in pollutants sufficient to meet national standards by 1977. 38 Fed.Reg. 34240 (December 12, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Thereafter, in June of 1974, Congress froze the standards for light duty vehicles and engines manufactured during the model years 1975 and 1976. P.L. 93-319(5)(a). The EPA itself revoked 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1112, styled the control and prohibition of sources of photochemically reactive organic material. 40 Fed.Reg. 5523 (February 6, 1975). It also suspended indefinitely 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1111 providing for the management of parking supply. 40 Fed.Reg. 2586 (January 14, 1975, pending amendment), 40 Fed. Reg. 29713 (July 15, 1975, without qualification pending Congressional action). In addition, the EPA has advised by letter dated March 25, 1975 that it is rescinding 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1097, the oxidizing catalyst retrofit program for medium and light duty vehicles. Finally, the EPA has taken the position that an indefinite suspension of any regulation entitled an aggrieved person, before reim-position of that regulation, to ask for review upon the same terms as were originally available.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AFI\">In reviewing an implementation plan under the Clean Air Act, the reviewing court must apply substantially the same standards imposed by the Administrative Procedure Act. See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 </em>U.S. 402, 413-14, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1970). The authority to make such regulations must be found in the statute, the procedures followed must be lawful, and the plan must be constitutional. If these requirements are met, the challenged regulations may be set aside only where they are found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Accord <em>Union Electric Co. v. EPA, </em>515 F.2d 206, 214 (8th Cir. 1975) and authorities cited therein. In arriving at such a determination, the court must: \u201c \u2018engage in a substantial inquiry\u2019 into the reasonableness of the agency action . . . and as a part of that \u2018inquiry\u2019 it \u2018must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment\u2019 . . . since \u2018it is \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d for an agency not to take into account all relevant factors in making its determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, </em>477 F.2d 495, 507 (4th Cir. 1973), (citations omitted). And, under <em>Appalachian Power, </em>which sets out the standard of review in this circuit, the courts must not substitute their judgment for that of the agency which Congress has entrusted with the responsibility of weighing the many competing factors. Accord <em>Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, </em>(D.C. Cir., No. 73-2205, 1975). Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the record must indicate that all such factors were weighed by the agency, and must support the decision which was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Numerous objections to the Agency\u2019s plan have been raised in these consolidated actions. They call into question the procedural aspects of the EPA\u2019s rule-making, the constitutionality of its regulations, and their rationality. While we find some parts of the regulations to be contrary to law, in view of the disposition we make of the case, we do not reach the many constitutional issues raised or most of the multitude of procedural questions posed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>Employers Provision for Mass Transit Priority Incentives, 40 CFR 52.1105 (EMTI)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">40 CFR \u00a7 52.1105 requires each employer within the region who maintains more than 700 employee parking spaces (to be later reduced so as to apply to those maintaining more than 70 such spaces) to submit to the EPA a plan for encouraging employees to use mass transit facilities rather than single passenger automobiles. The only criteria governing the acceptability of such a plan is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">\u201c. . . the Administrator shall approve such program for each employer <em>if he finds it to be adequate, </em>and shall disapprove it <em>if he finds it not to be adequate.\u201d </em>40 CFR \u00a7 52.1105(c) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">We note complete absence of any established relevant factors which the Administrator considers in approving or disapproving an implementation plan. So without any stated criteria, the EPA has unlimited discretion in deciding which plan will or which will not be approved, and of equal significance, the employer is given no guidance whatsoever as to how he might draft an acceptable plan other than he must \u201cencourage the use of mass transit\u201d and \u201cdiscourage the use of single passenger automobiles\u201d by his employees. While several suggested restrictive measures are set forth in the regulation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an employer\u2019s ingenuity and know-how in implementing the regulation faces an impossible task, for the regulation does not advise him of a goal to be attained or of the factors to be considered by the Administrator in determining whether a particular program is \u201cadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">The EPA has admitted in its brief that it is practically impossible for an employer to ascertain what will constitute an acceptable plan. According to the EPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-15\">\u201c[t]he appropriate measures in any given instance will depend upon the location of the employer and the employees, the availability of mass transit, traffic patterns, and many other factors. These matters can be judged only on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis. It may be that one transit incentive plan providing for a ten percent reduction in VMT will be disapproved because a twenty percent reduction is feasible, while another transit incentive plan providing for a five percent reduction in VMT will be approved because it is the most feasible plan under the circumstances.\u201d EPA brief at 33.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">While the EPA brief attempts to cure the regulation by suggesting some factors the Administrator should consider in his <em>ad hoc </em>determination of adequacy, the regulation itself suggests none. It has recently been held in a similar case that such vagueness invalidated a parking regulation imposed under the Clean Air Act. In <em>South Terminal Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>EPA, </em>504 F.2d 646 (1st Cir. 1974), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201cWe are concerned, however, by the standardlessness of subsection (d). The clause permits denial of a permit unless the functionary passing on such requests decides that the facility \u2018will not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of applicable Federal Air Quality Standards. . . . \u2019 * * * The regulation does not indicate how \u2018interference\u2019 is to be judged, nor does it state who must bear the burden of showing non-interference. The prospective applicant for a permit is utterly without guidance as to what he must prove, and how. And the standard is so vague that it invites arbitrary and unequal application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">We disapprove the \u2018interference\u2019 clause as now worded.\u201d 504 F.2d at 670.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">We are of the opinion that the regulation in question, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1105, is likewise impermissibly vague. It states neither a goal to be attained, nor a standard to be applied, nor factors to be used by the Administrator in his determination as to adequacy. An employer may read the regulation in vain for guidance as to what his mass transit program should contain in order to receive administrative approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Common sense dictates that if the same number of people are transported to and from their work by fewer motor vehicles, there will be fewer pollutants discharged into the atmosphere and the laudable purpose of clean air will be served. But the employer, and in many instances the employees, who must bear the brunt of the reduced vehicular traffic, must be given some reasonable direction as to what is demanded of them by the government. Moreover, this court, before it can make an intelligent determination as to whether the Administrator\u2019s action is arbitrary or capricious, must know what the relevant factors are that are to be considered in approving or disapproving such programs. Accord <em>Union Electric Co. v. EPA, </em>515 F.2d 206 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">We do not suggest a solution, but only decide the case before us. Nothing in the record indicates the EPA faces an impossible task in framing a regulation of sufficient specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">Neither the Maryland plan submitted on April 16, 1973 nor the EPA\u2019s proposed rulemaking promulgated on August 2, 1973 made any mention of a program which resembles the Employers Mass Transit Program set out in 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1105. While the proposed rulemak-ing mentioned limitations upon on-street parking, as well as upon construction of additional parking spaces, the only thing the EPA can point to to show the Employers Mass Transit Incentive Program should have been expected in the Baltimore region is that on the same day the EPA proposed a measure entitled \u201cReduction of Employee Parking\u201d for the National Capital Interstate Air Quality Control Region. 38 Fed.Reg. 20787, \u00a7 52.1096 (August 2, 1973). Yet, the regulation here under review did not appear in the Baltimore plan until published in final form on December 12, 1973. It was only then that the EPA offered to receive comments and limited their receipt to those filed prior to January 14, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">Clearly, the promulgation of implementation plans under the Clean Air Act by the EPA is \u201crulemaking.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Buckeye Power Inc. v. EPA, </em>481 F.2d 162, 170-71 (6th Cir. 1973); <em>Willapoint Oysters, Inc. v. Ewing, </em>174 F.2d 676, 693 (9th Cir. 1949), cert. den., 338 U.S. 860, 70 S.Ct. 101, 94 L.Ed. 527 (1949). The Administrative Procedure Act requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>notice be given of proposed rulemaking and specifies that it include \u201ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or-a description of the subject and issues involved.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3). The Clean Air Act itself requires the EPA to consider any State hearing or record and \u201cpublish proposed regulations setting forth an implementation plan for a State . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c \u2014 5(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The petitioners argue that at no time prior to December 12, 1973 were they given notice that employer mass transit incentive provisions were being considered, and that, as a result, they have been denied a reasonable opportunity to evaluate and consider these measures. They argue that the Agency\u2019s willingness to accept post-promulgation comments after the fact from interested parties is evidence of the confusion attendant to the adoption of certain of the strategies included in the plan and illustrates a lack of prior information. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The need for adequate hearing proceedings was emphasized by this court in <em>Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, </em>477 F.2d 495 (4th Cir. 1973). In that case, we were reviewing the EPA\u2019s approval of a state pollution control program. We held that the EPA need not conduct hearings prior to its decision if the state hearings were adequate and the EPA properly considered their findings. As we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">\u201cThis conclusion [that no EPA hearing is required] ... is based on the assumption that at the state hearing interested parties were afforded full opportunity to present their contentions with respect to the proposed plan. Because of the nature of the regulations and their drastic impact, such opportunity might well include the right to more than merely the opportunity to comment. [Citation omitted] What is required in all instances, whatever the character of the administrative action, is \u2018the reality of an opportunity to submit an effective presentation,\u2019 and, if in the context of the issues involved, \u2018cross-examination on the crucial issues\u2019 is found proper, such right should be recognized and upheld.\u201d 477 F.2d 495, 503.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">At the hearing on September 5, 1973, no one' discussed the Employers Mass Transit Incentive Program. This adds weight to the petitioners\u2019 contention that they were denied \u201can opportunity to participate in the rulemaking.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(c). In <em>South Terminal, </em>the notice mentioned reducing off-street parking, and during the subsequent hearing there was discussion of \u201creducing parking facilities where plants . . . [could] be served by mass transit.\u201d 504 F.2d at 659. Here, however, the notice did not mention off-street parking, and at the hearing there was no discussion of reducing employee parking spaces. Since the disputed regulations were not subject to hearings at a state level, were not a part of the proposed regulations that were subject to comment, and were not mentioned prior to December 12, 1973 when they were issued in final form, it is clear that the intensive pre-promulgation inquiry anticipated by <em>Appalachian Power </em>was not afforded the petitioners. The reception of comments after all the crucial decisions have been made is not the same as permitting active and well prepared criticism to become a part of the decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">We are, therefore, of opinion that the regulation is invalid as a result of the lack of notice required by <em>Appalachian Power, </em>and failure to comply with the notice and publication requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3), and the statute itself, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(c)(l). We emphasize again, as we did in <em>Appalachian Power, </em>that, in light of the \u201cdrastic impact\u201d which compliance with regulations such as this will have, adherence to applicable statutory provisions is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\n<em>hi</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\n<em>Management of Parking Supply 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1111</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Given the fact that the EPA has indefinitely suspended 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1111, while at the same time taking the position that such suspension entitles one aggrieved to a new right of review upon reinstatement, we do not feel that the issues raised by the petitioners should be considered at this time. When, and if, the EPA reimposes the provisions of this regulation, the parties will have ample opportunity to present their objections to its implementation. Accord <em>County of Contra Costa v. EPA </em>(9th Cir. 1975). In declining to rule on the regulation involved, we in no way imply that we would not follow the holding in <em>South Terminal </em>with respect to a similar interference clause there deemed to be stan-dardless.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>Control and Prohibition of Sources of Photochemically Reactive Organic Materials, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1112</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The EPA concluded that 40 CFR \u00a7 52.-1112 regulating sources of photochemically reactive organic materials was vague and, on January 31, 1975, rescinded it. 40 Fed.Reg. 5523 (January 31, 1975). Thus, this regulation is no longer part of the Maryland plan and will not be considered at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">\n<em>Control of Evaporation Losses from Vehicular Tanks, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1102</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">40 CFR \u00a7 52.1102 was designed to prevent the discharge into the atmosphere of gasoline vapors from the nozzles used in filling automobile gasoline tanks. It was also intended to provide for the recovery of at least 90% of the organic compounds displaced from such tanks upon filling, and to prevent overfills and spillage arising therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">On June 18, 1974, the EPA relaxed the compliance schedules and reopened the comment period due to the \u201csubstantial confusion\u201d which had \u201carisen as to the type of equipment and necessary recovery efficiency required to comply.\u201d 39 Fed.Reg. 21049-53, esp. 21051.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\">In so doing, the Agency noted that: \u201c[t]he Administrator has concluded that there have been sufficient developments since the regulations were drafted, and that there is sufficient uncertainty about which system will be approvable as to be in compliance with these regulations to warrant a reopening of the opportunity for public comment on this issue until July 31, 1974. In addition, an EPA-funded testing program is being carried out in San Diego County to attempt to measure the performance of various systems with results expected by August 1, 1974.\u201d Id. at 21051.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">We have not been advised of the results of the testing program, and, so far as we are informed, neither have the parties. It may be that the Administrator will soon be able to advise what devices are approved and end the uncertainty. The court has had an indication that such may be the case in the allied cases of <em>Texaco, Inc. v. EPA, </em>No. 74-1011, and <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. EPA, </em>No. 74-1052, which were severed from these cases and action deferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">The EPA takes the position that a requested stay filed by Bethlehem Steel, one of the numerous private parties herein, is premature because no application has been made to the Agency. See Fed.R.App. P. 18. While this position may have some merit, a literal application of Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure during the penden-cy of a review and in the midst of changing regulations would seem of doubtful value. Nevertheless, we decline to grant a stay of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">We are thus faced with the problem of the proper course to take. If the Administrator does not know what device will be approved, it is obvious that nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ther the court nor the petitioners do. The compliance schedule dates were extended so that the last construction date fell on May 1, 1975. 39 Fed.Reg. 21051. Hopefully, the technical data is available and has been distributed so this aspect of the case may be dismissed as moot. If it has not, the petitioners may begin anew for all practical purposes if they feel harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">We, therefore, are of opinion to remand this regulation to the EPA for such further consideration as may be appropriate. It may be the EPA will simply reimpose the regulation. If such should be the case, all objections available now or later may be made at that time, including requests for stays and reinstatement of this matter on the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">All matters relating to 40 CFR \u00a7 52.-1102 will be consolidated with those of the <em>Texaco </em>and <em>Gulf </em>cases, Nos. 74-1011 and 74-1052, and jurisdiction of the matter retained. We feel certain the parties will advise us should a need for our further action be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>Claims of the State of Maryland</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">As mentioned before, Maryland submitted its plan to the Administrator, who approved parts of it and disapproved parts of it. For the purposes of our discussion, we consider only the inspection and maintenance program, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1095; vacuum spark advance disconnect retrofit of pre-1968 light duty vehicles, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1096; air/fuel control retrofit of certain 1968-71 light duty vehicles, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1098; certain pre-1974 medium duty vehicles, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1099; heavy duty vehicles, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1100; and the establishment of bikeways, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">While certain parts of Maryland\u2019s Transportation Plan were accepted, some were rejected by the EPA because, among various reasons, the \u201clegal authority\u201d was not submitted in the plan. The EPA then required Maryland to \u201cestablish\u201d an inspection and maintenance program, \u00a7 52.1095, various retrofit programs, \u00a7\u00a7 52.1096-1100, and a system of bikeways and parking facilities, \u00a7 52.-1106. The regulations concerning inspection and maintenance, retrofit and bike-way programs all required Maryland to submit \u201clegally adopted regulations\u201d which established or implemented the programs as promulgated by the EPA. The inspection and maintenance regulations required Maryland to submit \u201cthe text of needed statutory proposals and regulations that it will propose for adoption\u201d as well as the \u201ctext of needed legislation\u201d for funding, if not otherwise available. The retrofit program regulations required Maryland to forward to the Administrator \u201cthe text of statutory proposals, regulations, and enforcement procedures\u201d that it submits for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The complications inherent in these astonishing regulations are compounded by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857h-5(b)(2) which provides that such actions of the Administrator \u201cwith respect to which review could have been obtained ... [as it is here] shall not be subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">In a nutshell, the EPA has directed Maryland and her legislature to legislate under pain of civil and criminal penalties, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-8, for a State is a person within the meaning of the statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857h(e). The government does not beg the issue, but boldly takes the position just set forth in its brief as it describes the questioned regulations: \u201cthese EPA regulations which require the State to enact enabling legislation. . . . \u201d It then argues that it is immaterial whether the activity regulated under the commerce clause is proprietary or governmental, see <em>New York V. United </em>States, 326 U.S. 572, 583, 66 S.Ct. 310, 90 L.Ed. 326 (1946), and <em>United States v. California, </em>297 U.S. 175, 183, 56 S.Ct. 421, 80 L.Ed. 567 (1936), and that a construction of the commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>clause which does not include the power of the United States to direct the legislature of a state to legislate is \u201cnarrow and restrictive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The EPA takes the position that \u201cdirect federal action\u201d to enforce its own regulations, similar to these, would be \u201cinefficient and impractical\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is clearly necessary that implementation and transportation control plans be carried out at the State and local level.\u201d 38 Fed.Reg. 30633 (November 6, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">But we do not agree with the Agency that the issue presented is not of unusual constitutional significance. Rather, we are of the opinion that it is. The Supreme Court \u201chas always recognized that the power to regulate commerce, though broad indeed, has limits.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Wirtz, </em>392 U.S. 183, 196, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 2024, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1968). In <em>New York v. United States, </em>the Court emphasized that \u201c[u]sual governmental functions . . . are immune from federal taxation in order to safeguard the necessary independence of the state.\u201d 326 U.S. at 580, 66 S.Ct. at 313. It went on to note that \u201c[t]here are, of course, State activities and State-owned property that partake of uniqueness from the point of view of intergovernmental relations.\u201d Id. at 582, 66 S.Ct. at 314. It is doubtless true that the imposition of a burden upon a state by Congress in the exercise of its power under the commerce clause, even though the burden be onerous and unexpected, does not render the federal action invalid. See, e. g., <em>Maryland v. Wirtz, </em>supra; <em>New York v. United States, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra; <em>Parden v. Terminal Railway, </em>377 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1207, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). But it is yet true, as it was at the time of the first great exposition of the breadth of the commerce clause, that \u201c[although many of the powers, formerly exercised by the states, are transferred to the government of the Union, yet the state governments remain, and constitute the most important part of our system.\u201d <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>9 Wheat. 1, 197, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">And, while it may be true that some, or even many, of the attributes of state sovereignty have been diminished by the exercise by Congress of the broad rights accorded the nation under the commerce clause, it is equally true that if there is any attribute of sovereignty left to the states it is the right of their legislatures to pass, or not to pass, laws. As the Court stated in <em>In re Duncan, </em>139 U.S. 449, 11 S.Ct. 573, 35 L.Ed. 219 (1891):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">\u201cBy the constitution, a republican form of government is guaranteed to every state in the Union, and the distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration, and pass their own laws in virtue of the legislative power reposed in representative bodies . . ..\u201d 139 U.S. 449, 461, 11 S.Ct. 573, 577, 35 L.Ed. 219.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Not far afield is the rejection by the Philadelphia Convention of Charles Pink-ney\u2019s constitutional plan which would have enabled Congress to \u201crevise,\u201d \u201cnegative,\u201d or \u201cannul\u201d the laws of a state. See <em>Elliot\u2019s Debates </em>(Michie Ed., Vol. I, Book I, pp. 149, 400-01).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">If the national legislature may not revise, negative or annul a law of a state legislature, how an Act of Congress may be construed to permit an agency of the United States to direct a state legislature to legislate is difficult to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">We have found no appellate case save one, <em>Pennsylvania v. EPA, </em>500 F.2d 246 (3rd Cir. 1974), which may be construed as holding that the nation may direct the legislature of a state to act, for it is one thing to strike down a state law under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the supremacy clause, or to decide that a state which chooses to engage in activities which Congress has a right to control must do so on Congress\u2019 terms, or to hold that Congress may induce a state to act by offering favors or exacting financial penalties if it does not, but it is quite another thing to extract from a state a most fundamental attribute of its sovereignty. \u201cThe Court has ample power to prevent what the appellants purport to fear, \u2018the utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland v. Wirtz, </em>392 U.S. at p. 196, 88 S.Ct. at p. 2024.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We, therefore, do not consider the problem routine, or one which we should meet directly absent the most compelling circumstances. With the Fifth Circuit, we are of opinion the question is weighty. <em>Texas v. EPA, </em>499 F.2d 289, 320 (5th Cir. 1974). We are, of course, aware that in <em>Pennsylvania v. EPA, </em>500 F.2d 246 (3rd Cir. 1974), that court approved an EPA imposed plan with many of the features here claimed objectionable. But it is also true that the First Circuit in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, </em>478 F.2d 875 (1st Cir. 1973), described as \u201cdifficult to imagine . [the] sort of guarantee the current Rhode Island executive or legislature could give the E.P.A. to insure that adequate resources would be devoted to the Plan.\u201d Id. at 883-84. This was so \u201cgiven the mechanics of state-federal relations,\u201d id. at 883, and its opinion that while \u201c[s]uch assurances might have a symbolic effect; however, they would have little more, since a governor or even a present session of the legislature cannot make binding commitments on behalf of their successors, nor would such representations seem to be enforceable.\u201d Id. at 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Of equal significance is the recent decision of the Ninth Circuit in <em>Brown v. EPA, </em>521 F.2d 827 (9th Cir. 1975). There, the court was faced with similar EPA regulations directing the State of California to take certain affirmative actions to insure the attainment of ambient air quality standard. It, too, was of the opinion that in enacting the Clean Air Act, Congress did not intend \u201cto make the states departments of the Environmental Protection Agency no less obligated to obey its Administrator\u2019s command than ... its [subordinates].\u201d P. 835. Thus, it interpreted the Act accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">While not reaching the constitutional issues raised by the EPA\u2019s claimed authority, the court, nevertheless, felt compelled to suggest its general evaluation of these issues so as to \u201creveal the intensity of [their] desire to avoid confronting them.\u201d P. 837. In so doing, the court noted that acceptance of the broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause which the EPA urged was appropriate \u201cwould reduce the states to puppets of a ventriloquist Congress.\u201d Id. at 839. The court refused to attribute to Congress any such purpose unless it was expressed unequivocally. This, in its view, was not done in the Clean Air Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">And, also in point is our language in <em>Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, </em>477 F.2d 495 (4th Cir. 1973), where, in discussing the rejection of a state plan by the EPA under this statute, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">\u201c[I]f . . . [the Administrator] finds it [the plan] reasonably unlikely to achieve such results within fixed time-tables, whether for technological or economic reasons, or otherwise, he should reject the plan and return it to the state authorities with instructions to consider alternative procedures that might meet the statutory requirements as established by the Administrator.\u201d 477 F.2d 495, 506.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">So, far from believing the regulations are plainly valid, we are of opinion their constitutional validity is very doubtful at the very best, and refrain from ruling on their validity only because of two canons of construction which, in the exercise of proper restraint and constitutional limitations, courts should use in construing an Act of Congress. The first of these is that given a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>valid and invalid construction, courts should, when possible, construe the statute as valid. <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 383, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971). The second is that if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, and the other, a question of statutory construction or general law, the court should decide on the basis of the latter. <em>Ashwander v. TVA, </em>297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Justice Brandeis concurring); <em>Alma Motor Co. v. Timken Co., </em>329 U.S. 129, 136, 67 S.Ct. 231, 91 L.Ed. 128 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The statute itself in pertinent part provides that a state shall \u201csubmit . a plan\u201d to comply with the statutory mandate (and achieve the goals set out therein), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(l), and the Administrator shall \u201capprove or disapprove such plan,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2). To merit approval, the plan must contain the \u201cnecessary assurances that the State will have . . . authority to carry out such implementation plan.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(F). If an implementation plan submitted by a state is \u201cdetermined by the Administrator not to be in accordance with the requirements\u201d of the statute, the Administrator \u201cshall . . . promptly prepare and publish proposed regulations setting forth an implementation plan, or a portion thereof, for a State.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(c)(l). As is seen from the table appended hereto, part of the Maryland plan was approved and part was disapproved. So far as we are presently concerned, such disapproval was based on a lack of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Instead of referring the matter back to the state to \u201cconsider alternative procedures that might meet the statutory requirements,\u201d <em>Appalachian Power </em>at 506, the EPA imposed its own plan for Maryland. Assuming the EPA has the right to impose such a plan on Maryland under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(c)(l), having once found Maryland\u2019s proposal lacking in authority, we find nothing in the statute which authorizes the Administrator to direct the state to supply \u201clegal authority,\u201d or \u201cstatutory proposals\u201d or the like for the \u201cassurances\u201d offered to the Administrator. The statute in plain words authorizes the Administrator to \u201cprepare . . . regulations for a State;\u201d it does not empower him to direct a state to enact its own statutes and regulations as prescribed by the Administrator. In our opinion, the preparation of regulations for a state means regulations to be applied within the boundaries of a state if it does not act in a manner approved by the EPA. The fact that the EPA may prepare regulations for a state \u201cto consider\u201d, <em>Appalachian Power </em>at 506, implies no authority to order Maryland to legislate, \u201csubmit legally adopted regulations,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">The EPA argues that federal administration of the federal law will be \u201cinefficient and impractical\u201d, and that the same may be better administered by the states. Assuming this to be true, and assuming the debates of Congress cited by the Agency support this contention, and accepting the stated intent of the statute that the control of air pollution remains the primary responsibility of the state and local governments, we still find nothing in any of them which indicates the statute should be construed with such sweeping breadth as the government claims. We are of opinion that constitutional principles may not be violated for administrative expediency, <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>155 Va. 367, 379, 154 S.E. 579 (1930), and the acceptance or rejection of hordes of federal employees enforcing an EPA plan for Maryland, as argued by the EPA, unpalatable as that may be, is a political judgment entrusted by the Constitution to the Maryland General Assembly and the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">We acknowledge that the construction of a statute by the agency administering it is to be accorded great weight. See, e. g., <em>Social Security Board v. Nierotko, </em>327 U.S. 358, 368, 66 S.Ct. 637, 90 L.Ed. 718 (1946). But if the acts of the administering agency are not in accordance with law, its actions must be set aside. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>It should be noted that many forms of pressure on the states have been held not to violate those rights reserved by the Tenth Amendment, and none of them have been included in this statute. The alternative whip of economic pressure and seductive favor was approved in <em>Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, </em>301 U.S. 548, 57 S.Ct. 883, 81 L.Ed. 1279 (1937) (unemployment tax); <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Civil Service Comm\u2019n, </em>330 U.S. 127, 67 S.Ct. 544, 91 L.Ed. 794 (1937) (withholding of highway funds conditioned on removal of a member of the highway commission of state); <em>Vermont v. Brinegar, </em>379 F.Supp. 606 (D.Vt.1974) (highway funds withholding for non-compliance with Highway Beautification Act); and many other cases. Statutes are common which invite state regulation or administration in lieu of federal control, see 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671 et seq., on National Gas Pipeline Safety; or which withhold federal aid for failure to comply with federal standards, see P.L. 92-239, withholding federal approval of highway projects for states which have a speed limit of more than 55 m. p. h.; or making federal grants for state plans invoking federal standards, Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 et seq. And it should be noted, as did the Fifth Circuit in <em>Texas </em>v. <em>EPA </em>at 320, that no similar available administrative alternatives have been proposed by the EPA in this case. The EPA has simply construed the statute to suit its administrative convenience with a direction to Maryland to perform, leaving no alternative. Maryland could not, as Oklahoma did in <em>Oklahoma v. Civil Service Comm\u2019n, </em>330 U.S. 127, 143, 67 S.Ct. 544, 554, 91 L.Ed. 794 (1946), \u201cadopt the \u2018simple expedient\u2019 of not yielding.\u201d Moreover, the statute itself, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857h-5(b)(2), provides that Maryland must litigate now or forfeit the defense later.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Has Congress abandoned its time honored and constitutionally approved device of threat and promise? We think not. The statute here tells the States to devise implementation plans conforming to federal specifications or else the EPA will promulgate its own plan. The threat is a federally imposed regulation with federal administration; the promise is the invitation for Maryland to enact a suitable implementation plan and administer it with state employees, thus avoiding federal interference. Nothing in the statute presently brought to our attention should prevent the EPA from, for example, promulgating substantive regulations and inviting Maryland to administer them upon proper \u201cassurances\u201d by Maryland as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">But in the promulgation of its own plan, the EPA may not, under the statute, direct Maryland to act in the manner and form prescribed under these regulations. This would be construing the statute to have a breadth Congress never intended. Inviting Maryland to administer the regulations, and compelling her to do so under threat of injunctive and criminal sanctions, are two entirely different propositions. We are thus of the opinion, and so hold, that the EPA was without authority under the statute, as a matter of statutory construction, to require Maryland to establish the programs and furnish legal.authority for the administration thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\n<em>Conclusions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">From what has been said, it is apparent that we must decline to approve parts of the EPA plan for Maryland. The State of Maryland asserts without contradiction that as a result of the amendment to the statute providing for the clean car, the plan as presently devised will require 56% gasoline rationing by 1977. It requests, therefore, that the entire matter be reconsidered by the Agency. The economic and social consequences of such restrictions on a community of hundreds of thousands are impossible to predict and it would be an understatement to say they will be immense. The EPA apparently does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>especially oppose this approach, although nothing in its brief may be construed as acquiescence. But we must consider that Congress has set deadline dates for attainment of the statutory goals and those parts of the Maryland plan not reviewed are a beginning on a very complex problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In view of the advice we have received from the EPA that the Congressional amendment to the clean car program \u201chas a serious impact on the capability of the transportation control plans to attain ambient air quality standards by May 31, 1977,\u201d especially when coupled with the fact that catalytic converters may be discharging sulfuric acid emissions into the atmosphere, the EPA may wish to reconsider the entire program for Maryland. This, however, is a matter the Administrator should decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We will, then, set out specifically the regulations with respect to which we take action.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">40 CFR \u00a7 52.1105, employer provisions for mass transit priority incentives, is remanded to the EPA for action not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">40 CFR \u00a7 52.1111, management of parking supply, having been suspended indefinitely, with the right of review reserved, the petitions for review are dismissed from the active docket of this court, without prejudice, and with leave to reinstate the same for good cause shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">40 CFR \u00a7 52.1112, control and prohibition of photochemically reactive organic materials, the regulation having been rescinded, the petitions are dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">40 CFR \u00a7 52.1102, control of evaporation losses from vehicular tanks, this regulation is remanded to the Administrator for action not inconsistent with this opinion, although jurisdiction of the matter is retained. For purposes of further action by this court, the petition of <em>Bethlehem Steel, </em>in case No. 74 \u2014 1064, as it may concern 40 CFR \u00a7 52.1102, is consolidated with the petitions of <em>Texaco, </em>No. 74-1011, and <em>Gulf, </em>No. 74-1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">40 CFR \u00a7 52.1097, oxidation catalyst retrofit program for light and medium duty vehicles. Since EPA advises the regulation is being rescinded, the petition is dismissed as moot, without prejudice to reinstate the same or file another petition should we be mistakenly advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">40 CFR \u00a7 52.1095, inspection and maintenance program, 52.1096, vacuum spark advance disconnect retrofit program, 52.1098, light duty air/fuel control retrofit program, 52.1100, heavy duty air/fuel control retrofit program, and 52.1106, study and establishment of bike-ways program, are all set aside as contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">40 CFR \u00a7 52.1080, compliance schedule. In the prayer of the petition, Maryland asked for the first time to have this regulation set aside. The regulation covers a multitude of subjects from boilers to bus lanes and no attempt was made to enlighten us as to the specific defects claimed.
