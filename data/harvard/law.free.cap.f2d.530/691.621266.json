Churchill, Judge, U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b762-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">The defendants-appellees in this case are the Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Ohio, and a referee of that court. A disappointed litigant in a domestic relations case in the State court filed this suit against the judge and referee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, seeking $5,000 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in punitive damages. Additionally, she sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">District Judge Carl B. Rubin granted the motion of defendants to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">Mrs. Littleton, the plaintiff, appeared before the referee in the Common Pleas Court seeking to set aside a previous order which had awarded custody of her seventeen year old daughter to plaintiff\u2019s ex-husband. She was not represented by an attorney and insisted on serving as her own lawyer. The referee telephoned the Common Pleas Judge and asked for instructions as to whether he should permit Mrs. Littleton to serve as her own attorney. According to the averments of the complaint, the Common Pleas Judge first instructed the referee to permit plaintiff to proceed without counsel, then, having reconsidered his decision, directed that plaintiff must be represented by a lawyer. The referee refused to proceed with the case unless and until Mrs. Littleton arranged for counsel to represent her.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">Judge Rubin correctly held that this action is barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity and that both the Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and the referee are immune from suit under the facts averred in the complaint. <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 335, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1871); <em>Azar v.
