The facts in this case are in most respects identical to those in <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>530 F.2d 1156 (5th Cir. 1976). Williams and Bishop were both indicted for commission of the same bank robbery. Both were convicted in separate trials. While Bishop was apprehended in the back seat of the car in which the stolen money was found, Williams was arrested by a policeman after a short foot chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-16\">Williams asserts the following errors for reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-17\">(1) Ruling that the arrest was properly made upon \u201cclose pursuit;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-18\">(2) Failure to suppress evidence illegally obtained following defendant\u2019s wrongful arrest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-19\">(3) Allowing introduction of evidence illegally obtained following defendant\u2019s wrongful arrest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-20\">(4) Comment, upon viewing fingerprint evidence, that the court was \u201csatisfied;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-21\">(5) Failure- to grant a mistrial because of the unlawful presence of a jur- or in courtroom during proceedings when the-jury was excluded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-22\">(6) Allowing evidence that stolen money was found on defendant Williams in contradiction of a finding at the pretrial hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-23\">There being no reversible error in any of these contentions the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-24\">The first three issues, and their factual background, are identical to questions before the court in <em>Bishop. </em>On the basis of that opinion we here decide these issues adversely to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-25\">The trial judge\u2019s comment after examining the fingerprint evidence to the effect that he was \u201csatisfied\u201d does not rise to reversible error. Viewing the record in its entirety, the prejudicial effect of the comment, if any, appears, negligible and, in light of the evidence, could not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>see also United States v. Rhoden, </em>453 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>F.2d 598, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 947, 92 S.Ct. 2050, 32 L.Ed.2d 334 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">The momentary presence of a jur- or in the room during the testimony of a prospective witness was not prejudicial to the accused. The record reflects that the trial judge, through interrogation, satisfied himself that the juror did not hear the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">Williams, in a <em>pro se </em>brief filed in addition to the brief of appointed counsel, urges that it was reversible error to permit evidence at trial that bait money was found on his person, in direct contradiction to a finding at the preliminary hearing. The record reflects that the Government\u2019s witness at trial did not at any time intimate that the bills were found on the petitioner. The testimony of the witness was for the purpose of identifying the bait money and did not ascribe possession to either defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
