Some of these reports contain marginal notations made by the Regional Director and his staff during a meeting at which they discussed the charges. Kent contends that these documents with their notations, insofar as they constitute decisions by the Regional Director not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint, are disclosable under subsections (a)(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (a)(3)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the FOIA. The government contends that the materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>are protected from disclosure by Exemptions 5 and 7<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Act. After an <em>in camera </em>inspection, the District Court ordered disclosure. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">I. The Origins of the Documents in Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Many of the issues in this case are governed by a recent Supreme Court decision applying the FOIA to the Board. <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975) (hereinafter <em>Sears). </em>We thus find it apt to begin our discussion with background information quoted from that opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADE\">Under the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq., the process of adjudicating unfair labor practice cases begins with the filing by a private party of a \u201ccharge,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 153(d) and 160(b); 29 CFR \u00a7 101.2; <em>Auto Workers v. Scofield, </em>382 U.S. 205, 219, 86 S.Ct. 373, 382, 15 L.Ed.2d 272 [281]; <em>NLRB v. Indiana and Michigan Electric Co., </em>318 U.S. 9, 17-18, 63 S.Ct. 394, 399-400, 87 L.Ed. 579 [585]. Although Congress has designated the Board as the principal body which adjudicates the unfair labor practice case based on such charge, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160, the Board may adjudicate only upon the filing of a \u201ccomplaint\u201d; and Congress has delegated to the Office of General Counsel \u201cacting for the Board\u201d the unreviewable authority to determine whether a complaint shall be filed. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(d); <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 182, 87 S.Ct. 903, 912, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 [853]. In those cases in which he decides that a complaint shall issue, the General Counsel becomes an advocate before the Board in support of the complaint. In those cases in which he decides not to issue a complaint, no proceeding before the Board occurs at all. The practical effect of this administrative scheme is that a party believing himself the victim of an unfair labor practice can obtain neither adjudication nor remedy under the labor statute without first persuading the Office . of General Counsel that his claim is sufficiently meritorious to warrant Board consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-12\">In order to structure the considerable power which the administrative scheme gives him, the General Counsel has adopted certain procedures for processing unfair labor practice charges. Charges are filed in the first instance with one of the Board\u2019s 31 Regional Directors, to whom the General Counsel has delegated the initial power to decide whether or not to issue a complaint. 29 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 102.10, 101.8. A member of the staff of the Regional Office then conducts an investigation of the charge, which may include interviewing witnesses and reviewing documents. 29 CFR \u00a7 101.4. If, on the basis of the investigation, the Regional Director believes the charge has merit, a settlement will be attempted, or a complaint issued. If the charge has no merit in the Regional Director\u2019s judgment, the charging party will be so informed by letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>with a brief explanation of the reasons. 29 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 101.8, 102.15, 101.6, 102.19. In such a case, the charging party will also be informed of his right to appeal within 10 days to the Office of the General Counsel in Washington, D. C. 29 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 101.6, 102.19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">421 U.S. at 138-39, 95 S.Ct. at 1510-1511, 44 L.Ed.2d at 40-41 (footnote omitted). Thus when the Regional Director believes that the charging party\u2019s position does not merit the filing of a complaint, that determination is final, subject only to the limited possibilities for intervention by the General Counsel\u2019s office. Such intervention led to the writing of the documents at issue in Sears. In the present case, however, we are solely concerned with procedures at the Regional Offices, where nearly all cases are resolved without the participation of Washington officials.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">During the spring and summer of 1973, various unfair labor practice charges were filed with the Board\u2019s Tenth Regional Office in Atlanta against Kent. Some of the charges were filed by a labor organization and other charges by individual employees of Kent. Donald E. Howard, the Resident Officer in Birmingham, investigated the charges in three of the cases (Nos. 10-CA-10077, -10091, and -10099), interviewing witnesses and gathering documentary evidence. He then wrote a \u201cFinal Investigative Report\u201d summarizing the evidence and recommending disposition of the charges. The report was discussed at a meeting on May 30, attended by Howard; the Regional Director, Walter C. Phillips; and two Regional Office attorneys. As the participants discussed the report, section by section, Phillips gave oral directions as to which alleged violations should be pursued (with a view towards settlement or complaint) and which should be dropped (by inducing a withdrawal of the charge, or by dismissal). Howard, Phillips, and possibly the other attorneys made notes in the margins of their copies of the report. Phillips filed his copy away;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Howard gave his to Donald W. Davis, an attorney in the Birmingham office, who drafted a complaint based on some, though not all, of the charges that had been discussed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Before the complaint had been issued, an investigative report on another case (No. 10-CA-10179) was completed by a Board field examiner. Phillips decided that this charge had merit and directed that the cases should be consolidated. The ensuing complaint was issued on June 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Another charge was filed against Kent on July 11, and a similar sequence of events followed. Davis investigated and wrote a report on the allegations; he, Phillips, and other attorneys discussed it at an agenda committee meeting, where Phillips decided that some of the charges should be dismissed and other charges included in the complaint. Again both Davis and Phillips made notes on their copies of the investigative reports to reflect the decisions. Davis wrote a \u201cpartial dismissal letter\u201d to the charging party, explaining why some of the allegations would not become the subjects of a complaint. At the same time, using his marked copy of the report, he drafted a complaint based on the remaining allegations. This complaint, consolidated with the previous one, was issued on August 22 and became the basis for subsequent litigation, culminating in <em>NLRB v. Kent Corp., </em>slip opin. p. 2764, 530 F.2d 610 (C.A.5, 1976), a companion case to this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">During the pendency of the unfair labor practice litigation, on September 24, 1973, Kent sent the Board a written request for documents, invoking the FOIA. Seven categories of records were requested, including the materials now in issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Upon receiving no response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the request, Kent filed suit in District Court on November 16, and moved for a preliminary injunction three days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In support of its motion, Kent set forth its reasons for wanting access to the materials. It alleged that the unfair labor practice investigation had pointed up</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">arbitrariness and abuse of discretion on the part of Board agents. There were a number of individuals named in the unfair labor practice complaint as having been improperly discriminated against by plaintiff, on facts no different from numerous other individuals who were eliminated from the complaint by amendment or withdrawal approved by the Board. Plaintiff needs the documents ... in order to determine the rational basis, if any, for selecting those individuals as to whom complaint was issued, since even after the hearing no discernible basis therefor exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Kent also claimed that \u201cthe investigation of the unfair labor practices was tainted by hostility [against Kent\u2019s president and its counsel], race prejudice, coercion or undue influence on witnesses, and entrapment.\u201d Kent hoped the documents would confirm the attitudes lying behind these alleged indications of improper conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-16\">The District Court granted the preliminary injunction. Subsequently, on February 27, 1974, it denied the government\u2019s motion to vacate and directed the defendants to produce \u201cthose parts of the investigation reports and the marginal notes which constitute the final decisions to prosecute or not to prosecute.\u201d Defendants appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-17\">II. The FOIA \u2014 General Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b687-18\">The Freedom of Information Act has been discussed by this court several times before.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Act \u201cestablish[es] a general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.\u201d S.Rep.No.813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1965). Thus, all federal agency records are prima facie disclosable to any member of the public who requests and \u201creasonably describes\u201d them. \u00a7 552(a)(3).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the materials are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>among those described by subsection (a)(2), including \u201cfinal opinions . made in the adjudication of cases\u201d and \u201cinstructions to staff that affect a member of the public,\u201d the agency has an additional duty: it must not only release the documents to the public, but also maintain and make available current indexes listing those materials. The agency can escape these responsibilities only if it sustains the burden of showing that the documents fall within one or more of the exemptions in subsection (b). Two such exemptions, those pertaining to in-tra-agency memoranda (Exemption 5)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and investigatory records (Exemption 7),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> are said to apply in this case. .</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><em>Sears </em>is the preeminent precedent applying this Act to the NLRB. The plaintiff sought memoranda which the General Counsel had issued to the Regional Offices. These memoranda told Regional Directors how to dispose of certain cases and expressed reasons to justify those outcomes. The Supreme Court stated that Exemption 5 embodies at least two common-law privileges for government memoranda. First, it preserves in the FOIA context the \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d protecting predecisional communications, because \u201c \u2018frank discussion of legal and policy matters\u2019 in writing might be inhibited if the discussion were made public; and . . . the \u2018decisions\u2019 and \u2018policies formulated\u2019 would be the poorer as a result.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, Exemption 5 preserves the attorney work product privilege announced in <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947). Accordingly, the Court held that memoranda of the General Counsel directing the filing of a complaint were exempt from disclosure, since they were work products, and, in any event, did not inform the public about agency law (since an adjudication of the charge was still to come). On the other hand, the Court held that \u201cfinal opinions . . . made in the adjudication of cases,\u201d \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A), are never within Exemption 5. The Court pointed out that the FOIA executive privilege had generally been deemed inapplicable to post-decisional documents such as \u201cfinal opinions\u201d, since disclosure of communications made after a decision can hardly injure that decision, and also because the public is vitally interested in knowing the reasons for agency policy. The category of \u201cfinal opinions,\u201d according to the Court, included memoranda by the General Counsel which explained decisions <em>not </em>to file a complaint. The Court said that such a memorandum accomplishes \u201cas \u2018final\u2019 a \u2018disposition\u2019 as an administrative decision can- \u2014 representing, as it does, an unreviewable rejection of the charge filed by the private party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">Kent now concedes, in light of <em>Sears, </em>that the District Court\u2019s order can no longer be sustained insofar as it required release of the Regional Director\u2019s decisions that a complaint should issue. But Kent vigorously maintains that under <em>Sears </em>the Regional Director\u2019s decisions <em>not </em>to issue a complaint are disclosable \u201cfinal opinions.\u201d Thus, the questions before us are whether the investigative reports with their markings, or any portion thereof, are \u201cfinal opinions,\u201d and, if not, whether they should be deemed outside of Exemption 5 for any other reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">III. \u201cFinal Opinions\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">We look first at the language of subsection (a)(2). Defendants do not deny that the Regional Office is an \u201cagency\u201d of the United States;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> nor can they plausibly maintain, after <em>Sears, </em>that the Regional Director\u2019s decisions were not reached in the \u201cadjudication\u201d of \u201ccases.\u201d See 421 U.S. at 158-59, 95 S.Ct. at 1520, 44 L.Ed.2d at 51-52. We also believe that these decisions possess the \u201cfinality\u201d demanded by subsection (a)(2)(A), notwithstanding the charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>party\u2019s right to appeal a dismissal to the General Counsel\u2019s office in Washington. Paraphrasing apt language from <em>Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 158-59 n. 25, 95 S.Ct. at 1520, 44 L.Ed.2d at 52 n. 25: \u201c[T]he possibility that the decision reached\u201d by the Regional Director \u201cmay be overturned in an Appeals Memorandum does not affect its finality for our purposes. The decision . ., in the absence of an appeal filed by the charging party, has real operative effect, as much as does every order issued by a United States District Court which might, if appealed, be overturned by a United States Court of Appeals.\u201d The Regional Director, like the General Counsel in <em>Sears, </em>has power to make a final disposition of a claim by dismissing it. This is effective law-making power, and the thrust of subsection (a)(2) is toward allowing the public to know what \u201cthe law\u201d is.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Despite these considerations, Kent\u2019s argument has a fatal flaw: the materials at issue in this case are not \u201copinions.\u201d We are guided in this regard by <em>Renegotiation Board v. Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp., </em>421 U.S. 168, 95 S.Ct. 1491, 44 L.Ed.2d 57 (1975), a companion case to <em>Sears. </em>In <em>Grumman </em>the plaintiff sought, <em>inter alia, </em>reports prepared by \u201cDivisions\u201d or subcommittees composed of three of the Renegotiation Board\u2019s five members. The full Board used these reports as a springboard for discussion in the course of deciding whether to require contractors to refund \u201cexcessive profits\u201d to the government. The Court held that these division reports were not to be treated as final opinions of the Board. For, after discussing a written memorandum\u2019s rationale, the Board might act for an entirely different reason; indeed, the individual author of the report might change his viewpoint after discussion and accept arguments quite different from the (possibly quite tentative) ideas he had expressed in writing. Echoing the philosophy of Exemption 5, the Court declared itself \u201cunwilling to deprive the Board of a thoroughly uninhibited version of this valuable deliberative tool.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">In the present case no document in controversy purports to explain why the Regional Director decided not to issue a complaint in the various instances. The \u201cFinal Investigation Reports\u201d as originally written do not do so. They express the tentative views of the Birmingham attorneys who wrote them. They state reasons that could account for Regional Director Phillips\u2019 decisions, but there is no assurance that Phillips accepted those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>reasons. They are precisely the sort of predecisional documents that <em>Sears </em>identifies as the intra-agency memoranda mentioned in the FOIA. As we held in <em>Wu v. National Endowment for Humanities, </em>460 F.2d 1030, 1032 (C.A.5, 1972), \u201cadvice, recommendations, opinions, and other subjective material are protected\u201d by Exemption 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The further question is whether the presence of the notations made in the margins of these reports changes anything. Of course, disclosure of the notations by themselves would be a futile endeavor, even assuming they are not exempt; apart from their context, they are gibberish. We understand Kent to argue, however, that the whole is greater than its parts \u2014 that these reports and their marginal annotations <em>together </em>(perhaps with the latter \u201cincorporating by reference\u201d the former) are \u201cfinal opinions.\u201d We think they are not. From our <em>in camera </em>inspection of the documents, we can say that these ambiguous scribbles do not clearly show the basis of the decisions in question. But even if these markings were both coherent and lucid, the case could come out no differently. There would be no assurance that they represented the institutional view of the Regional Office. Even Phillips\u2019 own copies of the reports might, for all we could tell, be inscribed with only some of the reasons behind his choice. And some of the points to be found in the margins might be tentative conclusions, put on paper only while he was on the way to making up his mind. <em>A for-tiori, </em>we could depend on Davis\u2019 and Howard\u2019s copies of the reports to reveal only part of \u201cthe decision,\u201d not necessarily all of it. The copies would not\u2014 could not \u2014 show the extent (if any) to which the Regional Director conveyed his views by oral statements that were never recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Under the District Court\u2019s order the agency would have had to comb through the reports and pick out those sentences or paragraphs which represented the ultimate basis of its actions; to articulate its reasoning more coherently and logically than the reports, and later the handwritten notes, themselves did; in short, to <em>create </em>a final opinion. But \u201c[t]he Freedom of Information Act imposes no independent obligation on agencies to write opinions. It simply requires them to disclose the opinions which they do write.\u201d <em>Grumman, </em>421 U.S. at 192, 95 S.Ct. at 1504, 44 L.Ed.2d at 75.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">The policies that Exemption 5 was meant to foster are illustrated, ironically, by Kent\u2019s own motives for seeking these documents. Kent claims that it needs access to the reports in order to determine whether Board personnel are hostile and prejudiced against its cause. Thus in the unfair labor practice litigation Kent is trying to probe the mental processes and motives of the individual decision-maker, rather than to question the objective legal validity of the institutional decision. In the circumstances of this case,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> this effort is inconsistent with a basic principle of administrative law. The Supreme Court announced the general bar against probing mental processes in the <em>Morgan </em>cases,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and decisions of this Circuit have held it appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>cable to NLRB prosecutorial processes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The point is significant in construing Exemption 5,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which was enacted to free decision-makers from the \u201cthreat of cross-examination in a public tribunal,\u201d <em>Ackerley v. Ley, </em>137 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 420 F.2d 1336, 1341 (1969); see <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). In view of Kent\u2019s position, it is hardly speculative to say that decision-makers would be exposed to just such threats if intra-agency advice memoranda were generally held dis-closable whenever they could arguably be viewed as \u201cfinal opinions.\u201d \u201cA court which does not consider probing mental processes part of its reviewing task will hardly read [Exemption 5\u2019s] language as requiring disclosure of documents for solely that purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We also cannot overlook the fact that one of the Regional Director\u2019s decisions not to issue a complaint was indeed expressed in an opinion. In Case No. 10-CA-10272 the charging party (the Boilermakers\u2019 Union) declined to withdraw the allegations that the Regional Director had disapproved. Consequently a letter of dismissal was issued, formally notifying the union that certain charges would not be pursued and explaining reasons for the decision. It was drafted by Howard and signed by the then Acting Regional Director. Here was a document that was truly post-decisional and did enunciate a basis for the agency\u2019s conclusion. Had an appeal been taken to Washington, this letter would have expressed to the General Counsel the Regional Office\u2019s view of the matter. When laid against this opinion, the marked-up investigation reports appear all the more clearly to be \u201cpredecisional.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">IV. \u201cInstructions to Staff\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">We turn briefly to the question of whether these documents are made dis-closable by subsection (a)(2)(C), under which agencies must release and index \u201cadministrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On a first reading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the statute it might be quite tempting to describe the Birmingham attorneys\u2019 handwritten records of Phillips\u2019 directions as \u201cinstructions to staff.\u201d Moreover, in <em>Stokes v. Brennan, </em>476 F.2d 699 (C.A.5, 1973), this court adopted a broad reading of subsection (a)(2)(C). We noted from the legislative history that Congress had added the adjective \u201cadministrative\u201d in order to limit the scope of this provision, but that only \u201c \u2018information which, if known to the public, would <em>significantly impede </em>the enforcement process\u2019 \u201d was thereby excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">However, we need not decide whether the materials in controversy fall within this subsection. As previously suggested and as further discussed below, these reports are the kind of memo-randa covered by Exemption 5; and, in any collision between the two provisions, subsection (a)(2)(C) must yield, because the Act \u201cdoes not apply\u201d to exempted material. \u00a7 552(b); <em>Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 154 n. 21, 95 S.Ct. at 1518, 44 L.Ed.2d at 49 n. 21. Thus we can narrow our consideration to the question of whether \u201cinstructions to staff\u201d automatically fall outside of Exemption 5. Such an interpretation might be suggested by the following language from <em>Sears: </em>\u201cWe should be reluctant ... to construe Exemption 5 to apply to the documents described in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2); and with respect at least to \u2018final opinions\u2019 ... we hold that Exemption 5 can never apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Several factors prompt us to hold that, unlike the situation with final opinions, a document\u2019s status as \u201cinstructions to staff\u201d under subsection (a)(2)(C) does not determine whether the document is within Exemption 5. First, despite its expressed \u201creluctance,\u201d the Supreme Court implicitly held in <em>Sears </em>that there is some overlap between the two statutory provisions: for it found that the work-product privilege brought certain memoranda into the exemption \u201cwhether or not\u201d those memoranda were also \u201cinstructions to staff.\u201d Second, the conclusion we reach is consistent with our analysis in <em>Stokes, </em>where we treated subsections (a)(2)(C) and (b)(5) as raising entirely different technical issues. Third, a different conclusion would undercut the fifth exemption. \u201cPredeci-sional\u201d processes will quite regularly involve instructions to staff in the literal sense \u2014 if only an \u201cinstruction\u201d to prepare a formal expression of the agency\u2019s views \u2014 and yet disclosure of those instructions would obviously tend to impinge on the deliberative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">V. \u201cAvailable by Law in Litigation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Thus far we have expressed the view that these documents are not within subsection (a)(2); in operational terms we have concluded that the Regional Office\u2019s \u201cfinal investigation reports,\u201d with or without marginal notes, do not have to be indexed. We next consider whether, and how far, Exemption 5 shields these records from the purview of the general disclosure provision, subsection (a)(3). As we have already made clear, the reports contain analyses and recommendations that are protected by the executive privilege within Exemption 5. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the reports may be withheld in their entirety. We must determine whether they contain any \u201creasonably segregable portion\u201d that is not within any exemption. \u00a7 552(b). And it is now established that the executive privilege does not protect \u201cpurely factual material appearing in [requested] documents in a form that is severable without compromising the private remainder of the documents.\u201d <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 91, 93 S.Ct. 827, 838, 35 L.Ed.2d 119, 134 (1973). If only executive privilege were claimed, it might be necessary to remand the cause for dissection and partial release of the reports.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">But the Board\u2019s contentions are broader. We must \u201cconstrue Exemption 5 to exempt those documents, and only those documents, normally privileged in the civil discovery context,\u201d <em>Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 149, 95 S.Ct. at 1515, 44 L.Ed.2d at 46, and the Board relies on three distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>privileges here: the executive privilege, the attorney work product privilege, and (apparently) the so-called informer\u2019s privilege.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We can dispose of the problem at hand by applying the work product privilege alone. Apart from the Supreme Court\u2019s cautious discussion in <em>Sears, </em>this is a rather unexplored corner of FOIA law, and it is therefore necessary to deal with some basics. The fundamental principles, of course, come from <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947), where the Court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">In performing his various duties, it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel. . Were [work product] materials open to opposing counsel on mere demand, much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten. An attorney\u2019s thoughts, heretofore inviolate, would not be his own. Inefficiency, unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial. The effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing. And the interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">329 U.S. at 510-11, 67 S.Ct. at 393-394, 91 L.Ed. at 462. More concisely we have said that the rule is \u201cbased on the public policy of preserving the independence of lawyers through the avoidance of unwarranted intrusion into their private files and mental processes.\u201d <em>Southern Ry. </em>v. <em>Lanham, </em>403 F.2d 119, 126 (C.A.5, 1968). And \u201c \u2018since the litigants before the Labor Board are legion, the evil of harassment * * * is correspondingly multiplied. The function of deciding controversies might soon be overwhelmed by the duty of answering questions about them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Braswell Motor Freight Lines, Inc., </em>363 F.2d 600, 604 (C.A.5, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Of course, the fact that an agency document was written by a lawyer does not necessarily make it \u201cwork product.\u201d The executive branch of our government employs an uncountable and ever-growing number of attorneys, and the Act can hardly be understood as protecting everything they put on paper. In the federal courts the privilege may be invoked only for materials \u201cprepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3). This is a phrase that must be interpreted with caution, and the case law affords relatively little guidance.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> To say that the investigation reports in this case were prepared in anticipation of litigation is not without difficulties, because they were written at the very outset of the Regional Office\u2019s involvement in the case, before there had been any authoritative determination that the charges had substance. But there are weighty considerations on the other side. Where unfair labor practices are concerned, the Regional Office\u2019s basic function is to litigate. Moreover, Davis and Howard could not have known when they wrote their reports which cases Phillips would want dismissed. Their written evaluations of the evidence necessarily were founded on the assumption that any given charge <em>might </em>become enmeshed in litigation. Insofar as the privilege is meant to promote candid expressions of an attorney\u2019s theories and perspectives, it cannot properly be made to turn on whether litigation actually ensued.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Since \u201cthe prospect of litigation [was] identifiable because of specific claims that [had] already arisen,\u201d <em>Stix </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>Prods., Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Mfrs., Inc., 47 </em>F.R.D. 334 (S.D.N.Y.1969), the reports are subject to a prima facie valid claim of privilege. These documents are quite different from the memoranda which were held disclosable (and thus, by implication, not work products) in <em>Sears, </em>because the latter were not composed until after an authoritative decision to dismiss had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">In an ordinary civil suit we would next go on to consider whether the claim was outweighed by the opposing litigant\u2019s evidentiary needs,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> but in an FOIA suit the plaintiff\u2019s needs cannot be considered, since all members of the public have equal rights under the Act.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Instead the question is whether any reasonably segregable portion of the documents remains after the parts protected by work-product policies are determined. In our view, even the factual matters in these reports (which might not be protected by executive privilege) are protected by the work-product privilege. Writing in contemplation of forthcoming unfair labor practice litigation, an attorney must be able not only to discuss doctrinal theories but also to \u201cassemble information, [and] sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts\u201d without feeling that he is working for his adversary at the same time. <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. at 511, 67 S.Ct. at 393, 91 L.Ed. at 462. The feeling would be well justified if we allowed the FOIA to be used to force disclosure of such materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">This case is a particularly strong one for recognizing the privilege. The contents of the reports are not primary information, such as verbatim witness testimony or objective data, but rather are mainly reports on how the Birmingham attorneys appraised the evidence they found. Thus the reports consist largely of \u201cmental impressions, conclusions, opinions, [and] legal theories\u201d within the meaning of the Federal Rule. Such materials, if prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial, are always protected by a properly-raised claim of work product privilege, regardless of the opposing litigant\u2019s need.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">We do not hold that the \u201cFinal Investigation Reports\u201d of NLRB Regional Offices are always wholly within the attorney work-product privilege. In a closer case the District Court might be obliged to consider, possibly through <em>in camera </em>proceedings or the taking of extrinsic evidence,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> whether any portions of the records could be disclosed without offending work-product rule policies.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> But our examination of these documents convinces us that they are protected in their entirety by Exemption 5. Thus we have no occasion to pass on the government\u2019s alternative contention that the reports are within Exemption 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-12\">.

The Court\u2019s example of such deference was the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standards by which Courts of Appeals review certain District Court conclusions. The record before us does not indicate that a Regional Director\u2019s dismissal of a complaint carries any formal weight with the Appeals Branch. Yet we do not read <em>Grumman </em>as saying that the acid test of finality is whether a decision carries legal weight on appeal. There are many District Court conclusions which Courts of Appeals are bound to reconsider de novo. Moreover, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that as a practical matter the General Counsel\u2019s Office does tend to accept the judgments of Regional Directors. The General Counsel told a House subcommittee in 1961:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-12\">\u201cThe Committee should bear in mind in this connection that the percentage of reversals (on the average about 6%) will necessarily be small since all of the cases on appeal have been subjected to careful evaluation at the Regional Office level by top-echelon field personnel, the great majority of whom have had long years of experience and proven integrity and ability, [which] provides a firm guarantee that the decision in every appeals case is made on the basis of a careful <em>de novo </em>evaluation and review [below] of the evidence disclosed by the field examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFCv\">CCH Lab.L.Rep. \u00b6 1150.05 at 3083.
