The counterclaim was dismissed, the jury awarded Mrs. Keith $5,218.45 and rendered a verdict for defendant on Richard Keith\u2019s claim. On June 12, 1975, after judgment was entered on the verdict, plaintiff Esther Keith moved for a new trial on the ground <em>inter alia </em>that the damages awarded were insufficient. On July 1, 1975, an appeal was filed by Newcourt, Inc. from the dismissal of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim against Richard K. Keith. The docket entries of the district court reflect that on July 3, 1975, the trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for new trial against Newcourt, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-24\">On the basis of the above record this court lacks jurisdiction to review the judgment appealed from. At the time that the notice of appeal was filed, a motion for new trial was pending and was subsequently granted. Under these circumstances, the judgment of the district court is not final without certification from the district court pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 54(b). <em>See Sargent v. Johnson, </em>521 F.2d 1260 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-25\">Furthermore, it is clear until the motion for new trial is ruled upon, a judgment is not final and any appeal therefrom is subject to dismissal as premature. <em>See Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co., </em>318 U.S. 203, 205, 63 S.Ct. 543, 544, 87 L.Ed. 714, 716 (1943); <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>392 F.2d 735, 738 n. 1 (8th Cir. 1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-26\">The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-19\">. Since a new trial was granted there exists no certainty that plaintiff will recover on the second trial, rendering the defendant\u2019s need for contribution speculative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
