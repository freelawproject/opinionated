The Commission remanded the proceeding to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) for a determination of what would constitute a \u201cproper allocation of services and facilities benefits to stevedores in order to arrive at a charge that can be properly assessed against the stevedores\u201d (J.A. 75). Commissioners Barrett and Morse dissented on the ground that Cargill\u2019s allocation to the stevedores was sufficiently related to benefits to pass muster under \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-18\">In No. 75-1018, Cargill, Inc., the terminal operator, maintains that its service and facility charge is reasonably related to the benefits provided to stevedores; that the Commission applied a public utility ratemaking standard rather than the less exacting reasonableness standard appropriate under \u00a7 17; and that the Commission\u2019s order suspending the 8-cents charge pending further hearing before the ALJ is, in effect, an interlocutory injunction beyond its statutory power. In No. 75-1108, Baton Rouge Marine Contractors, Inc. (Barma), a corporation comprised of four stevedores, argues that Cargill\u2019s charge violates \u00a7 15 of the Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 814,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because it is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>modification, without requisite specific FMC approval, of Cargill\u2019s underlying Commission-approved lease agreement with the Greater Baton Rouge Port Commission (Port); and violates \u00a7 16 of the Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 815,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because it creates illegal preferences and privileges for Cargill through the use of Cargill\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Rogers Terminal and Shipping Corporation (Rogers), in competition with Barma at the Baton Rouge facility. The Department of Justice (Antitrust Division), representing the United States as statutory respondent, agrees with the Commission that Barma has not proven a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 15 or 16, but disputes the Commission\u2019s intimation that it would approve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>under \u00a7 17 an allocation of the charges to the stevedore going beyond express contract, custom, or actual use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">We affirm the Commission on all counts. Cargill\u2019s charge, while unprecedented at Baton Rouge, comes within the broad authority conferred by its Commission-approved lease with the Port and does not require specific approval under \u00a7 15. We reject Barma\u2019s claim of a <em>per se </em>violation of \u00a7 16 premised only on the fact that Cargill also does business with its wholly-owned stevedore Rogers, in the absence of proof of discriminatory practices. Finally, we find that the Commission acted within its mandate under \u00a7 17; that its approach here in disapproving certain allocations to the stevedore is not arbitrary or capricious; and that its order does not prevent an interim levy by Cargill pending further determination of what may properly be assessed against the stevedore. We decline to consider the Justice Department\u2019s contention because it was neither raised before the Commission nor advanced by Barma in its petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">By a lease agreement, the Port granted Cargill, as lessee, \u201cthe exclusive right to operate hereunder a public grain elevator within the Port Area.\u201d The Car-gill facility opened in September, 1955, and Barma has stevedored vessels there from its inception. In March, 1957, the Port and Cargill amended the lease agreement so as to authorize Cargill to provide stevedoring services and \u201cto condition the loading or unloading of a vessel upon the requirement that Cargill\u2019s integrated stevedoring service be used by such vessels.\u201d The Commission\u2019s predecessor agency, the Federal Maritime Board, approved the basic lease, but disapproved the exclusive stevedoring amendment under \u00a7 15 and as an \u201cunreasonable practice\u201d under \u00a7 17, <em>Agreements Nos. 8225 and 8225-1, </em>5 F.M.B. 648, 655-56 (1959). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, <em>Greater Baton Rouge Port Commission v. United States, </em>287 F.2d 86 (5th Cir. 1961), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>293 F.2d 959, <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 985, 82 S.Ct. 600, 7 L.Ed.2d 523 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-10\">As to the dispute in question, on February 4, 1971, Cargill informed Barma and all other stevedores using its Baton Rouge facility that charges would be imposed for use of services and facilities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Several days later, Cargill demanded that the stevedores sign an agreement requiring payment of 5-cents per ton of grain handled by Cargill and $50.00 per vessel to defray the cost of cleaning the dock (J.A. 313).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since Cargill indicated it would not deliver grain to a vessel employing a nonsigning stevedore, Bar-ma signed \u201cunder protest and with full reservation of its rights\u201d (J.A. 319-20). Informed by Barma of the stevedore charges, the General Counsel of the Port wrote to Cargill asking that they be postponed until their legality could be determined (J.A. 303). The Port, however, made no formal complaint and did not participate in the FMC proceeding. On March 29, 1971, Barma filed a complaint with the Commission resulting in the administrative actions under review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">II. Section 15</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-12\">Barma claims that the action by Car-gill represents a wholly novel and unanticipated practice that constitutes a modification of its agreement with the Port of Baton Rouge, and hence under \u00a7 15 is not effective until approved by FMC. FMC\u2019s ruling rejecting this claim has two aspects: (1) that the lease to Cargill gave it a broad authority which em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>braces such a practice even though it was not specifically foreseen; and (2) that Cargill\u2019s exercise of what it understood to be its authority under the lease \u2014 even if it was wrong \u2014 was a unilateral action, and not an \u201cagreement\u201d requiring FMC approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">We reject the FMC\u2019s alternative ground, that Cargill\u2019s action was a unilateral undertaking and not an \u201cagreement\u201d subject to \u00a7 15, for this might open the door to evasion of \u00a7 15, through unilateral actions by one party to an agreement and failure to protest by the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, we agree with the FMC that the lease between the Port and Cargill can fairly be read to authorize the terminal operator to seek a return on his capital improvements by levying charges against those parties reaping the benefit of his equipment. There is room for deference to the agency on the interpretation of industry agreements<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 though, of course, less than is due for findings of fact. The language of the lease is broad enough to give Cargill the same charging authority in this respect as any operator of such a terminal \u2014 subject, of course, to FMC regulatory authority, and subject to the requirement that the charges be competitive (and not cause a loss of business to any other port).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The FMC approved the agreement by which the Port gave the lessee this operating authority \u2014 and thenceforth the lessee made individual decisions like any other operator within the bounds of the lease. This is not a case of a fundamental change in rate-making methodology that gives a whole new competitive direction to ratemaking authority. Contrast <em>Pacific Westbound Conference v. FMC, </em>440 F.2d 1303 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 881, 92 S.Ct. 202, 30 L.Ed.2d 162 (1971) (\u00a7 15 approval required for agreement between two ratemaking conferences conferring mutual veto power over certain rates).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">Barma argues that Cargill and the FMC are barred from relitigating the issue whether the underlying lease agreement governs the relationships between Cargill and stevedores because the Fifth Circuit answered this in the negative in <em>Greater Baton Rouge Port Commission v. United States, supra. </em>There is no merit to this res judicata argument. The issue determined by the Fifth Circuit was whether Cargill\u2019s lease with the Port and an attempted amendment to establish an <em>exclusive </em>stevedoring arrangement were subject to \u00a7 15; Car-gill\u2019s rate-making power under the lease as to stevedores was simply not at issue. The language quoted by Barma to the effect that the amendment broadened the lease to reach stevedores <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>viewed in the context of what was actually decided; an exclusive stevedoring arrangement would indeed have entailed a modification of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">III. Section 16</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">Barma claims that Cargill\u2019s charges against it are a <em>per se </em>violation of \u00a7 16 because Cargill employs its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rogers, as a competing stevedore. This was properly rejected by the Commission, which reasoned that as long as Cargill\u2019s terminal is open to all stevedores and its charges are imposed equally against all stevedores (including its subsidiary) there is no \u201cunreasonable preference or practice\u201d under \u00a7 16. Barma has made no showing that Cargill\u2019s charges have in fact harmed its competitive position vis-a-vis Rogers, although Barma may have suffered some decline in profits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While, as the Commission noted, the situation in this case \u201ccould give rise to discriminatory practices\u201d (J.A. 69), the record simply does not support Barma\u2019s apprehension that Cargill intends by predatory practices to drive it out of the Baton Rouge Port.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">IV. Section 17</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">Regarding its authority under \u00a7 17 as extending to the \u201cpractices\u201d by a terminal operator of levying charges against stevedores for services rendered by its grain elevator, the Commission found Cargill\u2019s 8-cents charge against Barma an \u201cunreasonable practice\u201d to the extent it relied on certain improper allocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">It is true, as Cargill notes, that the FMC\u2019s scope of scrutiny under \u00a7 17 is somewhat narrower than with respect to common carriers by water in domestic and foreign commerce. But under <em>Volkswagenwerk v. FMC, </em>390 U.S. 261, 88 S.Ct. 929, 19 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1968), the agency\u2019s ambit of inquiry is nonetheless substantial. The Supreme Court specifically held that \u201ceven though the benefits received are clearly substantial,\u201d the \u201cproper inquiry under \u00a7 17 is, in a word, whether the charge levied is reasonably related to the service rendered.\u201d 390 U.S. at 282, 88 S.Ct. at 941. <em>See California v. United States, </em>320 U.S. 577, 584-85, 64 S.Ct. 352, 88 L.Ed. 322 (1944). That was the inquiry undertaken by the Commission in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">One can make the economic argument that there is no difference in the long run whether the cost of the grain elevator is charged to the stevedore rather than the vessel, because the charges will be passed on to the party, usually the vessel, employing the stevedore to load and trim the vessel. In the long run, the stevedore\u2019s charge will be borne by the ultimate beneficiary of the services, the consumer, regardless of whether the stevedore is employed by and paid in the first instance by the vessel or shipper. But at least in the short run, different consequences will attach to differences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>in the immediate incidence of the charges, depending on the documents negotiated and entered into by the parties prior to the imposition of the new charges. Moreover, the separation out and identification of the various charges may have a kind of psychological spillover effect on the behavior of the various parties, which the Commission can properly take into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\">The Commission has taken the position, first stated in <em>Pacific Northwest Tidewater Elevators Ass\u2019n, </em>11 F.M.C. 369, 388 (1968), that the contractual division of responsibility between the buyer and seller of grain does not control the proper allocation of terminal costs, and that those costs should be distributed, to the extent possible, in accordance with \u201cactual use.\u201d This analysis, however primitive as a matter of economic theory, is in our view a reasonable interpretation of the Commission\u2019s mandate under \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">Here the Commission has ruled that while the grain terminal is rendering services to the stevedore, it is an \u201cunreasonable practice\u201d under \u00a7 17 to assess stevedores to the extent of 50% of the cost of the shipping gallery,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 100% of the costs of the grain dock and wharf, $50 per vessel for dock clean-up, and $25,000 per year for liaison service, because these charges do not reasonably relate to services now rendered to the stevedore based on actual use. The Commission reasons that to the extent benefits of increased efficiency are conferred by the grain terminal beyond actual use by stevedores, the attendant costs are properly assessable against the immediate beneficiaries: the vessel, which can make more trips because of the vastly shortened loading time, and the shipper, who can have his grain loaded at greatly decreased cost per ton (J.A. 72).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-10\">Cargill says there is no evidence of such benefits to the vessel or shipper, and that the only testimony is that of its expert, Philip E. Linnekin. There are two answers to this: (1) The cross-examination of Linnekin brought out that he had not really made a quantitative determination of benefits to the stevedore, and that he was in a sense relying on his general experience and economic theory (J.A. 215-16). (2) The matter is one of judgment in determining benefits under the so-called Freas Formula, really an approach based on fairness and benefits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The FMC has expertise and familiarity with the concepts, and so long as it gives its reasons and the basis of its approach, the FMC is not to be faulted because it did not put on an expert to make a recital of its approach in the form of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-11\">Here Cargill did not file a petition for reconsideration, or offer a witness to testify that the FMC\u2019s approach was unreasonable. While Cargill expert Linnekin testified as to how <em>he </em>would recommend an allocation, as a matter of his \u201cjudgment\u201d (J.A. 364), he did not say that this was the only allocation permissible under pertinent principles of regulatory economics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-12\">The court does have a supervisory role \u2014 to assure that the agency does not embark on a course that is arbitrary or capricious. We have no warrant for condemning the FMC\u2019s approach here as unreasonable or arbitrary. The ultimate questions involve judgment, and we cannot say that FMC\u2019s approach is without rationality, although were the decision ours we might slice the pie differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-13\">Admittedly Cargill finds little solace in being able to assess the shipper because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>Cargill is the shipper here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, the Commission can insist on a proper allocation among the benefited parties, disregarding the happenstance that a given party may occupy several roles. If the distribution of the benefit is such that the shipper is properly assessable where there is no relationship between the terminal operator and the shipper, the same allocation applies where they are one and the same. In any case, Car-gill\u2019s dilemma is only in the short run, for if the ground rules are now clearly stated, it will be able to recoup the charges assessable against the shipper by getting more from the consignee in future transactions. At the oral argument, it was said that at Baton Rouge it is customary for the shippers to sell F.O.B. vessel (J.A. 163), placing the responsibility on the consignee to procure the vessel, but even if the documents are not phrased in that form the actual cost of the supplies on board the vessel is the dominant economic fact of life, which determines how much the consignees will pay the shippers for the grain itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">The question of whether the Port\u2019s reservation of \u201cdockage\u201d precludes Car-gill from charging \u201cwharfage\u201d to the vessel is not before us.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The FMC would permit charges associated with the shipping gallery allocable to the stevedore to be assessed as \u201cwharfage\u201d against the vessel (J.A. 73 &amp; n. 29). We need not consider what the FMC would have done, and for what reasons, if it had been confronted with a case where the Port prevented the terminal operator from levying any charge on the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">Cargill further claims that the Commission\u2019s order prevents any assessment against the stevedore until the ALJ on remand determines what constitutes a proper allocation to the stevedore. While the Commission\u2019s ruling lacks clarity, we do not read it to say Cargill cannot in the interim levy a charge against the stevedore for \u201cactual use\u201d of the grain terminal. The Commission\u2019s position at oral argument was that Cargill must follow the usual procedures under the Commission\u2019s General Order 15, 46 C.F.R. \u00a7 533.3, and file a tariff with charges based on an allocation consistent with its ruling. Here Cargill failed to file a tariff in the first instance, which the Commission found to be an independent violation of Section 17 (J.A. 75) \u2014 a ruling endorsed by all five members of FMC, and not appealed by Cargill. The Commission, far from preventing Cargill from charging Barma, specifically ordered Cargill to \u201cfile forthwith any and all charges and conditions within the limits authorized by this decision which Cargill intends to impose\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">Cargill\u2019s failure to file a tariff does not, in some mysterious fashion, render improper the Commission disposition and remand. Picking upon the point raised by Commissioners Barrett and Morse in their partial dissent, Cargill urges that the Commission in effect has issued an interim injunction, a remedy it does not have under this court\u2019s ruling in <em>Transpacific Freight Conference of Japan v. FMB, </em>112 U.S.App.D.C. 290, 302 F.2d 875 (1962). In that case, however, Judge Washington held that the Commission was not authorized under \u00a7 15 to issue a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>restraining order <em>pendente lite </em>where the only justification advanced was a finding of irreparable injury and there was no finding of a violation of the Act. <em>Transpacific Freight Conference </em>is inapposite here, where the Commission is acting under \u00a7 17 and has found a violation of that provision, and where charges cannot be levied forthwith in view of the terminal operator\u2019s failure to file a tariff. The Commission\u2019s course here seems clearly within its powers as outlined by Justice Frankfurter in <em>California v. United States, </em>320 U.S. 577, 582, 64 S.Ct. 352, 354, 88 L.Ed. 322, 329 (1944). There Justice Frankfurter stated that on finding a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 17, \u201cthe Commission was charged by law with the duty of devising appropriate means for their correction,\u201d which included issuance of \u201can order generally prohibiting further preferential and unreasonable practices, leaving the parties to translate such a generality into concreteness and to devise their own remedies.\u201d Thus, while under \u00a7 17 the Commission \u201cmay\u201d prescribe a \u201creasonable practice\u201d as a remedy for a \u00a7 17 violation, under the <em>California </em>decision it may declare the charges to be an \u201cunreasonable practice\u201d and leave to Cargill the option in the first instance of filing a tariff carrying charges consistent with \u00a7 17 and the FMC\u2019s ruling thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">At the oral argument there was some discussion of the consequences of Car-gill\u2019s filing of a tariff for a 5-cents charge subsequent to the issuance of the FMC order under review. That is not a part of the record and case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">The Department of Justice (Antitrust Division) claims that the FMC went too far in the authorization of charges to Barma. The Department says that charges can only be based on (a) express contract with the persons charged; (b) a custom at the port, possibly on the theory that this gives rise to an implied contract; or (c) actual use, in which case there is either another kind of implied contract or a subjection to reasonable tariff regulation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And the Department says that the benefits ascribed to use cannot be the kind of benefits inherently accruing to a stevedore whose employees never set foot on the dock, as an \u201cincidental beneficiary.\u201d In rebuttal, FMC counsel puts it that even a stevedore whose employees row to the vessel use the dock when they attach to the spout on the dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">Barma sought review only on the ground that Cargill\u2019s charges violated \u00a7\u00a7 15 and 16.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Cargill opposed the FMC\u2019s authority under \u00a7 17 to limit its charges against stevedores. There was no appeal to this court by anyone on the ground that, assuming \u00a7\u00a715 and 16 to be inapplicable, the FMC contravened \u00a7 17 because it did not place sufficient limits on what might be charged to a stevedore. The approach of the Antitrust Division was neither presented to the FMC, nor made the subject of a petition to review. We have no jurisdiction to rule on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1134-13\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342, as amended in 1966, gives the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction over such final orders of the Federal Maritime Commission as are made reviewable under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 830.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1134-14\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 816 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-15\">Every such carrier [by water in foreign commerce] and every other person subject to this chapter shall establish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable regulations and practices relating to or connected with the receiving, handling, storing, or delivering of property.

Cargill had not previously charged stevedores for the use of terminal services and facilities at Baton Rouge, although it had done so at the Port of Houston in 1967. Four other Louisiana grain elevators had instituted such charges, although Cargill\u2019s main competitor, the public grain terminal at New Orleans, had not done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1136-13\">. During the course of the administrative hearings, Cargill informed the stevedores that the charge would be increased to 8-cents per ton, effective 30 days after the date of a Commission decision in Cargill\u2019s favor, and this would include the dock clean-up charge (J.A. 395).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">. Moreover, if Cargill enjoys unilateral authority to impose novel charges without seeking prior approval under \u00a7 15, because any such unilateral course is not an \u201cagreement\u201d subject to that provision, the corollary is that there would be no \u00a7 15 immunity against antitrust actions, if, e. <em>g., </em>Barma or the Department of Justice should bring an action charging that Cargill and its stevedore subsidiary have entered into a combination or contract in restraint of trade.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">. <em>United Gas Pipe Line Co. v.

The Port Commission and Cargill contend that Agreement 8225-1 does not come within the purview of Section 15 of the Shipping Act, and that these provisions merely represent the exercise of the free right of managerial judgment by the Commission as owner and Cargill as operator of the property. But if Agreement 8225 comes within Section 15, as we have held, then a <em>fortiori </em>Agreement No. 8225-1, which broadens the lease to include stevedores \u2014 clearly a maritime concern \u2014 comes within Section 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-14\">287 F.2d at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-15\">Barma also quotes the following language from the Federal Maritime Board\u2019s opinion in the <em>Greater Baton Rouge Port Commission </em>litigation, which was substantially incorporated by the Fifth Circuit in its decision, <em>id:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-16\">There is a complete separation of the function of the elevator in delivering grain and that of the vessel in receiving and stowing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdsI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>There is no physical connection between vessel and elevator except mooring and guide lines. The latter hold the spout which discharges the grain into the hatch under control of the stevedore. The elevator has completed delivery when the grain flows out of the spout. All remaining functions are those of the stevedore, who in effect takes over the ship\u2019s operation for the time being. The elevator personnel perform no function on the vessel; the stevedore personnel perform no services in the elevator or on the wharf. There is, of course, necessity for cooperation between the two groups as the stevedore must signal terminal personnel in order to control the flow of grain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"anz-dedup-0\"><em>Agreements Nos. 8225 and 8225-1, supra, </em>5 F.M.B. at 651. This language is quoted out of context, for the issue addressed is whether primary regulatory authority over Cargill\u2019s activities with respect to stevedoring rests with the Department of Agriculture or the Federal Maritime Board. The determination that stevedor-ing is essentially a maritime matter within the Board\u2019s purview has no bearing on the issue in this case \u2014 whether the terminal operator furnishes services and facilities to the stevedore for which charges may be assessed. The fact that stevedores may perform no services on the leased premises does not mean that they do not derive benefit from them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1138-13\">. As the record presently stands, Barma has lost none of its share of the stevedoring market at Baton Rouge and has actually increased its share during the first six months of the charge, primarily because Barma\u2019s rates did not reflect the new Cargill charge during this period (J.A. 17). On some occasions, Cargill as charterer has chosen Barma rather than Rogers to act as stevedore (J.A. 205).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">. Cargill\u2019s expert first estimated that the stevedores should bear 75% of the cost of the gallery, then revised it to 50% (J.A. 34).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">. The Freas Formula, developed by Howard G. Freas in connection with <em>Terminal Rate Structure </em>\u2014 California <em>Ports, </em>3 U.S.M.C. 57 (1948), involves a two-step determination of (1) total cost as divided by functional area, and (2) the appropriate revenue item from each benefiting user of the service or facility to produce a compensating revenue for the marine terminal. As Cargill export Linnekin testified, \u201c[i]t is important to note that while the method is called a \u2018formula,\u2019 it is not an immutable equation. Rather, it is a set of principles which when combined with the judgment of a trained analyst, provides a reasonable assessment of costs, and a fair and reasonable allocation of those costs.\u201d (J.A. 364).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">. Cargill owns approximately 90 to 95 percent of the grain it handles at the Baton Rouge facility (J.A. 175-76).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">. The lease provides that \u201c[njothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Port from charging normal and competitive dockage fees chargeable to ships using the facilities; but wharfage fees chargeable against the grain shall not be charged\u201d (J.A. 296). The lease thus precludes Cargill from charging \u201cdock-age,\u201d defined by both the Port\u2019s tariff and the Commission\u2019s regulations as a charge against the vessel for tieing up at a dock or wharf, <em>see </em>J.A. 301; 46 C.F.R. \u00a7 533.6(d)(1) (1974). But it is silent on whether Cargill may assess \u201cwharfage\u201d against the vessel. The Commission defines \u201cwharfage\u201d as a charge \u201cagainst the cargo or vessel on all cargo passing or conveyed over, onto, or under wharves . for [its] use of [the] wharf,\" <em>see </em>46 C.F.R. \u00a7 533.6(d)(2). While the Port\u2019s tariff recognizes \u201cwharfage\u201d as a charge separate and distinct from \u201cdockage\u201d and based upon the movement of cargo over a facility rather than tieing up there, it defines the term as \u201ca charge against cargo,\u201d see J.A. 301. Whether this definition precludes such a charge against the vessel should be addressed by the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">. The Justice Department agrees with the Commission\u2019s determination as to Cargill\u2019s allocations to the stevedore for the shipping gallery and dock clean-up and liaison service, although for different reasons. As to the wharf and utility allocations, it would expressly condition the charge on actual use by the stevedore; as to overhead, it would require a recalculation to reflect the reduction in other charges to the stevedore resulting from the Commission\u2019s decision.

Whatever contention Barma may have previously made that <em>any </em>charges against the stevedore would constitute an \u201cunreasonable practice\u201d under \u00a7 <em>17 </em>was abandoned in this appeal. Indeed, Barma filed a brief as interve-nor in No. 75-1018, involving Cargill\u2019s petition for review, endorsing the Commission\u2019s application of \u00a7 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
