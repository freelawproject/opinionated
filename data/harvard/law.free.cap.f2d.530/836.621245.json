Wollenberg, United States District Judge, Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b907-18\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"A3U\">WOLLENBERG, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b907-21\">While stationed at March Air Force Base in California, appellant Proietti, then a Master Sergeant in the Air Force, was involved in a traffic accident with an Air Force officer, Major Nakatani. Pursuant to the Federal Drivers Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679, Proietti requested representation by the United States Attorney General in a state court action brought against him by Nakatani.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After his re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>quest was denied, Proietti filed suit seeking review of that decision. The district court held a <em>de novo </em>evidentiary hearing and affirmed the decision of the Attorney General. Because the district court did not employ the proper method for review of the Attorney General\u2019s decision, we must vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">The district court correctly asserted review jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Review is not precluded by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The appropriate standard for review is whether the Attorney General\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). In making that analysis, the district court should have focused entirely on the administrative record compiled by the Attorney General. <em>Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 142, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Instead of following this procedure, the district court held an evidentiary hearing and conducted a <em>de novo </em>inquiry into the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s traffic accident. The court then filed findings of fact and conclusions of law and decided as a matter of law that plaintiff was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident and that the Attorney General was not required to represent him in the state court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\"><em>De novo </em>review of administrative decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act is proper only under a limited set of circumstances. In Proietti\u2019s case, it would be appropriate only if the \u201cagency fact-finding procedures are inadequate\u201d. <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, supra, </em>401 U.S. at 415, 91 S.Ct. 814. Since the procedures employed by the agency in this case were not inadequate, the district court should not have gone beyond the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">The factual information in the report prepared for the Attorney General was gathered by soliciting a statement from Proietti<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and an affidavit from his supervisor. Accident reports and answers to interrogatories in the state court action were also considered. There is nothing to indicate that this method produced unreliable information. While the investigation may not have been painstakingly thorough, the same procedures, especially solicitation of affidavits, could have been used to obtain any necessary additional information. Any defects in the investigation were not the result of the agency\u2019s \u201cfact-finding procedures\u201d. If the administrative record could not have sustained the Attorney General\u2019s decision, the proper remedy would have been to remand the case for further consideration. <em>Camp v. Pitts, supra, </em>411 U.S. at 143, 93 S.Ct. 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">In the district court, appellant claimed that the lack of an administrative hearing made a <em>de novo </em>court hearing necessary. The terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679, however, do not require an administrative hearing, and, in the absence of such a requirement, neither does the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>Camp v. Pitts, supra, </em>411 U.S. at 140-141, 93 S.Ct. 1241.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">Further proceedings in the district court might be unnecessary if we could now evaluate the administrative record under the proper standards. However, the record before us is inadequate for that task. While it contains the reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>prepared by the Air Force Judge Advocate\u2019s offices at March Air Force Base and Washington, it does not contain a copy of the decision of the Attorney General. Upon remand, the district court should conduct further proceedings to supplement the record in that regard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The Attorney General contends that the decision of the district court should be upheld even if Proietti was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. If that is the case, the Attorney General argues that the rule of <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), would preclude Nakatani from recovering from the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">This factor is clearly irrelevant to the decision required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679. The statute requires the Attorney General to base the certification decision solely on the resolution of the scope of employment issue. If Proietti was acting within the scope of his employment, the <em>Feres </em>doctrine could be raised as a defense on his behalf when and if the Attorney General represents him in the Nakatani litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">There is no indication that the Attorney General actually relied on the <em>Feres </em>case as a reason for refusing to represent Proietti. The case is mentioned by the Judge Advocate\u2019s office in a discussion of defenses to the state court action in the event that Proietti was acting within the scope of his employment. However, if the district court finds that an irrelevant factor entered into the Attorney General\u2019s decision, Proietti would still not be entitled to a <em>de novo </em>hearing. Using an incorrect legal doctrine as the basis for a decision would not be a defect in the agency\u2019s fact-finding procedures. <em>Camp v. Pitts, supra, </em>411 U.S. at 142-143, 93 S.Ct. 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\">.

Should a United States district court determine on a hearing on a motion to remand held before a trial on the merits that the case so removed is one in which a remedy by suit within the meaning of subsection (b) of this section is not available against the United States, the case shall be remanded to the State court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-24\">(e) The Attorney General may compromise or settle any claim asserted in such civil</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agu-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>action or proceeding in the manner provided in section 2677, and with the same effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-8\">In the state action, Proietti\u2019s insurer paid $25,000, the policy limit, to avoid a possible bad faith claim, although Nakatani claimed in excess of that amount. No signed release has been executed, and the action is still pending in the state court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A6j\">. <em>Rothman v.

WRIGHT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aus-dedup-0\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">The accident giving rise to this litigation occurred on October 12, 1970. Now, more than five years later, the majority vacates and remands for further proceedings. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">If the agency fact-finding procedures <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were inadequate, the de novo review in the district court was appropriate. <em>Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 142, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973); <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 415, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If they were adequate, we should simply ignore the evidence presented at the de novo hearing, and review the administrative determination under the arbitrary and capricious test. [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)]</p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">Whichever record is used, I am convinced as a matter of law that the Attorney General should defend Proietti in the state action pursuant to the Federal Drivers Act [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679].</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">The administrative record shows the following: Master Sergeant Proietti\u2019s private automobile collided with that of Major Nakatani, who subsequently brought a personal injury and property damage action against Proietti in California Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The accident oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>curred during normal duty hours on the streets of March Air Force Base, California. At the time of the accident, both Proietti and Nakatani were active duty personnel in an \u201con duty\u201d status. Proietti was in uniform at the time, and was engaged in transporting directly military documents between buildings located some 1 to 2 miles apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Base legal officers recognized that \u201cSenior NCOs and officers routinely used their POVs [Privately Owned Vehicles] while travelling on base, primarily for their own convenience.\u201d The inference is inescapable that such POVs were not used <em>exclusively </em>for private convenience and that base personnel were aware of this state of affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Proietti was engaged in personal as well as government business at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">There were no regulations either expressly authorizing or expressly prohibiting the use of private vehicles for government business. However, it was unrealistic for Proietti to use government transportation because of the paucity of government vehicles available and the irregularity of service. As a senior non-commissioned officer, he was required to transport the documents within given time constraints, and could not reasonably do so except by using his private automobile. He had used his own car to carry government documents on several occasions prior to the day of the accident as had his predecessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">The above facts are also apparent from the district court hearing record. In addition, there was testimony at the de novo hearing that base security personnel had been aware for some time that military personnel were using private automobiles on the base for government business.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">The facts belie any notion that Proiet-ti was on his own \u201cfrolic.\u201d He was transporting government documents directly from one building to another. \u201cDeviation\u201d is not at issue. The only issue is whether Proietti\u2019s use of his private automobile, without express authority, and in fulfillment of both government and personal purposes, was within or without \u201cthe scope of his office or employment\u201d within the meaning of Section 2679. This issue can be decided as a matter of law. <em>Cf. Chapin v. United States, </em>258 F.2d 465, 467 (9th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">In resolving the \u201cscope of employment\u201d question presented in a suit instituted under the Federal Tort Claims Act [28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) &amp; 2674 (1970)], a federal court \u201cmust apply the <em>respondeat superior </em>principles of the state wherein the alleged tort was committed. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 857, 76 S.Ct. 100, 100 L.Ed. 761 (1955) . . . .\u201d <em>United States v. McRoberts, </em>409 F.2d 195, 197 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">Since 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 provides, \u201cas used in this chapter [such chapter including \u00a7\u00a7 2671 \u2014 80] and sections 1346(b) and 2401(b) of this title,\u201d and then proceeds to define, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c \u2018Acting within the scope of his office or employment,\u2019 \u201d it is reasonable to conclude that the rule of <em>Williams, supra, </em>applies whether the action is brought under section 1346, 2674, or 2679.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Attorney General so concluded and proceeded to apply the law of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">Our inquiry is whether the California courts would hold, if this case were before them, that Proietti was acting within the scope of employment despite the absence of express authorization. <em>Chapin, </em>258 F.2d at 467. The answer is yes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqjx\">The factors to be considered include the intent of the employee, the nature, time, and place of his conduct, his actual and implied authority, the work he was hired to do, the incidental acts that the employer should reasonably have expected would be done, and the amount of freedom allowed the employee in performing his duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-16\"><em>Loper v. Morrisson, </em>23 Cal.2d 600, 145 P.2d 1, 4 (1944). <em>See also Johnson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>Banducci, </em>212 Cal.App.2d 254, 27 Cal. Rptr. 764 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">The mere fact that an employee uses his private vehicle to pursue the business of his employer does not relieve the employer of liability, so long as the employee is acting with the express or implied consent of the employer. <em>Boynton v. McKales, </em>139 Cal.App.2d 777, 294 P.2d 733, 741 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">An employee, particularly one of such significant rank as Master Sergeant, has implied authority to use any means \u201creasonably proper in the performance of an assigned task.\u201d <em>Garber v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, </em>203 Cal.App.2d 693, 22 Cal.Rptr. 123, 128 (1962). <em>See also Espinoza v. Rossini, </em>247 Cal.App.2d 40, 55 Cal.Rptr. 205, 211 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Even where an employee combines his own business with that of his employer, \u201cthe master will be held responsible unless it clearly appears that the servant could not have been directly or indirectly serving his master.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Farrell, </em>208 Cal. 200, 204, 280 P.2d 945, 946 (1929), <em>followed in Wiseman </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, </em>46 Cal.2d 570, 297 P.2d 649, 651 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Finally, where an employee has used his own automobile repeatedly in his employer\u2019s business with the employer\u2019s knowledge and assent, implied authority is often found. 60A C.J.S. Motor Vehicles \u00a7 453 at p. 1115 &amp; n. 49 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Although we have not been directed to a case construing California law in the light of facts such as those before us,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I would conclude as a matter of law that a California court would find on these facts that Proietti was acting within the scope of his employment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-10\">. While the administrative record includes only the recommendation of Air Force counsel, the United States Attorney in defending this case has presented that determination as being that of the Attorney General. There is no contention by either party that the administrative action is not final.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-20\">. In <em>Camp v. Pitts, supra, </em>the Supreme Court was faced with the question whether a de novo hearing, <em>which had not yet been held, </em>should be. In the case before us, the district court has already held such a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b909-21\">. In the state action Proietti\u2019s insurer paid $25,000, the policy limit, to avoid a possible bad faith claim, although Nakatani claimed in excess of that amount. No signed release has been executed, and the action is still pending in the state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b910-9\">. The result is not different merely because the accident occurred on U.S. Government property. In <em>Canon v. United States, </em>111 F.Supp. 162, 165 (N.D.Cal.1953), <em>aff\u2019d </em>217 F.2d 70 (9th Cir. 1954), the district court applied California law to decide the \u201cscope of employment\u201d issue, even though the accident occurred in a federal government hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b911-9\">. In <em>Boynton v. McKales, supra, </em>the California Court of Appeal held that an employer was liable for injuries caused by a private automobile being driven by an employee en route home from a company social function if the employee\u2019s attendance there was expected by the employer and the employee lived such a distance away that use of an automobile was reasonably necessary. The employer expectation and reasonable necessity factors have similar bearing in the case before us, although the factual situation is quite different.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b911-20\">. In <em>Boynton v. McKales, supra, </em>294 P.2d at 741, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-21\">\u201cThe use of a car by an employee who owns one and has a driver\u2019s license has become so normal in California that implied consent will soon be accepted . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-22\">While I can find no California decision post-<em>Boynton </em>which has turned this prognosis into holding, and can therefore only speculate as to whether a California court would do so in this case, the above language nevertheless adds weight to my conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
