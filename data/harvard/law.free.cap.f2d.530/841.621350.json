Markoff appeals from a summary judgment rendered against him by the District Court for the District of Nevada. Appellant brought this action based upon two life insurance policies issued in 1963 by appellee New York Life Insurance Company. Appellant contended that he had been totally disabled and was therefore entitled to \u201cwaiver of premium\u201d benefits pursuant to the two policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Prior to instituting this action, appellant filed an action in the Nevada state court for damages and amounts allegedly due under an income protection policy issued by appellee in 1963. After a trial, the court held for appellee based on findings that: (1) appellant had intentionally misrepresented and concealed his prior medical history, and (2) there was an absence of total disability such as to trigger New York Life\u2019s obligation to pay disability benefits. On review, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the trial court in <em>Markoff v. New York Life Insurance Company, </em>88 Nev. 319, 497 P.2d 904 (1972), <em>cert. denied </em>409 U.S. 1064, 93 S.Ct. 572, 34 L.Ed.2d 520 (1972), without specifically mentioning the trial court\u2019s finding on total disability. After stating that the trial court\u2019s finding of misrepresentation was \u201camply supported,\u201d the court stated that \u201cother assigned errors are without substance.\u201d Id. at 320, 497 P.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">In rendering summary judgment in favor of appellee, the district court determined that due to the findings in the prior litigation, appellant was collaterally estopped from raising the issue of total disability once again. Since jurisdiction in this case was based upon diversity of citizenship, the district court was obligated to apply Nevada law regarding the application of collateral estoppel. Noting that Nevada had not resolved the estoppel effect to be given to a decision reviewed by an appellate court, the district court judge adopted the California position. That view is that even if the appellate court refrains from considering one of the grounds upon which the decision below rests, an affirmance of the decision below extends legal effects to the whole of the lower court\u2019s determination, with attendant collateral estoppel effect. <em>Bank of America v. McLaughlin Land and Livestock Co., </em>40 Cal.App.2d 620, 105 P.2d 607 (1940), <em>cert. denied </em>313 U.S. 571, 61 S.Ct. 958, 85 L.Ed. 1529 (1941). We believe that this is a sound application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">All other issues raised by appellant are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
