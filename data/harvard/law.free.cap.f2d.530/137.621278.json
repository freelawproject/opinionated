The Board also found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) by interrogation of employees Bynum and Foster. The Board ordered Groendyke to cease and desist from the unlawful practices and to reinstate Bynum with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Groendyke argues that the no-distribution rale is valid and that the discharge of Bynum for violation of the rule did not contravene \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1). The company also contends that the remote instances of interrogation were not a sufficient basis for finding a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). We disagree and decline to set aside the Board\u2019s order, and grant enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">The unfair labor practice charges had initially been heard by an Administrative Law Judge who dismissed the entire complaint in two written decisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In combination these two decisions specifically found that Groendyke \u201cdid not precipitously promulgate the [no-distribution] rule to thwart unionization\u201d; that the no-distribution rule was reasonably enforced; that Bynum had engaged in the distribution of union literature on company time and in work areas; and that he could have been and was lawfully discharged for this reason. The Judge further found that Bynum\u2019s termination was not discriminatory (R. 361-62). As to the interrogation charge, the Judge found that there were only isolated acts of interrogation, two to four months before Bynum\u2019s discharge, which were too remote and technical to color the discharge with illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">As stated, the Board disagreed as to the ultimate findings to be made on the record. The Board essentially adopted the findings of subsidiary facts of the Administrative Law Judge, but made different ultimate findings and conclusions that violations of the Act had occurred. It is for the Board to make such final determinations on the charges. <em>S. A. Healy Co. v. NLRB, </em>435 F.2d 314, 316 (10th Cir.). The issues before us concern the correctness of those determinations by the Board on the no-distribution rule and Bynum\u2019s discharge under it, and the interrogation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">THE NO-DISTRIBUTION RULE AND BYNUM\u2019S DISCHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">In early April, 1972, a Teamsters Local<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> began an organizational cam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>paign among Groendyke\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> employees culminating in a Board conducted election held on August 31 and September 1, 1972,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which the union won. Bynum had been employed by Groendyke as a truck-driver for about fifteen months prior to his discharge on September 5. In April, Bynum learned of the organizational drive, executed a union authorization card, and solicited other drivers on behalf of the union. Bynum was appointed by the union to serve as an observer in the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">On Saturday, September 2, Bynum went to Groendyke\u2019s Channelview terminal, where he was employed, to get his pay check. The Administrative Law Judge specifically found this was a non-work day for Bynum. When Bynum arrived at the terminal at 10:00 a. m. he was informed that the paychecks would not be available until noon. During this interval Bynum spoke to several off-duty drivers in the driver\u2019s lounge and on the parking lot. During these discussions he distributed union bumper stickers and sample collective-bargaining agreements. In addition, he handed out union authorization cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Subsequently, Bynum entered a. lobby area of the terminal where he happened to see a driver whom he did not recognize. The man was a driver from Groen-dyke\u2019s Beaumont terminal, named Hen-drickson. Bynum testified that he didn\u2019t know Hendrickson and according to By-num, Hendrickson \u201cwas just standing in the reception room.\u201d (R. 88). Hendrick-son, like Bynum, was awaiting the final preparation of paychecks by the payroll clerk, Felps. However Hendrickson, unlike Bynum, had driven from Beaumont in a company truck and had been assigned the duty of picking up the paychecks for all the drivers out of the Beaumont terminal and returning to the terminal with the checks. Although it was not disputed that Hendrickson was merely \u201cstanding around\u201d when Bynum approached him, the Judge found that Hendrickson \u201cwas engaged in normal work duties in the terminal when he appeared to pick up the paychecks for his fellow employees\u201d (R. 361).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Bynum asked Hendrickson whether he was interested in joining the union. When Hendrickson responded affirmatively, Bynum offered him some union literature and an authorization card. Groendyke\u2019s terminal manager, Stinson, observed this exchange and immediately called Bynum into the office and asked whether he was aware of Groendyke\u2019s no-distribution rule. When Bynum replied that he was not aware of the rule, Stinson led Bynum to the driver\u2019s lounge where the no-distribution rule was posted. Stinson read Bynum the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">Employees are prohibited from distributing, posting or otherwise circulating handbills or literature of any type on company property during working hours. Employees violating this rule will be discharged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">Stinson testified that Bynum said he didn\u2019t think he was violating the rule; that he told Bynum he thought he was violating the rule; and that he asked Bynum to put the literature in his car until the question was determined. By-num testified that Stinson told him \u201cthat as long as it was a company policy he would not be allowed to solicit or hand out any literature on company property, and told me to put this literature in my car\u201d (R. 90). Bynum engaged in no further distribution of literature, went to his car, and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">The same afternoon Stinson began procedures to terminate Bynum\u2019s employment. After receiving authority from the home office, Stinson terminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ed Bynum on September 5. The Judge found that Bynum was apprised by Stin-son that the Enid office had instructed Stinson to terminate Bynum \u201cfor passing out union literature\u201d (R. 360). It was on these facts that the Board\u2019s findings and order adverse to the company were entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The company argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that its no-distribution rule was valid on its face, citing <em>Walton Manufacturing Co., </em>126 NLRB 697, enforced, 289 F.2d 177 (5th Cir.); <em>International Union v. NLRB, </em>140 U.S.App.D.C. 199, 434 F.2d 473; and <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372. It says the evidence showed Bynum was soliciting union membership and distributing union literature in a working area \u2014 the payroll clerk\u2019s office \u2014 while the payroll clerk was working; that the rule was not intended to apply to an employee soliciting a fellow employee, both being off-duty, in a non-working area such as the employees\u2019 lounge; that the rule is also presumptively valid as to its promulgation and enforcement; and that its validity may only be rebutted by proof of a discriminatory purpose in adoption or application of the rule (Petitioner\u2019s Brief, 10-11).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We start with recognition of the undisputed right of self-organization assured by the Act, and the equally undisputed right of the employers to maintain discipline in their establishments. <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 797-98, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372. <em>Republic </em>upheld the Board\u2019s determination that \u201cpromulgation and enforcement\u201d of a rule against \u201c[s]oliciting of any type ... in the factory or offices,\u201d id. at 795, 65 S.Ct. at 987, 988, violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) as an unlawful restraint of employees\u2019 \u00a7 7 rights, there being no showing of unusual circumstances by the company to outweigh the presumption against such rules. Id. at 803-04, 65 S.Ct. 982. <em>Republic </em>did involve both the promulgation and the enforcement of such a rule. Our court has said that adoption of a no-solicitation, no-distribution rule is not, of itself, a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). See <em>NLRB v. American Coach Co., </em>379 F.2d 699, 701 (10th Cir.), citing <em>NLRB v. Shawnee Industries, Inc., </em>333 F.2d 221, 225 (10th Cir.); see also <em>NLRB v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>357 U.S. 357, 363-64, 78 S.Ct. 1268, 2 L.Ed.2d 1383; <em>Serv-Air, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>395 F.2d 557, 560 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 840, 89 S.Ct. 121, 21 L.Ed.2d 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\"><em>Shawnee Industries </em>involved broad rules against solicitation and distribution on the premises, but with a provision for approval of distribution and solicitation by management. This court said it saw nothing in the record to sustain an inference that these rules had been or would be used in a forbidden manner. And it was held that the mere promulgation of the rules was not a per se violation of the Act. <em>Shawnee Industries, </em>supra at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Here, however, we have both promulgation and enforcement of a broad rule prohibiting distribution \u201con company property during working hours.\u201d And unlike the rules in <em>Shawnee Industries, </em>Groendyke\u2019s rule has no provision contemplating authorization for exceptions being granted to the bar against distribution. Moreover, the prohibition of distribution of literature of any type \u201con company property during working hours\u201d is susceptible to the interpretation by employees that it applies to distribution on the employees\u2019 own time, which may be found to violate the Act where the required proof of unusual circumstances justifying the rule is lacking. <em>International Union v. NLRB </em>supra, 434 F.2d at 481; <em>NLRB v. Southern Electronics Co., </em>430 F.2d 1391, 1392 (6th Cir.); <em>NLRB v. Miller, </em>341 F.2d 870, 873-74 (2d Cir.); <em>Essex International, Inc., </em>211 NLRB 112.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And a rule thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>restricting distribution during the employees\u2019 own time impinges on rights protected by the Act. <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 796, 803-04, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We note particularly the Board\u2019s findings showing that this case is unlike <em>Shawnee Industries </em>which involved the mere existence of the rule. <em>Shawnee Industries, </em>supra at 225. Here the application and enforcement of the broad ban of the rule is shown by the Board\u2019s findings (R. 381-82):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">We also find that the discharge of Bynum violated the Act. When Terminal Manager Stinson discovered that Bynum was distributing union literature, he immediately informed Bynum that he was violating the no-distribution rule, showed the posted rule to Bynum, and told him to remove his literature to his car. Thus, even though the other employee involved may have been on his working time, and the distribution arguably occurred in a working area, Bynum was shown the unlawfully broad rule proscribing all distribution during working hours on company property. Respondent never explained to Bynum that he could distribute union literature during nonworking time and in nonworking areas of the Company\u2019s premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">* He * sfc * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-13\">Moreover, record testimony indicates that the Respondent, pursuant to its no-distribution rule, never allowed anyone to engage in any distributing or soliciting on Company premises at any time. The broad proscription was enforced uniformly against everyone. There is no reason to believe that the Respondent would allow an exception for distribution of union literature during nonworking time and in nonworking areas.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">We are not persuaded by the company\u2019s arguments that the rule was presumptively valid and lawfully applied. We are instead satisfied that the record supports the Board\u2019s findings cited above. And we feel the record and the findings support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the unlawfully broad rule, which was applied to organizational activities without any indication of any exception during non-working time in non-working areas, was in violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Further, the Board found that since the no-distribution rule itself was unlawful, the rule was not a valid basis for Bynum\u2019s discharge. Accordingly the Board found that his discharge \u201cfor passing out union literature\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act, and ordered reinstatement and back pay (R. 382-83). We are persuaded that the findings concerning the discharge and the remedial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>order are amply supported and not in error. Cf. <em>NLRB v. Miller, </em>supra, 341 F.2d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In sum, we conclude that the Board\u2019s rulings concerning both the no-distribution rule and Bynum\u2019s discharge under it should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">THE INTERROGATION ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Employees Bynum and Foster testified that they had been subjected to questioning by the terminal manager, Stin-son, concerning their attitudes toward the union during the course of the union\u2019s organizing campaign. Each said that he was questioned by Stinson on two different occasions, the first incident occurring sometime in late May or early June and the second incident occurring early in July (R. 183, 200).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Stinson denied questioning either employee concerning union activities (R. 214-15). The Administrative Law Judge found Foster and Bynum to be trustworthy and forthright witnesses and he credited their testimony and found the facts to be as reported by them (R. 374).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Essentially the two employees related incidents during which Stinson asked them what they thought about the union and what they thought the union could accomplish. Foster said that during the first incident in late May or early June Stinson argued the advantages and disadvantages of the union (R. 182); that during that first talk Stinson asked him how the other drivers felt about the union and that during the second talk in early July, Stinson discussed some union collective bargaining agreements with Foster and asked Foster how Bynum felt about the union (R. 183-85). Foster also said that on both occasions Stinson had called him into his (Stinson\u2019s) office, where they were alone, and that Stinson closed the door on the second occasion (R. 180-84). Foster said that the conversations were \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d because he and Stinson didn\u2019t normally talk about the union (R. 190-91).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Bynum testified that on the first occasion in the earlier part of June, he was called in to Stinson\u2019s office where they were alone; that Stinson asked what he thought the union \u201ccould do for us,\u201d and if he had heard any union discussions; that Stinson agreed their demurrage was too low but said the pay was as much as other tank line companies were paying. Bynum said the second occasion was in the latter part of July; that Stinson again asked him to come into his office where they were alone; that Stinson asked what his \u201cmain bitches were about the way things were running and if [he] had given any more thought to the union\u201d; and that they discussed Bynum\u2019s pay as compared with that of other Gro-endyke drivers (R. 195-202). Bynum said the doors to Stinson\u2019s office were left open on both occasions when the discussions occurred (R. 206).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Although he found the testimony to be credible, the Administrative Law Judge found no unfair labor practices arising from these \u201cisolated acts of interrogation\u201d because they were \u201ctoo remote in time to color with illegality the termination of Bynum,\u201d and that the acts of interrogation \u201care too isolated and technical to warrant remedial relief.\u201d (R. 375). The Board disagreed that the instances of interrogation were so isolated and technical as to warrant dismissal (R. 382), and it ordered Groendyke to cease and desist from interrogating its employees concerning their own and other employees\u2019 union membership, activities and desires, and to post a customary notice (R. 384, 388). Again, the Board disagreed with the Judge as to the ultimate findings and conclusions to be drawn and the need for remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">The company argues that the Board erred in its finding of unlawful interrogation. Specifically, Groendyke maintains that the proof of isolated instances of interrogation fell far short of establishing illegal interrogation by the terminal manager; that casual, moderate in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>terrogation not amounting to threats or coercion is not unlawful; and that its supervisor could lawfully campaign with vigor against the union and point out disadvantages of union membership, citing <em>NLRB v. Orleans Manufacturing Co., Inc., 412 </em>F.2d 94 (2d Cir.); <em>NLRB v. MacCollum Paper Co., </em>367 F.2d 761 (7th Cir.), and similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">It is true that a record showing only isolated, innocuous incidents of interrogation, and unrelated conversations lacking the indicia of coercion, has been held insufficient to sustain findings of unfair labor practices under \u00a7 8(a)(1). <em>NLRB v. Orleans Manufacturing Co., </em>supra, 412 F.2d at 96. Similarly, proof showing only pre-employment interrogation without any antiunion threats was viewed as insufficient support for such a finding. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>MacCollum Paper Co., </em>supra, 367 F.2d at 764. The issue is whether the proof demonstrates interference, restraint or coercion of employees in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). The core of the unfair labor practice lies in the element of coercion and does not extend to a total restriction against argumentative discussion of the effect of unionization, argumentative discussion itself being protected by \u00a7 8(c) of the Act. <em>NLRB v. Thompson Transport Co., </em>406 F.2d 698, 702 (10th Cir.);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>NLRB v. Automotive Controls Corp., </em>406 F.2d 221, 223-34 (10th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The determination of an unfair labor practice charge arising out of employee interrogation necessarily involves an exercise of judgment and is a matter initially for the Board. <em>NLRB v. Gold Spot Dairy, Inc., </em>417 F.2d 761, 762 (10th Cir.). In making that determination it is peculiarly the province of the Board to draw permissible inferences from credible testimony. Id.; <em>NLRB v. Thompson Transport Co., </em>supra, 406 F.2d at 702. Our function is limited to determining whether the findings of violations are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 491, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">We must view the company\u2019s whole course of conduct. See <em>NLRB v. Thompson Transport Co., </em>supra, 406 F.2d at 702. We note that there were some four instances of interrogation occurring over several weeks, according to the facts as found by the Judge and accepted by the Board. The men were called into the terminal manager\u2019s office where the conversations were between just Stinson and one man each time, and inquiries were made about the attitudes of the men questioned and others toward the union. There was the observation that such conversation was \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d. In this connection we note too that no purpose for the questions was stated and no assurance against reprisal was given. See <em>NLRB v. Miller Trucking Service, Inc., </em>445 F.2d 927, 930 (10th Cir.). And, of course, the incidents occurred against the background of the organizational drive. While the proof is: not strong, we feel it supports the Board\u2019s inferences and the finding of .a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). Accordingly, we sustain the Board\u2019s finding and will enforce the remedial order. <em>NLRB v. Gold Spot Dairy, Inc., </em>supra, at 763-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Enforcement will be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-9\">. Board Member Jenkins filed a concurring statement.

Counsel for Groendyke questioned Stinson as to the nature of Groendyke\u2019s terminal operations in an apparent attempt to demonstrate that a rule barring distribution during \u201cworking hours\u201d was justified:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Q This rule states during working hours. Will you please tell the Judge what the working hours of Groendyke Transport are, please, sir, at the Channelview terminal?</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">A Twenty-four hours a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Q Are there people there on duty 24 hours a day?</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">A We only have one time that there has been nobody at the Channelview terminal, and that is from 5:00 o\u2019clock Saturday evening until 7:00 o\u2019clock Sunday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">Q Other than that the Company does have day-round working hours, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"aam-dedup-0\">A That\u2019s right (R. 54-55).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">The Administrative Law Judge credited this testimony and found the operating hours to be as stated by Stinson (R. 360).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-18\">We read this testimony in a different light. To us, Stinson\u2019s testimony as to Groendyke\u2019s working hours supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that no exceptions to the rule would be permitted by the company.
