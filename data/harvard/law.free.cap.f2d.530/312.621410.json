Although not identified, it is clear that they were not members of Local 6362 of the United Mine Workers (the Beech Bottom mine local). Work at the mine stopped when members of the Local re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>fused to cross this \u201cstranger\u201d picket line.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">On March 27, 1975, Windsor brought suit under Section 301 of the National Labor Relations Act, as <em>amended, </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, against the International Union, District 6, Local 6362, and various officers of the District and Local Union (hereinafter Union), seeking damages and temporary and permanent injunctive relief as a result of the Union\u2019s breach of \u201cno-strike\u201d obligations under the 1974 National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement. Judge Maxwell entered a temporary restraining order on the same day, ordering termination of the existing work stoppage and requiring the Union \u201c[t]o honor the contract between the plaintiff and the [U.M.W.] and return to work . . ..\u201d The order concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">It- is further ORDERED that Windsor Power House Coal Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1974 shall arbitrate any grievance submitted by any member of the United Mine Workers employed at its Beech Bottom Mine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac1\">By order entered April 7, the TRO was extended until April 17 at 5:00 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The work stoppage continued in spite of entry of the TRO, and on April 9 the court ordered the Union to show cause why it should not be held in contempt for failing to obey the temporary restraining order. A hearing on both the show cause order and Windsor\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction was begun on April 15. Extensive hearings were held, and on April 17 the district court entered orders on both matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">The contempt order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-13\">[If defendants] do not fully comply with the provisions of the temporary restraining order of March 27, 1975, and the extension thereof, on or before 8:01 a. m., on April 18, 1975, and return to work, said United Mine Workers of America is hereby ORDERED assessed the sum of $10,000.00 for each and every shift of work missed at the Beech Bottom Mine of Windsor Power House Coal Company by reason of the strike or walkout thereat when work is scheduled and available at said mine; that District 6 United Mine Workers is hereby ORDERED assessed the sum of $5,000.00 for each such shift on the identical conditions; and that Local 6362 is hereby ORDERED assessed the sum of $100.00 per each such shift upon the identical conditions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">The preliminary injunction entered later on the same afternoon recited substantially the same terms as the TRO, except that the district court, apparently by inadvertence, failed to repeat the requirement that the company agree that all disputes be submitted to arbitration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">The Union took this appeal from both the contempt order and the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\n<em>The Preliminary Injunction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The basic issue presented in this appeal concerning the preliminary injunction is whether, under the rule of law laid down in <em>Boys </em>Markets,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the refusal of the members of Local 6362 to cross a stranger picket line falls within the mandatory arbitration clause of its labor contract with Windsor and, as a result, is subject to injunction by the federal courts. We have held that the principle of <em>Boys Markets </em>may extend to such disputes, depending upon the contract\u2019s language. <em>Armco Steel Corp. v. United Mine Workers, </em>505 F.2d 1129 (4th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 877, 96 S.Ct. 150, 46 L.Ed.2d 110 (1975); <em>Monongahela Power Co. v. Electrical Workers Local 2332, </em>484 F.2d 1209 (4th Cir. 1973). <em>See also Island Creek Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, </em>507 F.2d 650 (3d Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 877, 96 S.Ct. 150, 46 L.Ed.2d 110 (1975); <em>NAPA Pittsburg, Inc. </em>v. <em>Automotive Chauffeurs Local 926, </em>502 F.2d 321 (3d Cir.) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1049, 95 S.Ct. 625, 42 L.Ed. 644 (1974). <em>But see United States Steel Corp. v. United Mine Workers, </em>519 F.2d 1236 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Buffalo Forge Co. v. United Steelworkers, </em>517 F.2d 1207 (2d Cir. 1975); Note, Injunctions \u2014 Federal Courts May Enjoin Work Stoppage When Its Legality Is Arbitrable Issue, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 463 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">Furthermore, in <em>Armco Steel, supra, </em>we held that just such a failure to cross a stranger picket line was within the mandatory arbitration clause of the 1971 National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement. <em>See also Island Creek, supra. </em>We have not found, and neither party to this appeal has suggested, any material difference between the relevant provision of the 1971 labor contract and a similar provision of the 1974 Agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We adhere to our prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">Secondly, the Union urges that the conduct of its members came within the \u201cPreservation of Individual Safety Rights\u201d provision of the 1974 contract<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>and that this clause is a specific, exception to the implied no-strike provisions of the Agreement. We are inclined to think that the Preservation of Individual Safety Rights was designed and intended to establish a procedure for correcting dangerous working conditions in the mines and has nothing to do with picketing. It is true, as the Union suggests, that crossing a picket line may provoke violence. But that does not appear to be among the dangers for which the procedure was designed. We need not, however, decide the question because it is clear that the procedure established by the safety rights clause was not invoked here.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The \u201cPreservation of Individual Safety Rights\u201d provision of the labor agreement sets out a detailed procedure for asserting such rights: (1) \u201cWhen an Employee in good faith believes that he is being required to work under [abnormally and immediately dangerous] conditions he shall notify his supervisor of such belief.\u201d (2) If there is no dispute between the Employee and management as to the existence of the dangerous condition, \u201csteps shall be taken immediately to correct or prevent exposure to such condition.\u201d (3) \u201cIf the condition is disputed, the Employee shall have the right to be relieved from duty on the assignment in dispute [and] ... at least one member of the Mine Health and Safety Committee shall review such condition with mine management within four (4) hours to determine whether it exists.\u201d (4) \u201cFor disputes not otherwise settled, a written grievance may be filed, and the dispute shall be referred immediately to arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">There is nothing in the record to indicate that any member of the Union ever invoked this provision by bringing the issue to the attention of Windsor in the manner required. <em>Cf. Gateway Coal Co. </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers, </em>414 U.S. 368, 383-84, 94 S.Ct. 629, 38 L.Ed.2d 583 (1974). We, therefore, hold that the preliminary injunction issued properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\n<em>The Contempt Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">For purposes of this appeal, the effect of the contempt order is determinable by whether is is characterized as criminal or civil in nature. If it is criminal contempt, it is properly before us on appeal and must be reversed because the court failed to afford the Union the panoply of rights available to defendants in criminal proceedings. If it is civil contempt, it is not appealable \u201c \u2018except in connection with appeal from a final judgment in the main action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carbon Fuel Co. v. United Mine Workers, </em>517 F.2d 1348, 1349 (4th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">In <em>Carbon Fuel, supra, </em>we defined civil contempt as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">Civil contempt, on the one hand, is \u201c \u2018wholly remedial,\u2019 serves only the purpose of a party litigant, and is intended to coerce compliance with an order of the court or to compensate for losses or damages caused by noncompliance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">517 F.2d at 1349. This definition has two parts: (1) civil contempt is forward-looking, \u201cterminable if the contemnor purges himself of the contempt\u201d and (2) it is \u201c \u2018compensatory\u2019 of any losses sustained by the [injured party] as a result of the contempt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">Clearly Judge Maxwell\u2019s order satisfied the first part of the test \u2014 it was prospective in application. The fine for contempt was to begin accruing only if workers did not return to work at the 8:01 a. m. shift on April 18, and it increased in amount only as each succeeding shift failed to resume work.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>However, it is not clear that the court\u2019s order was intended to compensate Windsor for its losses as a result of the contempt. The total daily fines amounted to approximately $45,000, and the record contains no \u201c \u2018evidence of complainant\u2019s actual loss\u2019 \u201d which approached that figure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Carbon Fuel, supra </em>at 1350. Furthermore, the payment of the fine was to be made here to the clerk of court, not Windsor, which we specifically identified in <em>Carbon Fuel </em>as a characteristic of criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Windsor has represented to this court, both in its brief and at oral argument, that the contempt order is not final. It contends that in subsequent proceedings the fine\u2019s payment may be directed to Windsor and adjustment may be made in its amount to match the contemnor\u2019s conduct. We do not understand the Union to dispute these contentions. Accordingly, we hold that the court\u2019s order is civil in nature and presently net ap-pealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">On remand, the district court will treat its contempt order as tentative and, in an effort to balance all pertinent factors to achieve a fair and just result, will carefully consider both the actual damages incurred by Windsor during the period from entry of the contempt order until work was resumed and the character of the efforts made by the Union and others to achieve compliance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, vacated, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">.
