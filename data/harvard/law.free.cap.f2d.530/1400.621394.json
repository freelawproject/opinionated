Appellee (Sales Producers) alleges use since 1891. Faultless owns a plurality of trademarks and trademark registrations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> consisting of or including the term \u201cFAULTLESS\u201d for laundry starches and various other household cleaning and laundry products, whose sales have exceeded $150,000,000 and whose promotional expenses have exceeded $15,000,-000. Faultless established that its first use of the term \u201cFAULTLESS\u201d occurred in 1887.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-7\">The sole issue is whether Sales Producers\u2019 mark so resembles that of Faultless as to be likely when applied to Sales Producers\u2019 goods, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-8\">The prior continuous user,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Faultless, argues that confusion is likely because the involved goods move in the same trade channels, are purchased by the same consumers, and are juxtaposed when displayed in supermarkets, citing <em>Hunt Foods &amp; Industries </em>v. <em>Gerson Stewart Corp., </em>367 F.2d 431, 54 CCPA 751, 151 USPQ 350 (1966), as precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-14\">We reiterate that the ultimate conclusion regarding likelihood of confusion is necessarily drawn from all probative facts in evidence in each individual case. That conclusion, as distinguished from general rules of law or interpretation, cannot be controlled by earlier conclusions such as that reached in <em>Hunt</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c[E]ach case must be decided on its own facts. There is no litmus rule which can provide a ready guide to all cases\u201d and \u201cEach [evidentiary element] may from case to case play a dominant role.\u201d <em>In re E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (CCPA 1973). Thus <em>Hunt </em>does not establish that foods and cleaning compounds are so similar that use of the same or similar marks thereon will in every case result in a likelihood of confusion. Although the movement, consumption and juxtaposition of goods parallel those in <em>Hunt, </em>the mark therein was a surname, whereas \u201cFAULTLESS\u201d is a laudatory term; survey and other evidence in <em>Hunt </em>established a greater degree of fame for \u201cHUNT\u201d than Faultless has established for its mark; the existence of actual confusion was established in <em>Hunt </em>but has not been established here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-15\">Considering the wide variety of different goods currently sold in supermarkets and the absence of survey or other evidence tending to establish a likelihood of confusion, we agree with the board\u2019s statement that \u201cconsidering the nature of the word \u2018FAULTLESS\u2019 and the differences between the goods here involved, it our opinion that applicant\u2019s use thereof is not at all likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception or to falsely suggest a connection with op-poser,\u201d which is but another way of say<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>ing that Faultless failed to meet its burden of establishing a likelihood of confusion. Accordingly, the decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1471-9\">. Reg.
