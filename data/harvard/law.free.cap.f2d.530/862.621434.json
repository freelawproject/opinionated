The Federal Youth Corrections Division of the Board of Parole, after a sixty-day period of study and observation of defendant at the Youth Corrections Institute at Englewood, Colorado, reported to the court its opinion that defendant would not benefit from treatment as a youth offender. The court then sentenced defendant as an adult to five years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312 and \u00a7 4208 after a specific finding negating benefit under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010 and in accord with subsection (d) of that Act as interpreted in <em>Dorszynski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855. Defendant attacks the validity of the sentence asserting an absolute right to be sentenced under section 5010(b) or (c) after the trial court has utilized the evaluation process under (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">We consider defendant\u2019s argument to be obviously self-denying in view of the specifics of the Act and the mass of dicta contained in both the opinion and concurring opinion in Dorszynski. To mandate sentencing under subsections (b) or (c) of the Act because the court seeks expert advice as to whether it <em>should </em>sentence under these subsections is a contradiction in terms and would completely frustrate the valuable aid intended by subsection (e) and the specific wording of subsection (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sentencing under \u201cany other applicable penalty provision\u201d obviously includes 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312 and \u00a7 4208.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">Other appellate contentions made by defendant are without merit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\">. (e) If the court desires additional information as to whether a youth offender will derive benefit from treatment under subsections (b) or (c) it may order that he be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for observation and study at an appropriate classification center or agency. Within sixty days from the date of the order, or such additional period as the court may grant, the Division shall report to the court its findings.
