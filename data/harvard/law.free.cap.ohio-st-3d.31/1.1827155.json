The answer to this question is determinative of the main issue in this case, which is whether the taxes attributable to these gifts may be divided among the <em>inter vivos </em>donees under the Ohio Tax Apportionment Act, former R.C. 2113.85 <em>et seq. </em>(138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1130, 1142 <em>et seq.).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For the reasons that follow, we affirm the well-reasoned holding of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>R.C. 2113.86 stated that estate taxes \u201cshall be apportioned among all persons interested in the estate.\u201d R.C. 2113.85(B), in turn, provided that a \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d means \u201cany person who is entitled to receive, or who has received, from a decedent or by reason of the death of a decedent any property or property interest included in the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d The decedent\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d was defined in R.C. 2113.85(A) as \u201cthe gross estate of a decedent as determined for federal estate tax purposes under Subtitle B of the \u2018Internal Revenue Code of 1954,\u2019 68 Stat. 373, 26 U.S.C.A. 2001, as amended, and for Ohio estate tax purposes under Chapter 5731. of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">For federal estate tax purposes, the municipal bonds will be considered part of Mrs. Finke\u2019s estate only if they would be included therein by any of the sections of Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code. Upon review of these sections, we find no language which could be construed as including in an estate municipal bonds which were transferred, complete with all incidents of ownership, as <em>inter vivos </em>gifts by Mrs. Finke.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Section 2001 of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, U.S. Code) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">\u201c(a) Imposition. \u2014 A tax is hereby imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">\u201c(b) Computation of tax. \u2014 The tax imposed by this section shall be the amount equal to the excess (if any) of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">\u201c(1) a tentative tax computed in accordance with the rate schedule set forth in subsection (c) on the sum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">\u201c(A) the amount of the taxable estate, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">\u201c(B) the amount of the <em>adjusted taxable gifts, </em>over</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-12\">\u201c(2) the aggregate amount of tax which would have been payable under chapter 12 with respect to gifts made by the decedent after December 31, 1976 * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-13\">\u201cFor purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the term \u2018adjusted taxable gifts\u2019 means the total amount of the taxable gifts (within the meaning of section 2503) made by the decedent after December 31, 1976, <em>other than gifts which are includible in the gross estate of the decedent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">Section 2001 implies that certain gifts are excludible from a decedent\u2019s gross estate. It is clear that Congress did not intend to include all gifts in the definition of \u201ctaxable estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">Gifts that are includible in a gross estate are described in Subtitle B. They include gifts of property in which the decedent retained possession (Section 2036[a]), an interest (Section 2037[a]), or some other incident of ownership (Section 2038[a]) such as a power of revocation. Mrs. Finke transferred <em>all </em>of her right, title and interest in the bonds to the <em>inter vivos </em>donees. She retained no incidents of ownership with respect to the bonds. Clearly, none of these sections of Subtitle B would include Mrs. Finke\u2019s gifts in her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">This conclusion is bolstered by Section 2033, which states that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201cvalue of the gross estate shall include the value of all property <em>to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Mrs. Finke had no interest in the bonds at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Prior to the 1981 amendment of Section 2035, the bonds would have been considered part of Mrs. Finke\u2019s estate if the gifts had been made within three years of her death. See Section 2035(a). However, Section 2035 was amended in 1981 to provide in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">\u201c(d) Decedents dying after 1981.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">\u201c(1) In general. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, subsection (a) shall not apply to the estate of a decedent dying after December 31, 1981. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The three-year rule provided in Section 2035(a) does not apply to the transfer of the bonds in this case because Mrs. Finke died on February 22, 1984. It is clear that Congress meant to specifically exclude gifts such as those made by Mrs. Finke from the gross estate of a decedent dying after 1981, for otherwise it would not have amended Section 2035.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">For federal estate tax purposes, the municipal bonds were not a part of Mrs. Finke\u2019s estate. Since the <em>inter vivos </em>donees were not \u201cpersons interested in the estate\u201d under R.C. 2113.86, they should not have been required to pay the federal estate taxes attributable to the gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">For Ohio estate tax purposes, however, the bonds are includible in Mrs. Finke\u2019s estate if they are described as part of her estate by R.C. Chapter 5731. R.C. 5731.05(A) and (B), at the time relevant herein, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">\u201c(A) Except as provided in divisions (B) and (C) of this section, the value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property, to the extent of any interest therein, of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of his death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-12\">\u201c(B) Any transfer, except as provided in division (C) of this section, by trust or otherwise, made within a period of three years ending with the date of the decedent's death shall be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death, unless the contrary is shown. No transfer made before such three-year period shall be treated as having been made in contemplation of death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">Mrs. Finke transferred the bonds to the <em>inter vivos </em>donees on February 9, 1984. She died some two weeks later on February 22, 1984. Since the gifts were made within three years of her death, they must be deemed to have been made in contemplation of her death, unless a contrary showing is made. The <em>inter vivos </em>donees concede that the transfers were made in contemplation of death. Consequently, R.C. Chapter 5731 requires that the bonds be included in Mrs. Finke\u2019s estate for Ohio estate tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-14\">Where gifts are made by a donor prior to death, and such gifts are included in the donor\u2019s estate for Ohio estate tax purposes, the <em>inter vivos </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>donees are generally subject to apportionment of the tax under R.C. 2113.86 unless they are exempted by action of R.C. 2113.88. Thus, unless they fall under the exception provided in R.C. 2113.88, the <em>inter vivos </em>donees are \u201cpersons interested in the estate\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2113.86 and must pay the Ohio estate taxes attributable to the gifts of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">In relevant part, R.C. 2113.88 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">\u201cIn making an apportionment, <em>any </em>exemption, deduction, or <em>credit directly attributable to a particular </em>legacy, devise, or <em>gift shall inure to the benefit of the </em>legatee, devisee, or <em>donee.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">In the instant case, there was a Unified Gift Tax Credit directly attributable to the gift of the bonds. The United States Gift Tax Return filed by the executor shows that the credit was $53,712. However, the <em>inter vivos </em>donees' share of Ohio estate taxes was determined, by the trial court to be only $9,739.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">We hold that where a credit is directly attributable to gifts made by a donor prior to death, and the credit is greater than the amount of Ohio estate tax attributable to the gifts under R.C. 2113.86, the credit shall inure to the benefit of the <em>inter vivos </em>donees under R.C. 2113.88 so as to exempt them from apportionment of the tax. The Unified Gift Tax Credit in this case is clearly \u201cany\u201d credit within the meaning of R.C. 2113.88. Since the credit is greater than the Ohio estate tax attributable to the gifts, we conclude that the tax should not have been apportioned among the <em>inter vivos </em>donees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">In summary, the <em>inter vivos </em>donees should not have been required to pay any federal or Ohio estate taxes. The <em>inter vivos </em>gifts made by Mrs. Finke w\u00e9re properly excluded from her estate for federal estate tax purposes, and thus under R.C. 2113.86 the <em>inter vivos </em>donees were excluded from apportionment of the federal estate taxes since they were not \u201cpersons interested in the estate.\u201d Furthermore, while the gifts were properly included in Mrs. Finke\u2019s estate for Ohio estate,tax purposes, the <em>inter vivos </em>donees were not subject to apportionment of the Ohio estate taxes because they were covered by the exemption in R.C. 2113.88.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-12\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-12\"> All references to R.C. 2113.85 <em>et seq. </em>as they appear herein are to these statutes as enacted effective March 23, 1981.
