Appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion <em>in limine </em>which requested that the prosecutor be prohibited from presenting evidence of alleged acts of misconduct other than those charged in the indictment. Pursuant to this motion, the court ordered that the prosecutor address the court at a sidebar conference at any time he intended to bring in \u201cany evidence pertaining to similar acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">During appellant\u2019s trial, the court permitted testimony from Robert Knapik, the collection manager of Bank One, that Auto Cars had fifty-six cars leased, and that he believed that it was in violation of the lessor operating agreement. He further testified that he had written appellant to inform him that $437,563.81 was due. Appellant argues that this evidence did not relate to the 1980 Porsche involved in the seven counts of the indictment, and that the testimony suggested that appellant was involved in a gigantic scheme, involving numerous automobiles, to defraud Bank One. The prosecutor, in his closing argument, repeatedly implied that appellant was involved in numerous insurance frauds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee further argues that the objectionable testimony was admissible to show appellant\u2019s \u201cknowledge of previous frauds and his intent to continue in the same pattern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Evid R. 404(B) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">This Rule of Evidence is codified in R.C. 2945.59, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201cIn any criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">This court has held that R.C. 2945.59 is to be strictly construed against the state, and to be conservatively applied by a trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Burson </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 157, 67 O.O. 2d 174, 311 N.E. 2d 526; <em>State </em>v. <em>Strong </em>(1963), 119 Ohio App. 31, 26 O.O. 2d 134, 196 N.E. 2d 801. This court has previously cautioned lower courts against the sweeping admission of evidence under R.C. 2945.59:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">\u201cNowhere do the words \u2018like\u2019 or \u2018similar\u2019 appear in the statute. Prosecutors and trial courts should be particularly aware that evidence of other acts of a defendant is admissible [pursuant to R.C. 2945.59] <em>only </em>when it \u2018tends to show\u2019 one of the matters enumerated in * * * [that] statute and * * * when it is relevant to * * * [prove the defendant\u2019s guilt] of the offense in question. Such evidence is admissible, not because it shows that the defendant is crime prone, or even that he has committed an offense similar to the one in question, but in spite of such facts. * * *\u201d <em>Burson, supra, </em>at 158, 67 O.O. 2d at 175, 311 N.E. 2d at 528. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Hector </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 167, 48 O.O. 2d 199, 249 N.E. 2d 912; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkinson </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 308, 18 O.O. 3d 482, 415 N.E. 2d 261.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The same logic should apply to Evid. R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">The evidence offered by the state regarding delinquent loans by Bank One to Auto Cars is not relevant to proof of the guilt of the appellant of the offense in question. The alleged delinquency of Auto Cars in its car loan payments does not necessarily establish any wrongdoing by appellant; nor is there an illustrated connection between the alleged delinquent loans on the part of the appellant and the crimes for which he was charged and convicted: dealings with the 1980 Porsche.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">In this case we believe the state was impermissibly allowed to imply that appellant was involved in a large-scale operation to defraud banks and insurance companies without establishing a proper evidential predicate or nexus with the appellant for the admission of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The second issue before this court is whether the trial court permitted inadmissible hearsay evidence. Appellant argues that the major portions of the testimony of the Aetna claims adjuster Patricia Page, Bank One of Akron auditor Alvin Lindeman, and police investigator Detective Robert Kingzett were inadmissible hearsay, based on information received from unidentified sources of unknown reliability; speculation; and other material indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Evid R. 801(C) defines \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca statement other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d It is axiomatic that hearsay evidence is inadmissible unless it falls within the specific hearsay exceptions enumerated in the Rules of Evidence. Hence, we must focus our inquiry to determine if inadmissible hearsay was permitted, and if so, whether such exercise was harmless or prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">This court has previously held that in order to hold an error harmless, the error must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St. 3d 146, 23 OBR 315, 492 N.E. 2d 401; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 391, 2 O.O. 3d 495, 368 N.E. 2d 623, vacated in part on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 910; <em>State </em>v. <em>Abrams </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St. 2d 53, 68 O.O. 2d 30, 313 N.E. 2d 823; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18. This court has also held that an error in the admission of evidence is harmless if there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence may have contributed to the accused\u2019s conviction, and that in such cases there must be overwhelming evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt or some other indicia that the error did not contribute to the conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bayless </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 73, 2 O.O. 3d 249, 357 N.E. 2d 1035, vacated in part on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 911; <em>State </em>v. <em>Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E. 2d 768; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 160, 166, 5 OBR 380, 386, 450 N.E. 2d 265, 270, fn. 5, cited with approval in <em>Rahman, supra, </em>at 151, 23 OBR at 319, 492 N.E. 2d at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">At trial, Aetna claims adjuster Page testified, over objection, about her investigation regarding the reported theft of the 1980 Porsche.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>One of Akron auditor Lindeman testified about the relationship between Auto Cars and Bank One of Ravenna.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Detective Kingzett testified about his investigation of the entire insurance fraud operation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Significant parts of the testimony of these witnesses involved technical violations of the hearsay rule, without a balancing demonstration of trustworthiness or reliability. Each of these witnesses testified about many events for which he or she did not have firsthand knowledge. The dispositive question is whether the hearsay testimony of these witnesses constituted harmless error. The court of appeals found that where hearsay was admitted at the trial level, the admission of such hearsay was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In our view, the cumulative effect of these witnesses\u2019 hearsay testimony was prejudicial. Although violations of the Rules of Evidence during trial, singularly, may not rise to the level of prejudicial error, a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>viction will be reversed where the cumulative effect of the errors deprives a defendant of the constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Our final inquiry concerns the sufficiency of evidence to convict appellant of the crimes charged. Appellant argues that the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence to support his conviction for two counts of attempted grand theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02 and 2923.02, and his conviction for one count of possessing a proof of loss affidavit as a criminal tool, in violation of R.C. 2923.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">We find that there was sufficient evidence to convict appellant of the crimes charged; however, the errors noted above require a new trial. Thus, we must reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. This cause is remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-10\">Moyer, C.J., Doan, Wright and H.

I respectfully dissent from the foregoing analysis of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">I believe today\u2019s opinion will cause unnecessary confusion regarding the continued viability of the harmless error doctrine as enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 281, 6 OBR 345, 452 N.E. 2d 1323. The majority\u2019s decision contradicts the holding of that landmark decision, yet leaves the reader to question, totally without guidance, whether <em>Williams </em>is still good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">In paragraphs three and six of the syllabus in <em>Williams, supra, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-17\">\u201cTo be deemed nonprejudicial, error of constitutional dimension must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-18\">\u201cWhere constitutional error in the admission of evidence is extant, such error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if \u2022 the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-19\">Thus, even where <em>constitutional error </em>has been committed, such error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the remaining evidence constitutes overwhelming proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The record in the case now before us reveals that any error which may have occurred during the course of appellant\u2019s trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Initially, the court of appeals correctly noted, and a review of the record shows, that the vast majority of the hearsay evidence admitted in this case was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence. Thus, while the admission of such evidence was error, it clearly was not, and the majority readily admits, prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Moreover, the record reflects that appellant actively participated in the \u201cscheme\u201d to steal the 1980 Porsche. Appellant, on behalf of Richmond Associates, filed a fraudulent insurance claim for $30,000 with Aetna. Appellant additionally signed a sworn proof of loss statement and gave a tape-recorded statement to the Aetna claims adjuster,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in which he represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that he had driven the Porsche to New York City so that the front-end damage could be repaired, stored the repaired vehicle in his mother\u2019s garage for four months following the repairs and had personally instructed an Auto Cars, Inc. employee to retrieve the Porsche from New York, drive it to Pittsburgh and sell it to potential buyers in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">However, the record reveals that the Porsche was totally undrivable. The car had suffered such severe front-end damage that it could be transported only by a vehicle carrier. The record further shows that the Porsche was not in a drivable condition when appellant and Richmond Associates, in which appellant was a shareholder, leased the vehicle in 1982. Additionally, the record reveals that appellant did not drive, supervise or arrange to have the Porsche transported to New York for repairs and subsequent storage in his mother\u2019s garage. Finally, appellant did not direct the employee to take the car to Pittsburgh. The record clearly reflects that appellant did not know the employee was in Pittsburgh until the same employee <em>returned </em>from Pittsburgh and related the \u201cfacts surrounding the theft\u201d to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Therefore, while error did occur when certain hearsay evidence was admitted, that evidence was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence and therefore not prejudicial. Further, notwithstanding the admission of the tainted evidence, the properly admitted evidence constituted overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt and therefore was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and thereby affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-8\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">&lt;&lt;* * 4c</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> The tape-recorded statement given by appellant to the Aetna claims adjuster provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\u201cQ.
