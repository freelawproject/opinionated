The Superior Court <em>(Temple, </em>J.), approved the recommendation of a Master <em>(R. Peter Shapiro, </em>Esq.), who noted his inclination to adopt the defendant\u2019s argument for abolition of the action, but ruled that any such abolition was a \u201clegislative function.\u201d We disagree and hold that the action for criminal conversation is no longer available in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">The facts of this case may be briefly summarized. The plaintiff, Joan Feldman, married Ben Feldman in 1962. They had three children between 1963 and 1970, and during that time had a relatively settled relationship. In 1970, Ben acquired a job that called for extensive travel. From that time on, he was frequently absent from the family home for long periods of time, though he changed jobs often and was unemployed or self-employed on various occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Ben Feldman met the defendant Darlene, who was and is an airline stewardess, in Tokyo in 1970 or 1971. He told her that he was divorced. About eight months later they began to date regularly and to engage in sexual relations. In 1972 they moved into an apartment in Los Angeles, and in 1973 they went through a marriage ceremony in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. In 1976 they had a son.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">Also in 1976, Ben and Joan Feldman moved to Sharon, Massachusetts, and Ben and Darlene Feldman moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. In January 1977, Ben and Darlene Feldman purchased a condominium in Londonderry, with Darlene as sole titleholder. Ben\u2019s relationship with Joan continued to deteriorate, and when, in February 1981, Joan discovered his marriage to Darlene, she com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>menced divorce proceedings in Massachusetts. She later filed this action for criminal conversation, combined with an action for alienation of affections.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Though Darlene was served with process in the divorce action and in the present action, Ben assured her that the proceedings involved a mere technicality. She continued to live with Ben until the spring of 1982, when she returned with her son to California. She asked her attorney in New Hampshire to inquire into the legal status of Ben\u2019s marriage to Joan, and when the attorney advised her in March 1983 that Ben had lied about a previous divorce, she obtained an annulment of her marriage to Ben.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Joan\u2019s divorce was granted after a hearing in December 1982, and became final in June 1983. The decree ordered Ben to pay substantial amounts for alimony, child support, and other expenses, none of which had been paid by the time of the trial in this case. Darlene has not sought any support from Ben, either for herself or her son. She continued to work as an airline stewardess throughout her marriage to Ben, as well as before and after. Indeed, it appears that both Joan and Darlene provided the principal support for their respective families for several years prior to 1981, as Ben Feldman\u2019s various business ventures frequently lost money.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The master in this case ruled that the plaintiff had not sustained her burden of proof on the count for alienation of affections, because he found that Ben had deceived Darlene as to his marriage to Joan, and that \u201cDarlene did not intend to alienate Benjamin\u2019s affections as to Joan.\u201d <em>See Dube v. Rochette, </em>110 N.H. 129, 262 A.2d 288 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">On the count for criminal conversation, however, the master denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruled for the plaintiff and found damages in the amount of $35,000. He noted correctly that the plaintiff in such an action need only prove an occurrence of sexual intercourse between the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s spouse, and that the only possible defense to the action is consent or condonation by the plaintiff. <em>Cross v. Grant, </em>62 N.H. 675, 684-85 (1883). While noting the \u201clogic\u201d of the defendant\u2019s arguments for abolition of the action, the master ruled that \u201c[t]he legislative judgment to allow the continuance [of the cause of action] is one that must be recognized and respected.\u201d <em>See Dube v. Rochette, supra </em>at 129-30, 262 A.2d at 288-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">As a common-law tort, the action for criminal conversation is a creation of the judiciary. Consequently, \u201cit is the duty of the judiciary to examine it and make such changes as justice requires when the Legislature has chosen not to act.\u201d <em>Briere v. Briere, </em>107 N.H. 432, 434, 224 A.2d 588, 590 (1966). \u201cThe legislature expresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>its will by enacting laws, not by failing to do so. Furthermore, its inaction could be motivated by its assumption that if a judicially developed rule is unjust the courts will overrule it.\u201d <em>Merrill v. Manchester, </em>114 N.H. 722, 728, 332 A.2d 378, 382 (1974). It follows that the general rule of deference to the legislative intent has no application here, where the legislature has expressed no intent that the cause of action be retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">An action for criminal conversation may no longer be brought in a majority of American jurisdictions. Louisiana, which is not a common-law state, has never recognized the action. <em>See Moulin v. Monteleone, </em>165 La. 169, 172-73, 115 So. 447, 448-49 (1927). Twenty States and the District of Columbia have abolished the action by statute, while another (Illinois) has severely limited its scope. Ala. Code \u00a7 6-5-331 (1977); Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 43.5 (Deering 1971); Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-20-202 (1973); Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 52-572f (West Supp. 1984); Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 3924 (1975); D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-923 (Supp. V 1978); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 771.01 (1983); Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 105-1203 (Supp. 1982); III. Ann. Stat. ch. 68, \u00a7\u00a7 41-47 (SmithHurd 1959); Ind. Code Ann. \u00a7 34-4-4-1 (Burns Supp. 1983); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 600.2901 (1968); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 553.02 (1982); Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 41.380 (1979); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A.-23-1 (West 1952); N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \u00a7 80-a (McKinney 1976); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2305.29 (Page 1981); Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 30.850 (1983); Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00a7 4.05 (Vernon Supp. 1983); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, \u00a7 1001 (Supp. 1983); Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-220 (1977); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 768.01 (1981-82); Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 1-23-101 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Six other states have abolished it by judicial decision. <em>Bearbower v. Merry, </em>266 N.W.2d 128 (Iowa 1978); <em>Kline v. Ansell, </em>287 Md. 585, 414 A.2d 929 (1980); <em>Lynn v. Shaw, </em>620 P.2d 899 (Okla. 1980); <em>Fadgen v. Lenkner, </em>365 A.2d 147 (Pa. 1976); <em>Hunt v. Hunt, </em>309 N.W.2d 818 (S.D. 1981); <em>Irwin v. Coluccio, 32 </em>Wash. App. 510, 648 P.2d 458 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Commentators in recent years have invariably called for the action\u2019s abolition or for severe restrictions on its scope. <em>See, e.g., </em>Kavanagh, <em>Alienation of Affections and Criminal Conversation: Unholy Marriage in Need of Annulment, </em>23 Ariz. L. Rev. 323, 340 (1981); Note, <em>The Case for Retention of Causes of Action for Intentional Interference with the Marital Relationship, </em>48 Notre Dame Law. 426, 433-34 (1972) (hereinafter Notre Dame Note).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The reasons for this accelerating trend toward abolition are easily found. The action\u2019s potential for injustice, resulting principally from the lack of available defenses, is apparent in cases like the present one. As the master found, the defendant here did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>intend to harm any of the plaintiff\u2019s interests and had no reasonable grounds before 1981 either to disbelieve Ben Feldman\u2019s story of a prior divorce, or to foresee the possibility of a suit like this one. Yet none of these facts could help her avoid liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">This arbitrariness reflects the action\u2019s origin as a means of protecting the husband\u2019s absolute right to his wife\u2019s services. NOTRE Dame Note, <em>supra </em>at 427. The wife\u2019s consent to, or even initiation of, the adultery was no defense because \u201cit was thought at common law that a wife was not competent to give her consent so as to defeat her husband\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Fadgen v. Lenkner, supra </em>at 150 (citing <em>Tinker v. Colwell, </em>193 U.S. 473, 483 (1904)). The defendant\u2019s ignorance of the marriage was irrelevant because \u201c[a] man who has sexual relations with a woman, not his wife, assumes the risk that she is married.\u201d <em>Antonelli v. Xenakis, </em>363 Pa. 375, 378, 69 A.2d 102, 103 (1949). It was not necessary to show that the adultery caused a breakup of the marriage, or even that the husband and wife were living together at the time. <em>Cross v. Grant, </em>62 N.H. at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Later extension of the action to permit suits by wives as well as husbands, <em>Seaver v. Adams, </em>66 N.H. 142, 144, 19 A. 776, 777 (1889), and attempts to justify its existence as a means of compensating for \u201cthe loss of the comfort and society\u201d of a spouse resulting from that spouse\u2019s adultery, <em>Cross v. Grant, </em>62 N.H. at 683, have not eliminated either the action\u2019s potential for abuse or the flawed assumptions on which it is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In this regard, we agree with the assessment of the Oklahoma Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">\u201cThe action does not prevent human misconduct and the interests which the action seeks to protect are not protected by its existence. Viable contented marriages are not broken up by an outsider, and the harm engendered through the opportunity for blackmail and the ruination of defendant\u2019s reputation by the mere [bringing of the action far outweighs any reasons for its continuance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\"><em>Lynn v. Shaw, </em>620 P.2d at 902. More importantly, the action \u201cdiminishes human dignity,\u201d <em>id., </em>by treating spousal affection as a property right. \u201cThe love and affection of a human being who is devoted to another human being is not susceptible to theft.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Hunt, </em>309 N.W.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">The legislature recognized this principle when it effectively abolished the action for alienation of affections. RSA 460:2. It further recognized the inefficacy of arbitrary legal rules in preserving marital harmony when it authorized \u201cno-fault\u201d divorce. RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>458:7-a. Such statutes merely serve to confirm the lack of any viable legal rationale for the continued existence of a tort action which essentially seeks to punish an activity without reference to either the activity\u2019s motivation or its results. Accordingly, we hold that the tort of criminal conversation is no longer a valid cause of action in this State. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"AdJ\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
