The issue raised in this appeal is whether that ruling, which was made more than two years after the weeks affected, is barred by the two-year limitation in RSA 282-A:165 (Supp. 1983). The department ruled that the statute did not apply because of the fraudulent nature of the petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Upon briefing and oral argument, what should have been apparent to the court when it denied the State\u2019s motion for summary affirmance, dated August 23, 1984, has become clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">Disposition of this case does not require formal written opinion. Our decision in <em>Appeal of City of Rochester, </em>125 N.H. 399, 480 A.2d 181 (1984) is controlling, and the decision below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
