The defendant moved for declaration of mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor in his final argument improperly commented on the defendant\u2019s silence. The Superior Court <em>(Goode, </em>J.) denied the motion, subject to exception. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">The defendant objected to this portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">\u201cOnly that Lthe defendant] went in there and the fact that he tried to fool the police that day is more evidence of his guilt. He\u2019s attempting to pull the wool over the police\u2019s eyes and yours. Don\u2019t let him say that he\u2019s not guilty when, in fact, we know that he is guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">The defendant claims that the remarks violated his rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the National Constitution, which forbid \u201ccomment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence.\u201d <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965); <em>cf. </em>N.H. Const, pt. I, art. 15; RSA 516:32.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">The offending comment in <em>Griffin </em>referred expressly to the defendant\u2019s decision to keep silent: \u201c\u2018Essie Mae is dead, she can\u2019t tell you her side of the story. The defendant won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d 380 U.S. at 611. The prosecutor\u2019s language in the case before us made no such express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>reference to the defendant\u2019s silence. Rather, it accused him of trying to pull the wool over the jurors\u2019 eyes and of saying he was not guilty when he was guilty. Whatever may be the merits of these comments, they are not obviously comments on silence, and it is difficult to see that they would fall within the <em>Griffin </em>proscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there is any doubt on the issue, we turn to the standard as articulated in <em>Lussier v. Gunter, </em>552 F.2d 385 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 854 (1977), for determining the applicability'of the <em>Griffin </em>rule in questionable cases. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit adopted this test: \u2018\u201cwhether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to <em>testify;\u201d\u2019.Id. </em>at 389 (quoting <em>Knowles v. United States, </em>224 F.2d 168, 170 (10th Cir. 1955)). Judged on these criteria, the prosecutor\u2019s statement falls on the permissible side of the line. It manifested no intent to comment on more than the defendant\u2019s behavior before arrest and his plea of not guilty, and it would not have been necessary or natural for the jury to take it otherwise. While the fact of this appeal proves that the remark was ill-conceived, there was no violation of <em>Griffin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Since we find no violation, it is not necessary to consider the doctrine of harmless error under <em>United States v. Hasting, </em>103 S. Ct. 1974 (1983), or the standard for choosing between declarations of mistrial and curative instructions when error is not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
