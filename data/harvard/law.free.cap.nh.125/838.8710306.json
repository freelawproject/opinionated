The defendant argues that, absent a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel, the use of an uncounseled conviction to convert the sentence of a subsequent offense into a term of imprisonment violates the New Hampshire and federal constitutional guarantees of the right to counsel. N.H. Const, pt. I, art. 15; U.S. Const. amend. VI. After this question was transferred, we decided <em>State v. Cook, </em>125 N.H. 452, 481 A.2d 823 (1984). In light of <em>Cook, </em>we find the defendant\u2019s claim to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\"><em>Cook </em>held that uncounseled motor vehicle violation convictions could constitutionally support a decree of habitual offender status even though imprisonment resulted from violation of the decree. <em>Id. </em>at 458, 481 A.2d at 828; <em>see </em>RSA 262:23. Although <em>Cook </em>concerned a civil disability status, and not sentence enhancement, we believe that our opinion in <em>Cook </em>adequately addressed the State and federal constitutional issues before us in the present case. We therefore find it dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
