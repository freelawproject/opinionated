Wholesale Building Materials, Inc. and Accurate Roofing Co., Inc., to funds paid into court under a bill of interpleader filed by the plaintiff, R. C. Foss &amp; Sons, Inc. Brockhouse Corporation hired Foss as a general contracter to build a building in Wolfeboro. Foss subcontracted work to New Hampshire Roofing, Inc., which further subcontracted with Accurate. Accurate brought a related action against New Hampshire Roofing for money owed, and it obtained two attachments: a trustee attachment against Foss and a mechanic\u2019s lien attachment against Brock-house\u2019s building under construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">At the time of the mechanic\u2019s lien attachment, Brockhouse owed Foss $5000 on the contract. D.J. Wholesale has a security interest in the accounts receivable of New Hampshire Roofing. It obtained that interest after Accurate had completed work on Brockhouse\u2019s building but before Accurate brought action against New Hampshire Roofing. D.J. Wholesale has also succeeded to the rights of the Bank of New Hampshire, N.A., an earlier holder of a security interest in those same accounts receivable, obtained before any of the events in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">The Bank asserted its rights to the funds in Foss\u2019 hands as against Accurate\u2019s rights under the trustee attachment. Foss then filed the present bill of interpleader and paid the funds in question into court. Although D.J. Wholesale successfully moved to intervene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>in the present action by pleading its rights as assignee of the Bank, the rights of the Bank were not thereafter adjudicated, and the superior court determined D.J. Wholesale\u2019s position on the basis of its own security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">On motion of Foss, the Superior Court <em>(Temple, </em>J.) released Accurate\u2019s trustee attachment against Foss and the mechanic\u2019s lien attachment against Brockhouse. Accurate does not appeal these releases. All issues have been resolved except the relative priorities of the claims of D.J. Wholesale and Accurate. As between them, the Court <em>{Temple, </em>J.) approved the conclusion of the Master <em>{Charles T. Gallagher, </em>Esq.), with which the parties agree, that the security interest of D.J. Wholesale would give its claim against the funds paid into court priority over Accurate\u2019s claim under the trustee attachment, subject to one qualification that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Accurate argues that its mechanic\u2019s lien attachment took precedence over all other disputed claims, to the extent of the $5000 owed by Brockhouse to the general contractor, Foss. <em>See </em>RSA 447:6. Accurate therefore claims priority to the extent of $5000 of the funds paid into court by Foss. In effect, the master accepted this position in ruling that New Hampshire Roofing had no account receivable from Foss to the extent that Accurate had obtained an enforceable mechanic\u2019s lien for the value of a portion of the materials and labor covered by the contract. This ruling was the basis for a second master\u2019s report accepted by the Superior Court <em>{Wyman, </em>J.). The effect of this ruling was to give priority to Accurate\u2019s claim to the first $5000 of the money paid into court. D.J. Wholesale claims this was error. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">A subcontractor\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien under RSA 447:5, like the contractor\u2019s lien under RSA 447:2, is \u201ca lien on any material . . . furnished and on . . . [the] structure, and on any right of the owner to the lot of land on which it stands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accurate\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien therefore encumbered the property of Brockhouse but it did not encumber the funds paid into court in this case. The bill of inter-pleader related only to the funds. While all parties concerned could have agreed to substitute the funds for the Brockhouse property, and to consider the mechanic\u2019s lien in determining the priorities as between Accurate and D.J. Wholesale, they did not make any such agreement. After the mechanic\u2019s lien was released, the funds paid into court in this action remained subject to the same claims as before the release, the claims of Accurate under a trustee attachment and of D.J. Wholesale under a security interest. However their claims should have been resolved, it was error to prefer Accurate\u2019s claim on the basis of the former mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>In view of this conclusion we do not consider the second issue raised on this appeal, about the validity of the former mechanic\u2019s lien. The case is remanded for entry of an order consistent with the remainder of the master\u2019s report and the parties\u2019 agreement, giving priority to the claims of D.J. Wholesale to the funds deposited in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b575-5\">Douglas, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
