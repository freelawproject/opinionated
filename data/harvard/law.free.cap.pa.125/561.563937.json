Ct.; court below, No. 362 September Term 1885, C. P. No. 4 in Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-13\">On September 23, 1885, John Mirkil filed against Samuel Morgan, George Evans and John D. Grover, a bill in equity charging them with the erection and maintenance of a nuisance to the injury of the plaintiff, and praying for an injunction, and for a decree awarding damages. Answers having been filed by the defendants, on December 26, 1885, the court appointed <em>Mr. James P. </em>Townsend, examiner and master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-14\">On December 1, 1887, the master made a report, reviewing at length the testimony which had been adduced before him, and, finding that it was not certainly proved that the injuries complained of by the plaintiff were caused by the negligence or unlawful conduct of the defendants, and that the result of the proofs in the case was to leave the matter at best in a doubtful state, he recommended a decree dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>To this report the plaintiff filed sixteen exceptions, inter alia, the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-4\">\u201c 1. The master erred in finding that the plaintiff\u2019s bill should be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-5\">\u201c 2. The master erred in reporting that the plaintiff\u2019s bill should be dismissed, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-6\">\u201c 3. The master erred in not recommending a decree for the complainant, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">\u201c 4. The master erred in riot awarding damages against the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">The said exceptions having been overruled by the master were renewed before the court, and after argument, the court, Thayer, P. J., without any opinion filed, made the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-9\">\u201c Now, June 15, 1888, ordered that exceptions 1, 2, 3 and 4 filed by the complainant be sustained, and that the case be referred back to the master to report what damages have been sustained by the complainant, and to report a proper decree in favor of the plaintiff and against defendants; both parties to be allowed to produce any additional evidence upon the subject of damages which the master may consider to be material and proper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-10\">On October 6,1888, the master made a supplemental report setting out that having considered the testimony of the witnesses called upon the subject, he had ascertained the damages resulting to the plaintiff from water from the defendants\u2019 mill, to be fully covered by an award to him of the sum of $250, and reported a form of decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-11\">To this'report both the plaintiff and the defendants filed exceptions. These exceptions being overruled by the master, they were renewed in the court and after argument, the court, Thayer, P. J., without opinion filed, entered the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-12\">\u201cNow, December 8, 1888, exceptions dismissed, and it is ordered and decreed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-13\">\u201c 1. That the respondents and each of them be perpetually enjoined and restrained from suffering or permitting the escape of water from the factory, in the bill described, into the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>erty of tbe complainant, No. 1921 East Huntingdon street, adjoining the same, to the injury thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-5\">\u201c 2. That the said respondents pay to the said complainant the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-6\">\u201c 3. That the respondents pay the cost of the cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-7\">Thereupon the defendants took this appeal, assigning errors.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-8\"><em>Mr. R. O. Moon </em>(with him <em>Mr. Arundel), </em>for the appellants, was stopped by the court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"A_3\">Mr. Chief Justice Paxson :</author>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">When this case was called for argument it was discovered that the court below had entered what was practically a pro forma decree. The findings of the master had been reversed without an opinion or a line to indicate upon what grounds or for what reason the reversal had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">To reverse a master\u2019s findings without assigning any reason, is simply an act of arbitrary power, and practically leaves his findings in full force. To hear a case under such circumstances would be the precise equivalent of hearing it upon the exceptions without the intervention of the court below. This we decline to do. It is the duty of that court to give us all the assistance it can, especially in view of the crowded condition of our list, and the heavy labor involved in the disposition of it. These remarks apply with peculiar force to equity cases, where, as here, there is a master\u2019s report, and a large amount of testimony. Every such case is entitled to the careful consideration of the Court of Common Pleas in which it is heard, and we should have the views of the learned judge, who decided it, upon the facts and the law. This is useful and desirable in all cases : it is absolutely essential where the master is reversed by the court. We have time and again sent cases back where a pro forma decree has been entered, and as this is the equivalent of a pro forma decree it must take the same course.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">We have no doubt the omission in this instance was through inadvertence on the part of the court below, and that when the attention of the learned judge who heard the case is called to it, he will cheerfully correct it, and place upon the record his reasons for reversing the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">Let the record be sent down for that purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
