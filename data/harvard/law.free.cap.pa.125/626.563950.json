Although he had paid the purchase money no deed was made to him. From 1872 to 1886 he erected a dwelling house and made various improvements on the land. In 1883 two small judgments were entered against him. The undisputed testimony was that no written application was made for the insurance by the plaintiff; that the agent of the defendant company came to his house and solicited him to insure in the defendant company; that no representations were made by the plaintiff that the property was not incumbered in any way, and no questions were asked by the agent whether or not there were any liens of any character against the plaintiff\u2019s property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-5\">Under this state of facts the jury were instructed to find for the plaintiff, subject to the reserved question of law whether or not under that clause of the policy which stipulates in these words: \u201c Or if the property, or any part thereof, shall be sold, conveyed, encumbered by mortgage or otherwise,\u201d the policy written was a valid and binding one, and the defendant company liable for the amount claimed by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-6\">The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for @712.18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-7\">Subsequently the court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff upon the question of law reserved.
