Pinkerton et al., executors of John Todd deceased, to attach a legacy held by said executors for Mary A. Evans under the will of John Todd, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>father.

L. 486, authorizing the attachment of legacies by foreign attachment, provides that the act, \u201cshall not extend to legacies and distributive shares of married women.\u201d The court discharged the rule on the ground that the act of April 11,1848, P.

The defendant lives in the state of Illinois, and has property coming to her from her father\u2019s estate in Chester county. The plaintiff in this action, learning that fact, and having a claim against her, issued an attachment attaching her interest in her father\u2019s estate. He proceeded in the state of Illinois and obtained judgment against her for the sum of $69, with $5.05 costs; and he has sent that judgment to this state properly certified under the act <em>of </em>assembly, so as to make it evidence in our court. The defendant objects to this chiefly upon legal grounds, but has nothing to say against the fact as it is presented by the plaintiff. The defendant asks the court to say to you :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-11\">1.

A married woman\u2019s legacy is not subject to the process of foreign attachment, but is expressly excepted by the act of 1842. Hence there is no statute authorizing the attachment. There are no words in the act of 1848 that are in conflict with the proviso of the act of 1842, or inconsistent with its remaining the law. To repeal a law by implication the intent or repealing clause must be clear: Sifred v. Commonwealth, 104 Pa. 179. All process of execution is a creature of statutes. As regards execution or attachment against legacies of married women, if there is no statute, to say that the process of attachment, by virtue of the act of 1848, extends to married women\u2019s legacies, is to create such a statute by implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-14\">2. The transcript of the justice was barred by the statutes of limitation of Pennsylvania. Lex fori and not lex loci contractus applies: Hoag v: Dessan, 1 Pittsb. 390. \"Parol, specialty, and record,\u201d are the forms of contract or evidence of debt: 2 Shars. Bl. Com. 462, n. 25. The forum of a justice of the peace is not a court of record: Snyder v. Wise, 10 Pa. 158. There is nothing about this transcript to constitute it a specialty. It is not entered in the prothonotary\u2019s office or Common Pleas, and is not of record. Is it not simply a statement of the claim and no more than a simple contract ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>Mr. H. H. </em>Gilkyson, for tlie defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-5\">1. The proviso to the act of 1842 has been repealed by the act of 1848. The act of 1848 created a radical change in the rights and liabilities of married women. Certain rights were secured to her and certain liabilities imposed. The act provides that her property shall be hers absolutely, and places it beyond the reach of her husband\u2019s creditors, but liable for her own debts, contracted for nec\u00e9ssaries. The act also provides a remedy for the collection of those debts, and clearly authorizes the issuing of execution, and that levy and satisfaction be made out of the separate property of the wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-6\">2. The transcript of the justice\u2019s judgment was admissible. Such a judgment is not within the purview of the act of congress of 1790,1R. S. U. S. \u00a7 905, which provides for the proper authentication of judgments and judicial records of sister states. The method of proof and authentication of judgments of justices of the peace of other states, is provided for in this state by the act of March 29, 1860, P. L. 342, and this judgment having been so proven, is entitled to the same faith and credit that attaches to it in the state of Illinois. The act of congress of 1790, only presents a general mode of authentication of records; it does not exclude any other evidence which the courts of a particular state may deem expedient; other evidence, good, according to established principle, independently of the act of congress, may be admitted: Snyder v. Wise, 10 Pa. 158; Ohio v. Hinchman, 27 Pa. 485; Kean v. Rice, 12 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 308; Otto v. Trump, 115 Pa. 430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-7\">3. That an action on this judgment was not barred by the statute of limitations, \u00a7 1, act of March 27, 1731, 1 Sm. L. 76, is shown by the words of the statute, which are as follows: \u201c All actions of debt, grounded upon any lending or contract, without specialty, all actions of debt for arrearages of rent..... shall be commenced and sued within six years next after the cause of such actions or suits and not after.\u201d This action is within neither the words nor the intention of the legislature. It is not founded upon a contract of any hind, but upon a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, entered, against the defendant after due process of law, and personal service upon her.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Adp\">Mr. Justice Williams :</author>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The claim of the plaintiff is for necessaries furnished to Mary A. Evans, who was \u25a0 then and still is a married woman. She was domiciled in Chicago in the state of Illinois, where she contracted for the goods with Cleary, a grocer of the same city. The statutes of Illinois provide that a married woman may make contracts and incur liabilities in the same manner as if she was unmarried, and that such contracts \u00a7nd liabilities may be enforced against her separately; with the proviso that she may not enter into a partnership contract without his consent, unless he has deserted her or become insane or is confined in the penitentiary. Section 15 of chapter 68 of the statutes of Illinois also provides that \u201c the expenses of the family and the education of the children shall be chargeable upon the property of both husband and wife, or of either of them, in favor of creditors therefor ; and in relation thereto they may be sued jointly or separately.\u201d Under the laws of the state in which the parties were domiciled and the contract for necessaries made, Mrs. Evans was competent to contract and liable to be sued in the same manner as if she had not been married. Cleary brought an action upon the contract of Mrs. Evans against her alone, and recovered a judgment before a justice of the peace in the city of Chicago for the amount of the necessaries furnished her. In 1885 this action was brought in the Common Pleas of Chester county by foreign attachment, and a legacy due Mrs. Evans was attached. It is now urged that the legacy was protected from attachment by the proviso in the foreign attachment law of 1842; that there can be no recovery against her without her husband is joined in the action and judgment; and that the statute of limitations is a defence to this action, as the action was not brought within six years after the rendition of the judgment in Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The act of 1848 restrained the marital rights of the husband and relieved him from liability for debts contracted by his wife before marriage. It secured to her the ownership and enjoyment of her separate property, but it subjected it to seizure for her debts contracted before marriage, for necessaries contracted for by her after marriage, and for her torts. For debts and demands belonging to the classes just enumerated, the act of 1848 declares that executions \u201c may be levied upon and satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>fied out ..of the separate property of the wife secured to her under the provisions of the first section of this act.\u201d This language is comprehensive enough to embrace legacies and distributive shares due to married women and subject them to seizure for demands like that on which this attachment issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">As to the non-joinder of the husband, it is only necessary to say that the contract which the plaintiff is seeking to enforce was not made in this state, where prior to the act of 1887 such joinder was necessary, but in the state of Illinois, where Mrs. Evans lived, and where she was competent to contract and liable to be sued without regard to her husband. In all matters relating to the remedy merely, the lex fori prevails, but the liability of a party to a contract depends on the lex loci contractus : Greenwood v. Curtis, 6 Mass. <em>358; </em>Swan v. Swan, 21 Fed. Rep. 299; Thompson v. Ketcham, 8 Johns. 146; Smith\u2019s and Wolff\u2019s Appeal, 104 Pa. 381. This question was also considered in the recent case of Spearman v. Ward, 114 Pa. 634, in which an effort was made to enforce the contract of a married woman made in Ohio. The action was against her, and it failed, not because the contract was not clearly proved, but because it did not appear that she was competent to make it, and liable upon it, by the laws of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The remaining question is, whether the statute of limitations is a bar to this action. The plaintiff\u2019s right of action upon a transcript of a judgment, rendered by a justice of the peace of another state, is given b'y the act of 1845. In the fourth section it is provided, that \u201c the plaintiff, or the party in interest in such cases, shall, as evidence of his demand, produce on the trial a copy* of the record or docket-entry of the proceedings had before the justice who tried the original action, with his affidavit thereunto annexed, certifying the same to be a true and full copy of the record of the proceedings had before him, and that the judgment remains in force, and has not, to his knowledge, been vacated, annulled, or in any manner satisfied.\u201d This certificate is to be supplemented by one from the clerk of the court of Common Pleas of the county, setting forth that the person before whom the proceedings purport to have been had, was at the time an acting justice of the peace, duly commissioned and qualified. This \u201c copy of the record or docket-entry of the. proceedings \u201d is admitted under the authority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>this statute as proof of the fact that the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant in the state from which it is brought, and upon it the plaintiff is entitled to recover a judgment here, unless the defendant can show some reason for refusing it. This copy of a justice\u2019s judgment does not have the conclusive effect given to the judgment of a court of record, but it is evidence prima facie of what appears upon its face, viz., that the liability of the defendant has been passed upon by a court competent to do so, and a judgment rendered against him. It is not the note or account sued on in the state from which the transcript comes, but the judgment rendered upon it that is the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and that is evidenced in the manner prescribed by the act of assembly. The note or account has been merged in tbe judgment rendered upon it by tbe foreign justice, and makes no part of tlie plaintiff\u2019s case. The statute cannot be interposed, therefore, unless applicable to tbe justice\u2019s judgment. No statute of Illinois lias been brought to our attention which puts tlie judgment of a justice of tbe peace on tbe same footing witb ordinary simple contract debts as to tbe statute of limitations, and in tlie absence of proof upon tbe subject tbe law of Illinois will be presumed to be tlie same as our own. The statute of limitations does not take effect upon the judgment of a justice of the peace in Pennsylvania at the end of six years, and is not a defence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
