The application when filed was accompanied by a label which had been used on bottles or packages of beer. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u25a0contains a female figure holding aloft and inspecting a glass of the beer in the rajs of a blazing sun. Above her appear the words \u201cCrystal Pale,\u201d and on a scroll beneath appears the word \u201cBeer,\u201d in gilt letters, over the name of the applicant. Upon objection raised to \u201cCrystal Pale,\u201d the appellant amended so as to claim the word \u201cCrystal,\u201d and filed a drawing showing that word only.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The application having been finally denied by the Examiner, -appeal was taken to the Commissioner, who affirmed the decision of the Examiner. The denial was on the ground that the word \u201cCrystal\u201d is descriptive of a characteristic or quality of the goods upon which it is used. It is shown by reference to the Century Dictionary, and certain others therein quoted, that the word \u201ccrystal\u201d is frequently, if not commonly, used as clear, transparent, pellucid. The expression \u201cclear as crystal\u201d is frequently applied to liquids by persons who probably have mo idea of the primary or technical meaning of the word. As applied to beer the word would import that it is clear, transparent; that is, light, clear beer as distinguished from other beers that are dark or black. That it was intended by the applicant to represent this quality is apparent from the figure on \u2022the label, of the woman holding up a glass of the beverage and \u25a0examining it in the rays of the sun.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We think that the Commissioner was right in holding it descriptive within the meaning of the statute. See Re <em>American Circular Loom Co. </em>28 App. D. C. 450; Re <em>National Phonograph Co. </em>29 App. D. C. 142; <em>Worster Brewing Corp. </em>v. <em>Reuter &amp; Co. </em>30 App. D. C. 428; <em>Winchester Repeating Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Peters Cartridge Co. </em>30 App. D. C. 505; <em>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co. </em>v. <em>Old Lexington Club Distilling Co. </em>31 App. D. C. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The decision must be affirmed. It is so ordered, and that the clerk certify this decision to the Commissioner of Patents ms required by law. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
