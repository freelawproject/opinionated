July 27, 1905, this application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>was denied by tbe Examiner on the ground that \u201cMountain Dew\u201d is a term commonly applied to and descriptive of whisky. December 21, 1905, applicant filed a substitute for the original, in which he alleged continuous and exclusive use of the words as a trademark for ten years next preceding the passage of the trademark act of February 20, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">This application was passed for publication, and, later, an interference was declared between it and an application for registration of the same words, filed by Robertson, Sanderson, <em>&amp; </em>Company, Limited, on November 23, 1905. The latter, a firm engaged as liquor dealers in Leith, Scotland, claimed the use of the words as a trademark for Scotch whisky in Great Britain, since the year 1846, and also for trademark use in this country. The evidence on their behalf showed the use in Great Britain, and one sale and shipment of a small lot of whisky with said brand to a grocery merchant in Philadelphia in February, 1883. There was no evidence of any further shipments to this country until August, 1894, when they established an agency in the city of New York, and since which time, through said agents and their successors, they have sold large quantities of their goods, branded as aforesaid. The brand was also advertised in trade journals and agents\u2019 price lists.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">The evidence on behalf of Dennehy &amp; Company showed that their predecessors in title to the trademark had commenced the use of the same in 1882, and had continuously used it in interstate trade since that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">The Examiner of Interferences awarded priority to Dennehy &amp; Company, and Robertson, Sanderson, &amp; Company, appealed to the Commissioner. It is unnecessary to state the grounds upon which he denied the effect of the foreign use by them, as they contented themselves, before the Commissioner, with opposing the registration of their opponents, and have not appealed from his decision denying registration to both parties.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-7\"><em>Mr. Arthur E. Wallace </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-8\"><em>Mr. Marcellus Bailey </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b381-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Mr. Chief Justice Shepard</author>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">As the Commissioner did not question the right of Dennehy <em>&amp; </em>Company to claim registration, both as a technical trademark, and by reason of the ten years\u2019 use, under his substituted application, we will follow his example, but without intending to approve or disapprove the practice. He considered, first, the right to registration as a technical trademark, and denied it for reasons stated in the following extract from his opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u201cThe question of whether the words \u2018Mountain Dew,\u2019 when applied to whisky, are \u2018descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods,\u2019 so as to render them ineligible to registration as a technical trademark under the first part of sec. 5, of the trademark act, will be considered first. Judicial notice is taken of the fact that it is a matter of common knowledge that the term \u2018Mountain Dew\u2019 means whisky and is defined in the Century, Worcester, Webster, and Standard Dictionaries as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201c \u2018Mountain-dew. Whisky, especially Highland whisky. [Scotch.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\u201c \u2018The shepherds who had all come down from the mountain heights and were collected together (not without a quench of the mountain-dew or water of life) in a large shed. J. Wilson, Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life, p. 305.\u2019 (Century Diet. 1890 ed.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201c \u2018Mountain-dew. Scotch Highland whisky that has paid no duty.\u2019 (Worcester Diet. 1865 &amp; 1902 eds.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">\u201c \u2018Mountain-dew. Illicitly distilled whisky; so called from being very commonly made among the mountains.\u2019 (Standard Diet. 1895 ed.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">\u201cIt is unnecessary to cite others than these commonly accepted authorities which are conveniently at hand. They show conclusively that the words \u2018Mountain-Dew\u2019 commonly mean whisky, or a particular kind of whisky.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">He also referred to certain testimony of Dennehy to the effect that the trademark was suggested' to him by an Irish sales<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>man. who said that \u201cthe words \u2018Mountain Dew/ in Ireland, are suggestive of whisky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">We agree with the Commissioner that the words \u201cMountain Dew,\u201d however fanciful the term may originally have been, are now generally recognized as meaning whisky; and we deem it unnecessary to add anything to his discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The Commissioner was clearly right in denying registration under the \u201cten years clause\u201d of the trademark act, because the evidence shows that the use by Dennehy &amp; Company was not an actual, exclusive use of the same for ten years next preceding the passage of the trademark act. <em>Worster Brewing Corp. </em>v. <em>Rueter &amp; Co. </em>30 App. D. C. 428, 431; <em>Natural Food Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>30 App. D. C. 348, 351; <em>Brown-Forman Co. </em>v. <em>Beech Hill Distilling Co. </em>30 App. D. C. 485, 486; <em>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co. </em>v. <em>Old Lexington Club Distilling Co. </em>31 App. D. C. 223, 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The decision must be affirmed. It is so ordered, and the clerk will certify this decision to the Commissioner of Patents, as required by the statute. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
