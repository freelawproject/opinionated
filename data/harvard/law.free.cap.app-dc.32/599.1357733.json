That improvement in the art of building a concrete bridge comprising laying a pavement, erecting centers upon, the pavement, then erecting the bridge and spandrel approximately to the coping, then adding earth loading, then creating forms for coping and railing, then manipulating the centers to-cause the bridge to assume its principal stresses, then completing coping and railing, and. subsequently removing centers and forms.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-9\">Applicant states that the generally recognized method of constructing arched bridges consists in erecting centerings,- and then erecting the arch ring, the spandrel walls, coping, railings,, and filling complete before the removal of the centerings, so-that the practically finished structure, including the roadway proper, is supported upon the centering or falsework until the concrete or mortar has properly set. By this process, the entire structure, upon the removal of the centering, is at once subjected to all of its settlement stresses, from which cracks inevitably result, with sagging of the coping and railing immediately above the crown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>By applicant\u2019s method, piers or abutments are first erected. Centering is then erected between these, the arch ring is produced, and the lower portions of the spandrels are erected while the centering is still in place. The extension of the spandrel walls upwardly is not definitely stated. The centering is then withdrawn so that the arch is subjected to its settlement stresses. The sagging at any point through this settling may then be compensated before the coping is added, thus \u25a0enabling it to remain true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-5\">The Primary Examiner rejected all of the claims made on references to the following publications: Engineering News, Yol. 50, p. 427 (description of the Big Muddy river bridge) ; Idem. Yol. 28, p. 49 (description of Goir Noir bridge construction) ; Transaction of the American Society of Civil Engineers, vol. 17, pp. 210, 212. He said: \u201cIt is a matter of common knowledge among mechanics of the building trades that if superstructure is begun upon a foundation that has not had time to settle, the walls of the superstructure will be likely to crack. This is, of course, because tensional stresses are set up in the superstructure. This principle is all that is included in the alleged \u2018method\u2019 disclosed in this application. The application is a mere attempt to obtain a patent for the application of this principle to the building of a bridge, and it is thought, even without references, that a valid patent could not be issued therefor. It is the custom among engineers when building a succession of arches to provide timber for centering for only part of the arches when the exigencies of the construction will allow, construct the arch rings for part \u25a0of the arches, remove the centers, and use the same timber for \u25a0other arches. This is shown in the reference to the building of the Big Muddy river bridge. The railroad now building from southern Florida to Key West is an example of the case where many arches in succession are to be built, in some cases extending over 2 or 3 miles.\u201d The Primary Examiner attached no importance to the suggestion that the application is limited to concrete construction alone. He said: \u201cIt is not seen to make the slightest difference, in. contemplating a \u2018method,\u2019 of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>material the arch is made. The settlement of a brick arch after the building of superstructure will introduce tensile strains-as will the settlement of a concrete arch. This is graphically illustrated by the effect of this decentering, as described by Major Medley, 1863.\u201d (This refers to one of the publications cited).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-5\">The Examiners-in-Chief, to whom applicant appealed, took a different view. They said: \u201cNone of the references cited, by the Examiner discloses the idea' of erecting the footings, the arch or girder and a part of the superstructure of spandrel of a concrete bridge, allowing the parts to settle by loosening or releasing the falsework of the bridge so that the structure assumes the principal stresses, and then completing the superstructure. The object of this method of construction is to prevent the settlement stresses from cracking the superstructure of the completed bridge. * * * The Examiner refers to a number of publications as anticipating appellant\u2019s improvement, but these citations, while revealing the idea of allowing a bridge structure to settle under load before the spandrels are added, do not describe the partial completion of the spandrels of a concrete bridge, the subsequent settling of this partially completed structure, and the final completion of the spandrels.\u201d They, however, reversed the Examiner\u2019s decision as to the last six claims only, twenty to twenty-five inclusive. Their view was that the appellant\u2019s invention is confined specifically to bridges of entire concrete construction, and that the first nineteen claims, not being so limited, were not allowable, under the application. Some of those claims it will be observed, fail to specify that any part of the structure is made of concrete or plastic material, while others limit the plastic material .construction to certain parts only, of the bridge structure.. For this reason they affirmed the denial of claims one to nineteen, inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-7\">The Commissioner approved the reasoning of the Examiners-in-Chief, and affirmed their decision.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b630-8\"><em>Mr. Chester Bradford </em>and <em>Mr. Arthur M. Hood </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>Mr. Webster 8. Ruchman </em>for the Commissioner of Patents-</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b631-5\">Mr. Chief Justice Shepard</author>\n<p id=\"Aml\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We must confess to being strongly impressed with the reasoning of the Primary Examiner on the general question of patent-ability, in view of the common knowledge of the art, and the descriptions of former bridge constructions contained in the several publications referred to by him. But we are of the opinion that consideration of that question is precluded by the decisions subsequent to his. The conclusion of the Examiner was. denied, and as a consequence six of the claims denied by him have been allowed, and a patent containing them will be granted, no matter what may be the result of this appeal, for we have no jurisdiction to review the decision as to them. We are constrained, therefore, to confine our consideration to the question whether the applicant is to be limited to claims based on an entire concrete construction, where a portion of the spandrel is integrally formed with the arch. We do not agree with the two last tribunals, which substantially held that the description of the invention is confined to a bridge constructed wholly of plastic material. At the time of this application these arched bridges had usually been constructed of brick or stone, although concrete was then coming more and more into use as a substitute. The method of the applicant is applicable in. constructions of the three several materials, though, evidently, he had plastic materials particularly in mind. He says in his application that his invention relates to girder and arch bridges, \u201cwhich are made of concrete or other suitable material.\u201d Other suitable material must be brick or stone joined with mortar. The apparent object of applicant\u2019s method is to decrease the size and thickness of the arch, thereby effecting a saving of material and labor, as well as enabling the use of less material for centering where several additional arches are to be erected. This is as desirable in the use of one kind of material as in another. In another part of his specification he says: \u201cAf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ter completing the arch or girder, and while waiting for it to harden while striking or removing the centers, the forms of the spandrel and railing, <em>if to be of concrete, </em>may be built so \u2022that after the centers are removed from the structure the only work required to complete it is the placing of the concrete in the forms. The work may be so divided that only the railing, forms of the railing and coping forms will require filling with concrete after releasing the centers.\u201d We agree with the Primary Examiner that it makes no difference in contemplating a \u2018method\u2019 of what material the arch is made; and we likewise think it makes no difference of what material the spandrel is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Without going into the question of the patentable novelty \u25a0of any of the claims in view of the references to the prior art, we are of the opinion that the conclusion in respect of the six claims that were allowed warranted the allowance of all of the \u2022others. Upon that ground, and for that reason alone, we are constrained to reverse the decision as to the first nineteen claims, the allowance of which is the only question for determination. It is ordered that the decision be reversed, and this decision certified to the Commissioner of Patents as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">\n<em>Beversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
