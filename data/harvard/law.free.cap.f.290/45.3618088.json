Evidence of the preliminary oral and written negotiations was offered by the plaintiff and admitted, apparently without objection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>presumably upon the theory that the written contract was not in terms sufficiently plain and unambiguous. Menage v. Rosenthal, 175 Mass. 358, 56 N. E. 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Wollenberg, the plaintiff\u2019s general manager, testified that his company began business with the defendant .in August, 1920, selling it oil delivered in October, 1920; that on September 13, 1920, he wrote Smith, the defendant\u2019s purchasing agent, that he had not forgotten his \u201cpromise to take up with you your fuel oil requirements for next year\u201d; that later Smith showed him statistics as to the rate at which the mills had been using oil, more being required in winter; that he\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am-\">\u2018\u00bfstated distinctly to Smith that the form of contract that we could and would make with him would be one to cover their requirements up -to some definite maximum to be clearly set forth. I told him that we, in making such\" contract, not only with one company, but with many companies, and having such contracts on our books, were in the position of \u2018holding the bag\u2019; that is to say, if the requirements of customers fell below their estimates, we would be left with oil on our hands not sold, and would have been prohibited from previously selling it. I told him that that situation had caused us a good deal of concern, and that as one protection, although not entirely adequate, but as one protection against that \u2014 I told Mr. Smith that any contracts that we were making covering extended periods included a provision for an option to ourselves, to extend the' contract period in the event that the buyer, by reason of having improperly or incorrectly estimated his requirements, failed to take the maximum quantity covered by the contract, within the period stated. I called attention to that very specifically and pointed out to him in the conversation that the contract dated August 27, previously executed,' between the same parties covering deliveries to be finished up in 45 or 50 days, did not carry any such option clause. Mr. Smith said to me that he understood the situation, that he comprehended the situation, and said nothing- which indicated any objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Smith then in Wollenberg\u2019s presence dictated a letter saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cWe hereby accept your proposition to supply us with approximately 500,000 barrels, * * * approximately 45,000 barrels per month under norm\u00e1l conditions. * * * It is understood you will submit to us the contract in triplicate, covering the proposition in general.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Eater, the estimate was raised to 550,000 barrels, and the contract, supra, was so written. Smith did not testify. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Defendant\u2019s learned counsel strenuously contend that, notwithstanding the extension clause, the contract still, remains a requirement contract. They stress the familiar rules that, in a contract drawn by plaintiff, ambiguities must be construed in defendant\u2019s'favor, and that contracts optional in respect to one party are construed strictly in favor of the party bound. Williston on Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 620, 621. But against this we have the controlling considerations that the extension clause is added, in writing, .at the end of the \u2019printed contract ; that it must be given some operation; that, if the defendant\u2019s obligations were absolutely limited by its requirements, there would be nothing to which to apply the extension clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u25a0 We cannot accede to the defendant\u2019s contention that the extension clause was put in, in order to meet the contingency arising out of the fact that, when the contract was signed in October, 1920, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>defendant had an outstanding contract with another company which might lap over into the new year, so that the new contract was framed to start \u201cabout January 1, 1921 \u2014 buyer to give seller timely notice of date it desired shipments to start.\u201d This possible overlapping was a trifling matter; in fact, there was none, for deliveries under the new contract began on December 29 or 30, 1920. Apart from the effect of the extrinsic evidence, this would be no adequate explanation of the existence of this important provision, in writing, at the end of this elaborate printed contract. But if we resort to the extrinsic evidence, which is treated by both counsel as competent on the question of construction, it is clear that the plaintiff\u2019s selling agent explicitly told the defendant\u2019s purchasing agent that the extension clause was to be inserted in order to protect the plaintiff against incorrect or improper estimates, and so as to have a contract covering requirements up to some definite limit. It follows that the District Court was right in ruling that the plaintiff was entitled, availing itself, as it did of the optional clause, to require the defendant to take the full estimate of 550,000 barrels, except so far as this obligation was cut down by the force majeure clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">But we think the District Court too narrowly limited the operation of the force majeure clause. There was abundant evidence tending to show that, owing to frequent changes in styles and to the rapid deterioration of news print in storage, such a paper business as the defendant\u2019s was invariably carried on upon orders;- that the storage capacity of such mills was almost negligible; that operations at such mills are not merely financially dependent upon market conditions, but are in effect physically blocked when sales stop; that the chief customer of the Rumford Mill was the Continental Paper Bag Comp\u00e1ny, whose mill was next door, so that the defendant\u2019s product was shipped directly into the Continental Company\u2019s plant; that the employees of the Continental struck in May, 1921, and stayed out several weeks after the Rumford mill had resumed operations, so that this important outlet for defendant\u2019s product was blocked. Without further statement of the evidence, it is plain that a jury would have been warranted in finding that, apart from the effect of the strike in the defendant\u2019s own mill, which began in May and lasted until well into the fall, the defendant\u2019s normal operations were cut down by causes beyond its control, and which it could not overcome by any exercise of due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Turning, now, to the force majeure clause: We observe at the outset that its scope is not to be determined by its title; for we find in the body of the clause provisions plain and unmistakable. We need not, therefore, resort either to the civil or to the common law for rulings as to force majeure or vis major, in order to determine the meaning and application. While this provision is found in a printed contract, drawn; by the plaintiff, and doubtless intended primarily for its protection, we must construe the applicable provisions no less favorably to the defendant than they would\u2019 be construed in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the plaintiff, if conditions were essentially reversed; that is, if, after the plaintiff had made a contract to supply the defendant\u2019s fuel oil requirements, the price of oil had greatly increased, and the plaintiff had met, in obtaining a supply, with obstacles \u201cbeyond its control,\u201d \u201cand which could not be overcome by the exercise of due diligence.\u201d The clause as drawn is applicable to both parties. It provides explicitly that.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\">\u201cNeither party shall be responsible for * * * omissions hereunder due to any cause beyond its control, wheresoever arising, not due to its own negligence and which cannot be overcome by due diligence, including labor disturbances,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">There follows a long illustrative enumeration; but, fearing the maxim \u201cexpressio unius exclusio alterius,\u201d the clause continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201c * * * Such enumeration being expressly understood to be in no wise exclusive of other causes or classes of causes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Then follows an additional provision exonerating the seller from responsibility for omissions, etc.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201cDue to the failure to receive at its Everett refinery its supply of crude petroleum from the party or parties with whom it is under contract for crude oil,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">All the foregoing is found in one sentence. There then follows, in a separate sentence, and obviously applicable to omissions of both parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">\u201cIf deliveries are interrupted for any of the causes embraced in the foregoing, the amount of product which is not delivered at the regular contract rate during the period of any suspension or reduction shall be deducted from the full amount which otherwise would have been delivered under this contract. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Plainly, this is much more than a strike or vis major clause. It, in plain temls, relieves both parties to this contract from responsibility for omissions due to causes beyond their control, which cannot be overcome by the exercise of due diligence, and provides for deducting the amount of such omissions from the contract quantity. To limit the clause, as in effect it was limited by the court below, to the effect of a strike in the defendant\u2019s own plant, amounts to permitting the enumeration of various causes to control the broad and inclusive language of the first part of the clause, and to override the caveat at the end of the enumeration to the effect that such enumeration shall \u201cbe in no wise exclusive of other causes or classes of causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">The defendant\u2019s sixth request for rulings is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-13\">(6) \u201cIf the court, contrary to the defendant\u2019s prayers for rulings, rules that the quantity contemplated by the extension clause is 550,000 barrels, then the defendant requests the court to rule that there must be deducted from this quantity under the force majeure clause all the oil not required by the defendant, by reason of any and all causes beyond the defendant\u2019s control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">The court refused this ruling, and the d\u00e9fendant duly excepted. This refusal, at any rate when taken in connection with the court\u2019s instruction that the jury should deduct from 550,000 barrels only the aggregate of the amount taken and of the amount not taken on account of the strike in the defendant\u2019s own mills, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Perhaps, as an abstract proposition, the court\u2019s instruction that the force majeure clause does not apply to \u201clack of market\u201d or to the \u201cordinary vicissitudes of business\u201d is correct; but there was abundant evidence that the defendant faced conditions outside those caused by the strike in its own mills, which went far beyond \u201cthe ordinary vicissitudes of business\u201d or a \u201clack of market,\u201d as the term \u201clack of market\u201d would ordinarily be understood, and the jury were not allowed to consider these conditions as grounds for deductions. It is plain that the nature of the business of both plaintiff and defendant was much like the business of a railroad. It must flow in a current; otherwise, there are obstacles which due diligence cannot overcome. The force majeure provision was drawn to protect both buyer and seller from the destructive effects of such blockading.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument that, if the force majeure clause is thus applied to the obligations of the paper company, the extension clause is stripped of all meaning, is not sound. The two clauses are not mutually exclusive. There is no logical or legal justification for applying this clause to a strike in the defendant\u2019s own mills, without applying it to the entire situation fairly covered by its terms. While the record is not entirely clear, we infer that the plaintiff did not except to the court\u2019s ruling that the force majeure clause applied to the strike in the defendant\u2019s mills. The plaintiff\u2019s present contention, that the very presence of a force majeure clause applicable to both parties is inconsistent with the view that the contract is a requirement contract as to the obligations of the buyer, while logical, is therefore inconsistent with the position apparently taken by the plaintiff at the trial, and plainly inconsistent with the ruling of the court below. Moreover, this contention overlooks that the primary purpose of the extension clause was to protect the plaintiff against improper' or incorrect estimates; that on the evidence of its own chief witness the extension clause was put in, not for the purpose of throwing upon its customers a burden of responsibility for causes beyond their control and which they could not overcome by the exercise of due diligence, but to make them liable for reckless, even for improper or inaccurate, estimates of their requirements under normal conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Wollenberg\u2019s stated reason for this extension clause was not that his company had suffered under requirement contracts from the prevention of deliveries by causes beyond its customers\u2019 control and operating during the life of the contracts; it was that it had made contracts to supply itself with oil and for ships to carry the oil, grounded upon estimates improper and inaccurate. And Wollenberg said that he therefore proposed thereafter, through such an extension clause, to protect his company from this abuse. The force majeure clause does not excuse customers for errors or exaggerations in their original estimates of their requirements. Its function is to excuse, pro tanto, from performance, <em>after </em>a contract, accurate and otherwise proper, has been made, not to relieve from liability involved in the genesis of the agreement. If, in this case, the plaintiff had alleged and proved that an accurate and correct estimate of the defendant\u2019s requirements for fuel oil under normal conditions would have been, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>say, 450,000 inste\u00e1d of 550,000 barrels, then, notwithstanding the force majeure clause, the plaintiff would have had an optional right, under the extension clause, to require the defendant to take the excess of 100,000 barrels. And the same result accrues if, under the force majeure clause, deductions from the,550,000 maximum are limited to those due to causes beyond the defendant\u2019s control, arising within the contract period and reducing the defendant\u2019s consumption of oil below its original estimate, which must be assumed to have been a proper and an accurate estimate. While the defendant contracted that its requirements would, under normal conditions, be 550,000, and that if the plaintiff exercised its option, as it did, it would take and pay for that amount, it nevertheless had a right, if it could sustain the burden resting upon it in that regard, to show that by reason of abnormal conditions, which could not be. overcome by due diligence, its takings of oil were' diminished below its proper and accurate estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The fact that the defendant agreed, at the plaintiff\u2019s option, that its requirements should equal 550,000 barrels, does not prevent the contract from being, in general nature and purpose, a requirement contract. Plainly, as plaintiff\u2019s own learned counsel admits, the contract was, so far as the plaintiff\u2019s obligations were concerned, a requirement contract, and only that. Plaintiff could not have been held to furnish more than the defendant\u2019s requirements in actual experience, \u00bfven if,because of originally exaggerated estimate and for causes covered by the force majeure clause, the defendant\u2019s consumption had been not more than one-half the estimate of 550,000 harrels. Defendant had no right to require oil for resale, even if the price of oil had gone up as much as it went down. But the paper company\u2019s agreement fell far short of an absolute agreement to take 550,000 barrels, no matter what contingencies .should arise. . It agreed only that, unless excused under the force majeure clause, it would take (at plaintiff\u2019s option) 550,000 barrels, even if its estimate of its requirements under normal conditions proved excessive. If its original estimate was proper and accurate for normal conditions, the force majeure clause tended to keep the contract a requirement contract, cutting down the paper company\u2019s obligation as causes beyond its control cut down its consumption. Without this clause its obligations and its requirements might have been thrown out of all sensible relation to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">If the defendant had absolutely contracted (the plaintiff exercising its option) to take 550,000 barrels, there was no occasion to use all the words, as to requirements, found in this elaborate contract. National Publishing Co. v. International Paper Co. (C. C. A.) 269 Fed. 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Our. construction leaves significant the words in the extension clause, \u201cThe quantity .covered by this contract is <em>based </em>on the buyer\u2019s estimate of its requirements\u201d; for plainly, if the \u201cquantity covered by the contract\u201d were, under all- possible contemplated conditions, the exact equivalent of the \u201cbuyer\u2019s estimate,\u201d viz. 550,000 barrels, it would not have been stated to be <em>\u201cbased </em>on the buyer\u2019s estimate.\u201d Things are not <em>based </em>on themselves. So, also, as to the terms \u201cquantity contracted for hereunder\u201d and \u201ccontract quantity\u201d \u2014 if these terms had meant, under all conditions, 550,000 barrels, 550,000 barrels would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>have been written into the clause. Our construction makes the \u201ccontract quantity\u201d subject to the extension clause, mean 550,000 barrels less such amount, if any, as the buyer can show itself excused from taking by causes beyond its control, not existent nor reasonably contemplated when the contract was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The defendant alleges error in the court\u2019s instruction that the jury should add interest from the date of the writ, January 9, 1922, instead of from the date of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The defendant is right in its contention that the damages must remain unliquidated until the jury should determine the amount of deductions under the force majeure clause, and also the market value of oil at the time delivery should have been made. Counsel agree that the jury found the defendant in default as to taking 138,856 barrels, .assessed the market value at 82 cents, and multiplied 138,856 barrels by the difference between the contract price $3.50 and 82 cents \u2014 $2.68 \u2014thus reaching a verdict of $372,136.76, to which interest was added' from the date of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">We think it was error to add interest from the date of the writ. The authorities cited by the plaintiff do not sustain its proposition. Practically all the cases relied upon hark back to Jackson v. City of Brockton, 182 Mass. 26, 64 N. E. 419, 94 Am. St. Rep. 635, where Chief Justice Holmes says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">\u201cIn some cases, where the amount to be paid is unliquidated until the report is filed, it would be unjust to treat the defendant as in default before that time. Under such circumstances the usual practice under Pub. St. c. 171, \u00a7 8, is to compute interest from the date of the report. But when the claim is liquidated and should have been paid before action brought, and when the auditor, while allowing interest, has computed it only to the date of the writ, it seems to us proper that, for the judgment, interest should be made, up from the same time; that is to say, from the date of the writ.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">But in this case the damages were not liquidated. The defendant had no means of determining to what extent if at all it was in default; it could not have paid or tendered, and thus stopped interest. The case, therefore, falls under the rule laid down in such cases as those cited by the defendant. Stephens v. Phoenix Bridge Co., 139 Fed. 248, 71 C. C. A. 374; White v. Miller, 78 N. Y. 393, 34 Am. Rep. 544; Wright v. Barnard (D. C.) 264 Fed. 582; Dresser v. Bates, 250 Fed. 525, at page 552, 162 C. C. A. 541 (C. C. A. First Circuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Of course, if this were the only error, the excess interest might be remitted, and judgment entered on the verdict thus revised. Pacific Postal Tel. Cable Co. v. Fleischner et al., 66 Fed. 899, 910, 14 C. C. A. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">The judgment of the District Court is vacated, the verdict set aside, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, and the plaintiff in error recovers costs in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
