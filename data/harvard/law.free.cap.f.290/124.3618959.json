This trade-mark it now owns, and has registered a similar trade-mark in some 51 foreign countries, either causing it to be registered in its name or that of its associates. It does a large business throughout the United States, as well as in foreign countries, and sells shoes bearing the brand name \u201cVera.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The appellee adopted, by incorporation under the laws of the state of New York, on May 14, 1920, the name of \u201cVera Shoe Company, Inc.\u201d It is engaged in business 'in Brooklyn,. N. Y. The charge is that, because of the use of the word \u201cVera\u201d in its corporate name and the use of it in the sale of its shoes, confusion has occurred and is likely to occur with loss to the appellant. It alleges that this competition in trade is unfair, and prays that it may have a decree against the appellee, its officers and agents, perpetually enjoining it from using the corporate name of \u201cVera Shoe Company, Inc.,\u201d or any similar name, on its stationery, signs, checks, or manufactured products. Since 1907, the appellant has exclusively used the name \u201cVera\u201d stamped on its shoes and products, and the proof shows that in 1920 it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>a gross business of approximately $600,000. Its factory is in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"A8M\">Before the commencement of this suit, .the appellant demanded that the appellee discontinue the use of the name \u201cVera\u201d in its corporate name. The appellee declined to do so, but thereafter did add on its letter and bill heads, \u201cThis firm not connected with any other concern.\u201d There is evidence that the appellee did imprint the name \u201cVera\u201d on a stock lining and on samples; some -20 or 30 sample pairs. The reason therefor is given as \u201cjust to introduce our line.\u201d They have a machine with which they stamp the names of their retail dealer on the product. They also stamped, \u201cMade by Vera Shoe Company.\u201d Sometimes their salesmen took out the stamped shoes and showed them to the trade, stamped with the name \u201cVera Shoe Company.\u201d There is evidence-that shoes were exhibited and business was solicited in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington, and in Texas. While the evidence of sales or efforts to sell is somewhat meager, still the company was new in the business at the time of the commencement of this action, and there were efforts made to sell, using the name \u201cVera,\u201d and using the phrase \u201cMade by Vera Shoe Company.\u201d We think that the use of the word \u201cVera\u201d was calculated to deceive the trade and purchasing public, and, if continued, would result in confusion and loss to the appellant and the consuming public, and the purchasing public would be confused as to the manufacturer of shoes bearing the imprint \u201cVera\u201d or \u201cMade by Vera Shoe Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"> The law does not require that any particular person has been actually misled. Scandinavia Belting Co. v. Asbestos &amp; Rubber Works, 257 Fed. 937, 169 C. C. A. 87; Willys-Overland Co. v. Akron-Overland Tire Co., Inc. (D. C.) 268 Fed. 151; Bissell Chilled Plow Works v. T. M. Bissell Co. (C. C.) 121 Fed. 357. If the natural and probable result of the appellee\u2019s conduct would be to lead the public to purchase its goods in the belief that they were the appellant\u2019s, such conduct would deceive the ordinary buyer making his purchases under ordinary conditions, and is in law unfair competition. Miller Rubber Co. v. Behrend, 242 Fed. 515, 155 C. C. A. 291. Therefore, adopting the word \u201cVera\u201d in its corporate name, which is an arbitrary selection, the appellee must be held to have intended the natural consequences of its act. It is very likely that appellee\u2019s shoes would soon become known as \u201cVera\u201d shoes, with the resulting confusion. We are referred to the case of United Drug Co. v. Rectanus Co., 248 U. S. 90, 39 Sup. Ct. 48, 63 L. Ed. 141, as an authority against the appellant\u2019s claims. There it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201cThere is no such thing as property in a trade-mark, except as a right appurtenant to an established business or trade in connection with which the mark is employed. The law of trade-marks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition; the right to a particular mark grows out of its use, not its mere adoption. Its function is simply to designate the goods as the product of a particular trader and to protect his good will against the sale of another\u2019s product as his; and it is not the subject of property, except in connection with an existing business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The adoption of a trade-mark does not project the right of protection in advance of the extension of the trade, or operate as a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>of territorial rights over areas into which it thereafter may be deemed desirable to extend the mark owner\u2019s trade. Wherever the trade goes, attended by the use of the mark, the right of the trader to be protected against the sale by others of their wares in the place of his wares, will be sustained. But the owner of a trade-mark, unlike the proprietor of a patent, may not prohibit upon the theory that he has a monopoly. United States v. Bell Telephone Co., 167 U. S. 224, 17 Sup. Ct. 809, 42 L. Ed. 144; Paper Bag Patent Case, 210 U. S. 405, 28 Sup. Ct. 748, 52 L. Ed. 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"> Where the proof of infringement is clear, a court of equity will not refuse an injunction for the future protection of the proprietor of a trade-mark right, even though it might appear that he is dis-entitled to an accounting for the past profits of the infringer. The appellant has used the trade-mark \u201cVera\u201d for 17 years upon its products, manufactured in Massachusetts and sold throughout the United States. The appellee was organized in 1920, and sold shoes in territory contiguous to that in which the appellant\u2019s shoes were sold. They sent salesmen south and west, and although it has not sold in Massachusetts, it has covered territory wherein the shoes of the appellant were sold. We must assume that, if unrestrained, the appellee will pursue its business to the injury of the appellant and danger of injury is sufficient ground for the restraining arm of the court of equity. Von Munn v. Frash (C. C.) 56 Fed. 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">It is true that at the present time the assets of the appellee are in charge of a trustee in bankruptcy, but there may be a sale of the property, which would include the assets and its good will and the corporate name, which includes the word \u201cVera,\u201d which may be deemed an asset of the corporation. The use of the word in the name of the corporation which infringes a trade-mark, or which, of itself, constitutes unfair competition, or which of itself may be a source of unfair competition, will be enjoined by a court of equity. Bates Mfg. Co. v. Bates Numbering Machine Co. (C. C.) 172 Fed. 892. We think it was error to deny the relief prayed for below.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b149-8\">MAYER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AV6\">(dissenting). I agree with the view of the facts entertained by the District Court, and hence that the case is ruled by United Drug Co. v. Rectanus Co., 248 U. S. 90, 39 Sup. Ct. 48, 63 L. Ed. 421. I think the decree below was right.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
