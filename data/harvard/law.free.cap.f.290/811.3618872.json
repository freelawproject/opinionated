We do not hold (and did not mean to be understood as holding) that the patent is void by reason of appellee\u2019s prior public use of its own plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-21\">Since there is no infringement, it is unnecessary (even if not strictly improper) in affirming the decree of dismissal of appellant\u2019s complaint of infringement to pass upon the question of validity. This, suit is purely in personam. If there were a finding of invalidity in. this suit, appellant would not be precluded from suing others. If appellant desires a contest on validity, let it bring in a defend\u00e1nt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>cannot escape except by overturning the patent. If appellee desires a finding of invalidity, let it appropriate the patented structure and run the risk of paying the substantial damages that are usually assessed against infringers of valid p\u00e1tents.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The petition for a rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
