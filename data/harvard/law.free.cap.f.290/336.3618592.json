The invention is set forth in eight counts, of which counts 1 and 8 will serve to illustrate the purposes of the invention. Counts 1 and 8 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-15\">1. In automobile buffers, a buffer having an impact portion, bearing members to be connected with said buffer and each having a portion adapted to extend around two outer sides of one of the automobile frame members, a one-piece retainer member co-operating with each bearing member and having a hooked end extending around a flange of one of said frame members and co-operating with an inner face thereof, which is opposite to said bearing member, and means to force together said bearing member and the hook end of said retainer to secure them to said frame member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-16\">8. In attaching devices adapted for use in attaching an automobile buffer or the like to automobile frame members having projecting flanges, a one-piece retainer having a hooked portion adapted to extend around one of the flanges of said frame members, and having a hook end adapted to co-operate with an inner side of said frame member considerably away from the flange edge, and securing means engaging said retainer and adapted to clamp said retainer in substantially rigid supporting position with respect to the co-operating frame member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">Fyon, the appellee, filed his original application for a patent on April 12, 1916, and on a continuation of that application, filed on December 7, 1916, a patent was granted on May 21, 1918. Fageol, the appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>filed his application on the 12th of November, 1917, and is therefore the junior party.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The testimony submitted by Fageol in the interference proceedings shows that he had made a test prior to August 1, 1912, of three different types of clamping hook bolts, which are covered by some or all of the counts in issue. The three types were known as the \u201cfish clamp,\u201d the \u201csquare mouth,\u201d and the \u201cround\u201d or \u201ceye-shaped.\u201d The fish clamp was tested on July 4, 1912, by using it to attach a bumper to a Ford automobile, which, with the bumper so attached, made a run from Philadelphia to Atlantic City and return on July 4, 1912. The only testimony adduced in corroboration of Fageol as to the success of that test is the testimony of Fageol\u2019s brother-in-law, Kepler, who stated that he first observed the clamps before starting from Philadelphia and that \u201cthey were good and tight.\u201d During the run and after the trip was completed he made no examination of the clamps, other than that of looking at them, but said that <em>as far as he could see </em>they were holding tight. The \u201cfish clamps\u201d were left on the automobile for about a week after the Atlantic City trip, and to the best of Kepler\u2019s knowledge they held firmly. Kepler, however, neglected to state the nature of his observations, and we are left in the dark as to whether he examined the clamps after the car was put in operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The \u201csquare-mouth\u201d hook bolts, covered by all the counts, were used to secure a bumper to a Ford frame, and according to Fageol the bolts were severely tested by pulling and jerking the bumper. Fageol admitted that as a result of that test the hooks opened somewhat, and Kepler goes farther and says that the \u201csquare-mouth\u201d hook bolts opened and worked loose.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The \u201cround\u201d or \u201ceye-shaped\u201d hook bolts,, included in all counts and made by Oswell, were subjected to the same test as that applied to the \u201csquare-mouth\u201d bolts; and with the same result, according-to Fageol. He said, however, that the bolts held all right under ordinary running conditions. Kepler corroborated Fageol only to the extent of saying that \u201cthey held all right,\u201d but failed to describe the test to which they were subjected. If Kepler witnessed the shop test, his testimony cannot be reconciled with that of Fageol; and if he witnessed the running test, his statement furnishes no information as to the nature of his observations, or of his opportunity for making them factors necessary for the determination of the weight to be given to his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Oswell\u2019s statement as to' the result of the tests was based on what Fageol told him, and are therefore of no corroborative value. Moreover, tests by pulling and jerking the bumper can hardly be accepted as subjecting the bolts to the strains and stresses which would be imposed by running the car over the inequalities of the average road; True enough, the \u201cround\u201d or \u201ceye-shaped bolts\u201d were attached to a Maxwell car and subjected to the test of a one day\u2019s drive and to the test of running the car against a pole. Fageol testified that the tests made on the Maxwell car were satisfactory; but his declarations on that subject were not corroborated, inasmuch as the witnesses brought forward for that purpose testified to nothing more than statements made by him to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>We are of the opinion that the evidence in behalf of Fageol was insufficient to establish an actual reduction to practice, and that view finds confirmation in the fact that Fageol admits that he did not consider the devices far enough developed in 1912 to file an application for a patent. Fageol patented inventions for bumpers in 1912, and had a license arrangement with the Hartford Company, for their manufacture, and apparently took no interest whatever in the hook bolts from 1912 until after he saw the Lyon hook bolts in 1917. His long delay must be attributed to some other cause than lade of means. Indeed, he frankly admitted that at any time from 1912 to 1917 he could have applied for a patent, had he desired to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The Examiner of Interferences, the Examiners in Chief, and the First Assistant Commissioner were agreed as to their findings of fact and the award of priority to Lyon. We find nothing in the record which would justify us in reaching a different conclusion as to the facts or the award, and the decision appealed from is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
