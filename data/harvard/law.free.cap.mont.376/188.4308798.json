We address each contention under the following two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">\u00b63 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in calculating the net worth of the marital estate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">\u00b64 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in distributing the marital estate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">\u00b65 We reverse portions of the court\u2019s calculation of net worth and remand for further findings and a recalculation. We affirm the court\u2019s distribution of the marital estate in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b66 Mark and Dianna married in 1984 and separated in 2007. Dianna filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on December 8, 2008. The District Court held a two-day trial on April 12 and May 2,2013, issued findings of fact and conclusions of law on June 20,2013, and issued a decree of dissolution on June 27,2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b67 When the parties married, Dianna was a registered nurse and Mark was a laborer on his family\u2019s farm and ranch. Neither party owned real property or substantial assets. In 1994, the parties bought their first property, Parker Place, with a $10,000 down payment from their combined resources and $65,000 in loans from Mark\u2019s relatives. In 1995, Mark\u2019s mother deeded him a parcel of land known as the Rushwater Property, where the parties lived until their separation. In January 1999, Dianna inherited a parcel known as Gramma\u2019s Place. Over the years they acquired more parcels \u2014 Jurovich Place, Peterson Place and Helzer Place \u2014 by leveraging their properties and borrowing money. The parties used all of the properties in various ways for the farming operation during the years of their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b68 The parties\u2019 farm and ranch operated in a fashion typical of a family farm. The Richardses utilized an operating loan for up-front expenses, paying it off annually with income received from the operation. They raised hay to feed the cattle and sold any excess. They raised and sold crops, bred cattle, and either sold the calves or used them to increase the herd. The parties continually acquired and maintained equipment. Following the parties\u2019 separation in 2007, Mark continued to operate the farm and ranch in the same manner as before, using the parties\u2019 real property, equipment and inventory as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b69 The parties shared household duties throughout their marriage. Though Mark disputes the amount and character of Dianna\u2019s farm labor, he agrees that she assisted with the farming in various capacities, at least until their separation. The parties agree that her farming duties decreased in 2004 when she began working full time as a registered nurse to help pay expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b610 At trial, the District Court was tasked with determining what to include in the marital estate, the estate\u2019s net worth and an equitable division of considerable property, which consisted primarily of farmland, farm equipment, animals and personal effects. To assist in the valuation of the estate, two appraisals were completed and submitted into evidence \u2014 Jim Carroll completed an appraisal of the parties\u2019 real property in December 2011 and Musser Bros., Inc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>completed an appraisal of the parties\u2019 equipment and crops in June 2011. The parties stipulated to both appraisals and Carroll testified at trial. Mark presented a financial statement from Yellowstone Bank dated April 1,2013, and a final financial disclosure dated April 8,2013. Mark\u2019s banker testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b611 During the trial, Mark argued that the value of the Rushwater property should not be included in the marital estate because it was gifted to him by his family. Further, he testified that he would be able to continue farming only if Dianna received no more than two parcels of land. Dianna requested four parcels of land \u2014 Gramma\u2019s Place, Jurovich Place, Parker Place and Helzer Place \u2014 along with an equalization payment of $350,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b612 The District Court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law on June 20,2013. Despite the parties\u2019 long separation, the District Court calculated the marital estate as of the date of trial, noting that their financial interests had remained intertwined and that \u201c[i]t would be impossible to separate the parties\u2019 assets as of any particular date.\u201d Utilizing the appraisals, financial statements and testimony from the trial, the court valued the parties\u2019 net worth at $3,509,560.86. The District Court rejected Mark\u2019s argument that the parties\u2019 inherited and gifted property should not be subject to division, noting that after the properties were deeded to the parties, they were merged with and operated as a part of the overall farm and ranch operation. Based on the length of the marriage and the contributions of both parties to build up the value of the farm and ranch operation, the court concluded that it would be equitable to split the parties\u2019 net worth equally. The court relied on Mark\u2019s testimony that he needed land to continue the farming operation and awarded him all the real property except for Gramma\u2019s Place and Jurovich Place. The court also awarded Mark the majority of the income-producing assets, such as equipment and cattle, so that he could continue farming. To account for its award of the majority of the real property and equipment to Mark, the court ordered Mark to pay Dianna $892,663.00 over fifteen years for her remaining portion of the marital estate. The court noted that the ultimate distribution left Mark with a net worth $190,000 greater than Dianna\u2019s, but concluded that this was equitable to account for his operation of the farm and ranch following the parties\u2019 separation. Mark appeals the court\u2019s decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s division of marital property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re Marriage of Funk, </em>2012 MT 14, \u00b6 6, 363 Mont. 352, 270 P.3d 39. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous \u201cif it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us the district court made a mistake.\u201d <em>Bock v. Smith, </em>2005 MT 40, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 123, 107 P.3d 488 (internal citation omitted). District courts have broad discretion in apportioning a marital estate. <em>In re Marriage of Crowley, </em>2014 MT 42, \u00b6 26, 374 Mont. 48, 318 P.3d 1031. Absent clearly erroneous findings, we will affirm a district court\u2019s division of property unless the court abused its discretion. <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b614 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in calculating the net worth of the marital estate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b615 Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, requires a district court to determine and consider the assets and liabilities of each of the parties before apportioning the marital estate. <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 26. A net valuation by the district court is not always mandatory. <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 26. The test is \u201cwhether the findings as a whole are sufficient to determine the net worth and to decide whether the distribution is equitable.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Lewton, </em>2012 MT 114, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 152, 281 P.3d 181 (internal citations omitted). A district court has broad discretion in determining the value of property in dissolution and is \u201cfree to adopt any reasonable valuation of marital property which is supported by the record.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Robinson, </em>269 Mont. 293, 296, 888 P.2d 895, 897 (1994). We have allowed a court to premise its valuation on \u201cexpert testimony, lay testimony, documentary evidence, or any combination thereof.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>269 Mont. at 296, 888 P.2d at 897. A court\u2019s findings must be complete enough, however, that we need not \u201csuccumb to speculation when assessing the conscientiousness or reasonableness of the district court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Bartsch, </em>2007 MT 136, \u00b6 33, 337 Mont. 386, 162 P.3d 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u00b616 Here, the District Court utilized the financial statement from Yellowstone Bank as a starting point and supplemented it with information from the stipulated appraisals and the parties\u2019 testimony. Mark argues that several of the District Court\u2019s findings regarding the valuation of the marital estate are clearly erroneous. He specifically contends that the court double-counted certain improvements to the parties\u2019 real property and certain items of farm equipment, erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>relied on Mark\u2019s Yellowstone Bank financial statement, failed to value certain farm items, and erroneously found that the parties made $200,000 in improvements to their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\n<em>a. Real property calculation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b617 Mark\u2019s April 1,2013, Yellowstone Bank financial statement lists the value of the parties\u2019 real estate and improvements as $1,611,400. The District Court adjusted this amount based on the Carroll appraisal of real property and testimony from Mark and his banker suggesting that the financial statement value was a conservative estimate. The District Court added the $1,017,502.50 difference between the Carroll appraisal of $2,628,902.5o<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the financial statement\u2019s total of $1,611,400 to the overall calculation of net worth. Essentially, the court utilized the Carroll appraisal of $2,628,902.50 as the calculation of the net worth of the parties\u2019 real property. Mark argues that this calculation results in an artificial inflation of net worth by including the value of the improvements listed on the financial statement twice. The financial statement\u2019s total of $1,611,400 includes $80,000 in improvements, including a machine shed, a grain bin and electric scales. Mark argues that this $80,000 also was included in Carroll\u2019s appraisal. Mark misunderstands the effect of the court\u2019s calculation. The court did not add the totals from Carroll\u2019s appraisal to Mark\u2019s financial statement. Rather, the court chose to value the real property using the total from Carroll\u2019s appraisal instead of the total from Mark\u2019s financial statement. Mark does not allege clear error in the Carroll appraisal and stipulated to its use. After reviewing the court\u2019s findings in conjunction with the record, we fail to see how this results in a double counting of $80,000 in improvements. We affirm the District Court\u2019s calculation of the real property portion of the parties\u2019 net worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>b. Equipment calculation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b618 Mark next argues that the District Court erroneously calculated the value of the parties\u2019 equipment by including certain pieces of equipment more than once. The District Court utilized the Musser appraisal of equipment, but added the value of equipment acquired subsequent to the parties\u2019 separation that was listed on Mark\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>financial disclosure. Mark contends that the District Court did not consider that the parties separated in 2007 and that the Musser appraisal was performed in 2011. Thus, much of the post-separation equipment listed in the financial disclosure already was included in the Musser appraisal. Having reviewed the two exhibits on which the court relied for this calculation, we agree with Mark that it appears that much of the same equipment was listed in both documents. We agree that the findings regarding the value of the equipment appear to be mistaken. We also agree with Mark that the court failed to address several items of equipment that Mark claimed were owned by others. Although Dianna counters that Mark stipulated to use of the Musser appraisal, the appraisal states that Musser made no investigation of the ownership of the equipment. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the District Coturt to conduct a recalculation of the equipment value.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">c. <em>Cash and debts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b619 Mark argues that the court\u2019s reliance on the Yellowstone Bank financial statement for the net worth calculation resulted in the court erroneously including cash that did not exist at the time of trial and excluding several debts that were not reflected in the Yellowstone Bank statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b620 First, Mark challenges the court\u2019s inclusion of $31,000 in cash as part of the net worth of the parties. At trial, Mark testified that the $31,000 listed on the financial statement was \u201clong gone,\u201d having been used to service the parties\u2019 debt, and that his checking account, as of the first day of trial, had a negative balance. There was no contradictory testimony regarding the cash amount. In the court\u2019s adjustments to the financial statement, it did not mention Mark\u2019s testimony on this issue. Although the $31,000 is fisted on the financial statement, it is dated before trial. Dianna argues that the Court was free to disregard Mark\u2019s testimony on this issue and rely solely on the financial statement. Mark presented unconverted testimony that he alone was responsible for paying the farm debts after he and Dianna separated and had used the cash to pay down the debt. With no findings providing insight into the District Court\u2019s reasoning for including the $31,000, we conclude that its inclusion of the cash is not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we remand for further factual findings regarding the value of cash as of the time of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u00b621 Mark next points out that the District Court did not include the remaining balance on the parties\u2019 $65,000loan obligation as part of the</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>net worth. The court found that the parties purchased their first property with a $65,000 loan from Mark\u2019s relatives and required Mark to be responsible for all debt on the parties\u2019 real property, but it did not address the obligation in its net worth calculation. At trial, Mark testified that there was still a balance of $30,000 on this obligation. Although the District Court has broad discretion in distributing the marital estate, it is required to consider the entire estate, including debt. <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>In re Marriage of Rudolf, </em>2007 MT 178, \u00b6 23, 338 Mont. 226, 164 P.3d 907. In <em>Rudolf, </em>we reversed the district court\u2019s distribution of the marital estate because we were left to guess how the district court accounted for certain assets and liabilities that both parties agreed existed. <em>Rudolf, </em>\u00b6 22. Given the lack of discussion by the District Court, we cannot determine from its findings whether it disregarded this debt. On remand the court should address this loan in its determination of net worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b622 In his final financial disclosure, Mark included a $31,515 second mortgage from Wells Fargo that he contends was used to pay off credit card debt accrued by Dianna throughout the marriage. At trial, this loan was discussed by both parties. Dianna acknowledged the existence of the second mortgage but disagreed that it was used to pay off her credit cards. The District Court found that this debt was incurred for the mutual benefit of the parties, but did not include it in the calculation of net worth. Regardless of the purpose of this debt, the court was still required to take the loan into consideration as a liability of the marital estate. <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>Rudolf, </em>\u00b6 23. Given the evidence presented in the final financial disclosure and at trial, we again conclude that the District Court did not include sufficient findings for us to determine whether it erred in its calculation. The court also should consider this debt on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b623 Mark finally argues that the District Court\u2019s use of the financial statement omits a $15,000 loan balance for a piece of farm equipment. Dianna contends that this loan amount was not raised until appeal. Mark counters that it Was included in his final financial disclosure, which was used as an exhibit at trial. While this loan is documented in Mark\u2019s disclosure, the trial transcript contains no discussion of it. \u201c[P]arties to a dissolution proceeding have a duty to assist the trial court in acquiring information needed to determine an appropriate distribution of marital property.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Foreman, </em>1999 MT 89, \u00b6 37, 294 Mont. 181, 979 P.2d 193 (internal citation omitted). Expecting the District Court to go through Mark\u2019s lengthy and largely repetitive financial disclosure when Mark did not raise this loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>amount at trial is unreasonable. The existence of this loan was not mentioned at trial and we will not fault the District Court for not considering it in its calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\n<em>d. Value of farm,'items awarded to Dianna</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b624 In its award of real property, the District Court awarded Dianna Gramma\u2019s Place and Jurovich Place \"along with the irrigation pipe typically used on each of these properties.\u201d The District Court also awarded Dianna the scrap equipment on the parties\u2019 property. Mark argues that the District Court failed to account for the value of these items, contending that the court must assign a value to every asset. We have held that a district court need only make findings sufficient for this Court to determine the net worth and review whether the marital distribution is equitable. <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 26. We will not attempt to review every element of a complex property distribution. <em>In re Marriage of Kink, </em>226 Mont. 313, 317, 735 P.2d 311, 314 (1987). Mark\u2019s allegations do not rise to clear error. Except as we have specifically noted above, the court made thorough findings regarding the value of the parties\u2019 real estate and equipment based upon sufficient evidence. The court set forth what it believed to be an equitable distribution, including Dianna\u2019s retention of the irrigation pipes and scrap equipment. Similarly, the court awarded Mark certain items without listing the exact breakdown of the value attached, such as all equipment and vehicles not awarded to Dianna. Mark does not demonstrate how Dianna\u2019s receipt of the farm items on the property she was awarded results in an inequitable distribution. We conclude that the court made sufficient findings for us to determine that this was an equitable division of these items of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>e. Improvements to the Rushwater Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b625 In its findings regarding the parties\u2019 inherited properties, the District Court noted that the Richardses made substantial improvements to the gifted properties, including over $200,000 of improvements to the'Rushwater Property. Mark argues that the record does not support the court\u2019s valuation of the improvements. He fails, however, to demonstrate how this finding is reflected in the court\u2019s ultimate distribution. The court utilized the Carroll property appraisal when setting the value of the real property, and Mark does not allege that the Carroll appraisal erroneously included this $200,000. Instead, it appears that the court made its finding about the improvements in rejecting Mark\u2019s argument that the Rushwater Property should not be included in the marital estate for purposes of property division. As we discuss later in the opinion, the court properly included the Rushwater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>property as part of the marital estate. Regardless of the value of improvements made to the property, this finding is immaterial to the outcome of the issues on appeal and we decline to determine whether the court erred in its valuation of the improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"A5j\">\n<em>f Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b626  We affirm the District Court\u2019s valuation of the parties\u2019 real property. Because the record indicates that the court incorrectly calculated the value of the parties\u2019 equipment and made insufficient findings regarding inclusion of $31,000 in cash and the exclusion of loans from Mark\u2019s relatives and Wells Fargo, we rev\u00e9rse its calculation of the parties\u2019 net worth. On remand, the District Court shall supplement its factual findings to address these matters and recalculate the parties\u2019 total net worth. The District Court may adjust its distribution of property if necessary based on the recalculation. We proceed to address Mark\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b627 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in distributing the marital estate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b628  In a dissolution proce\u00e9ding, a district court is required to \u201cequitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title to the property and assets is in the name of the husband or wife or both.\u201d Section 40-4-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b629 Mark argues that the District Court abused its discretion in distributing the marital estate by failing to credit him for his labor during the parties\u2019 separation, failing to apportion to each of the parties a larger percentage of the value of their respective gifted properties, failing to credit Mark for Dianna\u2019s post-separation acquisitions, and failing to consider tax consequences of the equalization payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\n<em>a. Credit for post-separation labor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u00b630 Mark first alleges error in the District Court\u2019s refusal to give him credit for operating the farm during the parties\u2019 five-year separation. He contends that during this five-year period, he ran the farm and that its net value increased significantly. He argues that because the court did not consider the $310,000 of salary that Dianna made during this time period, it should have credited Mark with $310,000 of the increase of net worth of the assets during the separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\u00b631 Section 40-4-202, MCA, instructs courts to consider a variety of factors when determining an equitable distribution of the marital estate, includingthe length of the marriage and a spouse\u2019s contribution as a homemaker to the family unit. The court need not expressly credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>a party for work done or payments made to maintain marital property so long as the court\u2019s distribution of the marital estate is equitable. <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 33. A district court should consider the extent to which a party\u2019s actions enhanced or protected a marital asset in its equitable apportionment of the estate. <em>Crowley, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>In re Marriage of Dowd, </em>261 Mont. 319, 324, 862 P.2d 1123, 1126 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b632  Here, the District Court recognized that Mark continued operating the farm following the parties\u2019 separation. The court credited Mm for this work by awarding him 53% of the parties\u2019 net worth \u2014 $190,000 more than Dianna received. It concluded that this was an equitable distribution because he operated the farm and ranch after the separation with little financial or work contributions from Dianna. Nevertheless, the court included in its findings that Mark\u2019s continuation of farming operations utilized the parties\u2019jointly acquired assets and their income-producing property, including the land, livestock and equipment. The court determined that although the parties had been separated for five years, \u201c[Dianna\u2019s] interest in the real properties, equipment and cattle has not been separated and, therefore, the parties have not existed in a financially separate way.\u201d Given Mark\u2019s use of the jointly acquired incoming-producing property and his receipt of a larger portion of the estate, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting Mark with an amount equal to the salary made by Dianna during the separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">6. <em>Gifted Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b633 Next, Mark contends that the District Court erred by failing to award the parties a greater portion of the value of the properties gifted to them by their respective families. Section 40-4-202, MCA, requires an equitable distribution of all property belonging to either or both parties, \u201chowever and whenever acquired.\u201d <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 13. The statute directs courts to consider specific factors for pre-acquired, gifted or inherited property, such as the nonmonetary contributions of a homemaker and the extent to which such contributions facilitated the maintenance of the disputed property. Section40-4-202, MCA. We have made clear; however, that these considerations do not constrain a district court\u2019s discretion to equitably divide all assets of the parties, however and whenever acquired. <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>In re Marriage of Caras, </em>2012 MT 25, \u00b6 33, 364 Mont. 32, 270 P.3d 48; <em>In re Marriage of Tummarello, </em>2012 MT 18, \u00b6 25, 363 Mont. 387, 270 P.3d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b634  Here, the District Court detailed the parties\u2019 numerous acquisitions of property from the start of their marriage, finding that they began their marriage with no significant assets and worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>jointly to acquire their assets throughout the marriage. Although each party inherited a parcel of land, these parcels were used jointly by the parties for housing, operation of the farm and leverage to acquire more property. The court found that Dianna significantly contributed to the household duties at the parties\u2019 residence on the inherited Rushwater property. Although Mark alleges that the District Court should have awarded the parties a greater share of their respective inherited properties, he has not established that its equal distribution of these properties amounts to an abuse of discretion. We conclude that the District Court properly considered the factors listed in \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, for both jointly acquired and inherited assets. We decline to disturb its distribution of the inherited properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">c. <em>Financial disclosure of personal property</em></p>\n<p id=\"Anl\">\u00b635 Mark argues that the District Court abused its discretion by not crediting Mark\u2019s share of the estate with the amount of Dianna\u2019s acquired property. He argues that Dianna did not file a final declaration of disclosure and a current income and expense declaration as required by \u00a7 40-4-253, MCA, and that the court failed to assign a value to Dianna\u2019s personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b636 The failure of a party to disclose an asset or liability on the final declaration of disclosure is presumed to be grounds for the court, without taking into account the equitable division of the marital estate, to award the undisclosed asset to the opposing party or the undisclosed liability to the noncomplying party. Section40-4-253(4), MCA. Because Dianna failed to submit a final financial disclosure, Mark argues that the court erred by not awarding him the value of the undisclosed assets pursuant to this statute. Although the statute allows a district court to award the disputed property, it does riot require the court to do so. In this case, neither party complied strictly with the financial disclosure requirements, but the District Court heard and considered extensive evidence about the parties\u2019 personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b637 Without Dianna\u2019s financial disclosure statement, Mark argues that the District Court could not assess the value of personal property that Dianna was awarded and therefore erred in failing to offset Mark\u2019s equalization payment by the amount of that value. The court awarded Dianna her own personal vehicles, life insurance and bank accounts, her jewelry and paintings, the scrap equipment on the parties\u2019 property, the parties\u2019 bedroom set and her .25 caliber pistol. The court also awarded Mark items of personal property without assigning a specific value to them. These items include his bank accounts, life insurance, office furniture, framed artwork from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>family, tools, a 9mm pistol, a .357 pistol, and a 22.250 rifle. For items not specifically awarded, the court ordered the parties to compile a list and alternate choosing items from the list. Mark\u2019s final 19-page financial disclosure, submitted two days before trial, included many of these items and the parties both testified about the items they wanted in the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b638  When the property and assets of the parties are complex, \u201c[w]e will not attempt to review every element of [the] distribution.\u201d <em>Kink, </em>226 Mont, at 317, 735 P.2d at 314. \u201cTrial courts, acting in equity, are granted far-reaching discretion to fashion <em>\u2018a </em>fair distribution of the marital property using reasonable judgment and relying on common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Marriage of Foreman, </em>1999 MT 89, \u00b6 23, 294 Mont. 181, 979 P.2d 193 (quoting In <em>re Marriage of Rock, </em>257 Mont. 476, 480, 850 P.2d 296, 298 (1993)). In <em>Lewton, </em>we held that the district court\u2019s failure to specifically value all the assets did not render the findings insufficient to determine whether the distribution was equitable, particularly because the items not valued were personal property items that \u201cwere a small part of a complicated estate.\u201d <em>Lewton, </em>\u00b6 19. Here, the court considered the parties\u2019 respective items of personal property in its distribution and awarded both parties different items. Mark has not demonstrated that the court\u2019s failure to assign a value to Dianna\u2019s personal property and to give him credit for that value resulted in an inequitable division of assets. The District Court was dealing with a large and complex marital estate and we will not disturb its distribution absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>Lewton, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Kink, </em>226 Mont, at 317, 735 P.2d at 314. Given the court\u2019s award of items of personal property to Mark, also without a specific valuation, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"AUA\">\n<em>d. Tax consequences</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b639 Finally, Mark argues that the District Court abused its discretion by awarding an equalization payment to Dianna without considering the tax consequences of such a payment. The court ordered Mark to pay Dianna $892,663 in annual installments over fifteen years with accrued interest. Mark contends that he will be unable to fulfill this yearly installment to Dianna without selling assets or property, which will result in tax liability. He cites <em>In re Marriage of Haberkern, </em>2004 MT 29, \u00b6 17, 319 Mont. 393, 85 P.3d 743, for the proposition that a court\u2019s failure to consider a \u201cconcrete and immediate\u201d tax liability resulting from its property distribution is an abuse of discretion. We also held in <em>Haberkern, </em>however, that when liabilities are not immediately taxable, a district court does not abuse its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>not considering such liabilities because doing so would be too speculative. <em>Haberkern, </em>\u00b6 17. In <em>Haberkern, </em>we reversed a district court\u2019s decision to consider a tax liability involving a marital asset where the distribution order did not Specifically force a sale of an asset to satisfy the distribution nor was there an imminent sale of such an asset. <em>Haberkern, </em>\u00b6 17. We held that \u201c[t]o apply a deduction of a \u2018reasonable tax rate\u2019 to [assets] that <em>may </em>be liquidated at <em>some time in the future </em>frustrates the goal of achieving a fair and equitable distribution of the marital estate\u201d because \u201cit is unreasonable to consider tax consequences in light of numerous unknown factors such as the value of the account at the time it is eventually liquidated; the tax laws in effect at the time it is eventually liquidated; and when the account will eventually be sold.\u201d <em>Haberkern, </em>\u00b6 19 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b640 The court\u2019s order in this case did not require a sale of a particular asset to satisfy the distribution order. Given that we are remanding for recalculation of net worth, the equalization payment amount may change on remand. We are unable to determine whether a \u201cconcrete or immediate\u201d tax liability will result from the District Court\u2019s property distribution order. We decline to consider this argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b641  We reverse the District Court\u2019s calculation of the marital estate\u2019s net worth and remand for further factual findings and a recalculation. Specifically, the court should correct the calculation of the parties\u2019 equipment value and address both the cash the court included from Mark\u2019s financial statement and debts the court did not include or address in its findings of fact. We direct the District Court on remand to adjust the. distribution of the marital estate if it is equitable to do so based upon its new calculation of net worth. In all other respects, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in its distribution of the parties\u2019 marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b642 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> The District Court\u2019s order does not explain where this total appears in the Carroll appraisal. The written appraisal admitted into evidence shows a higher total of $2,918,652. Neither party disputes the accuracy of the Carroll appraisal or the District Court\u2019s use of the $2,628,902.50 total. We therefore defer to the District Court\u2019s use of the $2,628,902.50 total.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
