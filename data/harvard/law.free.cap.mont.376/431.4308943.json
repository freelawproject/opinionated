We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\u00b62 On appeal, we address whether the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Franks\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">\u00b63 On December 28, 2010, fifteen-year-old C.L. told her father that his former roommate, Jason Franks, had raped her when she\" was eleven years old. The next day, C.L. and her father went to the Kalispell Police Department to report the allegation. During a forensic interview on January 11,2011, C.L. told Detective Michelle O\u2019Neil that she decided to come forward after four years because of a newspaper article reporting Franks had been accused of molesting a five-year-old boy. The article, published December 3, 2010, was accompanied by a photograph of Franks, which C.L. recognized. C.L. told Detective O\u2019Neil she wanted to help in that case if she could.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">\u00b64 On May 16, 2011, Franks was charged with sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault. Before tried, Franks moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>exclude any mention of the charges in Cause No. DC-10-444(B), the case reported in the newspaper, as more prejudicial than probative under M. R. Evid. 403 and improper character evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b). Franks pointed out he was acquitted of those charges. The State responded it intended to offer testimony explaining that C.L.\u2019s delayed disclosure was prompted by the newspaper article. The State explained it also intended to offer expert testimony about disclosure patterns in child sexual abuse cases, and this expert testimony, combined with testimony about the newspaper article, would help the jury understand why C.L. disclosed when she did. The District Court held a hearing on the motion and concluded the testimony was not offered as evidence of Franks\u2019s character, but rather to explain C.L.\u2019s disclosure, and therefore was admissible. The District Court said Franks could offer evidence he was acquitted of the charges in order to counteract any unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b65 After multiple continuances, trial began November 5,2012. The prosecutor made the following reference to the newspaper article during his opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">You\u2019ll hear from [C.L.], who will state that the reason that she disclosed, finally and fully came forth, was because Jason Franks was in the newspaper. There was an article, and he was accused of raping a little boy, age four or five. And [C.L.] saw the newspaper article, which had a picture of Jason Franks, and it brought everything back home. She recognized him, down to the scar on his face, and suddenly she thought, \u201cI\u2019ve got to come forward to see if I can have an impact in that case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b66 C.L. testified that before seeing the newspaper article, she had disclosed the incident to her best friend, D.B.; another close friend, A.A.; her boyfriend, R.A.; and D.B.\u2019s father. She testified that after a discussion with D.B.\u2019s father, she started to think about telling her own father. C.L. was asked whether a newspaper article also helped her come forward. She responded, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it helped me come forward. It gave me a bigger visual of everything, that I wasn\u2019t the only one.\u201d C.L. testified she could not remember whether she saw the newspaper article before talking to her dad, but \u201cit was close in the time frame.\u201d She later testified she told Detective O\u2019Neil that after seeing the newspaper article, \u201cI knew that there was... another person that had had the same thing done to them that was done to me....\u201d She testified she told Detective O\u2019Neil she wanted to help in that case. Detective O\u2019Neil also testified that C.L. brought up the newspaper article during the forensic interview, and said her reason for coming forward at that time was to help in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u00b67 Franks then testified in his defense and denied the allegations. He testified that his picture had been in the newspaper because he had been charged with sexually assaulting his girlfriend\u2019s son. He testified that he had been tried and found not guilty of those charges by a jury. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Franks whether he heard his attorney state, during jury selection, \u201cthat not guilty doesn\u2019t mean innocent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b68 Prior to closing argument, the jury was instructed that evidence about the newspaper article was admitted only to show why C.L. decided to disclose the incident, and could not be used for any other purpose. During closing argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">Boy, is [C.L.] lucky that a guy named Jason Franks, who happened to be her dad\u2019s roommate, is in the paper, accused of molesting a little boy. What are the odds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">What are the odds that the fall guy that she just happened to list, named Jason, my dad\u2019s roommate, shows up in the paper? Is he an easy target because of the paper, or is he the target because he did this?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u00b69 Franks was convicted of both sexual intercourse without consent gmd sexual assault. He moved for a new trial and acquittal. He claimed the testimony at trial failed to bear out the prosecution\u2019s theory that the newspaper article had prompted C.L.\u2019s disclosure, because her testimony revealed she had already told friends about the incident before seeing the newspaper article. He claimed the unfair prejudice caused by testimony about the newspaper article far outweighed its probative value. He also argued that the conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence, and that his conviction of both sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault violated due process and subjected him to double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u00b610 By stipulation, the District Court vacated the sexual assault conviction. The District Court denied the motion with respect to the remaining issues. The District Court reasoned that despite some conflicts in the testimony, there was evidence showing the newspaper article motivated C.L\u2019s disclosure. The District Court also said the jury instruction and evidence of Franks\u2019s acquittal on the prior charges served to counteract any possible prejudice. The District Court stated that testimony about the newspaper article did not deny Franks a fair and impartial trial. The District Court also concluded there was sufficient evidence supporting the conviction. Franks was sentenced to fifty years in the Montana State Prison, with ten years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Brummer, </em>1998 MT 11, \u00b6 49, 287 Mont. 168, 953 P.2d 250. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>2009 MT 341, \u00b6 7,353 Mont. 111, 220 P.3d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b612 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Franks\u2019s motion for a new trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b613 Following a verdict of guilty, a district court may order a new trial \u201cif required in the interest of justice.\u201d Section 46-16-702, MCA. The court may order a new trial either on motion of the defendant or of its own accord, pursuant to its inherent powers. <em>Brummer, </em>\u00b6 35. Franks moved for a new trial on the grounds that evidence of prior charges of child molestation should have been excluded under M. R. Evid. 404(b) and was more prejudicial than probative under M. R. Evid. 403. He claimed these errors denied him the right to a fair and impartial trial. \u00b614 As a general rule, character evidence is not admissible to prove conduct. M. R. Evid. 404; <em>State v. Dist. Ct. of the Eighteenth Judicial Dist., </em>2010 MT 263, \u00b6 47, 358 Mont. 325, 246 P.3d 415. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may not be admitted to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that he or she acted in conformity with that character on a particular occasion. M. R. Evid. 404(b); <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, \u00b6 61, 367 Mont. 503,291 P.3d 1187. The evidence may, however, be used for \u201cother purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d M. R. Evid. 404(b). Rather than prohibiting the admission of evidence, M. R. Evid. 404(b) prohibits a theory of admissibility. <em>Eighteenth Judicial Dist., </em>\u00b6 47. Evidence of prior bad acts is not admissible if it is offered for a purpose that requires \u201cthe inference from bad act to bad person to guilty person,\u201d <em>Eighteenth Judicial Dist., </em>\u00b6 47, but may be admissible if it \u201c \u2018proves a material issue without requiring any inference to the defendant\u2019s criminal disposition,\u2019 \u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 61 (quoting 22A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence </em>\u00a7 5239, 260 (Supp. 2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u00b615  Even if evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is offered for a valid non-propensity purpose, M. R. Evid. 404(b) may require its exclusion if \u201cthe nature of the evidence might tempt the jury to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the case against the defendant on an improper propensity basis.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 62. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may unduly prejudice the jury against the defendant, regardless of the purpose for which the evidence is nominally admitted. <em>See State v. Sage, </em>2010 MT 156, \u00b6 36, 357 Mont. 99, 235 P.3d 1284. In this way, M. R. Evid. 404(b) must be viewed in concert with M. R. Evid. 403, which allows the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Evidence that is offered for a valid purpose under M. R. Evid. 404(b) is still subject to the balancing test prescribed by M. R. Evid. 403. <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b616  Unfair prejudice may arise from evidence that arouses the jury\u2019s hostility or sympathy for one side, confuses or misleads the trier of fact, or unduly distracts the jury from the main issues. <em>State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 59, 339 Mont. 309, 170 P.3d 444. Where the probative value of evidence is substantially outweighed by its unfair prejudice, admission of the evidence may be reversible error. <em>State v. Pendergrass, </em>179 Mont. 106, 112-13, 586 P.2d 691, 694-95 (1978). In certain circumstances, the nature of the prejudicial material introduced may so severely undermine the fairness of the trial that a new trial is the only remedy. <em>Havens v. State, </em>285 Mont. 195, 200-01, 945 P.2d 941, 944 (1997) (ordering new trial in civil case pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, and M. R. Civ. P. 59(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b617 In its ruling on Franks\u2019s motion in limine, the District Court found testimony about the newspaper article relevant because it explained C.L.\u2019s reason for disclosing the incident after four years. The evidence would be offered for a purpose other than to show Franks\u2019s character, and thus M. R. Evid. 404(b) did not require its exclusion. The \u201chighly inflammatory\u201d nature of child molestation evidence, however, required the District Court and the State to tread with caution. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 46, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735; <em>see also United States v. Ham, </em>998 F.2d 1247, 1252 (4th Cir. 1993) (\u201cIndeed, no evidence could be more inflammatory or more prejudicial than allegations of child molestation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u00b618 As the District Court noted in its ruling on Franks\u2019s motion for a new trial, the testimony regarding the timing of and reasons for C.L.\u2019s disclosure was, in some respects, contradictory. Nevertheless, there was testimony supporting the State\u2019s theory of admissibility. C.L. testified that she told Detective O\u2019Neil she wanted to help in the prosecution of the case reported in the newspaper. Detective O\u2019Neil testified that C.L. said, during the forensic interview, that the other case was her reason for coming forward. Testimony also established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>that C.L. disclosed the incident to her father on December 28, more than three weeks after the article was published on December 3. The testimony presented at trial did in fact help to explain why C.L. disclosed the abuse to her father and to police in December 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b619 It is apparent, however, that the State did not limit its use of the testimony to explaining the timing of C.L.\u2019s disclosure. In his opening statement, the prosecutor stated Franks was \u201caccused of raping a little boy.\u201d After Franks testified he had been acquitted of those charges, the prosecutor asked if he heard his attorney state \u201cthat not guilty doesn\u2019t mean innocent.\u201d This question implied to the jury that, rather than being innocent until proven guilty, Franks was a serial child molester who had simply gotten away with it. The prosecutor later commented on \u201cthe odds\u201d of Franks showing up in the newspaper, \u201caccused of molesting a little boy.\u201d This comment strengthened the implication that Franks was a child molester and therefore more likely to have assaulted C.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b620  The State\u2019s use of the evidence aroused the jury\u2019s hostility toward Franks, resulting in unfair prejudice. <em>See Bieber, </em>\u00b6 59. The District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury that they were not to consider testimony about the newspaper article for any purpose other than to explain C.L.\u2019s disclosure was not sufficient to protect the defendant from undue prejudice in the face of the State\u2019s repeated insinuations. <em>See Sage, </em>\u00b6 42. Similarly, the value of allowing Franks to testify that he was acquitted of the prior charges was negated by the State\u2019s cross-examination, which showed frank disregard for the right of a criminal defendant to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Section 46-16-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b621 Based on the information and arguments presented to the District Court at the motion in limine stage, and given the overwhelmingly prejudicial nature of child molestation evidence, the wiser course would have been to withhold ruling on its admissibility. The issue could have been revisited in the event that the delayed disclosure became an issue for C.L.\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b622  When ruling on Franks\u2019s motion for a new trial, however, the District Court had the full benefit of hindsight, and knew exactly the manner in which the State had manipulated the District Court\u2019s attempted safeguards and used the evidence to create the impression that Franks was a habitual abuser of children. Clearly, the probative value of this evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and should have been excluded under M. R. Evid. 403. <em>See Pendergrass, </em>179 Mont. at 112-13, 586 P.2d at 694-95. To hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>introduction of the evidence did not deny Franks a fair and impartial trial was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 200-01, 945 P.2d at 944 (\u201c[I]n the context of a motion for a new trial, the court should have reconsidered its prior ruling....\u201d). Therefore, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b623 Because we have already determined Franks\u2019s conviction must be reversed, we need not address the remaining issues raised in his appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHAT, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b466-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"ASR\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b625 Although I concur in the Court\u2019s decision, I do not agree with all that is said in our Opinion. The Court decides this case, and reverses Franks\u2019s conviction, based on the District Court\u2019s <em>post-trial </em>ruling denying Franks\u2019s motion for a new trial. In so doing, however, the Court offers several statements relating to the District Court\u2019s <em>pretrial </em>rulings on Franks\u2019s motions in limine. I believe these statements are inconsistent with the Court\u2019s ultimate disposition of the case and that they consequently undermine the Court\u2019s analysis. I am thus compelled to note my disagreement with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\u00b626 First, the Court opines that \u201cthe wiser course\u201d would have been for the District Court \u201cto withhold ruling\u201d on the admissibility of the newspaper article. Opinion, \u00b6 21.1 disagree. \u201cA motion in limine is a request for guidance by the court regarding an evidentiary question, which the court may provide at its discretion to aid the parties in formulating trial strategy.\u201d <em>Hunt v. K-Mart Corp., </em>1999 MT 125, \u00b6 11, 294 Mont. 444, 981 P.2d 275. For example, in <em>State v. Crider, </em>2014 MT 139, 375 Mont. 187, 328 P.3d 612, we observed that Crider had sought through a motion in limine to exclude evidence of his prior bad acts. When his motion was unsuccessful, he adjusted his trial strategy accordingly and instead challenged the State\u2019s use of that evidence. <em>Crider, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">\u00b627 A similar process unfolded in the present case. Franks sought through a motion in limine to prohibit the State from introducing evidence of the 2010 newspaper article reporting that he had been charged with molesting a five-year-old boy in DC 10-444(B). When that motion was unsuccessful, Franks made the tactical choice to confront the evidence directly. Franks and the prosecution were entitled to a ruling on his motion in limine so that they could formulate their respective trial strategies. Indeed, both Franks and the prosecution addressed the newspaper article in their respective opening statements, offering differing views of what the article would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ultimately show regarding C.L.\u2019s disclosure. I do not subscribe to the Court\u2019s view that the District Court should have left the parties hanging, thereby engendering uncertainty and potential confusion as to how the case should proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b628 We have repeatedly approved, and even encouraged, the use of motions in limine, recognizing that such motions serve \u201cvalid and useful\u201d purposes and even have \u201cspecial advantages\u201d in the trial process. <em>State v. Ingraham, </em>1998 MT 156, \u00b6 36, 290 Mont. 18, 966 P.2d 103; <em>Crider, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>State v. Ankeny, </em>2010 MT 224, \u00b6 36, 358 Mont. 32, 243 P.3d 391; <em>see also </em>21 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 5037.10, 760-64 (2d ed. 2005) (listing some of the advantages of a motion in limine). Certainly, there may be situations where the relevance and admissibility of evidence will depend on developments at trial, in which case it will be necessary to delay ruling on the motion in limine or to revisit a prior ruling. Here, however, the prosecution intended to present the jury with a story that included testimony about the newspaper article in order to explain the timing of and reasons for C.L.\u2019s disclosure. Franks and the prosecutors needed to know at the outset whether the District Court would allow this story to be told, so that they could adjust their trial strategies accordingly. I cannot agree that withholding a ruling would have been \u201cthe wiser course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b629 Second, the Court states that the issue of allowing testimony about the article \u201ccould have been revisited in the event that the delayed disclosure became an issue for C.L.\u2019s credibility.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21. The implications of this statement are that the delayed disclosure was not <em>already </em>an issue for C.L.\u2019s credibility and that the defense first had to challenge C.L.\u2019s credibility based on the timing of her disclosure before the prosecution could present any testimony about the article. I disagree on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u00b630 \u201cRelevant evidence\u201d is defined in M. R. Evid. 401 and includes \u201cevidence bearing upon the credibility of a witness.\u201d Thus, since evidence of the delayed disclosure bore upon C.L.\u2019s credibility, the evidence was relevant from the outset and its admission was not dependent on an impeachment theory of admissibility as the Court suggests. This was a \u201che said/she said\u201d case. Franks had denied C.L.\u2019s accusations, and the State\u2019s proof hinged largely on whether the jury believed C.L. C.L., however, had waited four years to report Franks\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct. In evaluating C.L.\u2019s testimony, the jurors naturally would wonder why she had delayed so long in disclosing the incident. Consequently, the delay in her disclosure was necessarily at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>issue. In this regard, C.L. had brought up the newspaper article in her interview with Kalispell Police Detective Michelle O\u2019Neil and stated that it was part of the impetus behind her disclosure. Upon seeing the article, she realized she was not the only victim, and she indicated to O\u2019Neil that she wanted to help with the other victim\u2019s case. Before trial, the State gave notice that it intended to call Dr. Wendy Dutton, an expert in child sexual assault cases, to assist the jury in understanding the dynamics of child sexual abuse. Dr. Dutton would testify that there are many reasons why children disclose sexual abuse, and one of the reasons is to help or protect others. Omitting this portion of C.L.\u2019s story would have impeded the jurors\u2019 evaluation of her credibility and the truthfulness of her disclosure. <em>Cf. United States v. Green, </em>617 F.3d 233, 250 (3d Cir. 2010) (evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts could be introduced to establish the government informant\u2019s reason for cooperating with the FBI, and thereby \u201cimprove her credibility with the jury\u201d). Accordingly, the delayed disclosure was relevant from the outset. M. R. Evid. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b631 Additionally, the prosecution\u2019s need for narrative integrity is a second reason why testimony about the article was potentially admissible at the outset. The circumstances surrounding C.L.\u2019s disclosure \u2014 including the article \u2014 were an integral part of the story the prosecution sought to present to the jury. Indeed, as noted, jurors naturally would wonder about the four-year delay between the alleged offense and C.L.\u2019s disclosure of it. Franks was not entitled to tie the prosecution\u2019s hands and force the prosecution to omit significant pieces of C.L.\u2019s stoxy simply by deciding in advance not to make an issue of the delayed disclosure at trial. \u201c[A] criminal defendant may not stipulate or admit his way out of the full evidentiary force of the case as the Government chooses to present it.\u201d <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 186-87, 117 S. Ct. 644, 653 (1997). The \u201cneed for evidentiaxy richness and narrative integrity in presenting a case\u201d may increase the probative value of uncharged misconduct evidence and support its admissibility. <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 183, 117 S. Ct. at 651. Narrative integrity \u201cis often essential to the capacity of jurors to satisfy the obligations that the law places on them.\u201d <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 187, 117 S. Ct. at 653. \u201cPeople who hear a story interrupted by gaps of abstraction may be puzzled at the missing chapters, and jurors asked to rest a momentous decision on the story\u2019s truth can feel put upon at being asked to take responsibility knowing that more could be said than they have heard.\u201d <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 189, 117 S. Ct. at 654. Also, if jurors\u2019 expectations are not satisfied, they \u201c \u2018may penalize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>party who disappoints them by drawing a negative inference against that party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 188, 117 S. Ct. at 654 (quoting Stephen A. Saltzburg, <em>A Special Aspect of Relevance: Countering Negative Inferences Associated with the Absence of Evidence, </em>66 Cal. L. Rev. 1011, 1019 (1978)). Of course, \u201c[n]ot every story needs lurid embellishment,\u201d and courts must be careful not to \u201cstretch the \u2018complete-the-story\u2019 logic too far.\u201d 1 Kenneth S. Broun et al., <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 190, 1053 (7th ed. 2013). But if \u201cthe incomplete story that the defendant would prefer leaves a gap that would frustrate \u2018the jurors\u2019 expectations about what proper proof should be,\u2019 \u201d <em>McCormick on Evidence, supra, </em>at 1054 (quoting <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 188, 117 S. Ct. at 654), then there is a valid basis for admitting the evidence \u2014 subject to balancing of unfair prejudice against probative value under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b632 Here, failing to explain the delay in C.L.\u2019s disclosure \u2014 even if the defense had not yet made an issue of it \u2014 would have left a conspicuous hole in C.L.\u2019s story and the prosecution\u2019s evidence, thus frustrating \u201cthe jurors\u2019 expectations about what proper proof should be.\u201d <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 188, 117 S. Ct. at 654. This is particularly apparent given Dr. Dutton\u2019s testimony that one reason children disclose sexual abuse is because they learn that another victim has come forward. The significance of this testimony would have been lost on the jury without C.L.\u2019s testimony about the article. The article and Dr. Dutton\u2019s testimony were designed to help the jury understand the prosecution\u2019s case and evaluate C.L.\u2019s credibility. Contrary to the Court\u2019s statement, Opinion, \u00b6 21, it was not a necessary prerequisite that the defense first make the delayed disclosure an issue for C.L.\u2019s credibility. The need for narrative integrity was a valid, independent basis for admitting testimony about the article \u2014 subject, as noted, to Rule 403 balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"AAr3\">\u00b633 This leads to my final point. In discussing the District Court\u2019s ruling on Franks\u2019s motion for a new trial, the Court observes that \u201cthe District Court had the full benefit of hindsight, and knew exactly the manner in which the State had manipulated the District Court\u2019s attempted safeguards and used the [article] to create the impression that Franks was a habitual abuser of children.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22. The Court then opines that \u201cthe probative value of this evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and should have been excluded under M. R. Evid. 403.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22. The Court cites <em>Havens v. State, </em>285 Mont. 195, 200-01, 945 P.2d 941, 944 (1997), for the proposition that, in the context of a motion for a new trial, a district court may need to reconsider an earlier evidentiary ruling. Opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u00b6 22. Although I do not dispute this principle, I believe it is necessary to be clear that the circumstance necessitating a retrial in this case arose not from an error in the District Court\u2019s initial rulings on Franks\u2019s motions in limine but, rather, from the prosecution\u2019s ultimate <em>misuse </em>of the newspaper article during trial for purposes that the District Court had expressly forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b634 <em>Havens </em>illustrates this point. The case involved a lawsuit against the State for failing to install a stoplight at a busy intersection where Havens was injured. Havens filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of his alcohol consumption on the date of the accident, arguing that this evidence was irrelevant. The State responded that it would produce testimony linking Havens\u2019s alcohol consumption as a contributory factor in the accident. On this basis, the district court denied Havens\u2019s motion. Despite the State\u2019s assurance, however, no evidence was produced at trial establishing a connection between Havens\u2019s alcohol consumption and the cause of the accident. Thus, Havens moved for a new trial, which was denied. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont, at 197-98, 945 P.2d at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b635 On appeal, we reversed and remanded for a new trial. We held that the district court \u201cdid not err when it initially denied Havens\u2019 motion in limine based upon the State\u2019s assurance that the testimony to be presented at trial would link Havens\u2019 alcohol consumption to the question of causation.\u201d <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 201, 945 P.2d at 944. We held that the district court erred, rather, after trial when it failed to attribute proper significance to the fact that the State had not presented such testimony. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">[A]fter the verdict, when Havens renewed his contention in the context of a motion for a new trial, the court should have reconsidered its prior ruling in light of the State\u2019s failure to fulfill its promise to elicit testimony establishing Havens\u2019 alcohol consumption as a factor in causing the collision. Havens persistently contended before, during and after the trial that the evidence was not relevant and that it would and did cause prejudice materially affecting his right to a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\"><em>Havens, </em>285 Mont, at 201, 945 P.2d at 944. We held that, under these circumstances, the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">\u00b636 The same principle applies here. In advance of trial, the prosecution gave notice that it intended to introduce evidence of four prior bad acts by Franks: testimony about a 1989 sexual offense involving a 17-year-old girl; testimony about a 1992 sexual offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>involving a 12-year-old girl; testimony about a newspaper article reporting on a 2010 charge of sexual misconduct involving a 5-year-old boy (of which Franks was ultimately acquitted); and a recent report by a female alleging that Franks had sexual intercourse with her sometime in 1992, when she was 13 or 14 years old. Franks filed two motions in limine seeking to exclude this evidence on the ground that it is \u201cpropensity character evidence\u201d and not relevant to the charges involving C.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b637 The District Court agreed with Franks as to the 1989 and 1992 incidents, concluding that the State had \u201cfailed to identify a theory of logical relevance which would permit admission of the evidence.\u201d The court observed that the State essentially was \u201cseeking to prove that Defendant has the character for being sexually interested in young girls and that he acted in conformity with that character regarding C.L.,\u201d which \u201cis the sort of impermissible propensity inference not allowed pursuant to Rule 404(b).\u201d With respect to the 2010 article, however, the District Court concluded that the State\u2019s theory was valid and that any prejudice to Franks could be mitigated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">The evidence regarding the 2010 newspaper article is not offered to prove that Franks has the character to engage in sexual assault and for the jury to infer that he acted in conformance with that character by assaulting C.L. Why and when C.L. disclosed are issues in this case and the evidence is probative of C.L.\u2019s motive in disclosing and should be admitted. As for any unfair prejudicial effect, Defendant can offer into evidence the fact that he was acquitted of the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\u00b638 A trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811; <em>State v. Oatman, </em>275 Mont. 139, 143-44, 911 P.2d 213, 216 (1996). I do not believe the District Court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of the 1989 and 1992 incidents, while allowing testimony about the 2010 article for the limited purpose of explaining the timing of and reasons for C.L.\u2019s disclosure. Rather, similar to <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont, at 201, 945 P.2d at 944, the problem developed at trial when one of the prosecutors made improper remarks that violated the letter and spirit of the District Court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b639 In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury: \u201cYou\u2019ll hear from [C.L.], who will state that the reason that she disclosed, finally and fully came forth, was because Jason Franks was in the newspaper.\u201d The prosecutor then indicated that \u201c[Franks] was accused of raping a little boy, age four or five.\u201d As the State concedes on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>this was not an accurate statement, as the article did not report that Franks had been accused of \"rape.\u201d Furthermore, stating that Franks had been accused of \"raping a little boy\u201d was an inflammatory accusation, <em>State v. Rogers, </em>2013 MT 221, \u00b6 44, 371 Mont. 239, 306 P.3d 348; <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 46,306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735, which is particularly apparent in light of the voir dire proceedings. Substantial time was spent ascertaining whether the prospective jurors could fairly and impartially decide a case of alleged sexual offenses against an 11-year-old girl. Six members of the venire admitted they could not be impartial and thus were excused by the District Court for cause, while others raised concerns but opined that they could remain impartial nonetheless. Given the nature of the charges and the concerns raised in voir dire, portraying Franks as a serial \u201crapist\u201d risked provoking feelings of indignation and revulsion in the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b640 During trial, Franks took the stand and denied C.L.\u2019s allegations of misconduct. On cross-examination, the prosecutor referenced Franks\u2019s picture in the newspaper and inquired whether his appearance in the December 2010 picture was the same as how he looked in late 2006 and early 2007 (the period of the alleged offenses against C.L.). As a result, on redirect examination, Franks explained that his picture had been in the paper because he had been charged with a sexual offense involving his girlfriend\u2019s son. He testified that he was tried for that offense and the jury had found him not guilty. On recross-examination, the prosecutor attempted to impeach this testimony by pointing out to Franks that \u201cnot guilty doesn\u2019t mean innocent\u201d \u2014 the obvious innuendo being that Franks sexually assaulted his girlfriend\u2019s five-year-old son and got away with it. This insinuation was improper on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b641 First, in weighing probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice, the District Court reasoned that Franks could introduce the fact of his acquittal to mitigate any prejudice resulting from testimony about the article. This was integral to the District Court\u2019s Rule 403 balancing. In conveying to the jury that Franks\u2019s acquittal \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean [he\u2019s] innocent,\u201d the prosecutor undercut the very safeguard that the District Court had put in place when it ruled that the State could present testimony about the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b642 Second, whether Franks actually committed the sexual offense referenced in the article was not something the jury needed to decide, or even consider. In other cases, where the jury is being asked to infer a person\u2019s knowledge, motive, intent, etc. based on the person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>commission of a prior bad act, it is necessary,for the proponent to present sufficient evidence upon which the jury can find that the prior act in fact occurred. <em>See Huddleston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 690, 108 S. Ct. 1496, 1501-02 (1988); <em>United States v. Plancarte-Alvarez, </em>366 F.3d 1058, 1062-63 (9th Cir. 2004); <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>696 F.3d 794, 799-800 (9th Cir. 2012). But here, the District Court did not admit testimony about the article so that the jury could (1) find that Franks sexually molested a five-year-old boy and then (2) draw inferences based on Franks\u2019s commission of that offense. The court admitted the testimony solely to explain the timing of and reasons for C.L.\u2019s disclosure. The truth of the allegations reported in the article was not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b643 Third, and perhaps most importantly, the prosecutor\u2019s remark invited the jury to hold Franks accountable for an offense of which he had already been tried and acquitted. One of the protections guaranteed by the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution is the protection against a separate prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 445-46, 90 S. Ct. 1189, 1195 (1970); <em>State v. Barron, </em>2008 MT 69, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 100, 179 P.3d 519. One of the dangers in admitting evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior misconduct is that the jury will convict him not for the offense charged, but for his past misdeeds. <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 180-81, 117 S. Ct. at 650-51; <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 51, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. This danger is aggravated when the prosecutor implies that the defendant was mistakenly acquitted of a prior offense \u2014 that he essentially \u201cgot away with it.\u201d There is a risk that the jury, even if it believes the defendant is not guilty of the present charge, will convict the defendant anyway in order to punish him for the prior acquitted charge. There is also a risk that the jury will convict because it believes, in spite of the acquittal, that the defendant committed the prior offense and thus is more likely to have committed the charged offense. \u201cThese dangers ... strike at the heart of the protections embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>State v. Mundon, </em>292 P.3d 205, 222 (Haw. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b644 Some courts have held that evidence of a prior offense is not admissible if the defendant has been acquitted of that offense. <em>See Mundon, </em>292 P.3d at 221-23; <em>State v. Wakefield, </em>278 N.W.2d 307, 308-09 (Minn. 1979); Christopher Bello, Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Evidence as to Other Offense as Affected by Defendant\u2019s Acquittal of that Offense, </em>25 A.L.R.4th 934, \u00a7\u00a7 3-4 (1983 &amp; Supp. 2014). While this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Court has not, to my knowledge, adopted the same bright-line rule, we have held that an acquittal constitutes \u201ca conclusive adjudication that defendant did not commit the [prior] offense\u201d and that the State is estopped at the trial on the current offense from asserting facts that are contrary to the acquittal. <em>State v. Hopkins, </em>68 Mont. 504, 517, 219 P. 1106, 1110 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b645 Accordingly, for all of these reasons, the prosecutor\u2019s insinuation that Franks had in fact committed the 2010 offense, despite his acquittal of that charge, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b646 Lastly, in closing argument, the prosecutor suggested that the jury should believe C.L. since she had implicated the same man who was accused of molesting another child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">So what we have here is this young girl who, from the first time she discloses [to her friends], indicates \"it was my father\u2019s roommate,\u201d and that continues. Then, before the newspaper article comes out, she tells her then-boyfriend it\u2019s a guy named Jason, that\u2019s all he knew. Then she continues, and finally the newspaper comes out and, man, is she lucky. Boy, is she lucky that a guy named Jason Franks, who happened to be her dad\u2019s roommate, is in the paper, accused of molesting a little boy. What are the odds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">What are the odds that the fall guy that she just happened to list, named Jason, my dad\u2019s roommate, shows up in the paper? Is he an easy target because of the paper, or is he the target because he did this?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">This argument invited the jury to infer that Franks is a sexual predator who preys on young children, that his acts of sexual aggression are dictated by his character, and that he acted in conformity with that character by sexually assaulting C.L. This is the very inference that Rule 404, our precedents, and the District Court\u2019s rulings all forbid.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">\u00b647 In deciding whether \"the interest of justice\u201d required that Franks be granted a new trial, \u00a7 46-16-702(1), MCA, the District Court needed to consider the State\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s rulings on Franks\u2019s motions in limine, <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont, at 201, 945 P.2d at 944. The Court implicitly concludes, and I agree, that the District Court should have attributed greater significance to the prosecution\u2019s misuse of the newspaper article and manipulation of the District Court\u2019s attempted safeguard. Opinion, \u00b6 22. Franks was on trial for two sexual offenses against C.L. The District Court allowed the State to present testimony that C.L. disclosed the misconduct after seeing an article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>which displayed Franks\u2019s picture and reported that he had been charged with sexual misconduct against a young boy. Evidence of prior child molestation is highly inflammatory and prejudicial \u2014 even more so where, as here, the defendant has been charged with doing the same thing to another child. Opinion, \u00b6 17; <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46. However, rather than limit his questioning and arguments in accordance with the District Court\u2019s rulings, the prosecutor dwelled on and embellished the nature of the 2010 charge and went beyond explaining the timing of and reasons for C.L.\u2019s disclosure. Collectively, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks implied to the jury that Franks was a serial child molester. The prosecutor invited the jury to infer that Franks committed the prior offense and thus committed the present offense, and also invited the jury to punish Franks for what the prosecutor implied was an erroneous acquittal of the 2010 charge. We cannot have confidence under these circumstances that Franks received a fair and impartial trial. In light of the prosecutor\u2019s actions, the District Court should have granted Franks\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 201, 945 P.2d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b648 In conclusion, except for my disagreement with the aforementioned statements at \u00b6\u00b6 21 and 22 of the Opinion, I otherwise join the Court\u2019s decision reversing and remanding for a new trial. The prosecutor\u2019s improper use of uncharged misconduct evidence, beyond the use authorized by the District Court\u2019s rulings on Franks\u2019s motions in limine, deified Franks a fair and impartial trial. I specially concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-6\">JUSTICE RICE joins the Special Concurrence of JUSTICE McKinnon.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
