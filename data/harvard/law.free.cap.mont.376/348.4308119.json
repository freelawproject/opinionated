We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">\u00b63 The following facts are taken from Brian\u2019s complaint, Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, and the documents filed in connection with Defendants\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">\u00b64 Defendant Holly Ann Duncan is a resident of Florida. In 2009, she signed a quit claim deed transferring to Brian\u2019s father, Grayson Tackett, her interest in real property located in Dade City, Florida. It appears that Grayson resides in Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">\u00b65 The Dade City property was insured by Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens). Citizens is \u201ca government entity that is an integral part of the state [of Florida].\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 627.351(6)(a)l. Citizens \u201cprovide[s] affordable property insurance to applicants who are in good faith entitled to procure insurance through the voluntary market but are unable to do so.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 627.351(6)(a)l. Citizens issues insurance only on property located in Florida and only through agents licensed in Florida. Citizens does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>transact any business in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b66 A house was located on the Dade City property. In 2010, two bolts of lightning struck the house, resulting in a fire loss. Grayson filed a claim with Citizens and hired Defendant Charles Tutwiler and Associates, Inc. (Tutwiler), a public adjusting company, to assist with handling the claim. Tutwiler is a Florida corporation. Defendant Robert Hemann was the Citizens adjustor on Grayson\u2019s claim. Hemann is a Florida resident. He has never resided, owned property, or transacted business in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b67 On February 20, 2013, Citizens issued a check for $67,930.22 in settlement of the claim. The check was made out to Grayson and Duncan, the named beneficiaries under the policy, and to Tutwiler, their public adjuster. It was issued in Florida and was sent to Tutwiler in Florida. Tutwiler obtained Duncan\u2019s endorsement on the check, apparently based on Duncan\u2019s Tinderstanding that she would receive 50 percent of the proceeds once Grayson endorsed the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b68 Brian claims that Duncan did not have any right to the insurance funds. He alleges that he reached an agreement with Tutwiler on Grayson\u2019s behalf, pursuant to which Brian would pay Tutwiler\u2019s adjusting fees and Tutwiler, in turn, would mail the Citizens check (with Tutwiler\u2019s and Duncan\u2019s endorsements) to Grays\u00f3n \u201cas a free and clear negotiable instrument needing only his signature.\u201d Brian states that he wired $7,543.02 from his bank account in Montana as payment of Tutwiler\u2019s adjusting fees on March 15,2013. Tutwiler then sent the endorsed check to Grayson on March 18. It appears that Grayson attempted to cash or deposit the check in Kentucky, without success. Grayson then assigned the check to Brian.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b69 On March 28, 2013, Duncan\u2019s attorney (Defendant Stephen Stanley) sent a letter to Hemann at Citizens. Stanley implied that Tutwiler had wrongfully accepted payment of its adjusting fees in exchange for sending the endorsed check to Grayson. Stanley asserted that Duncan\u2019s endorsement on the check had been obtained by fraud and false pretenses. Stanley requested that Citizens cancel or stop payment on the check until the matter could be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\u00b610 Citizens ordered a stop payment on the check on April 3,2013. In his complaint, Brian alleges that Tutwiler and Hemann effected the stop payment. Hemann denies this allegation and asserts that the stop payment was ordered by another Citizens employee. Tutwiler likewise disputes Brian\u2019s allegation, but also points out that even if Hemann and Tutwiler did in fact effect the stop payment as Brian claims, this act occurred in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u00b611 On April 5, 2013, Hemann received an email from Brian. Brian stated that he represented himself and Grayson with regard to the Citizens check. Brian further stated that he had personally wired the funds to have the check released to Grayson. He asked that a new check be issued in Grayson\u2019s name only, for the full amount of $67,930.22, and that the new check be sent to Brian at a mailing address in Troy, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b612 Also on April 5,2013, Grayson contacted Citizens customer service and left a message requesting that Hemann contact him or Brian. Hemann returned the call but was unable to reach Grayson or Brian. Later that day, Hemann received a call from Brian. The two of them discussed the letter Stanley had sent to Hemann on Duncan\u2019s behalf. Hemann advised Brian that Citizens intended to reissue the check and that Citizens was contractually obligated to issue the check to the co-insureds, Duncan and Grayson, and to their public adjuster, Tutwiler. Hemann indicated that the reissued check would be sent to Tutwiler in Florida. Brian objected to this arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b613 Brian filed the instant action in Montana\u2019s Nineteenth Judicial District Court on April 8, 2013. He alleged that Defendants had procured a wire transfer from Brian to Tutwiler under false pretenses and with the intent to defraud him. More specifically, he claimed that Duncan, Stanley, Hemann, and Tutwiler had conspired to induce payment from Brian for Tutwiler\u2019s adjusting fees of $7,543.02 and then stopped payment on the Citizens check for the $67,930.22 in insurance proceeds. Brian sought compensatory damages of $7,568.02 (which includes a $25.00 wire-transfer fee) and punitive damages. He asserted that the District Court had personal jurisdiction over Defendants because his injury arose from \u201ca transaction which occurred in Lincoln County, Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b614 Defendants all moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Initially, the District Court noted that, to survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff must make a sufficient showing that personal jurisdiction exists based not only on the pleadings, but also on the affidavits and exhibits supporting or opposing the motion. <em>K-V Pharm. Co. v. J. Uriach </em>&amp; <em>CIA, S.A., </em>648 F.3d 588, 591-92 (8th Cir. 2011); <em>Jet Charter Serv., Inc. v. Koeck, </em>907 F.2d 1110, 1112 (11th Cir. 1990). Thus, the court converted Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment and set a time for discovery and supplemental briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u00b615 After the deadline for discovery had passed, the District Court entered am order granting summary judgment to Defendants. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>court concluded that general personal jurisdiction did not exist because Defendants\u2019 contacts with Montana were neither continuous nor systematic. The court further concluded that specific personal jurisdiction did not exist because all of the substantial activity underlying Brian\u2019s claims occurred in Florida. The court noted that Defendants were not engaged in a business relationship with Brian, who was neither an owner of the Dade City property nor a beneficiary under the insurance policy. The court reasoned that Defendants\u2019 contacts with Montana were minimal and would not have caused them to anticipate being haled into a Montana court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b616 The existence of personal jurisdiction is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>See Gulf Ins. Co. v. Clark, </em>2003 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 315 Mont. 121, 68 P.3d 673; <em>El Dorado Heights Homeowners\u2019 Assn. v. Dewitt, </em>2008 MT 199, \u00b6 14, 344 Mont. 77, 186 P.3d 1249. If the trial court conducts a preliminary hearing and makes factual findings necessary to the determination of personal jurisdiction, we review those findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Gulf Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 11. No such hearing was conducted in the present case, however. The District Court based its determination of personal jurisdiction on the parties\u2019 filings supporting and opposing the motions for summary judgment. As such, our review of the District Court\u2019s decision is entirely de novo. <em>Andersen v. Schenk, </em>2009 MT 399, \u00b6 2, 353 Mont. 424, 220 P.3d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Defendants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">\u00b618 \u201c[T]he reasonableness of asserting jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant must be assessed in the context of our federal system of government.\u201d <em>Simmons v. State, </em>206 Mont. 264, 271, 670 P.2d 1372, 1376 (1983) (citing <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286,100 S. Ct. 559 (1980)). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constrains a state\u2019s authority to bind a nonresident defendant to a judgment of its courts. <em>Walden v. Fiore, </em>134 S. Ct. 1115, 1121 (2014) (citing <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 291, 100 S. Ct. at 564). \u201cAlthough a nonresident\u2019s physical presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the court is not required, the nonresident generally must have \u2018certain minimum contacts ... such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>and substantial justice.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1121 (ellipsis in original) <em>(quoting Intl. Shoe Co. v. Wash., </em>326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S. Ct. 154, 158 (1945), in turn quoting <em>Milliken v. Meyer, </em>311 U.S. 457, 463, 61 S. Ct. 339, 343 (1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b619 There are two categories of personal jurisdiction: specific and general. <em>Daimler AG v. Bauman, </em>134 S. Ct. 746,754 (2014). \u201cSpecific\u201d or \u201ccase-linked\u201d jurisdiction depends on an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally an activity or occurrence that takes place in the forum state and is therefore subject to the state\u2019s regulation. <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1121 n.6; <em>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, </em>131S. Ct. 2846,2851 (2011). Thus, specific jurisdiction focuses on the \u201c \u2018relationship <em>among </em>the defendant, the forum, and the litigation,\u2019 \u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 758 (quoting <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 204, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 2580 (1977)), and depends on whether the defendant\u2019s \u201csuit-related conduct\u201d created a substantial connection with the forum state, <em>Walden, 134 </em>S. Ct. at 1121. \u201cGeneral\u201d or \u201call purpose\u201d jurisdiction, conversely, permits a court to assert jurisdiction over a defendant based on a forum connection unrelated to the underlying suit. <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1121 n.6. General jurisdiction exists where the defendant\u2019s affiliations with the state are so \u201ccontinuous and Systematic\u201d as to render the defendant essentially at home in the forum state and, as such, subject to suit on any and all claims against it, even causes of action that arise from dealings entirely distinct from the defendant\u2019s activities within the state. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b620 Rule 4(b)(1) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure incorporates these principles of general and specific jurisdiction. <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Holly Corp., </em>244 Mont. 75, 83, 796 P.2d 189, 194 (1990). The first sentence of the rule provides for general jurisdiction. It states: \u201cAll persons found within the state of Montana are subject to the jurisdiction of Montana courts.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1). We have defined \u201cfound within\u201d Montana to mean that the party is physically present in the state or that the party\u2019s contacts with the state are so pervasive that the party maybe deemed to be physically present within the state. <em>Simmons Oil, </em>244 Mont, at 83, 796 P.2d at 194. \u201cA nonresident defendant that maintains \u2018substantial\u2019 or \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 contacts with the forum state is found within the state and may be subject to that state\u2019s jurisdiction even if the cause of action is unrelated to the defendant\u2019s activities within the forum.\u201d <em>Simmons Oil, </em>244 Mont, at 83, 796 P.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b621 The remainder of Rule 4(b)(1) provides for specific jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>Threlkeld, v. Colo., </em>2000 MT 369, \u00b6 10, 303 Mont. 432,16 P.3d 359. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">Additionally, any person is subject to the jurisdiction of Montana courts as to any claim for relief arising from the doing personally, or through an employee or agent, of any of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">(A) the transaction of any business within Montana;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">(B) the commission of any act resulting in accrual within Montana of a tort action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">(C) the ownership, use, or possession of any property, or of any interest therein, situated within Montana;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">(D) contracting to insure any person, property, or risk located within Montana at the time of contracting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">(E) entering into a contract for services to be rendered or for materials to be furnished in Montana by such person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">(F) acting as director, manager, trustee, or other officer of a corporation organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business within, Montana; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">(G) acting as personal representative of any estate within Montana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(l)(A)-(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">\u00b622  This Court applies a two-part test to determine whether a Montana court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. <em>Threlkeld, </em>\u00b6 9. First, we determine whether personal jurisdiction \u2014 general or specific \u2014 exists pursuant to Rule 4(b)(1). Second, if personal jurisdiction exists pursuant to Rule 4(b)(1), we then determine whether exercising such jurisdiction would comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice embodied in the Due Process Clause. <em>Threlkeld, </em>\u00b6 9; <em>Nasca v. Hull, </em>2004 MT 306, \u00b6 26, 323 Mont. 484,100 P.3d 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">\u00b623 The District Court determined that the first part of the test was not met. The court considered both general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction and concluded that neither existed under Rule 4(b)(1). Brian does not contest the District Court\u2019s conclusion as to general jurisdiction. Thus, we turn to the question whether the District Court erred in concluding that it lacked specific jurisdiction over Defendants. \u00b624 Brian relies on Rule 4(b)(1)(B) as the sole basis of specific jurisdiction in this case. That provision states: \u201c[A]ny person is subject to the jurisdiction of Montana courts as to any claim for relief arising from... the commission of any act resulting in accrual within Montana of a tort action.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1)(B). Brian suggests that his tort claims accrued in Montana because Defendants\u2019 conduct caused him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>suffer a loss in Montana \u2014 namely, the funds he transferred from his Montana bank account to Tutwiler. In response, Defendants cite this Court\u2019s \u201caccrual\u201d precedents for the proposition that Brian\u2019s claims did not accrue within Montana. We agree with Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b625 In <em>Bi-Lo Foods, Inc. v. Alpine Bank, </em>1998 MT 40, 287 Mont. 367, 955 P.2d 154, Bi-Lo Foods (a Montana corporation) entered into negotiations with D. Hermann &amp; Co. (a Colorado sole proprietorship) for the purchase of refrigeration equipment. As part of these negotiations, Hermann instructed Bi-Lo to deposit earnest money into an escrow account at Alpine Bank (a Colorado corporation). Bi-Lo sent Alpine a $10,000 check, which Alpine deposited into Hermann\u2019s account. Thereafter, negotiations between Bi-Lo and Hermann broke down. Bi-Lo demanded that the escrow money be returned, but Alpine and Hermann refused. Bi-Lo then filed a complaint against Alpine in a Montana district court. <em>Bi-Lo, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-7. Bi-Lo argued that its claims accrued in Montana because, \u201cby cashing its check and disbursing the funds to Hermann, Alpine took voluntary actions which were calculated to have an effect in Montana, did cause injury in Montana to a Montana resident, and should have caused Alpine to reasonably anticipate being haled into court in Montana.\u201d <em>Bi-Lo, </em>\u00b6 21. We disagreed, reasoning that all acts giving rise to Bi-Lo\u2019s claims occurred in Colorado: \u201cBi-Lo sent its check to, Alpine in Colorado. Alpine deposited the check into the account of one of its customers in Colorado. Alpine\u2019s alleged mishandling of the check occurred in Colorado. Accordingly, Alpine\u2019s activities did not result in the accrual of a tort action in Montana.\u201d <em>Bi-Lo, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b626 In <em>Bird v. Hiller, </em>270 Mont. 467, 892 P.2d 931 (1995), Carolyn Bird and Cara Bird were Montana residents who were involved in an automobile accident in Idaho. Philip Bird (Carolyn\u2019s husband and Cara\u2019s father) hired M.B. \u201cBuck\u201d Hiller, an Idaho attorney, to represent them in connection with the accident. Hiller sent Philip a contingency fee agreement, which Philip signed in Montana and returned to Hiller. Cara did not sign the agreement, however, nor was her name mentioned in the agreement. Hiller undertook the representation and ultimately negotiated settlements of the Birds\u2019 claims. Two settlement checks were issued, one for Cara and one for Carolyn. Both checks included Hiller as a payee. Meanwhile, a dispute arose between the Birds and Hiller over Hiller\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Hiller claimed he was entitled to one-third of each settlement check, while the Birds claimed he was entitled to one-third of only Carolyn\u2019s check, since Cara had not signed the fee agreement. The Birds, through their Montana counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>sent the checks to Hiller for his signature; however, Hiller refused to endorse them until he received written authorization to negotiate the drafts, deduct his attorney's fees and costs, and remit the balance to the Birds. <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont, at 468-70, 892 P.2d at 931-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b627 The Birds filed a complaint against Hiller in a Montana district court asserting claims of fraud, deceit, and conversion. They argued that these claims accrued in Montana because that is where Hiller sent certain documents to the Birds. First, Hiller sent the fee agreement to the Birds in Montana, where it was executed. The agreement allegedly was false and misleading, and evidenced an intent to defraud and deceive the Birds, because it did not mention Hiller\u2019s representation of Cara or that Hiller would take a fee for any services he provided to Cara. Second, Hiller later sent a letter to the Birds in Montana' advising them that he was going to withhold the settlement checks until he received authorization to negotiate the checks and deduct attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont, at 471-73, 892 P.2d at 933-34. We concluded, however, that Hiller\u2019s sending these documents to Montana did not result in the accrual of claims here. We held that the conversion claim accrued in Idaho because that is where Hiller came into possession of the checks and allegedly asserted unauthorized control over them. <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont, at 472, 892 P.2d at 934. Likewise, any alleged fraud or deceit that Hiller perpetrated on the Birds as a result of his unstated intentions about representing Cara accrued in Idaho. In this regard, we observed that Philip traveled to Idaho to seek out Hiller\u2019s representation, and all representation regarding the Birds\u2019 claims, including the settlement negotiations, took place in Idaho. Although Hiller sent the fee agreement and other letters to the Birds in Montana, we noted that \u201cjurisdiction is not acquired through interstate communications pursuant to a contract to be performed in another state.\u201d Bird, 270 Mont, at 473, 892 P.2d at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b628 In <em>Threlkeld, </em>the Threlkelds raised and bred Appaloosa horses outside Bozeman, Montana. After one of the horses developed a neurological condition, the Threlkelds took the horse to Colorado State University\u2019s Veterinary Teaching Hospital for treatment. The horse died the day after it was admitted to the Hospital, and the Threlkelds filed suit in a Montana district court against the University and the Hospital alleging veterinary malpractice, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation or fraud. <em>Threlkeld, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-5. The Threlkelds asserted that University personnel had recommended a course of treatment and assured them the Hospital could provide such treatment, but that these assurances were false because University personnel knew the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>facilities were not available due to a recent salmonella outbreak and the horse did not receive the quality of care promised. <em>Threlkeld, </em>\u00b6 26. In arguing that their claims accrued in Montana, the Threlkelds cited <em>Johnson Flying Serv., Inc. v. Mackey Intl., Inc., </em>1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16642 (D. Mont. Aug. 8, 1975). The <em>Johnson </em>court, after noting the absence of Montana decisional authority, relied on federal cases to conclude that a nonresident who sends material representations into a state with the intention that they be relied on, and they are relied on by a resident of the forum state to his detriment, is subject to the jurisdiction of that state\u2019s courts. 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16642, at *8-9. We concluded, however, that this construction of Montana\u2019s \u201caccrual\u201d provision was doubtful in light of our more recent decision in <em>Bird. Threlkeld, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Based on <em>Bird, </em>we held that \u201cthe Threlkelds\u2019 deceit and fraud claims relate entirely to services to be performed in Colorado and the mere existence of interstate communications relating to those services does not provide a basis for personal jurisdiction over [the Colorado defendants].\u201d <em>Threlkeld, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b629 Lastly, in <em>Cimmaron Corp. v. Smith, </em>2003 MT 73, 315 Mont. 1, 67 P.3d 258, Cimmaron (a Montana corporation) entered into a collection agreement with Budget Reader\u2019s Service (a Pennsylvania corporation owned by Pennsylvania resident Gregory Smith) and a sales agreement with Gregory\u2019s father, Harold Smith (a Florida resident). Thereafter, Cimmaron filed suit against Budget and the Smiths in a Montana district court asserting various claims, including conversion of funds and misappropriation of assets. <em>Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 17. Cimmaron conceded that the defendants\u2019 actions giving rise to those claims occurred outside Montana; however, Cimmaron argued that because it was detrimentally affected within Montana by the defendants\u2019 actions, such actions resulted in the accrual of a tort action within Montana. <em>Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b630 We disagreed with this argument. We reiterated that \u201c \u2018a nonresident does not subject himself to the jurisdiction of Montana by merely entering into a contract with a resident of Montana.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6 14 (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Edsall Constr. Co. v. Robinson, </em>246 Mont. 378, 382, 804 P.2d 1039,1042 (1991)). Moreover, \u201c \u2018interstate communication is an almost inevitable accompaniment to doing business in the modem world, and cannot by itself be considered a \u201ccontact\u201d for justifying the exercise of personal jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Edsall, 246 </em>Mont, at 382, 804 P.2d at 1042, in turn quoting <em>Simmons, </em>206 Mont, at 280, 670 P.2d at 1380). Finally, we again noted that \u201cpersonal jurisdiction is not acquired through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>interstate communications made pursuant to a contract that is <em>to be performed in another state.\u201d Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6 14 (emphasis in original) (citing <em>Bird, 270 </em>Mont. at 473, 892 P.2d at 934). Relying on <em>Bird, </em>we held that the actions which gave rise to the alleged torts occurred outside Montana, since the defendants came into possession of, and allegedly misappropriated, Cimmaron\u2019s accounts receivable in Pennsylvania. We thus held that the defendants\u2019 actions did not result in the accrual of a tort action within Montana. <em>Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b631 In analyzing accrual in each of these cases, we focused on where the events giving rise to the tort claims occurred, rather than where the plaintiffs allegedly experienced or learned of their injuries. In <em>Bi-Lo, </em>Alpine\u2019s alleged mishandling of Bi-Lo\u2019s check took place in Colorado. In <em>Bird, </em>Hiller\u2019s alleged fraud, deceit, and conversion arose from actions that Hiller took in Idaho. In <em>Threlkeld, </em>the defendants\u2019 alleged malpractice and misrepresentations regarding the horse\u2019s treatment occurred in Colorado. In <em>Cimmaron, </em>the defendants\u2019 conversion and misappropriation of funds occurred in Pennsylvania. \u00b632 In addition to the foregoing cases, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent pronouncements on specific jurisdiction, within the context of a tort action, are also relevant to our analysis. First, the limits on a state\u2019s adjudicative authority \u201cprincipally protect the liberty of the nonresident defendant \u2014 not the convenience of plaintiffs or third parties.\u201d <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1122 (citing <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 291-92, 100 S. Ct. at 564). Thus, the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation \u201cmust arise out of contacts that the \u2018defendant <em>himself </em>creates with the forum State.\u201d <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1122 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 475, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 2184 (1985)). \u201c[T]he defendant-focused \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 inquixy [cannot be satisfied] by demonstrating contacts between the plaintiff (or third parties) and the forum State.\u201d <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1122; <em>see also Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, SA. v. Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 417, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 1873 (1984) (\u201c[The] unilateral activity of another party or a third person is not an appropriate consideration when determining whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to justify an assertion of jurisdiction\u201d). However significant the plaintiffs contacts with the foxum may be, those contacts cannot be decisive in determining whether the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant is proper. <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b633 Second, \u201c[the] \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 analysis looks to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State itself, not the defendant\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>contacts with persons who reside there.\u201d <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1122. \u201c[T]he plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the formn. Rather, it is the defendant\u2019s conduct that must form the necessary connection with the formn State that is the basis for its jurisdiction over him.\u201d <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1122. While \u201ca defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State may be intertwined with his transactions or interactions with the plaintiff or other parties[,]... a defendant\u2019s relationship with a plaintiff or third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1123. A defendant must be haled into court in a forum state \u201cbased on his own affiliation with\u201d the state, not based on the unilateral activity of a plaintiff or on the random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts the defendant has with other persons affiliated with the state. <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b634 Here, Defendants\u2019 only link to Montana is Brian. Defendants have no connection with this state, other than the connection that Brian himself has created. No part of Defendants\u2019 course of conduct forming the basis of Brian\u2019s claims occurred in Montana. Defendants never traveled to, conducted activities within, or sent anything or anyone to Montana. Citizens issued the settlement check in Florida and sent the check to Tutwiler in Florida. Tutwiler, in turn, sent the check to Grayson in Kentucky. Duncan, Stanley, Hemann, and Tutwiler formulated and executed the alleged conspiracy to defraud Brian in Florida. Tutwiler\u2019s alleged agreement to send Grayson the check with Duncan\u2019s and Tutwiler\u2019s endorsements in exchange for Brian\u2019s payment of Tutwiler\u2019s adjusting fees occurred in Florida, and Defendants\u2019 alleged act of stopping payment on the settlement check after receiving Brian\u2019s payment occurred in Florida. Duncan\u2019s, Tutwiler\u2019s, and Hemann\u2019s communications with Brian were initiated by Brian on his and Grayson\u2019s behalf and were directed, by Brian, to these individuals in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b635  Brian contends that his alleged injury (the loss of the funds he paid to Tutwiler) occurred in Montana. \u201c[M]ere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum,\u201d however. <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1125; <em>accord Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-20 (the mere fact that the plaintiff was detrimentally affected within Montana by the defendant\u2019s actions outside Montana is not sufficient to establish accrual of a tort action within this state). Brian also contends that Defendants knew their conduct would cause him a loss in Montana. However, the transmission into Montana of material statements that the defendant allegedly knows ar\u00e9 false or fraudulent is insufficient by itself to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>establish accrual of a fraud or deceit action in Montana. <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont, at 472-73, 892 P.2d at 934; <em>Threlkeld, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-30; <em>cf. Bi-Lo, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-31 (that the defendant allegedly took actions which were calculated to have an effect in Montana and caused an injury to a Montana resident in Montana does not establish accrual of an action in Montana).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b636  In sum, Defendants \u201cformed no jurisdictionally relevant contacts\u201d with Montana. <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1124. All but one of the events giving rise to Brian\u2019s claims occurred in Florida. Brian\u2019s single act of authorizing his local bank in Montana to wire funds to Tutwiler is insufficient to establish that his tort action accrued in Montana for purposes of M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1)(B). Therefore, the District Court correctly concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b637 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
