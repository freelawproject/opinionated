To receive benefits, Sayler reported to the State of Montana Department of Labor and Industry (DLI) that he worked zero hours a week. DLI eventually determined that Sayler misrepresented the hours he worked and that Sayler was ineligible for assistance. DLI required Sayler to repay the benefits, and imposed an administrative penalty. The Fourth Judicial District Court reversed in part, concluding that when Sayler drew no salary he was eligible to receive unemployment benefits and was not under a duty to report the hours he worked. DLI appeals that decision. We now address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u00b62 <em>1. Whether a corporate officer working full-time without pay for his corporation is engaged in employment under Montana\u2019s Unemployment Insurance Law and is required to report his hours of work when seeking unemployment benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">\u00b63 <em>2. Whether DLI correctly imposed a penalty on Sayler for misrepresenting the amount of hours he worked.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">\u00b64 We reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of DLI.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">\u00b65 Robert Sayler owns and is president of Big Sky Bikes (BSB), a Montana corporation located in Missoula. Sayler owns 51% of BSB and his wife owns the rest. When BSB experienced a downturn in business in 2010, Sayler stopped taking a salary and, in November 2010, applied for unemployment benefits. Despite no longer drawing a salary, Sayler continued his customary 50-hour work weeks for BSB. Sayler continued working to keep the business going and to protect his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>personal investment in BSB until it again could turn a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">\u00b66 Between November 2010 and September 2012, Sayler periodically would collect unemployment benefits. For each week Sayler claimed benefits, the benefit application rules required Sayler to report \u201call hours of insured work and gross wages for insured work.\u201d Sayler repeatedly reported that he worked zero hours, and repeatedly received benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b67 BSB initiated a \u201cbonus plan\u201d in mid-2011. Under the \u201cbonus plan,\u201d Sayler occasionally received a bonus or wage from BSB, and Sayler reported these earnings. As the earnings disqualified him from unemployment benefits, Sayler did not receive benefits for the weeks he reported earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b68 In September 2012, DLI audited BSB. During the audit, Sayler admitted that he worked 50 hours a week. The auditor referred the matter to the Claims Investigation Unit. The following month, DLI determined that Sayler had wrongfully received benefits. DLI calculated the amount of overpaid benefits to' be $28,387.00. DLI ordered Sayler to repay these benefits, along with a $9,367.71 penalty. Sayler requested a redetermination, but DLI affirmed its decision. Sayler appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b69 In January 2013, a Hearing Officer (Hearing Officer) issued a decision affirming DLI\u2019s determination. The Hearing Officer agreed that Sayler had not been \u201ctotally unemployed\u201d when he continued to work. The Hearing Officer also found that Sayler was not credible when he testified that he did not think he had to report his hours of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u00b610 Sayler appealed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision to the Board of Labor Appeals (Board). In February 2013, the Board concluded that substantial evidence supported the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings and that the Hearing Officer had correctly applied the law. The Board adopted and affirmed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">\u00b6 11 Sayler sought judicial review in the Fourth Judicial District Court. The District Court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court determined that the Board had included factual inaccuracies in its decision \u2014 specifically, the Board had asserted that Sayler had failed to report his bonuses in 2011 when in fact Sayler had reported the bonuses. The court also disagreed with the Board\u2019s and the Hearing Officer\u2019s interpretation of the law as it applies to corporate officers. The court concluded that Sayler was required to report his hours only during the period of time when BSB adopted the \"bonus plan\u201d in 2011. Outside the \u201cbonus plan\u201d period, the court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that Sayler was not working for a wage or under a contract for hire, so he did not need to report his work and was eligible to receive benefits. \u00b612 DLI appeals the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b613 When a district court reviews a decision by the Board of Labor Appeals, the court reviews conclusions of law for correctness. <em>McKay v. Bd. of Labor Appeals, </em>1999 MT 329, \u00b6 13, 297 Mont. 357, 990 P.2 1251. The same standard applies for this Court\u2019s later review of the district court decision. <em>Gary and Leo\u2019s Fresh Foods, Inc. v. Mont. Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>2012 MT 219, \u00b6 12, 366 Mont. 313, 286 P.3d 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b614 <em>1. Whether a corporate officer working full-time without pay for his corporation is engaged in employment under Montana\u2019s Unemployment Insurance Law and is required to report his hours of work when seeking unemployment benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b615 Under Montana\u2019s Unemployment Insurance Law, unemployment assistance is for \u201cthe benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.\u201d Section 39-51-102(3), MCA. The law accordingly requires that a person be \u201ctotally unemployed\u201d to receive benefits. Section 39-51-201(27), MCA. A person is \u201ctotally unemployed\u201d when the person meets two criteria measured on a weekly basis: (1) the person does \u201cnot perform any work in employment,\u201d and (2) the person does \u201cnot earn any wages for employment.\u201d Section 39-51-2101(1), MCA (2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A97\">\u00b616 The legislature has provided a definition of \u201cemployment,\u201d and, by extension, \u201cwork in employment.\u201d Employment includes \u201cservice... by an officer of a corporation... performed for wages or under any contract of hire, written or oral, express or implied.\u201d Section 39-51-203(1), MCA. To qualify as employment, then, the service must either be (1) for wages, (2) under an express contract, or (3) under an implied contract. Section 39-51-203(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u00b617 While there is no express contract in the record, DLI argues that the record evinces an implied contract. The existence of a contract ordinarily is a question of law. <em>Chipman v. Nw. Healthcare Corp., </em>2014 MT 15, \u00b6 12, 373 Mont. 360, 317 P.3d 182. A contract is formed through the consent of identifiable parties for a lawful object, backed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>by consideration. Section 28-2-102, MCA. A contract is implied when it is manifested by the conduct rather than by the words of the contracting parties. Section 28-2-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b618 The record establishes that there was an implied contract between Sayler and BSB. Even after he stopped taking a salary, Sayler continued working 50 hours a week for BSB. The consideration for that work becomes apparent through examining Sayler\u2019s relationship with BSB. Sayler was not donating 50 hours a week to a not-for-profit entity. Rather, BSB was Sayler\u2019s business; he owned 51% of it, and his wife the rest. By continuing to work without a salary, Sayler increased BSB\u2019s worth, with the expectation that it would benefit him. In Sayler\u2019s own words, he continued working for BSB without pay because he had \u201ca large personal investment [in] the business,\u201d and intended to work until BSB again became profitable. DLI Hr\u2019gTr. 83:20-24, Dec. 26, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b619  Because Sayler was a corporate officer, performing service under an implied contract, he was performing \u201cwork in employment.\u201d Section 39-51-203(1), MCA. The plain language of \u00a7 39-51-2101(1), MCA, requires that, in order to be \u201ctotally unemployed,\u201d a person must perform no work <em>and </em>receive no wages. It is thus ultimately of no consequence to Sayler\u2019s employment status that he received no wages for his work outside the \u201cbonus plan\u201d period. The District Court erred as a matter of law in construing the statute otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b620  Sayler argues nonetheless that he did nothing wrong by reporting zero hours a week because he was required to report only \u201cinsured work.\u201d See Admin. R. M. 24.11.443(4) (2006) (\u201cA claimant must report all hours of <em>insured work </em>and gross wages for insured work for each week claimed.\u201d) (emphasis added). The problem with this argument is that \u201cinsured work\u201d means the same thing as \u201cemployment.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.11.204(20) (2006) (\u201c \u2018Insured work\u2019 means ... employment, as defined in 39-51-203, MCA ... .\u201d). In other words, \u201cinsured work\u201d includes a corporate officer\u2019s service under an implied contract. Section 39-51-203(1), MCA. The same implied contract that rendered Sayler ineligible for unemployment ben\u00e9fits also placed him under a duty to report his weekly hours of work. We hold that Sayler was employed and under a duty to report his hours of work, and that the abdication of that duty led to his wrongful receipt of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b621 <em>2. Whether DLI correctly imposed a penalty on Sayler for misrepresenting the amount of hours he worked.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b622 Sayler argues that DLI incorrectly imposed an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>penalty in addition to requiring Sayler to repay his wrongfully received benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b623 \u201cA person who makes a false statement or representation knowing it to be false or who knowingly fails to disclose a material fact in order to obtain or increase any benefit\u201d faces certain consequences. Section 39-51-3201(l)(a), MCA. One consequence is that the person is \u201crequired to repay ... a sum equal to the amount wrongfully received by the individual, plus the department may assess a penalty not to exceed 100% of the fraudulently obtained benefits.\u201d Section 39-51-3201(l)(a)(ii), MCA. DLI set the penalty for a first-time offense during the pertinent time period in this case to be equal to 33% of the fraudulently obtained benefits. Admin. R. M. 24.11.1209 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b624 As recounted above, Sayler\u2019s argument before this Court has been that he accurately represented the hours he worked because he was under no duty to report his hours of work while not receiving a wage. We have concluded that this argument is incorrect as a matter of law and that Sayler was under a duty to report his hours of work. The Heaxing Officer found that Sayler knowingly misrepresented his hours of work and that Sayler\u2019s claimed misinterpretation of \u201cinsured work\u201d was \u201cnot credible.\u201d Sayler does not directly contest these factual findings, but instead relies on his argument that DLI incorrectly applied the law. Based on our determination that DLI\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct, the Hearing Officer\u2019s conclusion that there was a knowing misrepresentation must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b625  The consequences of a knowing misrepresentation are clear under the law. The legislature granted DLI the power to assess penalties upon individuals who make misrepresentations. Section 39-51-3201(l)(a)(ii), MCA. DLI fixed the administrative penalty for a first-time offense at 33% of the wrongfully received benefits. Admin. R. M. 24.11.1209 (2000). In levying a 33% penalty on Sayler for his first offense, DLI acted according to its administrative rules and according to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u00b626 The District Court\u2019s November 19, 2013 order is reversed. We remand to the District Court for entry of judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-9\">JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\"> The legislature amended the statute in 2011, but all the pertinent language remained the same as among the two versions that applied when Sayler received benefits. Unless otherwise noted, reference is to the 2009 version of the MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
