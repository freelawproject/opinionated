The bulk of the parties\u2019 property was found to be either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>gifted to Karen Rintoul (Karen), or purchased with money inherited by Karen. Russell appeals from the court\u2019s decision to award Karen a significantly larger share of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b62 We affirm, after addressing the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err by distributing substantially all the gifted and inherited property received from Karen\u2019s family during the marriage to Karen without proper consideration of Russell\u2019s contributions to the family ?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>2. Should Karen be awarded attorney fees incurred in responding to this appeal?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00b63 The parties were married for 38 years before filing a petition for dissolution in 2012. The parties owned and operated an automobile repair business together for a significant portion of the marriage, which was sold in 2003. Russell is a mechanic, while Karen works as a bookkeeper. She does not have other specialized training. During the years they operated the repair business, both parties worked long hours, making a combined annual salary of approximately $40,000. However, all this income was reported under Russell for tax purposes. \u00b64 The District Court found that the parties\u2019 combined salary would have supported them, but would not have permitted accumulation of the substantial assets in the marital estate. It made specific factual findings that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the parties\u2019 assets had either been gifts from Karen\u2019s family or purchased with money Karen inherited. The court also found that during the course of the marriage, the parties used money from Karen\u2019s trust fond to pay living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u00b65 Following a bench trial on September 19,2013, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Order) distributing the marital assets and debts between the parties. A Decree of Dissolution of Marriage was entered on October 17, 2013, incorporating the Order. The Order distributed to Karen approximately three-quarters of the marital estate. Further facts will be included below where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">\u00b66  We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact pertaining to the division of martial assets to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage ofTummarello, </em>2012 MT18, \u00b6 21, 363 Mont. 387, 270 P.3d 28. \u201cIf the court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous, we will reverse only if the district court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Tummarello, </em>\u00b6 21. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>district court has \u201cbroad discretion to apportion a marital estate in a manner equitable to each party under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Tummarello, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u2022\u00b67 <em>1. Did the District Court err by distributing substantially all the gifted and inherited property received from Karen\u2019s family during the marriage to Karen without proper consideration of Russell\u2019s contributions to the family </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b68 Russell\u2019s sole claim of error is that \u201c[t]he District Court judge made an error of law when he failed to consider [ <em>In re Marriage of Funk, </em>2012 MT 14, 363 Mont. 352, 270 P.3d 39] when making his decision as to the property distribution.\u201d Russell argues-that under <em>Funk, </em>it \u201cno longer matters if the parties acquired property through inheritance or with the help of one of the parties\u2019 family.\u201d Thus, he claims he should have been given an equal share of all marital property, including the property gifted to or inherited by Karen.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b69 Russell\u2019s claim of error is discounted by even a cursory review of the record. The District Court explicitly directed the parties to address <em>Funk </em>and how it related to the facts of this case prior to trial, and again allowed the parties to do so in post-trial briefing at Russell\u2019s request. Moreover, though the Order does not specifically cite to <em>Funk, </em>the document reveals that the court did precisely what we required in <em>Funk </em>\u2014 consideration of each of the statutory factors relating to gifted or inherited property and entry of property-specific findings of fact underlying the equitable apportionment of the property. <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 34. \u00b610 In <em>Funk, </em>a husband challenged the district court\u2019s distribution of property awarding the wife a portion of the value of real property he inherited. Noting that there had been conflicting results in o\u00far prior decisions as to whether inherited or gifted property was to be included in the marital estate in dissolution proceedings, we clarified that a court is required to \u201cequitably apportion between the parties all assets and property of either or both spouses, regardless of by whom and when acquired.\u201d <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19. However, we recognized that \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, supplied \u201cthe particular matters to be considered in dividing pre-acquired, gifted or inherited property.\u201d <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 16. Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, provides that for such property, the court must consider the contributions of the other spouse to the marriage including the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker, the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of the property, and whether or not the property division serves as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>alternative to maintenance. Due to the specific statutory factors to be considered in regard to pre-acquired, gifted, or inherited property, we held that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s decision with respect to this category of property must affirmatively reflect that each of these factors was considered and analyzed, and must be based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 19. We remanded the case to the district court because the decision to distribute a portion of inherited property to the other spouse did not reflect specific consideration of any of these factors. <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-24. We also noted that \u201c[i]t will be incumbent upon the parties to provide full disclosure of all property.\u201d <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b611 Contrary to Russell\u2019s argument that proper consideration of <em>Funk </em>requires \u201cthat the gifted and inherited property be <em>equally </em>apportioned between the parties\u201d (emphasis added), nothing in that decision directs that gifted and inherited property be equally apportioned. Such an application would essentially abrogate the requirements of \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, and move Montana toward a <em>de facto </em>community property state. Our decision in <em>Funk </em>only clarifies that pre-acquired, gifted, or inherited property is to be included in the martial estate when determining property distribution, though with specific statutory factors to be considered when determining an equitable distribution of the estate. We specifically noted that \u201c[t]he party claiming ownership of the pre-acquired, bequested or gifted property is entitled to argue that it would be equitable to award him or her the entirety of such property.\u201d <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b612 Russell premises an argument that he contributed to the improvement and upkeep of the subject property upon several asserted facts, and concludes therefrom that the property distribution was inequitable, but these asserted facts were not found by the District Court, and Russell has not challenged any of the court\u2019s findings as clearly erroneous. We will not reweigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, or consider whether the evidence would support a different decision than the one reached by the court. <em>In re Estate of Bradshaw, </em>2001 MT 92, \u00b6 11, 305 Mont. 178, 24 P.3d 211. \u00b613 The primary assets were two pieces of real property \u2014 the family home (Cobum Property) and a vacation property (Luther Property). The Cobum Property was gifted to the couple by Karen\u2019s father and had a current value of $190,000. This home is located,approximately one mile from Karen\u2019s father and step-mother, on part of a large ranch purchased by Karen\u2019s father. The Luther Property was also gifted to the couple by Karen\u2019s father, and had a current value of $525,000. This property had been purchased by Karen\u2019s father decades earlier and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Karen\u2019s grandfather lived on the property until his death, when Karen\u2019s father gifted it to Karen in 1995. A neighbor had done much of the upkeep of the property over the years, and Karen\u2019s father and brother paid for a fence, gate, and pond to be built on the property. Karen used money she inherited from her mother to purchase an Airstream trailer which still remains on the property. The court determined that the couple made few contributions to the property, but did use joint funds to deliver electricity to the property. The court distributed both properties to Karen.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b614 Among the other assets were four retirement accounts. The court found that the parties only contributed $41,000 of martial funds to the retirement accounts, while over $120,000 came from Karen\u2019s inherited funds. The court distributed the individually-held accounts to the respective parties, with Karen\u2019s account balance being slightly larger than Russell\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">\u00b615 The District Court also noted that several assets were sold or liquidated by Russell following the filing of the petition for dissolution, in violation of the Summons and Restraining Order, and the proceeds were kept by Russell. Most of the values received were unknown to the court at the time of trial, but the court estimated the amounts and attributed them to Russell\u2019s portion of the divided assets. The court also noted that Russell did not formally disclose at least one bank account in his name, the account balance of which was not known at the time of trial. Despite Russell\u2019s failure to disclose this account and its value, the court did not estimate any amount to attribute to Russell for this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b616 The court considered the three factors set out in \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, with regards to the gifted or inherited property, and concluded that neither party was a homemaker, but Karen \u201ccontributed the most nonmonetary contributions to the marriage\u201d; Russell made some contributions to the properties through his labor and general upkeep; and maintenance was not an issue as neither party had asked for it. Among the other reasons for the court\u2019s determination of the equity of the distribution was that Russell has a trade and the ability to work and make more than Karen in the future; the parties\u2019 income during the marriage was accounted for under Russell, giving him approximately 60% more credits toward future Social Security than Karen; Russell was currently fighting for ancestral land in Hawaii, where he moved after the separation, and any land interest he received in Hawaii was awarded to him; and that Karen h\u00e1d family ties and sentimental reasons for keeping the real property, which she planned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>on retaining in the family, while Russell only sought to liquidate and receive cash. After considering all these unique factors, the court determined it was equitable to give Karen the majority of the marital estate. However, it determined that equity required an \u201cequalization payment\u201d of $50,000 to Russell in consideration of the long duration of the marriage and Russell\u2019s contributions to the maintenance of the gifted properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b617  Based on the record, it is clear that the District Court properly considered the factors in \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, with regard to the gifted or inherited property in this case and made specific findings of fact relating to the property and the equitable distribution of the estate. We conclude there was no error in the facts found by the District Court, and that the court did not abuse its discretion in its distribution of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b618 <em>2. Should Karen he awarded attorney fees incurred in responding to this appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b619 Karen asks us to award attorney fees incurred in responding to this appeal as sanctions pursuant to M. R. App. P. 19(5). We may award sanctions, including costs, attorney fees, or other monetary or non-monetary penalty, to the prevailing party in an appeal if the appeal is \u201cdetermined to be frivolous, vexatious, filed for purposes of harassment or delay, or taken without substantial reasonable grounds.\u201d M. R. App. P. 19(5). However, \u201c[t]his Court does not readily impose sanctions for filing frivolous appeals. As a general rule, we impose sanctions in cases only where the appeal is entirely unfounded and intended to cause delay, or where counsel\u2019s actions otherwise constitute an abuse of the judicial system.\u201d <em>Bi-Lo Foods, Inc. v. Alpine Bank, </em>1998 MT 40, \u00b6 36, 287 Mont. 367, 955 P.2d 154 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b620 As noted above, the record clearly demonstrates that the District Court did exactly what Russell faults the court for failing to do \u2014 consider <em>Funk. </em>Russell knew about the court\u2019s consideration of <em>Funk </em>because the issue was discussed before trial and he specifically asked the court for the opportunity to submit post-trial briefing on the effect of that case. For Russell to argue that the District Court failed to consider or apply <em>Funk, </em>without referencing this record, is simply misleading. Russell\u2019s arguments regarding <em>Funk </em>and the distribution of gifted or inherited property are clearly unsupported by the specific instructions provided in that case. Finally, Russell\u2019s briefing includes significant mischaracterizations or omissions of fact that failed to challenge the District Court\u2019s findings of fact as clearly erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Russell cites to his own trial testimony regarding facts not found by, or contrary to those found by, the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b621 We decline to impose sanctions under Rule 19(5) because this case itself provided a reasonable basis to challenge the District Court\u2019s application of <em>Funk </em>and the equity of the property distribution. However, the manner in which the case was argued very nearly moved our discretion to impose sanctions. Appeals to this Court must be supported by an accurate presentation of authority, M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f), and accurately represent the record. Advocating for a desired result is required and expected, but parties must stop short of advancing arguments that are a misrepresentation of the record or of case holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b201-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, SHEA and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
