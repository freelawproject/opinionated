As Holbrook was running the pickup driver\u2019s information, Eisenzimer approached Holbrook\u2019s patrol car. As Eisenzimer approached, the patrol car\u2019s red and blue flashing top lights were activated, the occupied pickup truck was parked in front of Holbrook\u2019s car, and Holbrook was sitting in his patrol car running the pickup driver\u2019s information. Seeing Eisenzimer approach, Holbrook motioned with his hand for him to keep moving. Eisenzimer, who was visibly intoxicated, asked Holbrook for a ride home. Holbrook repeatedly told Eisenzimer to \u201ckeep walking\u201d and to \u201cget out of here.\u201d When Eisenzimer persisted in asking for a ride, Holbrook told him he was busy and stated, \u201cYou want to be arrested? Keep walking. I\u2019ll do it. Get out of here.\u201d After several warnings, Holbrook arrested Eisenzimer for obstructing a peace officer. After placing Eisenzimer in custody, Holbrook completed his traffic stop of the pickup driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b64 On September 7, 2011, Eisenzimer was found guilty in Conrad City Court of obstructing a peace officer pursuant to \u00a7 45-7-302, MCA. He appealed his conviction to the District Court, which conducted a trial de novo. At trial in the District Court, Eisenzimer moved at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief to dismiss the charge for insufficient evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His motion was denied. On September 17,2012, a jury found Eisenzimer guilty of obstructing a peace officer. On October 15,2012, the District Court sentenced Eisenzimer to submit to a chemical dependency evaluation at. his own expense, and to pay court costs totaling $654.25. Eisenzimer appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b65 We review the denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence de novo. <em>State v. Kirn, </em>2012 MT 69, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 356, 274 P.3d 746. \u201cWe review a question on the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Booth, </em>2012 MT 40, \u00b6 7, 364 Mont. 190, 272 P.3d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b66 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Eisenzimer\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence to convict him of the charge of obstructing a peace officer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b67 \u201cA person commits the offense of obstructing a peace officer or public servant if the person knowingly obstructs, impairs, or hinders the enforcement of the criminal law.\u201d Section 45-7-302(1), MCA. \u201c[A]n individual obstructing a peace officer must engage in conduct under circumstances that make him or her aware that it is highly probable that such conduct will impede the performance of a peace officer\u2019s lawful duty.\u201d <em>City of Kalispell v. Cameron, </em>2002 MT 78, \u00b6 11, 309 Mont. 248, 46 P.3d 46 (interpreting the statutory definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d under \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, in the context of \u00a7 45-7-302(1), MCA.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b68 Eisenzimer argues that he neither hindered Holbrook\u2019s enforcement of the law, nor was he aware that his conduct was \u201chighly probable\u201d to impede the performance of Holbrook\u2019s work. Eisenzimer argues that his situation is similar to <em>Cameron, </em>in which we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for obstructing a peace officer because we concluded that \u201cthe City did not and could not prove the elements of \u00a7 45-7-302(1), MCA.\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>\u00b6 13. Eisenzimer\u2019s reliance on <em>Cameron </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b69 In <em>Cameron, </em>two police officers observed the vehicle in which defendant Cameron was a passenger driving erratically as it pulled into a restaurant\u2019s parking lot. As the officers approached the vehicle, both Cameron and the driver had already exited and Cameron was walking into the restaurant. While the first officer was investigating the driver, the second officer instructed Cameron to get back into the vehicle. Cameron refused, stating that he was going to get something to eat. After Cameron refused the officer\u2019s instruction a second time, he was arrested and charged with obstructing a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\u00b610 At trial, the officer who had arrested the driver \u201ctestified that his ability to arrest the driver had not been hindered in any way by Cameron and that Cameron did nothing to delay or threaten him.\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>\u00b6 6. This Court reversed Cameron\u2019s conviction after concluding that Cameron did not obstruct the officers in the performance of their duties, the officer had no reason to arrest Cameron, and Cameron had no reason to know why he was being investigated or arrested. <em>Cameron, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b611  In contrast to <em>Cameron, </em>there was ample evidence presented in Eisenzimer\u2019s case from which a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of obstructing a peace officer beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>reasonable doubt. Holbrook was obviously in the middle of a traffic stop when Eisenzimer approached him. The top lights on Holbrook\u2019s patrol car were flashing as Eisenzimer approached, and the lights continued to flash as Eisenzimer repeatedly asked for a ride. Holbrook told Eisenzimer he was busy and repeatedly instructed Eisenzimer to \u201ckeep walking\u201d and advised him that he would be arrested if he continued to ask for a ride. Holbrook was only able to complete his traffic stop after he arrested Eisenzimer. Prior to arresting Eisenzimer, Holbrook\u2019s attention to the performance of his duties \u2014 i.e., the traffic stop \u2014 was diverted by responding to Eisenzimer\u2019s repeated requests for a ride. Although Holbrook acknowledged at trial that he did not think Eisenzimer intended to impede his work, Eisenzimer\u2019s subjective intent is not the issue. The issue is whether Eisenzimer engaged in conduct that impeded the performance of Holbrook\u2019s lawful duties under circumstances that made Eisenzimer aware it was highly probable his conduct would impede the performance of those duties. Reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have made such a finding beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b612 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Eisenzimer\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\"> Eisenzimer moved for a directed verdict in favor of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief. However, his motion is treated as a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 21 n.2, 342 Mont. 1, 180 P.3d 1102.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
