We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-25\">\u00b62 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court violated N. A.\u2019s statutory and due process rights when it issued a commitment order without obtaining from N. A. an intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and knowing waiver of his procedural rights as required by \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">\u00b63 N.A. is a 31-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder. In early February 2013, N.A. was conditionally discharged from the Montana State Hospital, Warm Springs, Montana. In March 2013, N.A. called his mother from the bank to report a gas leak at their home. N.A.\u2019s mother returned home and, finding no gas leak, drove to the bank to pick up N.A. She had difficulty convincing N.A. to close the car door, and he refused to wear Ms seatbelt. N.A. tried to exit the moving veMcle twice. N.A.\u2019s mother stopped at a store to contact law enforcement officers. Meanwhile, N. A. wrapped Ms money in an orange towel and put the towel on Ms head. When Ms mother told Mm not to enter the store like that, N.A. said: \u201cI can because I control the air.\u201d Law enforcement officers arrived and placed N.A. in protective custody at Hope House in Bozeman, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b64 WMle in custody at Hope House, N.A. reported smelling chemicals in the hallway, wore a dirty jacket and pants with an open zipper, constantly brushed the floor with Ms feet, and carried trash in Ms jacket. John Karath (Karath), a licensed climcal social worker, interviewed N.A. and concluded he was decompensating, showed impaired judgment, and was unable to protect Ms health and safety. \u00b65 On March 11, 2013, the State filed a petition for involuntary commitment and attached a report by Karath. At an imtial hearing that day, N.A. appeared in person and with counsel. The District Court asked whether there was an individual who could be appointed friend of respondent pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-102(8), MCA. N.A. responded that \u201c[tjhere is a possible fiiend I would like appointed. I would need more time to appoint one.\u201d The District Court reserved N.A.\u2019s right to appoint a friend. Upon N.A.\u2019s request, the court held a detention hearing pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-124, MCA, and heard testimony from N.A.\u2019s mother and from the Hope House manager. After the testimony, the court ordered that a member of the Crisis Response Team evaluate N.A. to determine whether he was an appropriate candidate for placement on the voluntary side, rather than the emergency detention' side of Hope House.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b66 On March 14, 2013, the District Court held a hearing on the State\u2019s commitment petition. N.A. again appeared in person and with counsel. The court received representations from N.A.\u2019s counsel and the State that N.A. had agreed that a commumty commitment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>appropriate. N.A.\u2019s counsel stated: \u201c[N.A.] is supportive of this proposed resolution, and we\u2019ve talked about it. So he\u2019s positive, and I\u2019m hopeful that everything will work out.\u201d David Powell (Powell), the certified professional person, testified that he had reviewed the State\u2019s petition for involuntary commitment and the records at Hope House, and that he had spoken with Karath, N.A.\u2019s mother, and N.A. Powell \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d N.A. was suffering from a mental disorder that might require community commitment and concluded it would be in N.A.\u2019s best interest to stay at Hope House on the voluntary side, \u201cwhich [N.A.] said he would very much enjoy.\u201d Powell indicated he had discussed his recommendations with N.A. who \u201ctold [him] all of the specifics of the Treatment Plan\u201d and seemed willing to follow through with the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b67 The court then orally announced its findings that N.A. had a mental disorder requiring a community commitment, that the least restrictive commitment was to'the Hope House voluntary side, and that N.A. \u201chas apparently agreed to do that and to abide by the terms and conditions of the rules of the Hope House.\u201d Subsequently, the District Court entered a written order mandating that N.A. be committed to a community program for 90 days and listing the conditions of his community commitment program. N.A. timely appealed the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b68 N.A. argues that the District Court failed to: (1) follow the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, in obtaining the waiver of his procedural rights; (2) conduct a hearing satisfying the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-126, MCA; and (3) issue a commitment order satisfying the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-127, MCA. The State counters that no waiver was necessary because the District Court conducted an adequate hearing with N.A. present and represented by counsel and with testimony from a professional person. The State argues that the record supports the District Court\u2019s findings under \u00a7 53-21-126, MCA, that N.A. was suffering from a mental disorder and required commitment. The State further argues that the court\u2019s order met the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-127(8), MCA, because \u201cN.A. implicitly acknowledged his diagnosis by virtue of the fact that he agreed to psychiatric treatment in the community.\u201d However, the State does not squarely address N.A.\u2019s contention that the record contains no evidence that he made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s civil commitment order to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re R.W.K., </em>2013 MT 54, \u00b6 14, 369, Mont. 193, 297 P.3d 318 (citations omitted). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made after reviewing the entire record. <em>R.W.K., </em>\u00b6 14 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b610 Due process claims arising from involuntary civil commitments are subject to plenary review. <em>R.W.K., </em>\u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court violate N.A.\u2019s statutory and due process rights when it issued a commitment order without obtaining from N.A. an intentional and knowing waiver of his procedural rights as required by \u00a7 83-21-119(1), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b612 Section 53-21-119(1), MCA, sets forth the requirements for a valid waiver of rights in a civil commitment action, and provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">A person may waive the person\u2019s rights, or if the person is not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision, these rights may be waived by the person\u2019s counsel and friend of respondent... acting together if a record is made of the reasons for the waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">A district court must inquire into whether the person who is the subject of a petition for involuntary commitment is capable of making an intentional and knowing waiver of rights. <em>In </em>re A.M., 2014 MT 221, \u00b6 11, 376 Mont. 226, 332 P.3d 263 (citation omitted). As we stated in <em>In re P.A.C., </em>2013 MT 84, \u00b6 14, 369 Mont. 407, 298 P.3d 1166, \u201cThe nature and extent of the record will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case,\u201d but at a minimum, the record must reflect that the attorney discussed the waiver with her client, that the client desired to waive his rights, and that the attorney was satisfied that her client understood his rights and the nature of the proceeding. <em>P.A.C., </em>\u00b6 14; R.W.K, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">\u00b613  In this case, N.A. did not read the State\u2019s petition, and he interrupted the District Court\u2019s reading of his rights, which the District Court did not resume. Importantly, as in our recent decision in <em>A.M., </em>neither N. A. nor his attorney made any representations to the District Court that N.A. understood his rights and the nature of the proceedings and that he had the capacity to knowingly and intentionally waive his procedural rights, nor did the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>make any inquiry or record in this regard. N.A.\u2019s counsel stated that N.A. was supportive of a community commitment, and Powell testified that N.A. had said he would enjoy commitment on the voluntary side of Hope House. However, no evidence was presented and no record was made establishing a knowing and intentional waiver of N.A.\u2019s procedural rights. Pursuant to our holding in <em>A.M., </em>\u00b6 15, we conclude that the District Court violated N. A.\u2019s statutory and due process rights when it accepted a stipulation to an involuntary commitment without first making an affirmative determination on the record that N.A. understood his procedural rights and waived those rights intentionally and knowingly. Thus, we must reverse the order of N. A.\u2019s commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"AfI\">\u00b614 Because this issue is dispositive, we do not reach N.A.\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b615 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, and supporting case law, thereby violating N. A.\u2019s statutory and due process rights. The District Court\u2019s order committing N.A. to community commitment is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b411-8\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A3V\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u00b616 I agree with the Court that the requirements for a waiver of procedural rights under \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, were not satisfied. The record does not reflect that N.A. was ever advised of his rights \u2014 either at the initial hearing or at the hearing on the commitment petition \u2014 by the District Court, counsel, or otherwise. For a waiver of rights to be knowingly and intelligently made, the respondent must first be made aware of his rights \u2014 particularly in light of statutory provisions requiring such an advisement. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 53-21-115, -119, -121(h), MCA. \u00b617 I believe, howover, the Court\u2019s analysis overlooks that the parties and District Court actually conducted an evidentiary hearing on the State\u2019s petition. Following a detention hearing on March 11, 2013, where voluntary placement at the Hope House was considered, the District Court set a trial date of March 14,2013. On March 14, 2013, the State produced the testimony of professional person David Powell, who established that N. A. was suffering from a mental disorder. Thus, it appears the parties and the District Court were conducting a trial on the petition, with N. A.\u2019s subsequent \u201cstipulation\u201d regarding placement to be thereafter considered. This would explain why no effort was made by counsel or the District Court to satisfy the requirements for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>waiver of procedural rights. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA. N.A. wasn\u2019t waiving any of his trial rights, but was rather agreeing to his placement option.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b618 N.A. thus argues, as an alternative to an insufficient waiver of his rights, that the State failed to prove he required commitment because of the existence of one or more of the circumstances set forth in \u00a7 53-21-126(1) and (4), MCA. The State did not produce sufficient evidence demonstrating that N.A.., as a result of his mental disorder, was unable to provide for his own basic needs, had caused or was imminently likely to cause injury to himself or others, or was likely to deteriorate to a point at which he would present a danger to himself or others. Section 53-21-126(1), (4), MCA. The District Court\u2019s finding that N.A. suffers from a mental disorder, by itself, is insufficient to satisfy statutory requirements authorizing a commitment. Simply stated, a person may not be committed solely on the basis of having a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b619 I therefore believe both the Court and the Dissent get lost between the statutory requirements authorizing a commitment, which have not been met, and the statutory requirements for a valid waiver, which similarly have not been met. Because the State did not attempt to present evidence addressing \u00a7 53-21-126(1) and (4), MCA, both the Court and the Dissent misinterpret the absence of evidence as N.A.\u2019s waiver of his right to have evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b620 I agree with the Court that the record does not affirmatively establish a knowing and intelligent waiver by N.A. of his procedural rights. However, the Court overlooks that the parties and the District Court appear to have actually conducted a hearing. N.A.\u2019s argument that the evidence presented at that hearing was insufficient pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-126, MCA, is therefore well-tak\u00e9n.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b621 I would reverse the judgment of the District Court, but for reasons in addition to those set forth by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b412-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH,</author>\n<p id=\"AqI\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">\u00b622 I dissent. The Court relies in part on our decision in <em>In re P.A.C., </em>2013 MT 84, \u00b6 14,369 Mont. 407,298 P.3d 1166. The circumstances of that case are significantly different from those found in the present case. P.A.C. did not appear at the commitment hearing. <em>P.A.C., </em>\u00b6 4. Because she was not present, the district court did not have the benefit of observing her demeanor and responses to the proceeding, and she was unable to voice any objection to . the representations of her attorney. <em>P.A.C., </em>\u00b6 4. At her court-ordered evaluation immediately prior to the hearing, P.A.C.\u2019s mental state was poor. <em>P.A.C., </em>\u00b6 4. She refused to cooperate and insisted the only treatment she needed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>alcohol and marijuana. <em>P.A.C., </em>\u00b6 4. Under those circumstances, there was reason to require confirmation that she understood her rights and the nature of the proceeding. <em>P.A.C., </em>\u00b6 13. We noted in PA. C. that the nature and extent of the record necessary to establish a knowing and intelligent waiver would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. P.A.C., \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b623 In this case, N.A. appeared at the commitment hearing, listened to statements indicating he had agreed to the commitment, and made no protest. The professional person testified that N. A. was \u201cdoing really well,\u201d was \u201cvery insightful about his disease,\u201d and \u201cseemed to have a pretty good plan\u201d for his treatment. The State agreed that N.A. was \u201cdoing much better.\u201d His attorney represented that N. A. was \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201csupportive\u201d about his proposed treatment. N.A. personally affirmed to the District Court that he had no questions about the disposition, and thanked the District Court when it wished him good luck in his treatment at Hope House. The District Court had the benefit of directly observing N.A.\u2019s demeanor. The District Court found that N. A. agreed a community commitment would be appropriate. The circumstances that led us to conclude further inquiry was required in P.A.C. are not present in this case. I would affirm the commitment order to which N.A. willingly agreed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-6\">JUSTICE BAKER and JUSTICE WHEAT join the Dissent of CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH. .</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
