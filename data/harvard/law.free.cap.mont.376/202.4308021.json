We affirm and restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to CBU for prevailing on its constitutional claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">\u00b63 FWP is the agency responsible for establishing hunting, trapping, and fishing regulations in Montana. On December 5,2012, FWP issued a press release announcing that it would conduct a meeting via conference call on December 10, 2012, \u201cto take final action on three land matters and to hear an update on the state\u2019s wolf hunting season.\u201d The press release further explained that \u201c[t]he wolf hunting update <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>will include information on the 2012 season\u2019s harvest so far and additional information on the upcoming trapping season, which opens Dec. 15. The wolf hunting and trapping seasons will close Feb. 28, 2013.\u201d The agenda materials for the meeting similarly noted that FWP would be discussing: \u201cWolf Harvest Update \u2014 Informational\u201d; \u201cReview of 2012 Wolf Harvest\u201d; and \u201cAction Needed \u2014 Informational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b64 During the meeting, Commission Chairman Bob Ream moved to close wolf hunting and trapping in Hunting District 313 and part of Wolf Management Unit 390, which are located in Park County. These areas have been described as a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d around certain parts of the Yellowstone National Park border. Several commissioners expressed concern that the public had not been properly notified of the proposed closure; however, the motion carried by a vote of four to one. \u00b65 On January 2,2013, CBU filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, alleging that FWP violated its constitutional right of participation \u201cby failing to provide prior public notice and opportunity to participate in [FWP\u2019s] decision to close certain areas to wolf hunting at its Dec. 10,2012 meeting\u201d and \u201cby failing to hold a public hearing in an accessible facility in an area or community directly affected by an agency action that is of significant interest to the public.\u201d CBU further alleged that FWP violated its constitutional right to know \u201cby failing to make [FWP\u2019s] papers, data and maps related to the closure of the wolf season available to the public in advance of the Dec. 10 Commission meeting.\u201d CBU also requested that the court award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs. That same day, CBU filed an Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction and Brief in Support, asking the court to set aside FWP\u2019s decision and reinstitute wolf hunting and trapping in the closed areas of Park County. The District Court, Hon. Wm. Neis Swandal presiding, ruled that Plaintiffs had established the likelihood of success on their claims that FWP acted in violation of Montana law and that delay would cause them immediate and irreparable injury. The court issued \u00e1 TRO prohibiting FWP from enforcing its decision and requiring it to reopen wolf hunting and trapping in the closed areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b66 On J anuary 14,2013, the court, Hon. Brenda R. Gilbert presiding, held a show cause hearing to determine whether to grant CBU\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction. The court heard the following testimony from Commissioner Dan Vermillion in regard to whether the public received notice of the potential closure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">I think it\u2019s fair to say that it wasn\u2019t on the agenda, and there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>question that people, if they looked at that agenda, wouldn\u2019t know, unless they understood the Commission\u2019s duties and the Commission\u2019s obligations and authority under the law, could \u2014 if that wasn\u2019t part of the general public\u2019s understanding of the Commission\u2019s rolp, then the[y] wouldn\u2019t know that that was on the agenda.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Additionally, the court accepted affidavits and declarations from members of the public expressing frustration they had not been informed of the potential closure and had not been able to provide comment before a closure decision was made. On January 18,2013, the court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting FWP from further enforcing its decision and from making any additional changes to wildlife seasons without first complying with Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b67 Following the issuance of the prehminary injunction, the Legislature enacted House Bill 73, effective February 13,2013, which prohibited FWP from implementing wolf hunting and trapping closures in areas immediately adjacent to national parks prior to reaching an established harvest quota. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, 2013, ch. 13, \u00a7 1, presently codified at \u00a7 87-1-304, MCA. Although Commissioner Vermillion had previously stated that FWP would likely hold another conference call to \u201callow people time to weigh in\u201d on the closure issue in order to \u201cshort circuit\u201d the litigation, FWP ultimately declined to address the matter further and allowed the wolf season to expire on its own on February 28, 2013. Accordingly, on July 29, 2013, the court, Hon. Jon A. Oldenburg presiding, granted FWP\u2019s motion to dismiss CBU\u2019s claims as moot based on the fact that FWP had voluntarily allowed the wolf season to expire and the Legislature had acted to ban these types of closures in the fixture. The court declined to address the parties\u2019 Cross Motions for Summary Judgment. The court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees and court costs to CBU in the amount of $14,728.90 after determining that it had prevailed on its constitutional claims by obtaining the prehminary injunction. FWP appeals this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b68 A district court\u2019s detennination that legal authority exists to award attorney's fees is a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2009 MT 426, \u00b6 42,354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230 (citations omitted). If such authority exists, we review a district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Hughes v. Ahlgren, </em>2011 MT 189, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 319, 258 P.3d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err hy awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to CBU for prevailing on its constitutional </em>claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b610 The rights to know and participate are set forth in the Declaration of Rights of the Montana Constitution. Article II, Section 8 of the Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">The public has the right to expect governmental agencies to afford such reasonable opportunity for citizen participation in the operation of the agencies prior to the final decision as may be provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Article II, Section 9 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Accordingly, agencies must provide interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, and arguments prior to making final decisions, <em>Schoof v. Neshit, </em>2014 MT 6, \u00b6 21, 373 Mont. 226, 316 P.3d 831 (citing \u00a7 2-3-111(1), MCA), and develop procedures permitting and encouraging public participation in such decisions, <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing \u00a7 2-3-103(l)(a), MCA). Decisions made in violation of these constitutional and statutory provisions may be set aside or voided by a district court. Sections 2-3-114 and 2-3-213, MCA. Further, \u201c[a] plaintiff who <em>prevails </em>in an action brought in district court to enforce the plaintiff\u2019s rights under Article II, section 9, of the Montana constitution may be awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees.\u201d Section 2-3-221, MCA (emphasis added). A district court\u2019s determination to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, is discretionary. <em>Pengra v. State, </em>2000 MT 291, \u00b6 24, 302 Mont. 276,14 P.3d 499 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">\u00b611 The District Court determined that CBU was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs because CBU \u201cprevailed \u2014 if not specifically, in substance,\u201d on its claims. The court reasoned that \u201c[b]y obeying the Preliminary Injunction, by not challenging the Injunction, and by allowing the wolf season to run its course, [FWP] provided [CBU] with the fundamental relief [it] sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">\u00b612 FWP argues that CBU cannot \u201cbe described as having prevailed\u201d because \u201csuccess at the preliminary injunction stage of a case is not a determination of the merits of the complaint for attorneys\u2019 fees purposes,\u201d citing <em>Dreyer v. Bd. of Trs., </em>193 Mont. 95, 100-01, 630 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>226, 229 (1981). FWP contends that a conclusion to the contrary would, quoting <em>Dreyer, </em>\u201cviolate\u00fc the most fundamental right of due process \u2014 the right to appear and be heard on the merits of [an adversary\u2019s] complaint.\u201d <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont, at 101, 630 P.2d at 229. \u00b613 CBU responds that it was the prevailing party despite the fact that the District Court did not reach a final decision on the merits, citing <em>Havre Daily </em>News, <em>LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 44, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864 \u2014 on which the District Court relied. CBU notes that in that case, we stated that the defendant\u2019s actions in mooting the lawsuit \u201cprovided the Newspaper with the very relief it sought to procure through litigation.\u201d <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 44. CBU argues that, similarly, FWP\u2019s decision to leave the preliminary injunction in place and let the wolf season expire on its own \u201cprovided CBU, in part, [with] the relief they sought to secure through filing this litigation.\u201d CBU reasons that, were it not for its efforts in obtaining a TRO and preliminary injunction, FWP \u201cwould have kept hunting closed in parts of Park County for the remainder of the 2012-2013 wolf hunting and trapping season.\u201d Therefore, CBU argues that it \u201cprevailed\u201d on its constitutional claims and is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">\u00b614  As a general rule, a party is \u201cnot entitled to a judgment for attorney fees without a final determination of the underlying controversy in [its] favor.\u201d <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont, at 99, 630 P.2d at 228; <em>Avanta Fed. Credit Union v. Shupak, </em>2009 MT 458, \u00b6 49, 354 Mont. 372, 223 P.3d 863 (The \u201c \u2018prevailing party is the one who has an affirmative judgment rendered in his favor at the conclusion of the entire case.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted). In <em>Dreyer, </em>members of the Mid-Rivers Telephone Co-op sought an injunction against the Board of Trustees of the Co-op to prevent them from holding a special meeting and election. The district court granted a temporary restraining order, and, after a hearing, issued an injunction pendente lite prohibiting the Board from proceeding until a hearing on the merits of the litigation could be conducted. <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont, at 96, 630 P.2d at 227. Nothing further occurred until the plaintiff members sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees, which the court granted. <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont, at 96-97, 630 P.2d at 227. The court also determined that the underlying lawsuit had been mooted by the passage of time. <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont, at 97, 630 P.2d at 227. This Court determined that the district court erred in awarding attorney's fees prior to reaching a final determination on the merits. We explained that the purpose of the court\u2019s injunction was \u201csimply to preserve the status quo pending trial of the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 complaint,\u201d and, therefore, the plaintiffs had not yet prevailed. <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont, at 99-100,630 P.2d at 228-29. We further determined that the case was not moot and remanded it to the district court to \u201cdetermine the ultimate rights of the parties,\u201d prior to taking up the question of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont, at 101, 630 P.2d at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b615 In <em>Havre Daily </em>News, plaintiff newspapers (collectively, the Newspaper) filed suit against the City of Havre and members of the Havre Police force (collectively, Havre) seeking to obtain several unredacted documents. <em>See Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 42. Eventually, Havre provided the Newspaper with the requested documents and moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted Havre\u2019s motion for summary judgment and awarded the Newspaper attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8. On appeal, we determined that although the Newspaper did not technically \u201cprevail,\u201d summary judgment in favor of Havre had been entered only because Havre had mooted the case by providing the requested documents. We explained that \u201c[ajbsent Havre\u2019s conduct, the case would not have become moot. In mooting the case, Havre provided the Newspaper with the very relief it sought to procure through litigation; thus, the Newspaper has prevailed in substance, albeit without court intervention.\u201d <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 44. Therefore, the Newspaper was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"ALj\">\u00b616  As CBU correctly argues, the truncated time frame between the challenged decision of December 10,2012, and the end of the wolf hunting season on February 28, 2013, \u201crendered it impossible for Plaintiffs to obtain a judgment on the merits prior to the end of the season.\u201d Given the short timeframe involved, the TRO and preliminary injunction were the only forms of relief that Plaintiffs could hope to receive. Like the plaintiffs in <em>Havre Daily News, </em>CBU successfully obtained \u201cthe very relief it sought to procure through litigation\u201d for the pertinent time period. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 44. The preliminary injunction barred FWP from implementing the early closure of the wolf hunting season, and produced the same result as a final judgment setting aside or voiding the decision under \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-114 or 2-3-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A-s\">\u00b617  The facts of this case are distinguishable from <em>Dreyer. </em>There, we concluded that the underlying controversy had not been mooted by the passage of time and should be remanded for a full trial on the merits. We explained that the \u201cfindings of facts, conclusions of law and judgment of the District Court awarding attorney fees was premature.\u201d <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont, at 101,630 P.2d at 229. In contrast, here, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>underlying controversy to litigate on the merits. The wolf hunting season has already expired and \u00a7 87-1-304(7), MCA, prevents FWP from making these types of closures in the future. The District Court\u2019s order awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs was not premature. CBU obtained the relief it sought to procure through litigation and must be considered a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">\u00b618 FWP argues that even if CBU is a prevailing party, CBU cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs for its Article II, Section 8 claims because \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, \u201conly allows specific recovery for Article II, section 9 claims \u2014 not for Article II, section 8 claims.\u201d CBU responds that its complaint alleged that FWP \u201cviolated its legal duties under Article II, Section 9 to protect the public\u2019s right to know of and to participate in final decisions of public importance.\u201d CBU asks us to review its complaint as a whole to ascertain the purpose of its suit, which it states was \u201cto hold FWP accountable for violations of both Montana\u2019s right to participate and right to know provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b619  Montana follows the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d that attorney\u2019s fees may not be awarded in a civil action absent a specific statutory or contractual provision. <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 88, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079. Section 2-3-221, MCA, authorizes a district court to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to a successful plaintiff seeking to enforce the right to know under Article II, Section 9. Sections 8 and 9 of Article II share a \u201cfundamental link\u201d and are \u201cinextricabl[y] associat[ed].\u201d <em>Bryan v. Yellowstone Cnty. Elem. Sch. Dist. No. 2, </em>2002 MT 264, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 312 Mont. 257, 60 P.3d 381. We have declined to \u201canalyze the two provisions in a vacuum, \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 from one another....\u201d <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>see Schoof, </em>\u00b6 22 fn.3. Given the close relationship between the right to know and right of participation, we conclude that the District Court did not err by awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to CBU under both provisions. CBU\u2019s complaint alleges multiple violations of these rights based on FWP\u2019s conduct during the December 10, 2012 phone meeting. Each count proffered by CBU arose out of this singular event and pertained to interrelated actions by FWP. Therefore, we decline to parse CBU\u2019s constitutional claims for purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b620 Lastly, FWP argues that the District Court\u2019s order on attorney's fees contains improper findings of fact that address the merits of CBU\u2019s claims and constitutes an advisory opinion in light of the conclusion that the case has been mooted. While we recognize that the court\u2019s order briefly discusses the merits of CBU\u2019s case, the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>findings were not determinative as to its analysis and play no part in our decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b238-6\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai1\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b622 I concur with the disposition of this appeal based on the Court\u2019s ruling that our holding in <em>Havre Daily News </em>authorizes the award of fees under the circumstances presented. In my view, however, <em>Dreyer </em>is of questionable validity on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees following issuance of a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b623 There has been considerable development in the law on \u201cprevailing part/\u2019 status for purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees since <em>Dreyer </em>was decided. The United States Supreme Court held in 1992 that a party prevails \u201cwhen actual relief on the merits of [the plaintiffs] claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\"Farrar <em>v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S. Ct. 566, 573 (1992). In reliance on <em>Farrar, </em>we have held that, where a plaintiff has preyailed bn her legal claims, she may be entitled to fees even if she recovers only nominal damages. <em>Griffith v. Butte Sch. Dist. No. </em>1, 2010 MT 246, \u00b6\u00b6 66-67, 358 Mont. 193, 244 P.3d 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u00b624 A plaintiff obtains relief \u201con the merits\u201d of the claim when there is a material alteration of the parties\u2019 legal relationship, accompanied by \u201cjudicial <em>imprimatur </em>on the change.\u201d <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 605, 121 S. Ct. 1835, 1840 (2001). The Ninth Circuit is among several federal circuits recognizing that a preliminary injunction will satisfy <em>Buckhannon\u2019s </em>\u201cjudicial <em>imprimatur\u201d </em>requirement \u201cif it is based on a \u25a0 finding that the plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Higher Taste, Inc. v. City of Tacoma, </em>717 F.3d 712, 716 (9th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\u00b625 A party is not considered to have prevailed if a prefiminary injunction \u201cis reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same case.\u201d <em>Sole v. Wyner, </em>551 U.S. 74, 83,127 S. Ct. 2188, 2195 (2007). In the absence of a final judgment in the case, however, such as when a settlement is reached or the case is rendered moot, \u201cthere may be circumstances in which a preliminary injunction results in sufficiently enduring change to warrant an award of fees[.]\u201d <em>Higher Taste, </em>717 F.3d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u00b626 Neither of the parties to this appeal has briefed these authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>or their application to this case, and the Court therefore properly refrains from analyzing them. Nonetheless, <em>Dreyer </em>should be revisited in an appropriate future case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
