We affirm, restating Yellow Cab\u2019s issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that the PSC\u2019s denial of a PCN certificate did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of Yellow Cab\u2019s property or violate equal </em>protection?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by affirming the denial of Yellow Cab\u2019s application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">\u00b64 <em>3. Did the District Court err by affirming the PSC\u2019s exclusion of Yellow Cab\u2019s Exhibit 2?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b65 In 2011, Legislature enacted Senate Bill 140 (SB 140), codified as \u00a7 69-12-328, MCA, which directed the PSC to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity (PCN certificate) to any carrier who, during the one-year period prior to January 1, 2011, had provided charter passenger service, utilized vehicles designed to carry more than 10 passengers, and had obtained a U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) number as provided in 49 CFR \u00a7 390.19. This statutory mechanism effectively \u201cgrandfathered\u201d qualifying carriers already operating a charter service, allowing them to continue conducting their business. A carrier not grandfathered under SB 140 was instead required to apply to the PSC and demonstrate that public convenience and necessity required authorization of the proposed service under governing statutes. Sections 69-12-321 et seq., MCA. \u00b66 Beginning in 2009, Yellow Cab had provided charter services as an unregulated business from its offices in Billings to locations statewide. To conduct this portion of its business, Yellow Cab purchased several passenger vehicles capable of transporting 10 to 26 passengers. The charter service generated approximately 25% of Yellow Cab\u2019s revenue. After SB 140 was enacted, Yellow Cab applied to the PSC for issuance of a PCN certificate as a grandfathered entity. However, because Yellow Cab had not been issued a DOT number during the year prior to January 1,2011, its application was denied by the PSC as failing to satisfy the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b67 Yellow Cab did not petition for judicial review of the PSC\u2019s denial of its application, but instead filed a second application for a PCN certificate as a Class B carrier pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 69-12-321 et seq., MCA. Other carriers protested the application, and the PSC conducted a public hearing on May 2, 2012, during which Yellow Cab offered witness testimony in support of its application. Five businesses engaged in passenger charter service appeared to oppose the application. On June 27, 2012, in a 3-2 vote, the PSC issued a Final Order denying the application, reasoning that Yellow Cab had failed to meet its burden of establishing public need for an additional statewide charter service carrier and that existing carriers were unable or unwilling to meet that need. Commissioner Travis Kavulla authored a concurring opinion, stating that public convenience and necessity regulation \u201chas the practical effect of conferring a veto power to the veiy persons who would face competition,\u201d and suggesting the law was unconstitutional as unrelated to a legitimate government interest. Yellow Cab filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Thirteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Judicial Court, challenging the PSC\u2019s denial and the constitutionality of the grandfather provisions of SB 140. The District Court affirmed the ruling of the PSC. Yellow Cab appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b68 This Court exercises plenary review over questions of constitutional law. <em>City of Billings v. Albert, </em>2009 MT 63, \u00b6 11, 349 Mont. 400, 203 P.3d 828. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional, and any person challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proving it unconstitutional. <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 11. When reviewing a district court\u2019s decision regarding the review of an agency action, the Montana Administrative Procedure Act governs this Court\u2019s review, and the scope of review is limited. <em>Citizens Awareness Network </em>v. <em>Mont. Bd. of Envtl. Rev., </em>2010 MT 10, \u00b6 13, 355 Mont. 60, 227 P.3d 583. The same standards used by the district court are applied when reviewing a district court order affirming or reversing an agency decision. <em>Ostergren v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2004 MT 30, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 405, 85 P.3d 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b69 In contested cases, district courts review administrative decisions to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the agency determined the law correctly, and a district court\u2019s decision is reviewed the same way. <em>Ray v. Mont. Tech of the Univ. of Mont., </em>2007 MT 21, \u00b6 24, 335 Mont. 367, 152 P.3d 122; <em>Cenex Pipeline LLC v. Fly Creek Angus, Inc., </em>1998 MT 334, \u00b6 22, 292 Mont. 300, 971 P.2d 781. If a finding is not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehended the effect of evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record convinces us a mistake has been made, a finding is deemed clearly erroneous. <em>Montanans v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 19, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759. This Court reviews the record to determine if an agency has acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully. <em>N. Fork Pres. Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t. of State Lands, </em>238 Mont. 451, 458-59, 778 P.2d 862, 867 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b610 Under \u00a7 2-4-612(2), MCA, agencies are bound by common law and statutory rules of evidence. This Court reviews evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Glacier Tennis Club at the Summit, LLC v. Treweek Constr. Co., </em>2004 MT 70, \u00b6 47, 320 Mont. 351, 87 P.3d 431. An abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is made arbitrarily and without employment of conscientious judgment so that it exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6 18, 327 Mont. 196, 113 P.3d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b611 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that the PSC\u2019s denial of a PCN certificate did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of </em>I <em>Yellow Cab\u2019s property or violate equal protection </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b612 Yellow Cab makes several arguments that challenge the PSC\u2019s denial of a PCN certificate on constitutional grounds, as it did in the lower court. Yellow Cab argues the PSC\u2019s application of \u00a7 69-12-328, MCA, the grandfather statute, violated due process protections by imposing a retroactive requirement that Yellow Cab could not satisfy and thus deprived it of the ability to continue providing its charter service. Yellow Cab also argues that the grandfather statute violated equal protection by distinguishing between those businesses in possession of a DOT number and those without.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b613 Noting that these arguments were related to the PSC\u2019s initial denial of a PCN certificate, the District Court concluded that they were procedurally barred. Yellow Cab did not seek judicial review of the PSC\u2019s initial denial, appealing only after the PSC had conducted the PCN proceeding and denied Yellow Cab\u2019s second application. Because Yellow Cab had failed to file a petition for review within 30 days following the initial denial under the grandfather statute, the District Court concluded the claims were untimely. Conceding that the timelines for appeal from an agency decision were not jurisdictional in nature, citing <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2012 MT 143, 365 Mont. 304, 281 P.3d 203, the District Court nonetheless determined that Yellow Cab had not demonstrated a \u201clegally sufficient reason\u201d for disregarding these \u201cfirm deadlines.\u201d <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 21. Noting that Yellow Cab had raised a regulatory takings claim and \u201can interesting substantive due process claim\u201d regarding SB 140, the court offered that \u201ca separate action could resolve Yellow Cab\u2019s remaining claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b614  The District Court properly resolved the claims in this proceeding. Section 2-4-702(l)(a), MCA, provides that a dissatisfied party may request judicial review of an agency\u2019s final decision after exhausting all administrative remedies if the request is made within thirty days of the decision. Section 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA. Yellow Cab did not petition for judicial review of the PSC\u2019s initial denial under the grandfather statute, instead raising those issues after the PSC\u2019s second denial under \u00a7\u00a7 69-12-321 et seq., MCA. We agree with the District Court that Yellow Cab\u2019s claims are not properly subject to review in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b615  Yellow Cab also asserts that the ultimate denial of a PCN certificate, following the second application, also resulted in a taking. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The District Court reasoned that the PSC\u2019s denial did not result in a taking because, without a PCN certificate, Yellow Cab never had a compensable property interest to be taken. On appeal, Yellow Cab reframes its position and states it is not claiming a property interest in the PCN certificate, but in the revenue generated from its charter service prior to the enactment of the grandfather statute. However, this argument is again primarily related to the original denial of its application. SB 140 instituted regulation of charter services. Any compensable interest Yellow Cab may have had in its pre-existing business was impacted by the original denial under the grandfather statute, by which Yellow Cab lost the ability to operate, rather than the second denial at issue here. Section 69-12-328, MCA, the grandfather provision, required the PSC to grant a PCN certificate to applicants who satisfied the statutory requirements. In contrast, \u00a7\u00a7 69-12-321 et seq., MCA, provide that the PSC has discretion in determining whether to grant a PCN certificate. Thus, Yellow Cab\u2019s claims are improperly raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\n<em>\u00b616 2. Did the District Court err by affirming the denial of Yellow Cab\u2019s application for a PCN?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b617 A district court reviews an agency decision under the standards set forth in the Montana Administrative Rules of Procedure Act, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">(2) The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">(a) the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">(i) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">(ii) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">(iii) made upon unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-12\">(iv) affected, by other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-13\">(y) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-14\">(vi) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-15\">(b) findings of fact, upon issues essential to the decision, were not made although requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">Section 2-4-704, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-17\">\u00b618 Section 69-12-312(1), MCA, provides that a Class B motor carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>may not transport persons on a public highway without receiving a PCN certificate. Section 69-12-323(2)(a), MCA, authorizes issuance of a PCN certificate if the PSC finds that public convenience and necessity require it. In making that decision, the PSC is to conduct a hearing and give consideration to the transportation services being furnished by other existing businesses. Finally, the PSC must consider the effect the proposed transportation service may have upon other forms of transportation service which have been deemed essential and indispensable to the communities likely to be affected by the new service. Section 69-12-323(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b6 19 Because Yellow Cab applied for a PCN certificate authorizing it to provide charter services across the entirety of Montana, it carri\u00e9d the burden of demonstrating there was a statewide need for its services. At the hearing, Yellow Cab owner Robert Young (Young) and four other witnesses offered testimony in support of the application. Young\u2019s testimony was concerned less about unmet need than about speculative growth in economic activity resulting from Bakken oil operations. Witness Rodney Gustafson had used Yellow Cab only once and did not testify about other carriers he had used or attempted to use, or why alternative carriers could not meet his needs. David Gonzales testified that his decision to use Yellow Cab\u2019s services was based on reasons unrelated to the ability of alternative carriers to meet his transportation needs. Robert Young\u2019s son, Dan, testified he had never contacted alternative passenger charter services to see if they could fulfill his needs. Jessica Guillaume had only used Yellow Cab once and had not sought service from other earners.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b620 The protestants offered the testimony of Rodney Wilson, owner of three Billings-based transportation companies operating under a current PCN certificate. Wilson testified that his company has a 24-hour dispatcher handling multiple phones and an answering machine to ensure service to those callers unable to reach the dispatcher when lines are busy. Wilson also testified his company would be able to accommodate the trips Yellow Cab indicated it had been providing since 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b621  In light of the testimony provided by the owner of the business and four prior customers \u2014 some Of them only one-time customers \u2014 Yellow Cab has failed to establish that the PSC erred by concluding there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a statewide need for its charter services. When Young\u2019s testimony is considered alongside Ronald Wilson\u2019s attestation that his company could accommodate the needs of Yellow Cab\u2019s customers, it is clear the PSC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>determination that Yellow Cab had failed to meet the burden needed to secure a PCN certificate was supported by substantial evidence and not erroneous in any way. The District Court properly affirmed the PSC\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b622 <em>3. Did the District Court err by affirming the PSC\u2019s exclusion of Yellow Cab\u2019s Exhibit 2?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b623 Under M. R. Evid. 801(c), hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. M. R. Evid. 802 further provides that hearsay is generally not admissible unless covered by a hearsay exception. At the outset of the hearing, Young attempted to demonstrate the need for his charter service by referencing the oil boom in Eastern Montana and its potential effects on transportation and tourism. To support Young\u2019s testimony, Yellow Cab sought to introduce Exhibit 2, a loose-leaf binder containing about 200 pages of documents regarding oil field information, newspaper articles, published studies, and tourism data. The protestants objected to the admission of Exhibit 2, arguing the information included inside lacked foundation and should be excluded as hearsay. The PSC took the objection under advisement and ultimately excluded Exhibit 2. \u00b624 The District Court affirmed the PSC ruling excluding the proffered material based on Yellow Cab\u2019s failure to offer specific hearsay exceptions that would permit introduction of all the materials within Exhibit 2. The court stated it was unlikely a single hearsay exception would apply to all the documents contained in Exhibit 2 and it would be impossible to conclude that the decision was incorrect without specific hearsay arguments. Yellow Cab now argues the documents, reports, and compilations referenced in Exhibit 2 were admissible under the M. R. Evid. 803(8) public records hearsay exception, and cites M. R. Evid. 902 for self-authenticating documents as the mechanism by which the appendix may have satisfied evidentiary foundation rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b625  This Court reviews evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. The PSC denied admission of the documents after Yellow Cab failed to offer a proper foundation and sufficiently describe the evidentiary rules under which the material was admissible. Appendix 2 was a voluminous exhibit, filled with a wide array of topics from many sources. The PSC did not abuse its discretion in denying its admission. \u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
