The Justice Court held a trial on November 8,2012, and the jury found Lamarr guilty of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u00b65 The conviction arose out of an altercation occurring between Lamarr and the alleged victim, Wesley Hill, at the Garden Bar in Bigfork, Montana, on May 26, 2012. On that night, Hill was drinking at the Garden Bar with friends, including Axel Huckins and Heidi Jelly. Huckins and Jelly recently had rekindled their prior relationship, following the end of Jelly\u2019s relationship with Lamarr. At the time, Jelly was pregnant with Lamarr\u2019s child. Lamarr allegedly had been threatening Huckins via telephone calls and text messages because of Huckins\u2019s relationship with Jelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">\u00b66 At around 9:00 p.m., Huckins went outside of the bar to meet a friend. Lamarr approached Huckins in the parking lot and they argued back and forth. Huckins, who is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair, later testified that Lamarr got down on one knee, said \u201clet me get down on your level,\u201d and hit Huckins across the face. Huckins testified that others came to break up the fight and several police officers arrived. Huckins declined to pursue charges against Lamarr because he did not want to deal with Lamarr any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">\u00b67 Huckins then went back into the bar, sat down with his group of friends, and began telling Hill what occurred in the parking lot. Within minutes, Lamarr approached and, concerned that Jelly was drinking alcohol, asked her what she was drinking. In response, she threw her glass of water in his face. When Huckins confirmed that Lamarr was the assailant from the parking lot, Hill stood up, placed his hands on Lamarr\u2019s arms, and told him that they did not \u201cneed this tonight\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>asked him to \u201cplease leave.\u201d Lamarr responded, \u201cplease don\u2019t do this,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d and then head-butted Hill twice in quick succession. Huckins and other bar patrons broke up the fight. Hill suffered a broken nose and a split lip requiring six stitches. Within the next few days, Hill reported the incident to the Flathead County Sheriffs Office and Lamarr was charged with assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b68 Prior to trial, the State filed a motion in limine requesting that the court allow Huckins to testify regarding Lamarr\u2019s threats and the altercation that occurred between Huckins and Lamarr prior to the charged assault. The court heard arguments on the State\u2019s motion the morning of trial and ruled, over Lamarr\u2019s objection, that the evidence was admissible. During Huckins\u2019s testimony, Lamarr renewed his objection to the information, stating that the probative value of Huckins\u2019s testimony regarding the prior threats and altercation was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The court again ruled that the evidence was not too attenuated because the assault of Huckins was the reason Hill got involved with Lamarr. The court gave a curative instruction, reminding the jury that Lamarr could not be found guilty for anything other than the charged offense. Following the guilty verdict, Lamarr appealed to the District Court, which affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b69 \u201cWe review cases that originate in justice court and are appealed to district court \u2018as if the appeal originally had been filed in this Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Gai, </em>2012 MT 235, \u00b6 11, 366 Mont. 408, 288 P.3d 164 (quoting <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646). Accordingly, we \u201cundertake an independent examination of the record apart from the district court\u2019s decision ....\u201d <em>Gai, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b610 A trial court has broad discretion when determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence and we review its rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. To the extent that the district court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, our review is de novo. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the Flathead County Justice Court erred by allowing testimony regarding Lamarr\u2019s alleged threats and conduct prior to the charged assault.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">\u00b612 M. R. Evid. 404(b) prohibits evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>acts\u201d used to \u201cprove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Prior acts of the accused may be admissible, however, for other purposes. One such purpose is provided in Montana\u2019s so-called \u201ctransaction rule.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA. That section provides: \u201cWhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b613 We have held that \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, allows evidence of acts that are \u201cinextricably linked\u201d with and \u201cexplanatory of\u2019 the charged allegations. <em>State v. Guill, </em>2010 MT 69, \u00b6 25, 355 Mont. 490, 228 P.3d 1152. The rationale for admitting evidence of the transaction is twofold. First, \u201cit is theoretically difficult to subdivide a course of conduct into discrete criminal acts and \u2018other\u2019 conduct,\u201d and second, \u201cit is difficult for a witness to testify coherently to an event if the witness is only permitted to reference the minutely defined elements of the crime.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 27 (citing Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence </em>vol. 22, \u00a7 5239, 446 (West 1988\u00bb.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b614 We have been careful to limit, the transaction rule\u2019s application, noting that it should not be used to avoid Rule 404(b)\u2019s prohibition against character evidence. <em>State v. Stout, </em>2010 MT 137, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 356 Mont. 468, 237 P.3d 37. Further, we have held that evidence offered under the transaction rule is subject to fact-specific balancing under M. R. Evid. 403, which allows the court to exclude relevant material when its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value. <em>State v. Hardman, </em>2012 MT 70, \u00b6 16, 364 Mont. 361,276 P.3d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"A6R\">\u00b615 Lamarr first asserts that the Justice Court did not use the correct \u201cinextricably linked\u201d standard to determine whether the testimony could be presented under the transaction rule and that we should therefore review its application of the rule de novo. During the pre-trial hearing, the court ruled that Huckins\u2019s testimony would be allowed because \u201cit was part of the same transaction\u201d and \u201cHuckins was involved all the way.\u201d Although the court did not use the words \u201cinextricably linked,\u201d it is clear from the court\u2019s comments that it utilized the correct standard. The Justice Court analyzed whether evidence of the altercation between Huckins and Lamarr was necessary to explain the altercation between Lamarr and Hill or whether it was \u201ctoo attenuated.\u201d We conclude that the Justice Court correctly interpreted the legal standard imposed by the transaction rule and decline to review its application de novo. Admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b616 Lamarr asserts that the threats and assault against Huckins were not inextricably linked to the charged offense. He argues that there was a \u201ctemporal break in the exchanges between Huckins and Lamarr, and Hill and Lamarr,\u201d and that the alleged text-message threats were \u201cnot made on the day of the alleged offense or even the day prior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">\u00b617 We have not limited the use of the transaction rule to evidence of acts occurring immediately prior to the crime. <em>Stout, </em>\u00b6 41. \u201c[Wjhile the timing of the events is relevant to admissibility under the transaction rule, it is not determinative.\u201d <em>State v. Mackrill, </em>2008 MT 297, \u00b6 43, 345 Mont. 469, 191 P.3d 451. Rather, admissibility is \u201cpredicated on the jury\u2019s right to hear what happened prior to the alleged offense, so that it may evaluate the evidence in the context in which the alleged criminal act occurred.\u201d <em>State v. Berosik, </em>2009 MT 260, \u00b6 45, 352 Mont. 16, 214 P.3d 776. Use of the transaction rule \u201cis most legitimateD... to admit uncharged misconduct when such conduct arises from a continuing series of events.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 45. In <em>Mackrill, </em>we upheld the District Court\u2019s decision to allow evidence of defendant\u2019s unruly behavior at various bars throughout the night of the charged offense. <em>Mackrill, </em>\u00b6 43. We determined that the events occurring at other bars the same night that the defendant assaulted the victim at a bar were \u201csufficiently contemporaneous with the assault itself.\u201d <em>Mackrill, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"A_I\">\u00b618  Here, Huckins\u2019s testimony about the threats and the parking-lot assault was linked to and explanatory of Lamarr\u2019s assault of Hill. Hill\u2019s decision to get involved and ask Lamarr, a man he had never met, to leave the bar was based on the information related to him by Huckins. That information was necessary for the jury to have context for the exchange between Lamarr and Hill. Both Huckins and Hill testified as to how Huckins\u2019s prior interaction with Lamarr influenced the way they handled the situation when Lamarr approached their table in the bar. The situation developed as a \u201ccontinuing series of events\u201d and was \u201csufficiently contemporaneous.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 45; <em>Mackrill, </em>\u00b6 43. The Justice Court determined that Hill would not have gotten involved at all but for the prior exchanges between Huckins and Lamarr. We conclude that Lamarr has not demonstrated an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b619 Lamarr also argues that the cotut failed to properly address his Rule 403 objection that Huckins\u2019s testimony would be substantially more prejudicial than probative. \u201cRule 403 does not require the exclusion of relevant information simply because it is prejudicial. In a criminal prosecution most of the evidence offered by the prosecution is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, \u00b6 68, 367 Mont. 503, 291 P.3d 1187. A court has discretion to exclude the evidence only when it poses a danger of unfair prejudice that substantially outweighs its probative value. M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b620  Here, the court determined that because \u201cHuckins was involved all the way,\u201d his testimony regarding the events was highly probative to the charged offense. Further, the court was not convinced that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial, stating that all evidence is prejudicial in one way or another. Lamarr argues that the State\u2019s proferred reason for probative value \u2014 to establish Lamarr\u2019s mental state \u2014 was inapplicable because Lamarr-asserted a justifiable-use-of-force defense, admitting that he acted with purpose or knowledge. Lamarr ignores that a justifiable-use-of-force defense generally is not available to a defendant \u201cwho purposely or knowingly provokes the use of force against the person.\u201d Section 45-3-105(2), MCA. Lamarr\u2019s previous encounters with Huckins assisted the jury in determining who was the aggressor in the situation and whether Lamarr provoked the use of force. Although Lamarr makes conclusory statements asserting prejudice, he has failed to point to any unfair prejudice resulting from Huckins\u2019s testimony, much less any that would substantially outweigh the testimony\u2019s probative value. We conclude that the Justice Court did not err in refusing Lamarr\u2019s request to exclude the evidence under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b621 Lamarr finally argues that Huckins\u2019s testimony regarding the prior threats was inadmissible because the State did not provide proper notice during discovery. At trial, Huckins testified that Lamarr had sent him death threats in the weeks leading up to the parking-lot assault. Lamarr argues that Huckins\u2019s written statement was not enough to put Lamarr on notice that evidence regarding death threats would be introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b622 Under the statutes governing discovery, the State must disclose to the defendant, upon request, the witnesses it may call and the evidence it may introduce. Section 46-15-322, MCA. Nevertheless, the State \u201cmay not be required to prepare or disclose summaries of witnesses\u2019 testimony.\u201d Section 46-15-322(5), MCA. Here, the State disclosed that Huckins would be called as a witness and submitted his written statement to the defense. In relevant part, this statement provided that \u201c[Lamarr] began to threaten me and slap me as hard as he could which he had said before via text he was planning to do.\u201d \u00b623 [3] Huckins included in his written statement that Lamarr had threatened him. Lamarr had the opportunity to interview Huckins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>prior to trial to obtain additional information regarding the text messages. Lamarr also had the opportunity to cross-examine Huckins regarding inconsistencies between his written statement and his trial testimony. Lamarr has not demonstrated that the State was aware that Huckins would describe the threats as \u201cdeath threats\u201d in his testimony or that it wrongfully withheld information regarding the nature of the threats. We conclude that the Justice Court properly determined that the State met its discovery obligation and did not abuse its discretion by allowing the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
