We restate the issues on appeal as follows: \u00b62 <em>1. Whether the State presented sufficient evidence to convict the Robertsons of trespass and theft.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u00b63 <em>2. Whether the Court should review issues that the Robertsons did not raise with the District Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u00b64 <em>3. Whether the written judgments conform to the oral pronouncement of sentences.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">\u00b65 We affirm the theft convictions, vacate the trespass convictions, and remand the written judgments to the District Court for amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">\u00b66 The Robertsons were members of the Basin Volunteer Fire Department (BVFD) for most of 2011. Issues arose within the BVFD and, on December 28, 2011, the BVFD Board of Trustees (Board) mailed a letter to the Robertsons stating, \u201c[Y]our membership with the [BVFD] is being placed in suspension status.\u201d The letter explained that the suspension was \u201cput in place by the [Board] of the BVFD as per the by-laws adopted July 2011.\u201d The letter also informed the Robertsons that \u201c[d]uring suspension status you are not allowed to enter any property owned by the BVFD ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">\u00b67 By January 14,2012, the Robertsons had received and read their suspension letters. While driving that day, they encountered a disabled vehicle pulled off alongside the interstate. The Robertsons offered to help the driver. Carri called the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office and told the dispatcher that they were going to deploy cones and flares. The Robertsons then went to the BVFD fire hall, using their member access codes to enter. While there, the Robertsons took two fire jackets from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the unassigned inventory, as well as two cones and some flares. Carri called BVFD President Dema Rhodes and left a message advising her that they were taking cones and flares from the fire hall to help a disabled vehicle. Carri did not mention the jackets.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b68 The Robertsons returned to the disabled vehicle and placed the cones and flares on the highway. A passing truck ran over and destroyed one of the cones. After they finished their assistance, the Robertsons went back to the fire hall. They returned the intact cone but not the jackets, and took a handful of additional flares. Carri called Rhodes again, leaving a message that the Robertsons returned the cones.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b69 Later, on the fire hall\u2019s surveillance video, Rhodes saw that the Robertsons had taken and not returned the two jackets. Eventually, a warrant was issued for the Robertsons\u2019 arrest, after which the Robertsons turned themselves in and returned the jackets.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b610 The State charged the Robertsons with trespass for entiy into the fire hall and with theft of the cones, flares, and jackets. Trial began on April 3, 2013, before a jury in the Fifth Judicial District Court. The Robertsons were jointly represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b611 After voir dire but befor\u00e9 the venire panel returned to the courtroom for final selection, the judge held a conference with the parties in the courtroom. Defense counsel informed the judge that there were prosecution witnesses in the courtroom\u2019s foyer speaking to prospective jurors. The judge then went out into the hallway to investigate. Upon returning, the judge reported that the bailiff was keeping the potential jurors separate from the witnesses, and that all witnesses and other persons in the hallway denied speaking with any members of the jury pool. Defense counsel did not object or request the opportunity to question either the prospective jurors or the people in the hallway about any contact between them, and the proceedings continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u00b612 The trial lasted two days. At the end of the second day, the parties submitted the case to the jury for deliberations. The jury deliberated for approximately fifty minutes before the judge reconvened the parties and the jury. The jury reported that it had more deliberating to do before it could reach a verdict. The judge disclosed that he had a long drive ahead of him that evening and that he would not be able to return to oversee the rest of the deliberations until April 17. The judge and parties then spoke off the record. Going back on the record, the judge said that the court would reconvene in nearly three weeks, on April 24, for the jury to continue deliberating. Neither party objected to this plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u00b613 On April 24,2013, the court reconvened for further deliberations. The jury deliberated for approximately two hours before returning guilty verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b614 At the sentencing hearing, the court asked whether the parties had any objections to the restitution affidavit for the cost of the trial. The restitution affidavit disclosed that three members of the jury pool who did not serve on the jury had addresses outside Jefferson County. Neither party raised any concerns about the out-of-county addresses. The court sentenced each of the Robertsons to consecutive six-month jail terms and $500 fines on each count, all suspended. The court also imposed restitution to the BVFD plus all costs of the jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b615 The Robertsons separately appeal their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b616 We generally decline to consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Torres, </em>2013 MT 101, \u00b6 37, 369 Mont. 516, 299 P.3d 804. Regardless of whether it was raised below, however, we review de novo a claim of insufficiency of the evidence. <em>State v. Criswell, </em>2013 MT 177, \u00b6 13, 370 Mont. 511, 305 P.3d 760. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and ask whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Criswell, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">\u00b617 <em>1. Whether the State presented sufficient evidence to convict the Robertsons of trespass and theft.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">\u00b618 The Robertsons each were convicted of trespass and theft, and each now appeals those convictions on the ground of insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">\n<em>A. Trespass</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">\u00b619 Trespass to property has three elements: (1) a \u201cperson knowingly,\u201d (2) \u201centers or remains unlawfully in,\u201d (3) an \u201coccupied structure\u201d or \u201cthe premises of another.\u201d Section 45-6-203(l)(a)-(b), MCA. \u201cA person enters or remains unlawfully ... when the person is not licensed, invited, or otherwise privileged ... .\u201d Section 45-6-201(1), MCA. Privilege to enter \u201cmay be revoked at any time by personal communication of notice by the landowner or other authorized person ....\u201d Section 45-6-201(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">\u00b620 The Robertsons both argue that, as BVFD members, they were privileged to enter the fire hall, which means their entry was lawful under \u00a7 45-6-201(1), MCA. They claim that no \u201cauthorized person\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>revoked that privilege before they entered the fire hall on January 14, 2012. Section 45-6-201(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b621 The State does not dispute that BVFD members ordinarily are privileged to enter the fire hall. The State argues that the Board was authorized to revoke the Robertsons\u2019 privilege to enter the fire hall, and did revoke that privilege through the suspension letter. The suspension letter specifically informed the Robertsons that they were \u201cnot allowed to enter any property owned by the BVFD ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b622 Montana permits fire district boards of trustees to \u201cgovern[ ] and manage[ ]\u201d fire districts. Section 7-33-2104, MCA. Trustees accordingly have powers to \u201cprepare and adopt suitable by-laws\u201d and \u201cprovide adequate and standard firefighting and emergency response apparatus, equipment, personnel, housing, and facilities.\u201d Section 7-33-2105, MCA. The Board\u2019s suspension letter, admitted into evidence, informed the Robertsons their \u201csuspension [was] put in place by the Board of Trustees of the BVFD as per the by-laws adopted July 2011.\u201d The State submitted into evidence the July 2011 BVFD \u201cConstitution and ByLaws.\u201d The document provides, \u201cAny adult citizen, who resides in Basin or who owns real property in the fire district or who lives in an area adjacent to the [BVFD], can be a member of the [BVFD].\u201d The document also provides, \u201cAny member may be removed from the [BVFD], for cause, by two-thirds vote of the active membership. Such cause for removal will be put in writing by the Chief or the Trustees and kept on record with the Fire Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b623 BVFD Trustee Greg Hughes testified that the by-laws authorized the Board to suspend members. He located the authorization in the bylaws\u2019 reference to \u201csuch calls [sic] for removal\u201d and testified \u201cI would consider the word \u2018calls [sic] for removal\u2019 to be part of a suspension.\u201d He admitted, however, that no \u201cdirect words\u201d provided the Board authority to suspend BVFD members. BVFD President Rhodes, meanwhile, testified that the Board lacks the power to remove a person from the ranks of BVFD members or to exclude members from the fire hall. \u00b624 Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the State failed to offer sufficient evidence that the Robertsons unlawfully entered the fire hall. The Robertsons were members of the BVFD. Like other members, they had the code needed to enter the fire hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b625 There is insufficient evidence to establish that the Board was authorized to revoke the Robertsons of their privilege to enter the fire hall. At trial, the State did not dispute that the Board derives its authority from the July 2011 by-laws. The BVFD by-laws do not authorize the Board to suspend BVFD members. In fact, the by-laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>are altogether silent on the suspension of BVFD members. The by-laws specify that the removal of a BVFD member requires <em>\u201ca </em>two-thirds vote of active membership.\u201d But the Robertsons\u2019 suspension was not executed through a \u201ctwo-thirds vote of active membership.\u201d As the suspension letter makes clear, the suspension was \u201cput in place by the Board of Trustees.\u201d Although the by-laws require the Trustees or the Chief to record \u201csuch cause for removal\u201d after it has occurred by a vote of BVFD members, that clause does not grant the Board the power to suspend members before a removal vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b626 The State argues that it is irrelevant whether the Board has the power to suspend because the Board also informed the Robertsons in the letter that they were \u201cnot allowed to enter any property owned by the BVFD....\u201d This argument suffers two flaws. First, the suspension letter predicated the removal of the Robertsons\u2019 privilege to enter BVFD property on the Robertsons\u2019 suspension. The entire pertinent portion of the letter reads, <em>\u201cDuring suspension status </em>you are not allowed to enter any property owned by the BVFD [emphasis supplied] ... .\u201d If the Board lacked the power to suspend, then there was no \u201csuspension status\u201d during which the Robertsons were not allowed to enter BVFD property.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b627 [1] Second, the State points to nothing in the by-laws that provides the Board the authority to ban a BVFD member from entering the fire hall. Without a suspension clause, there is nothing in the bylaws to support the Board\u2019s claimed authority to revoke a BVFD member\u2019s permission to enter BVFD property.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b628 As a matter of law, in the absence of authority, the Board could not revoke the Robertsons\u2019 normal privileges to enter the fire hall. We thus vacate the Robertsons\u2019 respective trespass convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\n<em>B. Theft</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b629 A person commits theft when he or she purposely or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of another with the purpose of depriving the other person of that property. Section 45-6-301(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u00b630  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, we conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence to sustain the Robertsons\u2019 respective theft convictions. Unlike entering the fire hall, which BVFD members were privileged to do, the State\u2019s evidence suggested that individual firefighters were not privileged to take jackets from the inventory without special permission. Rhodes testified that jackets in the inventory were for new firefighters without jackets of their own. The Robertsons had their own jackets in their assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>lockers. Moreover, the State presented sufficient evidence that the Robertsons possessed the requisite state of mind for a theft offense. Unlike other items they took, the Robertsons did not report taking the jackets. And unlike a cone they took, the Robertsons did not return the jackets until a sheriff\u2019s deputy confronted them. A reasonable juror could conclude from these facts that the Robertsons exercised unauthorized control over the jackets with the intent to purposely deprive the BVFD of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b631 <em>2. Whether the Court should review the issues that the Robertsons did not raise with the District Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b632 We generally will not review the merits of an issue that an appellant fails to preserve through a timely objection at trial. <em>Torres, </em>\u00b6 37; <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA. Although we retain our common law power to review unpreserved issues under the plain error doctrine, we exercise that power only when an appellant convinces us that (1) \u201cthe claimed error implicates a fundamental right,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe claimed error would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>\u00b6 37,</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b633 On appeal, Joseph raises whether it was proper for the District Court to adjourn jury deliberations for three weeks and whether the procedures used to select his jury pool complied with statutory requirements. Cam raises whether her right to presence was violated by the District Court judge speaking to witnesses outside her presence. On all these issues, we find the Robertsons\u2019 failures to object fatal to their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\n<em>A. Adjournment in Jury Deliberations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHW\">\u00b634 Joseph challenges the propriety of the adjournment in jury deliberations. The Robertsons failed to object either before or immediately following the adjournment. After the jury reconvened, deliberated, and delivered its verdicts, however, the Robertsons moved for a \u201cmistrial\u201d based on the adjournment \u2014 a motion that the District Court summarily denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00b635 A motion for a new trial does not serve as a replacement for a timely objection. <em>State v. Ugalde, </em>2013 MT 308, \u00b6 59, 372 Mont. 234, 311 P.3d 772. Joseph did not object when the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>determined that there would be a three-week adjournment in deliberations and does not request plain error review. We decline to consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>B. Right to Presence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b636 Carri argues that the judge\u2019s inquiry into whether there was contact between witnesses and jurors violated her right to be present at a critical stage of her trial because the judge\u2019s inquiry took place in the hallway while she remained in the courtroom. Although she did not object to the inquiry at the time, she nonetheless insists that the Court now review the merits of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b637 The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to be present at all critical stages of her trial. <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244. A critical stage is \u201cany step of the proceeding where there is a potential for substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b638 Cam\u2019s exclusion from the judge\u2019s brief inquiry did not inhibit her opportunity to register a contemporaneous objection. The supposed critical stage occurred right outside the courtroom where Carri was present. Carri was present but did not object when the judge said \u201cI\u2019m going out in the hallway.\u201d Carri also was present but did not object immediately after the inquiry when the judge reported what he had learned.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">\u00b639 Carri argues that the claim is properly before the Court because there was no \u201ccontemporaneous, personal, knowing, voluntary, intelligent and on-the-record waiver\u201d of her right to be present. <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, \u00b6 32, 307 Mont. 428, 41 P.3d 305. Earlier this year, we clarified how we analyze appeals on unpreserved right to presence claims. In <em>State v. Reim, </em>2014 MT 108, 374 Mont. 487, 323 P.3d 880, the Court addressed a defendant\u2019s claimed violation of his right to presence by noting that \u201cin the absence of a timely objection in the trial court, the defendant must obtain review of a right to presence claim under one of the established methods, such as plain error review or an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d Reim, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">\u00b640 Although Carri requests plain error review, she has not met her burden to \u201cfirmly convince\u201d the Court that her exclusion compromised the justness, fairness, or integrity of her trial. <em>Torres, </em>at \u00b6 37. Cam compares her right to presence claim to other right to presence claims that the Court has elected to review in the past, but the comparison is unconvincing. Both in <em>Tapson </em>and in <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>2004 MT 53, 320 Mont. 161, 85 P.3d 1279, the trial judge, without the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>present, spoke with members of the jury directly \u2014 in <em>Tapson, </em>in the jury room while the jury was deliberating, and in <em>Kennedy, </em>privately with a juror about a \u201cclear possibility [of] juror misconduct.\u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b641 By contrast, the contact here was the judge\u2019s brief foray into the hallway to inquire whether the witnesses had spoken to any of the prospective jurors during the break. The judge immediately returned and reported on the record what had occurred. Cam was present with counsel and the jury had not yet been sworn. She had the opportunity to object at that time and to make a record. As we noted in <em>Reim, </em>our prior decisions did not create a blanket rule that \u201call right of presence . claims [are exempt] from the general rule that a constitutional violation must be first presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>Reim, </em>\u00b6 40. Under these circumstances, we decline to exercise plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">C. <em>Substantial Compliance with Jury Pool Procedures</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADs\">\u00b642 A criminal defendant\u2019s right to trial by an impartial jury includes the right to a jury pool that represents a fair cross-section of the community. <em>State </em>v. <em>LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6 36, 298 Mont. 358,2 P.3d 204. Certain procedures must be followed to ensure that the fair cross-section requirement is met. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-15-301, -402 to -404, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b643 Joseph claims that there was a \u201csubstantial failure\u201d to comply with the mandated procedures in the procurement of his jury pool. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 55. Specifically, he points out that the State\u2019s restitution affidavit disclosed that three persons who participated in the jury pool had traveled from addresses outside Jefferson County and thus presumably were not Jefferson County residents. Although none of these three individuals ended up serving on the jury, and Joseph did not have to use any of his peremptory challenges on them, Joseph claims that their participation in the juiy pool violated his rights because it evinced a substantial failure to comply with jury pool procurement procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u00b644 Joseph failed to register an objection on this issue during the jury selection process. On appeal, he points out that nothing in the record shows that he knew that these three individuals were from outside the county. To the contrary, Joseph argues that he received a notice from the District Court on March 21, 2013, that thirty-five prospective jurors had been randomly selected \u201cpursuant to\u201d Montana\u2019s jury selection procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\u00b645 At the beginning of voir dire, however, Joseph\u2019s counsel \u201cstipulate[d]\u201d that the \u201cveneer [sic] panel [was] properly summoned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>properly selected, and [had] an appropriate number of persons ... .\u201d Moreover, the record does reveal that Joseph was put on notice of this issue during the sentencing phase, but raised no concern when presented with the restitution affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b646 To preserve an issue for appeal, an appellant must object \u201cas soon as the grounds for the objection become apparent.\u201d <em>State v. Grace, </em>2001 MT 22, \u00b6 35, 304 Mont. 144, 18 P.3d 1008. While Joseph argues that there is nothing in the record to show conclusively that he knew about the addresses of the three jurors at the voir dire stage, Joseph nonetheless should have known at this stage. Under Uniform District Court Rule 9, the jury questionnaires were available to counsel, and Joseph\u2019s counsel stipulated that the jury pool was properly summoned and selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b647 We are not convinced that the inclusion of these three jurors in the jury pool resulted in \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice, left unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromised the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>\u00b6 37. None of the individuals actually served on the jury that tried the case. None therefore played a role in convicting Joseph. Moreover, Joseph did not have to use any of his preemptory challenges on any of these three individuals. Thus, we do not find the circumstances appropriate for plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b648 3. <em>Whether the written judgments conform to the oral pronouncement of sentences.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u00b649 The Robertsons own their own fire company and engage in fire suppression by contract. At sentencing, the Robertsons pointed out that they may be called upon to assist the BVFD in fire suppression. The District Court ordered the Robertsons to stay out of the fire hall, but said that it \u201cintends by the absence of comment to make no order about [the Robertsons\u2019] firefighting activities.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, the court imposed no restriction on the Robertsons\u2019 abilities to interact with law enforcement. When the written judgment was entered, however, it included a condition that the Robertsons \u201cmust report any contact with law enforcement to the County Attorney within 48 hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">\u00b650 The record shows that the Robertsons were not \u201cafforded the opportunity to respond to [this] condition\u2019s inclusion upon sufficient notice at sentencing.\u201d <em>State v. Goff, </em>2011 MT 6, \u00b6 31, 359 Mont. 107, 247 P.3d 715. Therefore, the question is whether the condition \u201csubstantively increased] the [Robertsons\u2019] loss of liberty or property.\u201d <em>Goff, </em>\u00b6 31. The State argues that it does not, and promises to not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>predicate probation revocation proceedings on the Robertsons\u2019 failure to report contact with law enforcement during emergency situations.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">\u00b651  Notwithstanding the State\u2019s pledge on appeal, the written judgment requires any contact with law enforcement to be reported. The Robertsons will almost certainly come into frequent contact with law enforcement while engaging in their business activities. Requiring them to report those contacts within forty-eight hours or potentially face revocation constitutes a substantial interference with their livelihood, and, by extension, their liberty and property. We thus conclude that this clause should not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b652 We affirm the Robertsons\u2019 convictions for theft. Because the State presented insufficient evidence to convict the Robertsons of trespass, we vacate their trespass convictions. We remand the case to the District Court with instructions to conform the written judgments to the oral pronouncement of the sentences.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA and WHEAT concur,</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\"> Although to both the District Court and this Court Joseph referred to his motion as a motion for mistrial, it is more properly considered a motion for a new trial because it came \u201c[f]ollowing a verdict or finding of guilty.\u201d Section 46-16-702, MCA. We thus will refer to it as a motion for a new trial in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
