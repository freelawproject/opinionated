Judicial District Court, Toole County, Hon. Robert G. Olson presiding, denying his Petition to Reopen Probate. We reverse and remand for further proceedings, and restate the issue presented as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by dismissing Delmar\u2019s claims for fraud and newly discovered tangible personal property under principles of res judicata?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\u00b63 This matter first arose from a will dispute between Delmar and his brother, Cecil Benjamin (Cecil). On July 15, 2009, Norman Benjamin (Norman),'the father of Delmar, Cecil, and three other children, passed away. On August 24,2009, Cecil filed Norman\u2019s Last Will and Testament with the Ninth Judicial District Court. Pursuant to the will, Cecil was named personal representative. On January 12, 2010, Cecil filed a Petition for Determination of Testacy, For Determination of Devisees and For Settlement and Distribution of a Testate Estate. The petition identified Norman\u2019s wife, Joyce Benjamin (Joyce), as the sole devisee and noted that there would be no distribution of tangible personal property to any of Norman\u2019s children. However, the will contained a pre-residuary bequest providing, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">Any tangible personal property ... shall be distributed to my surviving children (and not to their descendants) as they may agree. If my surviving children fail to reach agreement within 90 days after the probate of this will, such tangible personal property shall be distributed to them by lot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">The Probate Court held a hearing regarding the petition on January 28, 2010. Delmar received notice of the petition and the hearing, but did not respond or attend. The Petition went unchallenged, and the court entered a decree approving it, which designated Joyce as the sole devisee under the will. Notice of this decree was sent to Delmar.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">\u00b64 On December 6,2011, Delmar filed an independent action against Cecil and Joyce in the Ninth Judicial District Court. The amended complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, alleging, in pertinent part, that Cecil violated his fiduciary duty as personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>representative by distributing Norman\u2019s tangible personal property in a manner not provided for under the will, namely, by distributing it among the other children and himself, but not to Delmar. On May 22, 2012, the District Court entered an order granting Cecil and Joyce\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. With respect to Delmar\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claim, the court reasoned that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over issues deahng with Norman\u2019s estate and dismissed Delmar\u2019s complaint \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d Delmar appealed to this Court and, in <em>Benjamin v. Benjamin, </em>2013 MT 293N, \u00b6 9, <em>(Benjamin I), </em>we held that the district court did not err in determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Delmar\u2019s claim, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">[bjecause the estate was probated in the Ninth Judicial District Court in a case with a separate cause number, the district court that probated the estate, rather than the District Court in this cause, had subject matter jurisdiction over the estate pursuant to \u00a7 72-l-202(l)(a), (2), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\"><em>Benjamin I, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b65 Subsequently, on November 26, 2013, Delmar filed a Petition to Reopen Probate (Petition), alleging that Cecil committed \u201cactual fraud, actual malice, misrepresentation, and inadequate disclosure\u201d by misrepresenting the extent of Norman\u2019s tangible personal property during probate and self-dealing much of this property in violation of \u00a7 72-1-111(1), MCA. He also alleged that there was newly discovered tangible personal property that needed to be distributed in accordance with the subsequent administration provisions of \u00a7 72-3-1016, MCA. The District Court <em>sua sponte </em>denied Delmar\u2019s Petition on the ground that the court in the prior case had \u201cdismissed a similar cause of action with prejudice and that decision was affirmed by the Montana Supreme Court.\u201d Delmar appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u00b66 A district court\u2019s application of res judicata is an issue of law that we review for correctness. <em>Touris v. Flathead Cnty., </em>2011 MT 165, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 172, 258 P.3d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err by dismissing Delmar\u2019s claims for fraud and newly discovered tangible personal property under principles of res judicata?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">\u00b68 The doctrine of res judicata prevents re-litigation of a cause of action that a party has already had the opportunity to litigate. <em>Lewis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>&amp; Clark Cnty. v. Schroeder, </em>2014 MT 106, \u00b6 14, 374 Mont. 477, 323 P.3d 207 (citation omitted). It is premised on the concept that litigation \u201cmust come to an end at some point\u201d and that judicial economy is promoted by a single action instead of multiple suits. <em>Olsen v. Milner, </em>2012 MT 88, \u00b6 20, 364 Mont. 523, 276 P.3d 934 (citation omitted). Res judicata applies when the following elements are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">(1) The parties or their privies are the same;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">(2) The subject matter of the action is the same;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">(3) The issues related to the subject matter are the same; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">(4) The capacities of the person are the same in reference to the subject matter and the issues between them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-10\"><em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 16, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267 (citation omitted). Further, res judicata \u201conly applies once a final judgment on the merits has been entered in an earlier action.\u201d <em>Touris, </em>\u00b6 13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">\u00b69 Delmar argues that the merits of his claims have never been addressed by any court. He cites <em>Cook v. Soo Line R.R. Co., </em>2008 MT 421, \u00b6 12, 347 Mont. 372, 198 P.3d 310 for the proposition that \u201capplication of res judicata presumes a judgment was rendered on the merits of the case....\u201d Cecil responds that dismissal of Delmar\u2019s claims was proper because Delmar should have raised any claims regarding Norman\u2019s estate during probate proceedings in 2010, noting the Official Comments to \u00a7 72-1-111, MCA, of the Uniform Probate Code provide that \u201c[a]ny action under this section is subject to usual rules of res judicata.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">\u00b610  The District Court held that because Delmar\u2019s \u201csimilar\u201d claims in <em>Benjamin I </em>had been dismissed there \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d his current claims are barred as well. We have held that when a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, as the district court determined in <em>Benjamin I, </em>it must dismiss the action. <em>Big Spring v. Conway (In re Estate of Big Spring), 2011 </em>MT 109, \u00b6 23, 360 Mont. 370, 255 P.3d 121 (citing M. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3); <em>Wippert v. Blackfeet Tribe, </em>260 Mont. 93, 102, 859 P.2d 420, 425 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">\u00b611 A court\u2019s dismissal of an action is entered with or without prejudice, depending on the circumstances. A dismissal with prejudice \u201chas a well-recognized legal import. It is the converse of the term \u2018without prejudice,\u2019 and a judgment or decree of dismissal with prejudice is as conclusive of the rights of the parties as if the suit had been prosecuted to a final adjudication adverse to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Schuster v. Northern Co., 127 </em>Mont. 39, 45, 257 P.2d 249, 252 (1953). The Court held that \u201c[t]he words ... \u2018with prejudice,\u2019 were an express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>statement that the dismissal was upon the merits.\u201d <em>Schuster, </em>127 Mont, at 48,257 P.2d at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b612 Although this Court has never directly addressed the issue, many other states\u2019 courts have held that dismissal of a claim \u201cwith prejudice\u201d for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is improper because a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction does not go to the merits of the case. <em>Beaver Cnty. v. Qwest, </em>Inc., 31 P.3d 1147, 1152 (Utah 2001); <em>Trottier v. Bird, </em>635 N.W.2d 157, 160 (N.D. 2001); <em>Bell v. Finnegan (In re B.A.D.), </em>82 So. 3d 608, 614 (Miss. 2012); <em>Black v. Jackson, </em>82 S.W.3d 44, 56 (Tex. App. 2002); <em>Coyle v. Stroh-Coyle, </em>2005 Wash. App. LEXIS 987, **9-10 (Wash. Ct. App. May 9,2005). M. R. Civ. P. 41(b) provides that an involuntary dismissal or any other dismissal not governed by the rule acts as an adjudication on the merits, <em>except </em>in cases where the dismissal results from lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party. \u201cOrdinarily, a case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be dismissed without prejudice so that a plaintiff may reassert his claims in a competent court.\u201d <em>Frigard v. U.S., </em>862 F.2d 201,204 (9th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b613  In <em>Benjamin I, </em>this Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, but did not address the propriety of the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d designation of the order, as it was unnecessary to our decision. Here, Delmar has asserted new claims for fraud and newly discovered tangible personal property. Based on the aforementioned authority, Delmar cannot be prevented from litigating his current claims on the ground that his previous breach of fiduciary duty claim was dismissed \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d Because the district court in <em>Benjamin I </em>lacked subject matter jurisdiction, as we so concluded, it was powerless to adjudicate the merits of Delmar\u2019s claim and the dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d was improper. Accordingly, res judicata does not bar Delmar\u2019s fraud and newly discovered tangible personal property claims in this case. The merits of these claims have never been addressed. Importantly, these claims depend on Delmar\u2019s ability to establish facts <em>independent of </em>the initial proceeding that probated Norman\u2019s will. In other words, this is not an opportunity for Delmar to challenge the probate court\u2019s interpretation of Norman\u2019s will and to argue it should have been interpreted differently. Rather, in order to obtain a remedy, he must prove that Cecil committed fraud during or subsequent to probate or that new tangible personal property was discovered subsequent to the initial probate proceeding. Cecil farther argues that these claims are time barred, but that issue was not addressed by the District Court and, if necessary, may be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b614 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
