(WRI) appeals from the Order entered by the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, Hon. Kathy Seeley presiding, determining that WRI may not deduct coal severance and gross proceeds taxes paid to the Crow Tribe (Tribe) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>to reduce the amount owing under Montana\u2019s Resource Indemnity Trust and Ground Water Assessment Tax (RITT). We affirm and restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by determining that WRI may not deduct taxes paid to the Tribe as \u201ctaxes paid on production\u201d from the \u201ccontract sales price\u201d when calculating the RITT?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b63 WRI mines coal owned by the Tribe on the Crow Reservation in south-central Montana, and pays coal severance and gross proceeds taxes to the Tribe. WRI collects money from purchasers of the coal as part of the f.o.b. mine gross revenue, as reported under statute to the Department of Revenue (Department), to pay these taxes. WRI also pays the RITT to the State. In February 2005, WRI filed a tax return with the Department for coal produced and sold at its Absaloka Mine, located on the Crow Reservation, during tax year 2004. On its return, WRI deducted the coal severance and gross proceeds taxes it had paid to the Tribe as \u201ctaxes paid on production\u201d to calculate the \u201ccontract sales price\u201d of the coal, against which the RITT is assessed. The Department disallowed WRI\u2019s deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b64 WRI filed a complaint with the State Tax Appeal Board, alleging that federal law preempted the assessment of the RITT on its Absaloka Mine, and alternatively alleging that the Department wrongfully denied its deduction for \u201ctaxes paid on production\u201d to the Tribe. Later, WRI and the Department filed a joint petition for an interlocutory adjudication of a substantive question of law -with the District Court pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 15-2-304 and -305, MCA. The parties asked the court to determine whether WRI\u2019s coal severance and gross proceeds deduction was proper. The court held in favor of the Department, explaining that Montana law \u201cdoes not allow [a] deduction for taxes paid to the Crow Tribe ....\u201d WRI appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u00b65 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute for correctness.\u201d <em>Blanton v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. HHS, </em>2011 MT 110, \u00b6 21, 360 Mont. 396, 255 P.3d 1229 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court err by determining that WRI may not deduct taxes paid to the Tribe as \u201ctaxes paid on production\u201d from the \u201ccontract sales price\u201d when calculating the RITT?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u00b67 The RITT assessed against coal producers is calculated as \u201c0.4% of the gross value of product in excess of $ 6,250.\u201d Section 15-38-104(2)(b), MCA. \u201c \u2018[GJross value of product\u2019 is determined by multiplying the contract sales price ... by the tonnage produced.\u201d Section 15-38-125, MCA. \u201cContract sales price\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">\u201cContract sales price\u201d means either the price of coal extracted and prepared for shipment f.o.b. mine, <em>excluding that amount charged by the seller to pay taxes paid on production, </em>or a price imputed by the department under 15-35-107. Contract sales price includes all royalties paid on production, no matter how the royalties are calculated. However, with respect to royalties paid to the government of the United States, the state of Montana, or a federally recognized Indian tribe, the contract sales price includes 15 cents per ton. Contract sales price does not include the costs specific to the act of coal washing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Section 15-35-102(5), MCA (emphasis added). In turn, \u201ctaxes paid on production\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201cTaxes paid on production\u201d includes <em>any tax paid to the federal, state, or local governments </em>upon the quantity of coal produced as a function of either the volume or the value of production and does not include any tax upon the value of mining equipment, machinery, or buildings and lands, any tax upon a person\u2019s net income derived in whole or in part from the sale of coal, or any license fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Section 15-35-102(11), MCA (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATa\">\u00b68 The dispute in this case centers on whether the phrase \u201cany tax paid to the federal, state, or local governments,\u201d within \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, includes those taxes WRI pays to the Tribe. The answer to this question impacts the calculation of the \u201ccontract sales price\u201d and, in turn, the amount owed to the State under the RITT. Understandably, WRI wants to deduct the taxes it pays to the Tribe from the \u201ccontract sales price\u201d of the coal it mines and markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b69 WRI argues that the plain language of \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA \u2014 defining \u201ctaxes paid on production\u201d \u2014 is unambiguous and should be read to include the taxes it pays to the Tribe. WRI maintains that the purpose of this statute is to indicate \u201cthe type of taxes that are \u2018paid on production\u2019 by providing an illustrative list.\u201d According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>WRI, the statutory definition does not omit obvious production taxes merely because such taxes are paid to an Indian tribe. WRI focuses on the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cincludes,\u201d and cites various sources defining the term expansively: \u201c \u2018[t]he use of the word \u2018includes\u2019 suggests the fist is non-exhaustive rather than exclusive,\u2019 \u201d <em>U.S. v. Wyatt, </em>408 F.3d 1257, 1261 (9th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted); \u201c \u2018includes\u2019 generally signifies an intent to enlarge a statute\u2019s application, rather than limit it, and it implies the conclusion that there are other items includable, though not specifically enumerated,\u201d <em>Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs v. Bassett, </em>8 P.3d 1079, 1083 (Wyo. 2000) (citations omitted). Therefore, WRI argues, \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, \u201cis not exclusive, but inclusive and not limiting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b610 The Department responds that \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, does not authorize WRI to deduct taxes paid to the Tribe because \u201cMontana law requires a deduction to be explicitly established and strictly construed.\u201d The Department argues that to be deductible, a statute must clearly allow the expense as a deduction, citing <em>Baitis v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2004 MT 17, \u00b6 25, 319 Mont. 292, 83 P.3d 1278; <em>Cyprus Mines Corp. v. Madison Cnty., </em>172 Mont. 116, 118, 560 P.2d 1342, 1343 (1977); <em>GBN, Inc. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 249 </em>Mont. 261,266,815 P.2d 595, 597-98 (1991). The Department states that \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, does not \u00e9xplicitly reference tribal governments, and therefore, the taxes WRI paid to the Tribe are not \u201ctaxes paid on production\u201d for purposes of calculating the \u201ccontract sales price.\u201d The Department also cites <em>Mitchell v. Univ. of Mont., </em>240 Mont. 261,265, 783 P.2d 1337,1339 (1989), for the proposition that when the Legislature uses the term \u201cincludes,\u201d this Court will not ordinarily construe it expansively to mean \u201cincludes, but is not limited to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b611 \u201cWhen interpreting a statute, our objective is to implement the objectives the legislature sought to achieve.\u201d <em>Mont. Vending, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>2003 MT 282, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 1, 78 P.3d 499 (citation omitted). We ascertain legislative intent from the plain meaning of the words used in a statute. <em>Mont. Vending, Inc., </em>\u00b6 21. We endeavor \u201cto avoid a statutory construction that renders any section of the statute superfluous or fails to give effect to all of the words used.\u201d <em>Mont. Trout Unlimited v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. &amp; Conserv., </em>2006 MT 72, \u00b6 23, 331 Mont. 483, 133 P.3d 224 (citation omitted). Under tax law, \u201c[i]t is well-settled law that a tax deduction cannot be inferred or presumed, as deductions are authorized only under clear statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Baitis, </em>\u00b6 25 (citation omitted). An expense may be deducted \u201conly when the legislature specifically establishes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>deduction.\u201d <em>In re Est. of Langendorf, </em>262 Mont. 123, 126, 863 P.2d 434, 436 (1993) (citation omitted). A revenue statute authorizing a deduction must be construed with specificity rather than the more liberal construction we generally apply to revenue laws. <em>Cyprus Mines Corp., </em>172 Mont, at 118, 560 P.2d at 1343 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b612 Section 15-35-102(11), MCA, makes no mention of taxes paid to tribal governments. Although WRI attempts to downplay this omission, it is important in this case. As noted above, tax deductions must be clearly authorized by the governing statute. Here, the Legislature authorized the deduction of taxes paid to \u201cfederal, state, or local governments,\u201d but not tribal governments. It is not this Court\u2019s duty to insert what has been omitted from a statute. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Moreover, under \u201cthe canon <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>we interpret the expression of one thing in a statute to imply the exclusion of another.\u201d <em>Dukes v. City of Missoula, </em>2005 MT 196, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 155, 119 P.3d 61 (citation omitted). A plain reading of \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, demonstrates that the Legislature defined \u201ctaxes paid on production\u201d as those taxes that are paid to a specified group of governing authorities, which does not include tribal governments. \u00b613 Our holdingin <em>Citizens for Balanced Use v. Maurier, </em>2013 MT 166, 370 Mont. 410, 303 P.3d 794, upon which the District Court relied, is instructive. There, the Department of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks (DFWP) transported bison from a location near Yellowstone National Park to the Ft. Peck Reservation. <em>Maurier, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Citizens for Balanced Use (CBU) subsequently filed suit, challenging the DFWP action and seeking to enjoin the bison transport. The district court entered a temporary restraining order and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting DFWP from continuing with the transfer process. <em>Maurier, </em>\u00b6 8. On appeal, we reversed the district Gourt, finding that it erroneously interpreted \u00a7 87-1-216, MCA, <em>Maurier, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 32. That statute provided, in pertinent part, that DFWP \u201c\u2018may not release, transplant, or allow wild buffalo or bison on any private or public land in Montana that has not been authorized for that use by the private or public landowner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maurier, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting \u00a7 87-1-216(4), MCA). We explained that the phrase \u201cpublic or private land in Montana\u201d could not be read to restrict the placement of bison on tribal lands because the statute \u201cdoes not expressly mention tribal lands.\u201d <em>Maurier, </em>\u00b6 16. We found it persuasive that in other statutes, the Legislature \u201cspecifically referred to tribes or tribal land when it intended to do so.\u201d <em>Maurier, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b6 14 As in <em>Maurier, </em>the Legislature did not mention tribal governments</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>in \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA \u2014 the definition of \u201ctaxes paid on production.\u201d Notably, however, in 1983 the Legislature amended what is currently \u00a7 15-35-102(5), MCA \u2014 the definition of \u201ccontract sales price\u201d \u2014 to include the following language: \u201cwith respect to royalties paid to the government of the United States, the state of Montana, or <em>a federally recognized Indian tribe, </em>the contract sales price includes ... .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Clearly, the Legislature could have amended \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, in a similar fashion if it had wished to include taxes paid to tribal governments within the definition of \u201ctaxes paid on production.\u201d Moreover, the Department\u2019s reliance on <em>Mitchell\u2019s </em>application of the term \u201cincludes\u201d is well placed here. <em>\u201cIf </em>so intended, the Legislature could have easily used the phrase \u2018includes, but is not limited to\u2019 in defining government entities.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>240Mont, at 265, 783 P.2d at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b615 WRI argues that even if \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, limits the deduction to taxes paid to federal, state, and local governments, \u201clocal governments\u201d is a broad category that necessarily encompasses the Tribe because it is a government and is located in Montana. WRI cites two statutes that include tribal governments within the definition of \u201clocal government\u201d: \u00a7 90-6-701(3)(b), MCA (\u201c \u2018Local government\u2019 means an incorporated city or town, a county, a consolidated local government, a tribal government....\u201d); and 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(11)(B) (\u201cThe term local government\u2019 means \u2014 an Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b616  However, the fact that there are instances where the Legislature or U.S. Congress has defined \u201clocal government\u201d to include a tribal government supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature specifically refers to tribal governments when it intends to include them in a definition of\u2018local government.\u201d A cursory search of the MCA reveals various instances where local governments and tribal governments are defined separately or exclusively: \u00a7 90-l-201(f)-(g), MCA (\u201c \u2018Local government\u2019 means a county, consolidated government, city, town, or district or local public entity with the authority to spend or receive public funds.... \u2018Tribal government\u2019 means any one of the seven federally recognized tribal governments of Montana and the Little Shell band of Chippewa Indians.\u201d); \u00a7 60-4-202(2)(a)(i), MCA (\"The department may sell an interest in real property without a public auction directly to:... a federal, state, tribal, or local government\u201d); \u00a7 85-1-605, MCA (\u201cThe department may recommend ... that coal severance tax bonds be authorized... to provide financial assistance to a... political subdivision or local government body of the state... or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>a tribal government.\u201d); and <em>compare </em>\u00a7 15-35-102(5), MCA (\u201cthe government of the United States, the state of Montana, or a federally recognized Indian tribe\u201d) <em>with </em>\u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA (\u201cthe federal, state, or local governments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b617 Includingtribal governments within the term \u201clocal governments\u201d as used in \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, would fly in the face of the plain and usual meaning of the words and produce an irrational construction given the separate references to \u2018local governments\u201d and \u201cfederally recognized Indian tribe[s]\u201d contained within \u00a7 15-35-102, MCA, itself. Accordingly, we conclude that the term \u2018local governments\u201d as used in \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, does not include tribal governments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFst\">\u00b618 Lastly, WRI argues that not allowing a deduction for the taxes it paid to the Tribe \u201cdirectly conflicts with well-established authority respecting and acknowledging Indian Tribes as legitimate government entities with the authority to tax.\u201d WRI cites the Montana State-Tribal Cooperative Agreements Act, \u00a7 18-11-101, et seq., MCA, as \u201cclear recognition by the State of the importance of tribal governments within Montana, as well as the State\u2019s desire to promote cooperation and economic development of Montana\u2019s tribes through direct tribal taxation.\u201d WRI points out that the federal government aims to promote and encourage tribal self-government and self-sufficiency, citing <em>N.M. v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, </em>462 U.S. 324, 334-35, 103 S. Ct. 2378, 2386-87 (1983). According to WRI, the District Court\u2019s ridings in this case \u201csuggest that the laws at issue do not recognize the Crow Tribe as a legitimate local taxing authority and part of the fabric of Montana state and local governments.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b619 Applying \u00a7 15-35-102(11), MCA, to disallow a <em>state </em>tax deduction does not undermine the Tribe\u2019s sovereign authority to tax or govern itself. The Legislature has simply chosen to limit the class of governments to which payment of taxes constitutes a deductible expense for coal producers. By so doing, the Legislature did not implicate tribal sovereignty. Moreover, as the Department notes, WRI lacks standing to raise a claim implicating the Tribe\u2019s sovereignty. <em>See Northern Border Pipeline Co. v. State, </em>237 Mont. 117, 128-29, 772 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>829,835-36 (1989) (Taxpayer corporation had standing to challenge a state property tax, but did \u201cnot have standing to assert the Tribes\u2019 sovereign right of self-government in doing so.\u201d). The District Court did not err in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> Monies collected under the RITT are allocated to the resource indemnity trust fund, \u00a7 15-38-201, MCA, and are then expended pursuant to the directives of \u00a7 15-38-202, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\"> WEI argues that there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the definition was adopted to exclude taxes paid to Indian tribes.
