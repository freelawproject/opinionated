We restate the issue on appeal as follows: Whether the termination proceedings complied with statutory requirements for proceedings involving an Indian child.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">\u00b63 Thirteen-year-old M.S. was removed from her mother\u2019s care and placed into emergency protective custody on July 18, 2011, after her mother was arrested for Possession of Dangerous Drugs with Intent to Distribute. M.S.\u2019s father, G.S., has been incarcerated in a federal prison in Arizona since 2009, serving a 480-month sentence with an additional 20 years of supervised release for aggravated sexual abuse. G.S. is an enrolled member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe (Tribe).</p>\n<p id=\"AyN\">\u00b64 On July 25, 2011, the Department of Public Health and Human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Services (Department) filed a Petition for Emergency Protective Services, Adjudication as Youth in Need of Care and Temporary Legal Custody. Although the Department initially placed M.S. with another family member, by August 2011, M.S. had moved to Billings to live with her grandmother\u2019s ex-husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b65 On July 28, 2011, the District Court set a date for a show cause hearing and issued a citation to the mother directing her to appear at the hearing. The Department sent notice of the pending show cause hearing to the Chippewa Cree Tribe, mistakenly believing that M.S. was a member or eligible for membership with that tribe. The Chippewa Cree responded that M.S. was not enrolled or eligible for enrollment with that tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b66 The District Court held the show cause hearing on December 5, 2011. G.S. did not personally attend, but he had been served and was represented at the hearing by his attorney. Both parents stipulated that M.S. was a Youth in Need of Care. The District Court issued an order on December 21,2011, adjudicating M.S. a Youth in Need of Care and granting the Department Temporary Legal Custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b67 On July 26,2012, the Department filed a Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and Termination of Parental Rights for both parents. At the disposition hearing on the petition, G.S., through counsel, informed the court that he was a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. The District Court denied and dismissed the Department\u2019s petition without prejudice on the grounds that the petition contained inaccurate information regarding M.S.\u2019s tribal affiliations and granted the Department leave to file a new petition to terminate G.S.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u00b68 On September 12, 2012, the Department sent notice of the proceedings by registered mail to the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Lame Deer, Montana. The Department filed a Notice of Filing with the court, stating that the Tribe received copies of the Petition for Temporary Legal Custody, Social Worker\u2019s Affidavit, Order to Show Cause Hearing, and Tribal Notice. The Tribe filed a notice of intervention acknowledging that M.S. was an Indian child under IC WA and was eligible for enrollment in the tribe. While the Tribe expressed interest in transferring the case to tribal court and provided contact information, the Tribe did not appear at any subsequent hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u00b69 On December 4,2012, the Department filed a modified petition for the termination of G.S.\u2019s parental rights- and for permanent legal custody of M.S. The Department asserted a theory of aggravated circumstances under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA. A hearing on this petition was held on March 25,2013. The court determined that a continuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>was necessary because the Tribe was not properly notified of the hearing. The termination hearing was rescheduled and held on April 22, 2013. The only indication that the Tribe received notice of the rescheduled hearing was that the court\u2019s order indicated that the Tribe was \u201ccc\u2019d\u201d with a copy of the order. At the April 22 hearing, the Department then moved to dismiss its petition and refile for termination solely on the issue of abandonment because it had concluded that, under \u00a7 41-3-423(2), MCA, aggravated circumstances are not a ground for termination where the proceeding is subject to ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b610 On April 30, 2013, the Department filed a motion to amend the petition to terminate G.S.\u2019s parental rights and for summaryjudgment. The District Court issued an order granting the Department\u2019s motion to amend. Although the Department\u2019s motion indicated that a copy was \u201ccc\u2019d\u201d to the Tribe, neither the motion nor the court\u2019s subsequent order contained a certificate of service confirming that the documents were served on the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b611 At the Department\u2019s request, the District Court issued an order setting a summary judgment hearing for October 21, 2013, on the petition to terminate G.S.\u2019s parental rights. This order indicated that it was sent to the parties by a certificate of mailing signed by the clerk of court. At the hearing, the District Court ordered G.S.\u2019s parental rights terminated and awarded the Department permanent legal custody of M.S. The District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order terminating G.S.\u2019s rights on November 12, 2013. G.S. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\u00b612 This Court reviews the District Court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re K.B., </em>2013 MT 133, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 254, 301 P.3d 836. \u201cIn a case governed by ICWA, we will uphold the district court\u2019s termination of parental rights if a reasonable fact-finder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d <em>In re K.B., </em>\u00b6 18. We review a district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts of the case for correctness. <em>In re K.B., </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the termination proceedings complied with statutory requirements for proceedings involving an Indian child.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u00b614 ICWA establishes the immmum federal standards for the removal of an Indian child from her family and the placement of such a child in a foster or adoptive home. M.S. is eligible for enrollment with the Tribe and, under ICWA, M.S. is an Indian child. ICWA must be followed strictly by state courts, to \u201cprotect the best interests of Indian children and promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b615 ICWA provides that \u201cany parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such [Indian] child was removed, and the Indian child\u2019s tribe may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that such action violated any provision of sections 1911,1912, and 1913 of this title.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914. Section 1912 of ICWA requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">In any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention... . No foster care pl\u00e1cement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretaiy....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b616 A recent case decided by this Court involved problems with notice under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). <em>In re KB., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-25. In that case, the tribe received proper notice of the youth in need of care proceeding by registered mail, but did not receive proper notice of the termination petition and hearing. <em>In re K.B., </em>\u00b6 24. Although the termination petition and the court\u2019s order setting the termination hearing indicated by notation that copies were \u201ccc\u2019d\u201d to the mother and the tribe, the record did not include an accompanying certificate of service or other documentation that could prove that timely service was accomplished. <em>In re KB., </em>\u00b624.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">\u00b617 We held that the notice was insufficient under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a) because the record did not reflect that the mother and the tribe received notice ten days in advance of the termination hearing. <em>In re K.B., </em>\u00b6 25. We reversed the district court\u2019s termination order and remanded for \u00e1 new hearing because the State gave insufficient notice and also because the State did not adequately develop the record with regard to whether it demonstrated \u201cactive efforts\u201d under 25 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u00a7 1912(d) or whether continued custody of the child by the parent was \u201clikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child\u201d under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). <em>In re K.B., </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b618 The procedure followed in this case with regard to notice was remarkably similar to that in <em>In re KB. </em>After the Department realized its mistake concerning M.S.\u2019s tribal affiliation, the Department properly notified the Tribe by registered mail of the involuntary child custody proceeding. The Tribe promptly filed a notice of intervention. The petition for termination of parental rights filed on April 30,2013, however, indicates only that it was \u201ccc\u2019d,\u201d without any certificate of service. The court\u2019s order granting the amendment also did not Contain a certificate of service. No other proof of service was filed in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"AjE\">\u00b619 ICWA requires that \u201cthe party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child\u201d first notify the Tribe of \u201cany involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved ... .\u201d25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). ICWA also provides that \u201c[n]o foster care placement <em>or termination of parental rights proceeding </em>shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary ....\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a) (emphasis added). If there is \u201cany question about whether notice had to be given both before the department sought to put the child in foster care and when it sought to terminate parental rights, that question should be resolved in favor of giving notice twice.\u201d <em>People ex rel. </em>S.R.M., 153 P.3d 438, 442 (Colo. Ct. App. 2006), <em>cited in In re K.B., </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b620  Here, while the initial notice to the tribe was adequate, the Tribe was not properly served with notice of the termination of parental rights proceeding. The Department\u2019s indication that it \u201ccc\u2019d\u201d the Tribe with its motion to amend the termination petition did not include a certificate of service, and no other proof of service appears in the record. Although the court\u2019s order setting the termination hearing was served on the Tribe, that document was styled as an order setting a summary judgment hearing and virtually all of the evidence considered by the court already had been presented in prior hearings. Cohsistent with <em>In re </em>K.B., \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, we conclude that the Department failed to provide adequate evidence of proper notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u00b621 We do not hold that the State must send notice of termination proceedings to the Tribe by registered mail if, as here, notice of the initial proceedings already has been effected in that manner. Where the Tribe already has intervened in the case, notice of termination will be sufficient if it is given in compliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure governing notice to other parties. Thus, the notice to the Tribe must, at a minimum, comply with M. R. Civ. P. 5; Rule 5 states that all documents listed in Rule 5(a)(1) must be served on every party. Service may be accomplished by \u201cmailing it to the person\u2019s last known address \u2014 in which event service is complete upon mailing.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(2)(C). If service is made by mail, a certificate of service must be filed. M. R. Civ. P. 5(d)(1). Once a tribe has filed a notice of intervention, it has appeared as a party in the case and is entitled to proper service under this rule. Compliance with Rule 5 ensures that a certificate of service will be filed in the record of the district court. M. R. Civ. P. 5(d). That did not occur here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b622 We have held consistently that a district court may protect a child\u2019s best interest despite procedural errors that would have no impact upon the result. <em>In re J.C., </em>2008 MT 127, \u00b6 43, 343 Mont. 30, 183 P.3d 22; <em>In re F.H., </em>266 Mont. 36,39,878 P.2d 890,892 (1994); <em>In re AM., </em>2000 MT 35, \u00b6 39, 298 Mont. 237, 995 P.2d 427 (2000). We agree with the line of cases holding that ICWA\u2019s notice requirements are not jurisdictional and are subject to harmless error review. <em>In re M.N.E., </em>752 N.W.2d 1,10 n.3 (Iowa 2008); <em>In re Christian P., </em>208 Cal. App. 4th 437 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 2012); <em>In re G.L., 177 </em>Cal. App. 4th 683, 695-96 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. 2009). An error involving notice to a tribe is not ground for reversal unless there is a \u201creasonable probability that [the appellant] would have obtained a more favorable result in the absence of the error.\u201d <em>In re G.L., 177 </em>Cal. App. 4th at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b623  Despite the Department\u2019s failure to provide adequate notice, the record shows that the Tribe was aware of the case but, after evaluating the circumstances, did not assume an active role or interest in participating in the matter. \u201cICWA recognizes that tribes have a unique interest and ability to provide services in the upbringing of Indian children.\u201d Jn <em>re C.H., </em>2003 MT 308, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 208, 79 P.3d 822. The ICWA expert testified, however, that she had \u201cspoken to the Tribe and they said that at this point, there would be turmoil if we removed her from the place that she\u2019s at [sic].\u201d The Tribe did not participate in this appeal and G.S. has not provided any evidence that the Tribe intended to actively participate had it properly been notified of the termination hearing. This is not a case where the court ignored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>a child\u2019s Indian ancestry or deprived a tribe of its right to intervene. \u201cIt would serve no purpose to require the [District Court] to terminate [G.S.\u2019s] parental rights all over again.\u201d <em>In re N.N.E., </em>752 N.W.2d at 10. Because there is not a reasonable probability that G.S. would have obtained a more favorable result in the absence of the Department\u2019s error regarding proper IC WA notice, we hold that the error in this case was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b624 G.S. argues next that the Department failed to meet ICWA\u2019s \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement. The Department has an obligation to demonstrate active efforts to prevent the breakup of an Indian family:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6RI\">Any party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d). \u201c \u2018Active efforts\u2019 implies a heightened responsibility compared to passive efforts.\u201d <em>In reD.S.B., </em>2013 MT 112, \u00b6 15, 370 Mont. 37, 300 P.3d 702. If the underlying proceeding is a termination of parental rights under \u00a7 1912(f), proof of \u201cactive efforts\u201d must be satisfactory \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>In re G.S., </em>2002 MT 245, \u00b6 33, 312 Mont. 108, 59 P.3d 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\u00b625 As we have noted before, a common sense understanding of \u201cactive efforts\u201d \u201crequires only that \u2018timely affirmative steps be taken to accomplish the goal which Congress has set: to avoid the breakup of Indian families whenever possible by providing services [designed] to remedy problems which might lead to severance of the parent-child relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re G.S., </em>\u00b6 36 (quoting <em>Letitia v. Superior Court, </em>81 Cal. App. 4th 1009, 1016, 97 Cal. Rptr. 2d 303, 309 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. 2000)). Further, \u201ca parent\u2019s incarceration may limit the remedial and rehabilitative services that the State can make available to the parent to prevent the breakup of the Indian family.\u201d <em>In re D.S.B., </em>2013 MT 112, \u00b6 15, 370 Mont. 37, 300 P.3d 702. We do not excuse the state\u2019s obligation to make active efforts if a parent is incarcerated, but \u201cwe will not fault the [Department] if its efforts are curtailed by the parent\u2019s own criminal behavior.\u201d <em>In re D.S.B., </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">\u00b626 The District Court expressly addressed whether ICWA\u2019s heightened standard for active efforts was met, noting that the Department worked with the mother to create a treatment plan and that reunification with the father was a practical impossibility because of G.S.\u2019s long-term incarceration. The Department assisted M.S.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>mother in complying with her court-ordered treatment plan before she consented to the termination of her rights. The Department paid for the mother to visit M.S. in Billings and made efforts to help her locate an appropriate residence. No treatment plan was ordered for G.S. due to his long-term incarceration. The court found that the father had failed to develop and maintain a parental relationship with M.S., and that his incarceration left \u201cvirtually no likelihood or prospect that [G.S.] will ever be in a position to parent, or even establish a parental relationship, as a matter of fact, with the child prior to the time that she turns 18.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b627 [3] The court concluded that \u201cthe [Department] has actively intervened in this matter and endeavored, to the extent practical, under the facts and the law, to effect reunification of the child with either or both parents.\u201d The court held as a matter of law that the Department\u2019s \u201cefforts to effect reunification are reasonable under State law and they have been active under the federal law within the meaning of the ICWA on the same findings of fact.\u201d We hold that a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that the Department made sufficient active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of this Indian family. Substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that G.S. will not be able to parent his daughter at any time before she reaches the age of majority. The District Court did not \u00e9rr in concluding that the Department met ICWA\u2019s \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement in this circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b628  G.S. asserts that the District Court did not make specific findings of fact required by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f) that continued custody of the child by the parent was \u201clikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d Th\u00e9 Department presented evidence that the continued parental custody of the children would result in serious emotional or physical damage to the children. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Court took judicial notice that G.S. has been convicted of aggravated sexual abuse of another daughter, who was four years old at the time, and that he is serving a term of forty years in prison. The District Court found that, even if the father were to leave prison, continued custody of the child with the father likely would result in serious emotional or physical harm to the child by removing her from her current placement in a stable environment. The District Court made sufficient findings regarding the child\u2019s well-being and reasonably concluded that continued custody by G.S. would likely result in \u201cserious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d <em>In re K.B., </em>\u00b6 18. \u00b629 Finally, although G.S.\u2019s issue statement alleges a violation of the right to procedural due process, he did not present any due process arguments or develop this allegation in any way and we do not further consider it. M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f); <em>In re Estate of Harmon, </em>2011 MT 84, \u00b6 28, 360 Mont. 150, 253 P.3d 821. G.S. does argue that the Department cannot terminate a parent\u2019s rights through a summary judgment motion, and that the District Court improperly relied on testimony from prior proceedings. The District Court made specific findings of fact during the April 22 hearing and expressly incorporated those findings, \u201cso as not to waste the time and effort\u201d of the parties and witnesses. The court reasonably sought \u201cto avoid duplication\u201d of the testimony presented at an earlier termination hearing. Although G.S. is correct that the statutes do not contemplate any summary judgment process for a termination proceeding, the court did not grant summary judgment. It is clear that the court based its decision on the presentation of evidence by the parties; it properly considered the statutes in Title 41, MCA, and ICWA; and it entered detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law explaining its decision to terminate G.S.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b630  The District Court did not err in determining that the Department satisfied the \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement and made sufficient findings of fact pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). Although we hold that the Department did not provide appropriate proof that the father\u2019s tribe received proper notice of the termination hearing, that error was harmless under the circumstances of this case. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"AFt\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\"> It is incumbent upon counsel for the Department to ensure that the Tribe receives proper service of the District Court\u2019s orders. If an order does not indicate that the court served a copy of the order on the Tribe, the Department should serve the order on the Tribe to guarantee that the Tribe receives a copy, and file a Certificate of Service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\"> The record does not clarify whether G.S. ever had custody of M.S. The record is silent regarding G.S.\u2019s relationship with M.S. prior to his incarceration. We recognize that 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d) does not apply where the \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d has long since occurred. <em>In re J.S., </em>2014 MT 79, \u00b6 29, 374 Mont. 329, 321 P.3d 103 (citing <em>Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, </em>133 S. Ct. 2552,2559 (2013)). Although the District Court asked during the April 22,2013 hearing, before <em>Baby Girl </em>was decided, how the ICWA standard for termination applies in a situation where the child was never in the parent\u2019s custody, the parties did not dispute that ICWA\u2019s active efforts were required. Because this potential issue was not raised, we will not address it in this appeal. <em>See Stevens v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>2010 MT 282, \u00b6 78, 358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
