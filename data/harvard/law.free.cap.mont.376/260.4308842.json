The issue on appeal is whether the District Court properly denied Minett\u2019s motion to suppress the results of a blood alcohol test taken pursuant to a search warrant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b62 On the morning of March 27,2011, Minett caused an accident by driving his vehicle into another vehicle while attempting to pass on a city street in Butte, Montana. Both Minett and the other driver were injured. Emergency medical service personnel arrived and attended the drivers. At the scene Minett was swearing, upset, waving his hands, and repeating that he was \u201cgoing to jail.\u201d Butte-Silver Bow Police Officer Tymofichuk observed Minett behaving erratically, vacillating from being aggressive to being apologetic. Officer Tymofichuk smelled a strong odor of alcohol when he talked to Minett but was concerned that he might have a head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b63 Both drivers went to the hospital by ambulance. After investigating the scene of the accident, Officer Tymofichuk went to the hospital to interview the drivers. When he arrived one of the ambulance crew reported that Minett fled on foot when a call came over the radio that officers were coming to the hospital. An officer found Minett a few minutes later at a nearby casino attempting to purchase alcohol and took him to the detention center.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u00b64 Officer Tymofichuk suspected that Minett had been driving while impaired by alcohol, based upon his observations at the accident scene. Minett refused to cooperate in any physical sobriety tests, and refused to provide a breath sample. Officer Tymofichuk called the County Attorney for advice and decided to apply for a search warrant to obtain a blood sample from Minett to test for drugs and alcohol. Officer Tymofichuk returned Minett to the hospital because he was complaining of head and neck pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u00b65 The Justice of the Peace issued a search warrant that authorized the police to obtain a blood sample from Minett based upon probable cause to believe that he was driving under the influence of alcohol. After hospital personnel drew the blood sample, Officer Tymofichuk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>arrested Minett for driving under the influence, driving without liability insurance and with a suspended license, and for a probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b66 The State ultimately charged Minett with felony DUI (fourth or subsequent offense) and with criminal endangerment. In November 2012 a jury found Minett guilty of both offences. The District Court sentenced Minett as a persistent felony offender to concurrent sentences of 30 years with ten years suspended on both convictions. Minett appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the blood test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b67 This Court reviews a district court ruling on a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Marcial, </em>2013 MT 242, \u00b6 10, 371 Mont. 348, 308 P.3d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b68 On appeal Minett argues that once he refused to cooperate in sobriety tests, Montana law prohibited law enforcement officers from taking any action to obtain a blood sample for testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b69 Section 61-8-402, MCA (2009), which was in effect at the time of Minett\u2019s offense, describes the \u201cimplied consent\u201d rule, based in part upon the fact that driving is not a right but a privilege and that a person who chooses to enjoy the privilege must \u201caccept the concomitant responsibilities\u201d such as implied consent. <em>State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 58, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636. The implied consent rule provides that a person operating a motor vehicle is \u201cconsidered to have given consent to a test or tests, as designated by the investigating officer, of the person\u2019s blood or breath\u201d to determine the presence of alcohol or drugs. Section 61-8-402(1), MCA (2009). The test or tests \u201cmust be administered at the direction of a peace officer,\u201d who may designate the tests to be administered. Section 61-8-402(2), MCA (2009). \u201cIf an arrested person refuses to submit to one or more tests requested and designated by the officer,... the <em>refused test or tests may not be given </em>but the officer shall ... immediately seize the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\u201d Section 61-8-402(4), MCA (2009) (emphasis added). \u00b610 The implied consent and license seizure provisions of \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (2009), are a civil administrative proceeding \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from a criminal charge of driving under the influence. <em>Matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>of the Suspension of the Driver\u2019s License of Blake, </em>220 Mont. 27, 31, 712 P.2d 1338, 1341 (1986). The statutory right of a driver to refuse to participate in the tests for alcohol is solely a \u201cmatter of grace bestowed by the Legislature\u201d and is not a matter of due process. <em>State v. Turbiville, </em>2003 MT 340, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 451, 81 P.3d 475. The right to refuse alcohol testing provided in the statutory implied consent procedure affords a driver greater protection from self-incrimination than that required by the Constitution, but the implied consent statute is not to be considered an exception to the general requirement for a search warrant. <em>Nichols v. Department of Justice, </em>2011 MT 33, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20, 359 Mont. 251, 248 P.3d 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b611 Minett relies upon the language in \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA (2009), that upon a driver\u2019s refusal to take a blood or breath test designated by the officer, the test \u201cmay not be given.\u201d He contends that because he refused the blood or breath tests requested by the officer, the statute categorically prohibited administration of those tests with or without a search warrant. In State <em>v. Beanblossom, </em>2002 MT 351, \u00b6\u00b6 15-17, 313 Mont. 394, 61 P.3d 165 the defendant made a similar argument on appeal \u2014 that because he had consented to giving a breath test the officer was required to give the breath test under the terms of the implied consent statute. He asserted that because the test was not given the charges against him should have been dismissed. This Corut held that the statutes do not provide the exclusive method of proving intoxication. Administration of blood or breath tests as a matter of implied consent is not \u201ca precondition to prosecution for DUI. The officer can, in his or her discretion, rely on other indicia of intoxication.\u201d <em>Beanblossom, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b612  This Court construes a statute to determine what in terms or substance is contained in it, and not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Sections 1-2-101 and -102 MCA; State <em>v. Incashola, </em>1998 MT 184, \u00b6 11, 289 Mont. 399, 961 P.2d 745; <em>Friends of the Wild Swan v. DNRC, </em>2005 MT 351, \u00b6 13,330 Mont. 186, 127 P.3d 394. Applying this rule to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (2009), that statute prohibits a forced search of a driver\u2019s blood after the driver refuses to participate. <em>State v. Stueck, </em>280 Mont. 38, 43, 929 P.2d 829, 833 (1996). However, there is nothing in the statute that prohibits an officer from obtaining a search warrant for blood alcohol testing. The statutory prohibition that the test must not be given after the driver refuses only prohibits forced warrantless collection of a blood sample. \u00b613 The dissent correctly notes that we recently stated in another case that under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (2009), the State was precluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>applying for a search warrant after a person refused a test designated by the officer. <em>State v. Giacomini, </em>2014 MT 93, \u00b6 10, 374 Mont. 412, 327 P.3d 1054. That case, however, did not arise under the 2009 version of the statute, and the issues on appeal were whether there was probable cause for the warrant and whether the blood test violated the defendant\u2019s right to privacy. The reference in <em>Giacomini </em>to the 2009 version of \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, was therefore dicta and is not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b614 When Minett refused to provide a blood sample, Officer Tymofichuk did not pursue implied consent as a means to obtain evidence of a crime, but rather sought and obtained a search warrant. Either method \u2014 implied consent under the statute or obtaining a search warrant \u2014 can be an effective means to execute a constitutionally-permissible search. A lawful search may proceed after consent or under a warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b615 Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution provides th\u00e1t the \u201cpeople shall be secure in their persons, papers, homes, and effects from unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>State v. </em>$129.970.00, 2007 MT 148, \u00b6 26, 337 Mont. 475,161 P.3d 816. The primary requirement and procedure for insuring security from unreasonable searches is that they be conducted pursuant to a warrant or pursuant to narrow exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Pipkin, </em>1998 MT 143, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 289 Mont. 240, 961 P.2d 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b616 There is a public policy to encourage the use of warrants. <em>Pipkin, </em>\u00b6 13. In Montana the law has a strong preference for search warrants and the policy of this state is to \u201cencourage law enforcement officers to seek prior judicial approval before conducting searches and to conduct those searches pursuant to warrant.\u201d <em>State v. West, </em>1998 MT 282, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, 291 Mont. 435, 968 P. 2d 289. Officer Tymofichuk\u2019s action in obtaining a warrant for the blood test was not prohibited by the statute and was entirely consistent with Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b617  Minett does not contest the validity of the warrant. When the police applied for and obtained a warrant the situation no longer fell under the implied consent statute. This is not an implied consent case and the prohibition of \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA (2009), does not apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Officer Tymofichuk acted in accordance with the principles of Montana law in obtaining a search warrant for Minett\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b618 The District Court\u2019s denial of Minett\u2019s motion to suppress and his convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-5\">JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> Other jurisdictions have reached the same conclusion. In <em>State v. Stone, </em>229 W.Va. 271, 728 S.E.2d 155 (2012), the West Virginia Court of Appeals applied a similar implied consent statute under similar facts. The West Virginia Court determined that a blood sample in a DUI case could be obtained by the consent of the suspect, or pursuant to a search warrant if the driver refuses to participate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b293-6\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AXe\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b619 I dissent. I would conclude that the District Court erred in denying Minett\u2019s motion to suppress his blood test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b620 Minett\u2019s violation occurred on March 27, 2011. As the Court indicates, the 2009 version of the law with respect to blood or breath tests for alcohol was in effect. Opinion, \u00b6 9. Section 61-8-402(4), MCA (2009), provided that \u201c[i]f an arrested person refuses to submit to one or more tests requested and designated by the officer as provided in subsection (2), the refused test or tests may not be given, but the officer shall ... immediately seize the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\u201d The 2009 version of the law contained only one exception to this provision. Section 61-8-402(10), MCA (2009), provided: \u201cThis section does not apply to blood and breath tests, samples, and analyses used for purposes of medical treatment or care of an injured motorist <em>or related to a lawful seizure for a suspected violation of an offense not in this part\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Here, as the Court indicates, the search warrant was issued based upon an affidavit of probable cause to believe that Minett was driving under the influence of alcohol. Opinion, \u00b6 5. As Title 61, chapter 8, part 4, MCA (2009), specifically addresses \u201cDriving Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs,\u201d the search warrant was thus issued for a suspected violation of an offense contained <em>in this part, </em>rendering the subsection (10) exception inapplicable. Notably, \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (2009), contains not a single reference to a search warrant. \u00b621 The foregoing statute underwent significant revision in 2011. A provision was added that permitted an officer to apply for a search warrant to collect a sample of a person\u2019s blood for testing if the person refused to provide a breath, blood, or urine sample and previously refused the same test in a prior investigation, or has a prior conviction or pending offense for related violations in this or another jurisdiction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA (2013). Moreover, \u00a7 61-8-402(11), MCA (2013), now reads as follows: \u201cThis section does not apply to tests, samples, and analyses of blood or breath used for purposes of medical treatment or care of an injured motorist, related to a lawful seizure for a suspected violation of an offense not in this part, <em>or performed pursuant to a search warrant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\u00b622 As noted by Minett on appeal, the 2011 Legislature amended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>foregoing statute out of concern that a \u201cloophole\u201d existed under subsection (4) of the statute, precluding the issuance of blood draw search warrants for suspected DUIs, because once tests were refused, \u201cthe refused test or tests may not be given.\u201d Section 61-8-402(4), MCA (2009); <em>Hearing on S.B. 42 Before the Mont. Sen. Jud. </em>Comm., 62nd Leg., Reg. Sess. 00:43:37-01:22:19 (Jan. 20,2011); <em>Hearing on S.B. 42 Before the Mont. House Jud. Comm., </em>62nd Leg., Reg. Sess. 00:58:22-01:24:53 (Mar. 17, 2011). \u201cThe legislature does not perform useless acts.\u201d <em>Kish v. Mont. State Prison, </em>161 Mont. 297, 301, 505 P.2d 891, 893 (1973). Because the 2009 version of \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, contained a categorical statement that any refused tests could not be given \u2014 and made no exception for search warrants \u2014 the Legislature logically and necessarily closed this loophole in the 2011 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b623 The Court reasons that there is nothing in the 2009 version of the statute prohibiting an officer from obtaining a search warrant for blood-alcohol testing. I respectfully disagree. The statute provides that if a person has refused to submit to the tests requested by the officer, \u201cthe refused test or tests may not be given.\u201d Section 61-8-402(4), MCA (2009). There is no exception for a warrant. In fact, we acknowledged this point just a few short months ago in <em>State v. Giacomini, </em>2014 MT 93, 374 Mont. 412, 327 P.3d 1054, in which we stated: \u201cPrior to 2011, this statute did not permit law enforcement to apply for a search warrant in DUX cases if an arrested person refused to submit to BAC testing.\u201d <em>Giacomini, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b624 It is not the province of this Court to insert into a statute language that has been omitted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6 32, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174. Because the 2009 version of the statute categorically precluded the refused tests from being given, without any exception for a search warrant, I would conclude that the District Court erred in denying Minett\u2019s motion to suppress. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
