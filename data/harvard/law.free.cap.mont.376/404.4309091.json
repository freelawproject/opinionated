Avery challenges the decision of the Sentence Review Division (Division), increasing his sentence in Cause No. DC 11-496.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u00b62 Avery raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the Division err by denying Avery\u2019s request to withdraw his application for sentence review after the hearing had concluded?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did Avery receive ineffective assistance of counsel before the Division in violation of Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">\u00b65 On May 8,2012, Avery pled guilty and was convicted of one count of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent in the Fourth Judicial District Court for the County of Missoula. The plea agreement called for the State and Avery to make a joint recommendation for a 30 year sentence to the Montana Department of Corrections, with 25 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">\u00b66 At the sentencing hearing, the District Cotut expressed disagreement with the jointly recommended sentence and explained that it intended to impose a stricter sentence. Defense counsel inquired if the court \u201cmight be more comfortable with a 30-year sentence, with 10 of those years suspended.\u201d The court stated it would accept that sentence if Avery agreed to it. After defense counsel and Avery conferred, Avery indicated he would accept the suggested sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The court, despite indicating it intended to impose the suggested sentence, actually imposed a lesser sentence. The court orally pronounced a sentence of 30 years in the Montana State Prison, with 20 years suspended. The written judgment imposed the same sentence. \u00b67 Avery thereafter submitted an application to the Division for sentence review. The written application materials explained the possible consequences of proceeding with sentence review, including an express warning that his sentence could be increased by the Division. \u00b68 On August 1, 2013, the Division met to conduct a hearing on Avery\u2019s application. Avery appeared and was represented by counsel. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Division warned Avery of the possible consequences, including the possibility that his sentence could be increased. Avery indicated his desire to proceed with the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b69 During the hearing, Avery\u2019s counsel advocated for a more onerous sentence than the District Court had imposed. Counsel urged the Division to impose a sentence of 30 years, with just 10 years suspended. After the hearing had concluded,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Avery\u2019s counsel requested that the Division reconvene, which it did. At that point, counsel asked that Avery be permitted to withdraw his application, leaving his original sentence of 30 years, with 20 years suspended, \u201cas is.\u201d After consideration, the Division declined Avery\u2019s request to withdraw his application. The Division ultimately entered an order increasing Avery\u2019s sentence to 30 years in the Montana State Prison, with 10 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b610 On October 30, 2013, the District Court resentenced Avery and amended the previous judgment. In accordance with the Division\u2019s decision, the District Court resentenced Avery to 30 years in the Montana State Prison, with 10 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b611 On January 6, 2014, Avery, self-represented, filed a petition for habeas corpus with this Court seeking relief from the Division\u2019s decision. We issued an order deeming Avery\u2019s petition to be one for extraordinary relief. We ordered that counsel be appointed for Avery through the Office of Appellate Defender, that an amended petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>and supporting memorandum be filed, followed by the filing of responses by the respondents. Colin M. Stephens was appointed to represent Avery, and he filed an amended petition and memorandum. Responses were filed by the State of Montana and the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b612 The proper basis by which this Court may review a challenge to a decision of the Sentence Review Division is through a petition for extraordinary relief. <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 12, 288 Mont. 391, 958 P.2d 670. \u201cBecause the Sentence Review Division functions as an arm of this Court, this Court has the supervisory authority to ensure that it complies with statutes and rules governing its operations as well as the Montana Constitution and the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing \u00a7 46-18-901(1), MCA; Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b613 <em>1. Did the Division err by denying Avery\u2019s request to withdraw his application for sentence review after the hearing had concluded?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u00b614 This Court has not previously addressed whether a defendant is entitled to withdraw his application for review of his sentence after the Division has conducted a hearing on the application. The Division is a creature of statute and is governed by the scheme set forth in Title 46, chapter 18, part 9, MCA. The Division is an arm of the Montana Supreme Court and is tasked with providing appellate review of legal sentences. <em>State ex rel. Holt v. Dist. Ct., </em>2000 MT 142, \u00b6 6, 300 Mont. 35, 3 P.3d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">\u00b615 There are two relevant statutes that address a defendant\u2019s application for sentence review: \u00a7 46-18-903 and \u00a7 46-18-904, MCA. Section 46-18-903(1), MCA, affords a defendant the discretion to institute sentence review, providing \u201c[a] person sentenced to a term of 1 year or more ... <em>may </em>within 60 days from the date the sentence was imposed... file... an application for review of the sentence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section46-18-904, MCA, states in pertinent part that \u201c[i]n each case in which an application for review is filed in accordance with 46-18-903, the review division: (a) (i) <em>shall </em>review the judgment....\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statutes do not directly address to what extent a defendant maintains discretion to withdraw from the process after filing the application in accordance with \u00a7 46-18-903, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">\u00b616 Avery argues that a defendant has the ability to \u201cwithdraw from the process at any time before the [Division] renders a final decision.\u201d Avery offers that because the statutory scheme does not expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201cforbid the withdrawal of an applicant\u2019s request\u201d and \u201c[bjecause the initiation of sentence review is solely within the discretion of an applicant, so too should the withdrawal from the process.\u201d Avery supports his argument by reasoning that sentence review is designed primarily for the benefit of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b617 Acknowledging that the statutory scheme does not expressly prohibit an applicant from withdrawing his application, the Division argues that it does not expressly permit withdrawal either. The Division reasons that permitting an applicant to withdraw after a hearing has concluded would give the applicant \u201ca second bite of the apple merely because he became dissatisfied with the course and conduct of his review hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b618 This Court construes statutes by reading and interpreting them \u201cas a whole, \u2018without isolating specific terms from the context in which they are used by the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 25, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819 (quoting <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003). \u201cStatutory construction is a holistic endeavor and must account for the statute\u2019s text, language, structure and object.\u201d <em>Triplett, </em>\u00b6 25 (quotations omitted). We also \u201cread and construe each statute as a whole so as to avoid an absurd result and to give effect to the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Triplett, </em>\u00b6 25 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b619 Although Avery correctly states that a purpose of the Division is to protect the interests of the defendant, the Division also exists to protect the interests of the public. The Legislature created the Division \u201cto serve essentially as a safety net for our indiscriminate sentencing system, providing additional protection for both the public and for the individual defendant.\u201d <em>Driver v. Sentence Review Division, </em>2010 MT 43, \u00b6 18,355 Mont. 273, 227 P.3d 1018. The Legislature authorized the Division to not only reduce or affirm a defendant\u2019s sentence, but also to increase the sentence originally imposed, if appropriate. <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing \u00a7 46-18-904(1), MCA). Likewise, the rules promulgated by the Division indicate it is \u201cto ensure that the interest of the public and the defendant are adequately addressed by the sentence.\u201d Rule 16, Mont. Sent. Rev. Div.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b620 Avery\u2019s interpretation of the statutes could well lead to the absurd result, as argued by the Division, of promoting the practice of applicants proceeding to a hearing in an effort to gauge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>receptiveness of the Division, only to withdraw the application post-hearing. The public would bear the brunt of the costs associated with these fruitless hearings, including the cost of legal representation of indigent applicants, who are entitled to counsel at sentence review hearings. <em>See Ranta, </em>\u00b6 32. Such a result is inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s creation of a system. designed to protect both the defendant and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b621 The Division\u2019s interpretation also ensures the interests of a defendant are protected. Defendants retain the discretion of whether to seek review of their sentences. Those believing their sentences are unjust have the choice to seek review, and are apprised of the risks in doing so by an explanation of the possible consequences of the review process. Here, Aveiy was twice advised of the consequences of proceeding to a hearing before the Division, first, by the express waiver he signed on the application, conspicuously warning him that his sentence could be increased by applying for sentence review;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, second, by the Division\u2019s advisory prior to the commencement of the hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Avery thereafter consented to the proceeding and cannot now be heard to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b622  The Division\u2019s statutory construction properly advances the purposes of the statutory scheme and appropriately balances the interests of the public and the defendant. We hold the Division properly denied Avery\u2019s request to withdraw his application for sentence review after the hearing had concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b623 <em>2. Did Avery receive ineffective assistance of counsel before the Division in violation of Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b624 Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantees a criminal defendant the right to counsel in criminal proceedings. This right attaches at every critical stage of the proceedings against the defendant. <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 17. \u201c[Sjentence review is a critical stage of the proceedings against a defendant.\u201d <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 22. Accordingly, a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to counsel at sentence review. <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u00b625 It is \u201cself-evident that the right to counsel carries with it a concomitant requirement that such counsel be effective.\u201d <em>In re A.S., </em>2004 MT 62, \u00b6 20, 320 Mont. 268, 87 P.3d 408. Absent effective assistance of counsel, the right to counsel is \u201cnothing more than a procedural <em>formality.\u201dIn reA.S., </em>\u00b6 20. Therefore, a criminal defendant has the right to effective assistance of counsel at a sentence review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b626 We apply the two-prong test announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), for deciding ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 20, 301 Mont. 135, 10 P.3d 49. <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-prong test requires that the defendant show: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">A. Deficient Performance</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b627 Under the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the Court must determine the reasonableness of counsels challenged conduct. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 16, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. The Court must examine \u201cwhether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 16 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\u00b628 Avery alleges he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel advocated for a <em>more onerous sentence </em>than was originally imposed by the District Court. At the commencement of the sentence review hearing, Aveiy\u2019s counsel stated, \u201c[w]e think, as a matter of equity, this sentence should be changed to what the court said it would initially do, which is 30 years to Montana State Prison, with 10 suspended.\u201d Avery\u2019s counsel repeated his argument during the hearing, stating, \u201cwe certainly believe that he\u2019s entitled to what [the district court] initially said he would give him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">\u00b629  Of course, the sentence the District Court had originally imposed upon Avery was 30 years, with 20 years suspended, not 10 years suspended. Counsel was essentially arguing for an additional 10 years of prison time for Avery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While there may have been reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>some confusion in the history of the case, there is no plausible justification for counsel's conduct under these circumstances. Counsel\u2019s statements contravened the purpose of Avery\u2019s application, for which he had accepted the risk involved in proceeding before the Division. Counsel\u2019s statements cannot be considered a trial strategy or tactical decision under the circumstances. We conclude that counsel\u2019s conduct was outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance and the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">B. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b630 The second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires the defendant \u201cdemonstrate the existence of a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional conduct, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 53, 315 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 641. The prejudice inquiry focuses on whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance rendered the proceeding fundamentally unfair. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b631  Not only did counsel fail to provide meaningful representation, but his statements actually undermined Avery\u2019s interest. Prior to counsel\u2019s representation, Avery approached the Division with a presumption that his sentence, as imposed, was correct. \u201cThe sentence imposed by the district court is presumed correct.\u201d Section 46-18-904(3), MCA <em>(see also </em>Rule 17, Mont. Sent. Rev. Div., stating \u201c[T]he sentence will not be... increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate ... .\u201d). Counsel\u2019s representation thus placed Avery in a worse position than if he had not been represented by counsel at all. Further, had counsel correctly understood Avery\u2019s sentence, he could have better advised Avery about the risks and benefits of proceeding before the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u00b632  Consequently, we conclude that counsel's deficient performance rendered the proceeding fundamentally unfair, and that Avery has satisfied both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Accordingly, we hold Avery was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\u00b633 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">\u00b634 1. The judgment of the Sentence Review Division in Cause No. DC 11-496, regarding Russell Scott Avery is VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">\u00b635 2. The amended judgment of the District Court in the above-referenced cause number regarding Russell Scott Avery, entered in response to the Sentence Review Division\u2019s order, is VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u00b636 3. This matter is remanded to the District Court with instructions to REINSTATE the sentence in the above-referenced cause number as originally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">DATED tMs 30th day of September, 2014.</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-6\">/S/JIM RICE</judges>\n<judges id=\"b440-7\">/s/ mike McGrath</judges>\n<judges id=\"ANl\">/S/ PATRICIA COTTER</judges>\n<judges id=\"AhL\">/s/ laurie McKinnon</judges>\n<judges id=\"AmB\">/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\"> Avery argues the hearing had not actually concluded at the time he asked to withdraw his application. However, the transcripts of the hearing clearly indicate the hearing had ended. Prior to Avery\u2019s request, the Division Chairman stated, \u201cAll right. If there is nothing further then. I will conclude our hearing. I appreciate your time here. The Sentence Review Division will deliberate on your case and provide you a written decision as soon as we can accomplish that. Hopefully within a few weeks. That will close our hearing and you can be excused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\"> The State\u2019s response addressed the propriety of Avery\u2019s request for extraordinary relief in this proceeding, but did not address the merits of Avery\u2019s arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\"> \u201cI consent and agree that <em>by </em>making this application for review, my sentence may be increased, decreased, affirmed without change, or otherwise modified, and there is no appeal from the decision herein to be made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\"> \u201cThe Division has the authority to review your sentence, to increase it if necessary, to reduce it if necessary, or leave it the same....

There is no question that this is the legally imposed sentence. It is possible that Avery had applied for sentence review in an attempt to obtain the sentence he had originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>bargained for in the plea agreement, 30 years with 25 suspended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
