We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u00b63 Was <em>Chafee\u2019s counsel ineffective when he failed to offer a \u201cmere presence\u201d jury instruction and failed to object to evidence of other bad acts?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">\u00b64 <em>Is Chafee entitled to a new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">\u00b65 <em>Is Chafee entitled to a new trial based upon the cumulative error doctrine?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">\u00b66 On the morning of October 7, 2011, Missoula County law enforcement officers responded to a report of a burning vehicle on Pattee Canyon Drive. The owners of the vehicle called 9-1-1 after approaching their unattended vehicle, noticing it was on fire, and observing a green SUV quickly drive away. Approximately an hour later, officers stopped a vehicle occupied by Chafee and Antonio Robinson. Chafee sat in the driver\u2019s seat. Robinson and Chafee were questioned by the officers and were eventually arrested. On October 25,2011, the State charged Chafee by information with accountability for arson, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-103, and -2-302, MCA, and accountability for theft, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-301(8) and -2-302, MCA. Robinson was charged with arson and theft. He subsequently pleaded guilty and was sentenced for those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-15\">\u00b67 Prior to trial, the State submitted proposed jury instructions. Defense counsel offered no jury instructions. Trial commenced on January 2, 2013, and went into the next day. Robinson testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Chafee pulled over, at his request, near the victims\u2019 vehicle. According to Robinson, he then exited Chafee\u2019s vehicle and tried to gain entry to the other vehicle. Because the doors were locked, Robinson smashed a window with a rock. He spent 10-15 minutes unloading the car\u2019s contents and loading them into Chafee\u2019s vehicle. He then lit the car on fire and told Chafee to drive. Robinson testified that his actions were impulsive, and that Chafee did not participate in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b68 Jeffrey Russell, a witness for the State, testified that Chafee had described the crimes to him. According to Russell, Chafee stated that she and Robinson had been drinking and broke into the vehicle because \u201cit was just something to do.\u201d Russell testified that Chafee fit the vehicle on fire with Coleman fuel or lighter fluid. Chafee\u2019s counsel suggested during cross-examination that Russell was mad at Chafee for turning him in at work for stealing food and for unauthorized use of a computer, which resulted in Russell being fired, and that he was \u201cwilling to lie here to get her thrown in jail.\u201d During the State\u2019s redirect, Russell testified that Chafee was also involved in the workplace theft. The prosecutor later referenced Chafee\u2019s alleged role in the \u201cworkplace theft\u201d during his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b69 In his closing, the prosecutor asked jurors \u201cto get in touch with yourself, with your own center, your own soul, your own heart, and ask yourself what is the truth?\u201d After telling jurors they couldn\u2019t \u201cget in touch with... the essence of what you know is right and what is true\u201d and then acquit Chafee, defense counsel objected. The District Court overruled the objection, calling the comments \u201cargument.\u201d The prosecutor ended by stating: \u201cI\u2019m asking you to look at everything and to use those attributes that the defense doesn\u2019t want you to consider, like common sense, like what you believe is most true. And you will not be able to do that and conclude that this defendant was not involved in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b610 On January 3, 2013, the jury found Chafee guilty of both counts. The District Court sentenced Chafee to two concurrent ten-year commitments with the Department of Corrections, each with eight years suspended. Chafee timely appealed her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b611 \u201cOnly record-based ineffective assistance of counsel claims are considered on direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Ugalde, </em>2013 MT 308, \u00b6 28,372 Mont. 234, 311 P.3d 772 (citations omitted). \u201cTo the extent such claims are reviewable, they present mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 28 (citations and internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b612 We consider closing argument statements in the context of the entire argument and review a district court\u2019s rulings on objections to closing argument content for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6 40, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174 (citations omitted). A defendant must make a timely objection to closing argument statements or the objection is deemed to be waived. <em>Cooksey, </em>\u00b6 40 (citation omitted). We may, however, review such an issue under the plain error doctrine \u201cin those situations that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights when failing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Walton, </em>2014 MT 41, \u00b6 10, 374 Mont. 38, 318 P.3d 1024 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Plain error review is discretionary, and we apply it on a case-by-case basis. <em>Walton, </em>\u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u00b613 1. Was <em>Chafee\u2019s counsel ineffective when he failed to offer a \u201cmere presence\u201d jury instruction and failed to object to evidence of other bad acts?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u00b614 The defense theory offered by Chafee at trial was that, though she had been present when Robinson committed the crimes, she had remained in the vehicle and had not participated in any way. In other words, she was \u201cmerely present,\u201d and did not commit any crime. Defense counsel argued in his closing argument that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">there is absolutely no evidence that Chelsea did anything while Antonio Robinson was rifling through the car and putting the stuff into her car. You will not find in the instructions anything that says that a person who\u2019s sitting there, has any duty to run away, has any duty to drive away, has any duty to do anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">He stressed that \u201c[the law] requires that she plan or agree with Mr. Robinson to commit this offense, and that she\u2019s actually aiding him. She didn\u2019t do anything to aid him. She sat there. There\u2019s no requirement under the law that she affirmatively do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\u00b615 Though defense counsel argued that mere presence was insufficient to establish that Chafee was involved in the crimes, he failed to offer the following standard jury instruction, approved by this Court as one of the instructions that correctly and adequately instructs the jury on the law of accountability, <em>State v. Kills on Top, </em>243 Mont. 56, 92, 793 P.2d 1273, 1298 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Mere presence at the scene of the crime and knowledge that a crime is being committed are not sufficient to establish that the defendant was involved in the crime. To be responsible, you must find beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was a participant and not merely a knowing spectator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b616 On appeal, Chafee argues that her counsel\u2019s failure to offer a \u201cmere presence\u201d jury instruction was not based on reasonable or sound professional judgment, and that it prejudiced her right to a fair trial. The State counters that defense Counsel\u2019s failure to request the instruction \u201cwas not deficient performance, because the evidence demonstrated Chafee\u2019s direct involvement and positive actions to aid, abet, promote, and facilitate Robinson\u2019s criminal acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b6 17 A defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmZ\">Before reaching the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a direct appeal, we must first determine whether the allegations are properly before the Court on appeal or whether the claim should be raised in a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\"><em>Ugatde, </em>\u00b6 65 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We will not address a claim on appeal if it relates to matters outside of the record, <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 65 (citation omitted), unless it is unnecessary in the first instance to ask \u201cwhy\u201d counsel did or did not perform as alleged and seek an answer by reference to the record. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095 (citation omitted). For example, it is unnecessary to ask \u201cwhy\u201d counsel performed as he did when there is \u201cno plausible justification\u201d for defense counsel\u2019s action or inaction. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b618  As noted, defense counsel argued to the jury that Chafee\u2019s mere presence at the scene was insufficient to support a conviction; however, he failed to offer the jury instruction that would have informed the jury that his argument was legally correct. The prosecutor was able to capitalize on this omission by arguing in closing for a guilty verdict because \u201c[ejven if she never got out of the vehicle, she wasn\u2019t just sitting there. She sat there while she let Antonio Robinson use her vehicle to load up this stolen stuff.\u201d He also told the jury that when people get into a mess, the law \u201cimposes an obligation on them to do something to -undo what they had done.\u201d These arguments could havebeen directly refuted had defense counsel offered the omitted instruction. Under these circumstances, there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>plausible justification for the failure of defense counsel to offer the \u201cmere presence\u201d jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b619 We analyze Chafee\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668,104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 66. A defendant must prove both: \u201c(1) that counsel's performance was deficient; and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 66 (citation omitted). Performance falling below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances is deficient performance. <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 75 (citation omitted). We \u201cindulgle] a strong presumption that counsel's performance falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 75 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201cthe failure to offer [a] potentially beneficial instruction, when that failure is not part of counsel\u2019s trial strategy, is an error so serious that it falls outside the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Garrett v. State, </em>2005 MT 197, \u00b6 24, 328 Mont. 165, 119 P.3d 55 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b620  The law is well established that \u201cmere presence at the scene of a crime is not enough to establish accountability, [although] the accused need not take an active part in any overt criminal acts to be adjudged criminally hable for the acts.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>231 Mont. 497, 511,757 P.2d 1275,1284 (1988) (quoting State <em>v. Bradford, </em>210 Mont. 130, 142, 683 P.2d 924, 930 (1984)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">Additionally, while mere presence and the failure to disapprove or oppose another\u2019s commission of an offense are insufficient to sustain an accountability charge, these factors maybe considered by a jray, along with other circumstances, which may indicate whether the accused in some way aided or abetted the principal in the commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\"><em>State v. Spang, </em>2002 MT 120, \u00b6 43, 310 Mont. 52, 48 P.3d 727 (overruled in part on other grounds) (citation omitted). We are not in this case reviewing the sufficiency of evidence to sustain Chafee\u2019s conviction, but the failure of counsel to offer an instruction that would allow the jury to consider \u201cthese factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u00b621 We conclude that defense counsel\u2019s failure to offer this \u201cpotentially beneficial instruction\u201d constituted deficient performance under the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>because there was no tactical reason for his failure to submit a \u201cmere presence\u201d instruction when his theory of the case was that mere presence at the scene was insufficient to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>conviction. We likewise conclude that counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>But see Garrett, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24, 26 (citations omitted); <em>see Kougl, </em>\u00b6 26 (citation omitted) (\u201c[W]hat the judge tells the jury necessarily carries the force of law, while what the adversarial counsel tells the jury does not,\u201d and closing arguments do not substitute for properjury instructions.).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b622  The Dissent argues that there was sufficient evidence presented to call into question whether or not a \u201cmere presence\u201d instruction would have been appropriate. Dissent, \u00b6 36. This argument presumes that counsel may have considered the appropriateness of the instruction and decided against offering it in light of the evidence presented. The problem with this argument is that it is belied by the manner in which defense counsel presented Chafee\u2019s defense. As indicated in \u00b6 14, counsel argued that his client was simply sitting there while Robinson committed his offense, and that she did not do anything to aid in the commission of the crime. Counsel further told the jury: \u201cThere\u2019s no requirement under the law that she affirmatively do anything.\u201d Chafee\u2019s attorney urged the jury to acquit her on this basis. Because the mainstay of the defense was that Chafee\u2019s presence at the scene was not sufficient to convict, there can be no plausible reason for failing to submit the very jury instruction that would have lent the force of law to counsel\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b623 We now address whether Chafee has established sufficient prejudice under the second prong of <em>Strickland. </em>\u201cSufficient prejudice ... requires that the defendant demonstrate that a reasonable possibility exists that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 70 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A defendant must undermine confidence in the outcome but is not required to demonstrate that she would have been acquitted. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 25 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b624 In its presentation of evidence and closing arguments, the State emphasized that Chafee was present \u00e1t the scene and did not take any action to prevent the crime or to report it to law enforcement. By reason of her counsel\u2019s inadequate performance, Chafee was deprived of the chance to have the jury conclude under well-settled law that she was not guilty of the crimes charged simply because she was present at the crime scene. Had trial counsel offered and argued the \u201cmere presence\u201d jury instruction, the result of this case may have been favorable to Chafee. Hence, prejudice is apparent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b625  Because we conclude that defense counsel's failure to offer the jury instruction warrants a new trial, we need not reach Chafee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>arguments that her counsel was ineffective when he failed to object to evidence of other bad acts and failed to object to the State\u2019s comments about Russell\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b626 <em>2. Is Chafee entitled to a new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b627 Though we are reversing this case on alternate grounds, we feel constrained to briefly address Chafee\u2019s argument that the prosecutor improperly told the jurors to base their decision on factors other than the law and evidence. The State argues that the comments did not constitute error because they were made in the context of discussing the evidence presented and its evaluation. We disagree. The prosecutor urged the jurors to rely upon their hearts, souls, centers, and essences in making their decision. However, the instructions direct the jury to decide the case on the basis of the evidence and the law. We measure prosecutorial misconduct by reference to established norms of professional conduct, <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 43 (citation omitted), and \u201c[argument urging the jury to decide the matter based upon factors other than those it is instructed to consider [by the court] is improper.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Calderon, </em>241 F.3d 765, 776 (9th Cir. 2000). We conclude that the cited statements by the prosecutor were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b628 <em>3. Is Chafee entitled to a new trial based upon cumulative error? </em>\u00b629 We decline to address the question of whether Chafee is entitled to a new trial pursuant to the cumulative error doctrine given our resolution of Issue One.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\u00b630 Based on the foregoing, we vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand this case for a new trial on the charges of accountability for theft and accountability for arson.</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-9\">JUSTICE WHEAT, SHEA and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b302-10\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AqB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">\u00b631 I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion in Issue 1 that the allegations of IAC are properly before this Court on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">\u00b632 \u201cThere is a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional conduct. ... \u2018The defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 48, 315 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 641 (quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2065 (1984) (internal quotation omitted)). Ordinarily, the record on appeal must adequately document why counsel acted, or failed to act, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>particular maimer in order for this Court to determine whether counsel\u2019s action falls below the reasonable standard for professional conduct. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 49. However, in rare cases it is unnecessary to ask \u201cwhy\u201d in the first instance. In such cases, \u201c[wjhat matters is that there could not be <em>any legitimate reason </em>for what counsel did.\u201d <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 15,323 Mont. 6,97 P.3d 1095 (emphasis added). When there is a plausible, but not necessarily actual, justification for counsel\u2019s action, the proper action for this Court is to dismiss the appeal without prejudice and allow the defendant to seek relief through a postconviction relief hearing. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b633 I am not convinced that this case satisfies the no \u201clegitimate reason\u201d exception for counsel\u2019s failure to request the \u201cmere presence\u201d instruction. Unlike our prior cases where we utilized this exception to review direct appeal claims of IAC for failure to offer a proposed jury instruction, Chafee cannot establish that she was entitled to a \u201cmere presence\u201d instruction. <em>See Kougl, </em>\u00b6 20 (failure to request an instruction to view accomplices\u2019 testimony with suspicion was clearly IAC because the witnesses were undisputedly accomplices and, pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, \u201cif the trial court had been asked to give a \u2018viewed with distrust\u2019 instruction to the jury, it would have had to honor the request\u201d); <em>State v.

We have denied direct appeal claims of IAC where we could not conclude that there was no \u201clegitimate reason\u201d for the failure of counsel to request a jury instruction. <em>See State v. Hubbel, </em>2001 MT 31, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 184, 20 P.3d 111, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, 317 Mont. 177, 75 P.3d 1268; <em>State v.

An \u201caccused[\u2019]s act of aiding or abetting under the accountability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>statute need not be criminal in nature; it need only promote or facilitate commission of the crime.\u201d <em>Lantis, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>see </em>\u00a7 45-2-302(3), MCA. While \u201cmere presence\u201d at the scene of the crime is not enough to impute liability, <em>see State v. Johnston, </em>267 Mont. 474, 885 P.2d 402 (1994) (defendant merely present when discovered in passenger seat of a vehicle, with no key, outside building that had been burglarized by another), \u201c[o]ne may become an accomplice by being present and joining in the criminal act, by aiding and abetting another in its commission ... but knowledge and voluntary actions are essential in order to impute guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Nordahl, </em>208 Mont. 513, 517, 679 P.2d 241, 243 (1984) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b636 I believe there was sufficient evidence presented to call into question whether or not a \u201cmere presence\u201d instruction would have been appropriate. The State argued and presented evidence that Chafee knowingly allowed Robinson to load stolen goods into her car repeatedly over the course of approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Once Robinson had finished retrieving items from the vehicle and setting it on fire, Chafee drove Robinson and the stolen goods away from the scene of the crime. Upon being questioned by police, Chafee lied to protect both herself and Robinson. Such evidence shows more than \u201cmere presence\u201d while a crime was committed. In response to this dissent, the Court relies on Chaffee\u2019s closing argument, but regardless of what Chaffee argued in closing, she was not entitled to a jury instruction that was not supported by the evidence, and her counsel could not be ineffective for failing to request an instruction to which Chaffee was not entitled. If anything, the Court should conclude that Chaffee was not prejudiced by the lack of an instruction, as counsel argued the point anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">137 There is ample reason here not to second guess counsel. I would dismiss the appeal, essentially affirming the judgment, without prejudice to Chaffee\u2019s right to seek postconviction relief on her IAC claims. As to Chafee\u2019s other claims of error on appeal, I would decline to exercise plain error review and affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-6\">JUSTICE McKINNON joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
