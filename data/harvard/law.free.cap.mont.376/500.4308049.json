The State of Montana appeals from the District Court\u2019s post-trial decision that the misdemeanor penalty provided by \u00a7 45-5-502(2)(a), MCA, is the maximum sentence that can be imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court\u2019s post-trial decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b63 In January 2012 the State charged Edward Ghostbear with one count of felony sexual intercourse without consent under \u00a7 45-5-503(4), MCA, and an alternative count of felony sexual assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. The victim in both counts was the 7-year-old daughter of Ghostbear\u2019s girlfriend. On October 30, 2012, the jury returned its verdict finding Ghostbear not guilty of sexual intercourse without consent and finding him guilty of felony sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u00b64 After the jury\u2019s verdict Ghostbear moved that the District Court sentence him to the misdemeanor penalty of a first conviction of sexual assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(2)(a), MCA. Ghostbear argued that the felony penalty in \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, was simply a penalty.enhancement for sexual assault that did not apply because the jury did not make a finding that the victim was younger than 16 and did not make a finding that Ghostbear was more than 3 years older under the provisions of \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA. The District Court agreed, concluding that <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466,120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000) required the jury to make a specific finding as to the ages of Ghostbear and the victim before the felony offense provided in \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, could apply. The District Court concluded that the State had not provided proof of the ages of Ghostbear and the victim, and that the jury had not made a factual finding as to the respective ages. The District Court concluded that Ghostbear could not be sentenced for felony sexual assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\u00b65 A district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is a conclusion of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>which we review for correctness. <em>Montana State Fund v. Simms, </em>2012 MT 22, \u00b6 15, 364 Mont. 14,270 P.3d 64; <em>Briese v. Mont. Pub. Emp. Ret. Bd., </em>2012 MT 192, \u00b6 11, 366 Mont. 148, 285 P.3d 550; <em>Olson v. Jude, </em>2003 MT 186, \u00b6 34, 316 Mont. 438, 73 P.3d 809. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Brimstone Mining, Inc. </em>a. <em>Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 236, 77 P.3d 175. A finding of fact may be clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record; if the district court misapprehended the evidence; or when our review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Brimstone, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b66 A person commits the offense of felony sexual assault by knowingly subjecting another person to \u201cany sexual contact without consent,\u201d and if the victim is less than 16 years old and the offender is 3 or more years older, or if the offender inflicts bodily injury. Section 45-5-502(1), (3), MCA. If the victim is less than 14 years old and the attacker is more than 3 years older, there can be no consent as a matter of law. Section 45-5-502(5)(a)(ii), MCA. An offender convicted of felony sexual assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, is subject to a term of not less than 4 years and up to life in the state prison, along with a fine up to $50,000. Section 45-5-502(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u00b67 In <em>Apprendi </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cother than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime <em>beyond the prescribed statutory maximum </em>must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2263-64 (emphasis added); <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 52, 336 Mont. 63,153 P.3d 601. Section 46-1-401, MCA, consistent with the holding in <em>Apprendi, </em>provides certain restrictions on the sentencing court before a penalty enhancement may be imposed. While the parties agree on appeal that \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, is a sentence enhancement provision covered by \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, and the rule in <em>Apprendi, </em>we conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\u00b68 A \u201csentence enhancement\u201d is a fact that increases the penalty for a crime \u201cbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2263-64. It is a fact not included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense that allows the judge to increase the penalty provided by statute. Section 46-1-401(3), MCA. There was no sentencing enhancement for the District Court to apply or consider in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u00b69 The State charged Ghostbear with the crime of felony sexual assault, specifically under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, exposing him to the felony penalty prescribed by that statute. There is no other statutory provision that increases the possible penalty for a conviction under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. In this case there is no fact that the sentencing court can use to increase the penalty for a conviction under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, that is not in the elements of the offense set out in that statute. There was no sentence enhancement as that term is used in <em>Apprendi </em>or in \u00a7 46-1-401(3), MCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b610 The District Court properly instructed the jury. On appeal we consider the instructions as a whole to determine whether a district court fully and fairly instructed the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. Scarborough, </em>2000 MT 301, \u00b6 47, 302 Mont. 350, 14 P.3d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u00b611 The District Court instructed the jury that Ghostbear was presumed innocent and that the presumption could not be overcome unless the jury was convinced from all the evidence that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The District Court instructed that the verdict must be unanimous, and that the jury must unanimously agree upon the commission of the same specific act constituting the crime before convicting Ghostbear. The District Court instructed the jury that a statement made by Ghostbear outside the trial could be considered an admission or confession, and that an admission is a statement of fact pertinent to the issue and tending to prove guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u00b612 Further, the District Court instructed the jury on the elements of the crime of sexual assault: that the offense requires proof that the victim was subjected to sexual contact; that the victim did not consent; and that Ghostbear acted knowingly. The District Court instructed the jury in the words of \u00a7 45-5-502(5)(a)(ii), MCA, that \"consent is ineffective if the victim is 14 years of age or younger and the defendant is 3 or more years older than the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u00b613 While Ghostbear contends and the District Court determined that there was no evidence of his age and the age of the victim, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>shows otherwise. The State correctly notes that during trial the District Court admitted into evidence a recording and a transcript of an interview of Ghostbear by a law enforcement officer. Early in that interview Ghostbear stated that his date of birth was in 1977, making him 34 years old at the time of the offense. In addition, in that same interview Ghostbear acknowledged that the victim was just turning age 8, making her age 7 at the time of the alleged offense. The victim also testified that she was age 8. The jury heard this evidence and was able to corroborate the respective ages of Ghostbear and the victim because each of them testified at trial. The jurors were entitled to infer from what they observed that the ages of Ghostbear and the victim were as he acknowledged them to be in the admitted interview. The jurors were instructed that they could consider \u201cthe appearance of the witnesses on the stand.\u201d The jurors saw, and therefore could consider, the appearance of Ghostbear as a mature man and the victim as a child. Ghostbear does not point to any contrary evidence of age in the record nor does he argue that there was any conceivable way that the juiy could fail to conclude that the victim was under the age of 16 and that Ghostbear was more than 3 years older. Ghostbear does not contend that the respective ages were in any way contested during the trial. \u00b614 Having been given these and other instructions, the jury returned a verdict that Ghostbear was guilty of \u201cthe charge of Sexual Assault, a Felony.\u201d Under the instructions as given, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict required the jury to find the essential elements of sexual assault as charged in this case. Under the instructions as given, the jury could not have returned the conviction without determining as a matter of fact that the victim was under the age of 14 and that Ghostbear was more than 3 years older. By following the instructions and by returning a guilty verdict the jury necessarily found as facts the respective ages of Ghostbear and the victim. This constitutes felony sexual assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. The jury\u2019s verdict reflects a finding of the age disparity required by \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b615 The State proved the elements of the crime of felony sexual assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA; the District Court properly instructed the jury on the burden of proof and the elements of the crime; the jury returned its verdict that Ghostbear was guilty of \u201cSexual Assault, a Felony.\u201d The prescribed range of punishment is set out in the statute, and there is no enhancement factor. It is proper forjudges to be given sentencing discretion while imposing a sentence within the range imposed by the statute. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 481, 120 S. Ct. at 2358.</p>\n<p id=\"AcR\">\u00b616  The age evidence was admitted by Ghostbear and the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>was <em>not </em>contested. Clearly there was no reasonable doubt that the young victim was under the age of 16 and that Ghostbear was more than 3 years older as required for a conviction of felony sexual assault. In conclusion, this case was a crime properly charged, the elements of the charge were specified by statute and were proven. The jury was properly instructed, and a verdict was properly rendered. The District</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Court may therefore proceed to sentencing under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. \u00b617 The District Court is reversed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b533-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\"> Ghostbear moved to dismiss the appeal contending that there was no authority for the State to appeal prior to imposition of the sentence. After briefing from the parties, this Court\u2019s order of February 26, 2013, denied the motion to dismiss, concluding that the State could appeal pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-103(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> In State v. <em>Baker, </em>2000 MT 235, 301 Mont. 323, 8 P.3d 817, cited in the concurring opinion, this Court held that the age differential in \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, is a punishment enhancement for sexual assault \u201cotherwise provided in \u00a7 45-5-502(2), MCA.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6 30. The important distinction between the present case and <em>Baker </em>is that Baker was charged with a violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, while Ghostbear was specifically charged with a violation of \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, a felony. Because Ghostbear was charged with the specific felony under subsection (3), the State was required to prove the age disparity with the victim as an element of the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b533-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A5l\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">\u00b618 \u00cd agree with the Court that the requirements of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), were satisfied at Ghostbear\u2019s trial. However, Ghostbear has raised an important question concerning the jury instructions, which the Court has not addressed. Given our reliance on the jury instructions in holding that there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation, I believe it is necessary to explain why Ghostbear\u2019s argument on this point fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">\u00b619 Additionally, I believe the Court has misconstrued the requirements of \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA. This statute provides greater protection of the rights to due process and trial by jury than does <em>Apprendi </em>by imposing a \u201cseparate finding\u201d requirement <em>that Apprendi </em>does not. Nevertheless, while I conclude that the statute was not satisfied at Ghostbear\u2019s trial, I also conclude that this error was harmless. I thus specially concur in the Court\u2019s decision to reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">\u00b620 In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490,120 S. Ct. at 2362-63. The Suprem\u00e9 Court subsequently explained that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 303, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 2537 (2004) (emphasis in original). In other words, \u201cthe relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303-04, 124 S. Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original). Thus, \u201c[w]hen a judge inflicts punishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts which the law makes essential to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>punishment, and the judge exceeds his proper authority.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 304, 124 S. Ct. at 2537 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This principle was later applied to mandatory m\u00ednimums: \u201cfacts that increase mandatory minimum sentences must be submitted to the jury\u201d as well. <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>133 S. Ct. 2151, 2160 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b621 Based on this constitutional rule, the Supreme Court has distinguished \u201celements\u201d of an offense from \u201csentencing factors\u201d or \u201csentence enhancements\u201d in the following manner. \u201c[A]ny facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed are elements of the <em>crime.\u201d Alleyne, </em>133 S. Ct. at 2160 (internal quotation marks omitted). Regardless of what a state legislature might call a particular fact \u2014 an element, a sentencing factor, an aggravating circumstance, or something else \u2014 if the finding of that fact exposes the defendant to a greater punishment, that fact is by definition an \u201celement\u201d for purposes of <em>Apprendi </em>and must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 494,120 S. Ct. at 2365; <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S. Ct. at 2155; <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 602, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 2439-40 (2002). As the Supreme Court expressed this concept in <em>Alleyne, </em>\u201c[w]hen a finding of fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to aggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part of a new offense and must be submitted to the jury.\u201d 133 S. Ct. at 2162.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b622 Penalty enhancements, in contrast, do not form a constituent part of a new offense. \u201cThe term [\u2018sentencing factor\u2019 or \u2018sentence enhancement\u2019] appropriately describes a circumstance, which may be either aggravating or mitigating in character, that supports a specific sentence <em>within the range </em>authorized by the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant is guilty of a particular offense.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 494 n.19, 120 S. Ct. at 2365 n.19 (emphasis in original). Indeterminate sentencing involves judicial fact-finding in that a judge may implicitly rule on those facts she deems important to the exercise of her sentencing discretion. <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 309, 124 S. Ct. at 2540. The critical difference for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is that, \u201cwhile sentencing factors may guide or confine a judge\u2019s discretion in sentencing an offender <em>within the range </em>prescribed by statute, judge-found sentencing factors cannot increase the maximum sentence a defendant might otherwise receive based purely on the facts found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 224, 130 S. Ct. 2169, 2174-75 (2010) (emphasis in original, citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The judge\u2019s authority is limited because, although she may make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>findings that guide her sentencing discretion within the statutorily prescribed range, she may not make findings that increase the statutorily prescribed range. The judge \u201cmay not inflict punishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow.\u201d <em>S. Union Co. v. United </em>States, 132 S. Ct. 2344, 2350 (2012) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b623 Ghostbear was charged with sexual assault against his girlfriend\u2019s daughter (A.T.). \u201cA person... commits the offense of sexual assault\u201d if the person \u201cknowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent.\u201d Section 45-5-502(1), MCA. The penalties for this offense are set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of the statute. A first or second conviction is a misdemeanor. Section 45-5-502(2)(a), (b), MCA. A third or subsequent conviction is a felony with a maximum term of imprisonment of five years. Section 45-5-502(2)(c), MCA. Regardless of the number of the conviction, however, the offender must be punished \u201cby life imprisonment or by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of not less than 4 years... or more than 100 years\u201d if the victim was less than 16 years old and the offender was 3 or more years older than the victim at the time of the offense. Section 45-5-502(3), MCA. A finding that the victim was less than 16 years old and the offender was 3 or more years older than the victim \u201calters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant is exposed\u201d and, thus, must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S. Ct. at 2160.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b624 The State sought a felony sentence in Ghostbear\u2019s case based on the ages of A.T. and Ghostbear. The \u201celements\u201d of this offense, for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes, are: Ghostbear subjected A.T. to sexual contact; the sexual contact was without consent; Ghostbear acted knowingly; A.T. was less than 16 years old; and Ghostbear was 3 or more years older than A.T. There is no dispute the jury found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Ghostbear knowingly subjected A.T. to sexual contact without consent. The dispute is whether the jury found that A.T. was under 16 and that Ghostbear was at least 3 years older.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b625 The jury did not enter a specific finding concerning age; however, the jury was instructed on the definition of sexual assault in Instruction No. 19, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">A person who knowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent commits the offense of sexual assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">Consent is ineffective if the victim is 14 years of age or younger and the defendant is 3 or more years older than the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">This definition of \u201cconsent\u201d was taken almost verbatim from the sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>assault statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-502(5)(a)(ii), MCA. It stands to reason that, in finding that A.T. could not consent because she was 14 years of age or younger and Ghostbear was 3 or more years older, the jury necessarily also found that A.T. was less than 16 years old and Ghostbear was 3 or more years older for purposes of elevating the offense to a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b626 Ghostbear argues, however, that Instruction No. 19 \u201cdid not direct the jury that the only way to find the \u2018without consent\u2019 element was through age findings.\u201d He opines that \u201cthe \u2018without consent\u2019 element could also be found based upon an ordinary lack of consent (that the victim did not agree to the sexual contact).\u201d He suggests that if the jury found \u201cwithout consent\u201d based on A.T.\u2019s actual lack of consent, rather than her inability to consent because of her age, then the jury did not make the age findings required by <em>Apprendi </em>to raise the offense to a felony under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. Although this theory might be plausible in another case, I conclude that it fails on the record here. \u00b627 Generally speaking, it is true that \u201cwithout consent\u201d may be found based upon the respective ages of the defendant and the victim, or upon an ordinary lack of consent. In <em>State v. Williams, </em>2010 MT 58, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27, 355 Mont. 354, 228 P.3d 1127, we explained that \u201cwithout consent,\u201d for purposes of both sexual assault and sexual intercourse without consent, has its \u201cordinary meaning\u201d as well as certain statutorily defined circumstances where the victim is deemed incapable of consent. The ordinary meaning of \u201cwithout consent\u201d is \u201c \u2018the victim is compelled to submit by force....\u2019\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 27 (quoting \u00a7 45-5-501(1)(a)(i), MCA). The circumstances where the victim is deemed incapable of consent include, among others, being incarcerated, being mentally incapacitated, being physically helpless, and being a particular age. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-501(l)(a)(ii), MCA (sexual intercourse without consent); \u00a7 45-5-502(5)(a), MCA (sexual assault). Given appropriate facts, a jury theoretically could be instructed that \u201cwithout consent\u201d means the victim was \u201ccompelled to submit by force\u201d or the victim was incapable of consent due to her age. If the jury were given these alternatives, without any requirement that the jury enter a specific finding as to age, then there likely would be an <em>Apprendi </em>problem for purposes of imposing an enhanced penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b628 At Ghostbear\u2019s trial, however, the jury was not given alternative definitions of \u201cwithout consent.\u201d Indeed, the parties assumed the jury would decide lack of consent based on age alone. At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Ghostbear moved to dismiss for insufficient evidence on the ground that the State had failed to prove lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>consent because \u201c[t]here hasn\u2019t been any testimony about the Defendant\u2019s age.\u201d The District Court agreed with the prosecutor that there had been testimony as to age and, thus, denied the motion. Then, in settling jury instructions, the District Court rejected a proposed instruction offered by the prosecution that would have permitted the jury to find lack of consent based either on age or on a finding that A.T. had been \u201cunable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct.\u201d The District Court opined that consent should be defined based solely on age, and defense counsel expressly stated that he had no objection to doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b629 Ghostbear posits that the jury nevertheless may have applied the ordinary meaning of \u201cwithout consent\u201d rather than the age definition. I am not persuaded, however, that the jurors would discard the definition of \u201cwithout consent\u201d that they were given in favor of a definition that they were not given. The District Court advised the jury: \u201cI will instruct you on the laws you must apply to the evidence presented in the case in order to reach a verdict.... These instructions are intended to cover all necessary laws which are pertinent to the case. You must take the law in this case from my instructions alone.\u201d Juries are presumed to follow the law that the court provides. <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 57, 341 Mont. 240, 177 P.3d 444. Ghostbear points to nothing in the record \u2014 no trial testimony or arguments by counsel \u2014 supporting his theory that the jurors may have made their \u201cwithout consent\u201d finding based on the ordinary meaning of this term. A.T. was not asked whether she had been \u201ccompelled to submit by force,\u201d and she provided no such testimony. A.T. was asked her age, and she testified that she was eight years old at the time (October 2012), making her six or seven at the time of the offense. The jury also heard evidence that Ghostbear was bom in 1977, making him 33 or 34 at the time of the offense. Under these circumstances, I am satisfied that Instruction No. 19 was sufficient to meet the requirements of <em>Apprendi. </em>In finding Ghostbear guilty of sexual assault as this offense was defined in the instruction, the jury necessarily also found that A.T. was less than 16 years old and Ghostbear was 3 or more years older than A.T. Thus, <em>Apprendi </em>does not preclude the District Court from imposing a felony penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b630 Section46-1-401, MCA, however, mandates a different conclusion. It states that \u201c[a] court may not impose a penalty enhancement specified in Title 45, Title 46, or any other provision of law unless... the jury unanimously found in a separate finding that the enhancing act, omission, or fact occurred beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>46-1-40l(l)(b), MCA. The statute then provides the following definition of \u201cenhancing act, omission, or fact\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">An enhancing act, omission, or fact is an act, omission, or fact, whether stated in the statute defining the charged offense or stated in another statute, that is not included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense and that allows or requires a sentencing court to add to, as provided by statute, a penalty provided by statute for the charged offense or to impose the death penalty instead of a statutory incarceration period provided by statute for the charged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Section 46-1-401(3), MCA. This provision distinguishes \u201cthe statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense\u201d from \u201can act, omission, or fact... that allows or requires a sentencing court to\u201d impose an enhanced penalty. The latter must be found by the jury \u201cin a separate finding.\u201d Section 46-l-401(l)(b), MCA. This is an added protection that <em>Apprendi </em>does not require. As long as all of the facts that expose the defendant to a particular range of penalties are submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Apprendi </em>is satisfied. <em>Apprendi </em>does not require that certain of those facts \u2014 i.e., enhancing acts, omissions, or facts \u2014 be set forth in a \u201cseparate finding.\u201d \u00b631 The Court is mistaken in asserting that \u201c[t]here was no sentence enhancement as that term is used in ... \u00a7 46-1-401(3), MCA,\u201d in the present case. Opinion, \u00b6 9. Indeed, the Court\u2019s assertion is contrary to our holding in <em>State v. Baker, </em>2000 MT 235, 301 Mont. 323, 8 P.3d 817. There, we explained that the statutory definition of the elements of sexual assault is set forth in subsection (1) of the statute: \u201c \u2018knowingly subject[ing] another person to any sexual contact without consent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6 29 (brackets in original) (quoting \u00a7 45-5-502(1), MCA). The penalties are set forth in subsection (2). <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6 30. A first or second conviction is a misdemeanor, while a third or subsequent conviction is a felony subject to imprisonment for up to five years. Section 45-5-502(2), MCA. Subsection (3), we held, \u201csets forth age-related circumstances which <em>enhance the punishment </em>for sexual assault otherwise provided in \u00a7 45-5-502(2), MCA.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6 30 (emphasis added). Regardless of whether it is his first, second, third, or subsequent conviction, subsection (3) exposes the offender to an enhanced penalty if the victim was less than 16 years old and the offender was 3 or more years older than the victim. The age difference is a \u201cfact ... that is not included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense\u201d and that allows or requires the sentencing court to impose a greater punishment than would otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>be authorized for a conviction of sexual assault. Section 46-1-401(3), MCA. The age difference thus results in a penalty enhancement, despite the Court\u2019s supposition to the contrary in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"A-h\">\u00b632 This conclusion is consistent with legislative history. In Baker, the defendant (Baker) was charged by information with sexual assault. The information also alleged that the victim was less than 16 years old and that Baker was 3 or more years older, which Baker argued was an \u201celement\u201d of the offense that the State had to prove at trial. This Cornt disagreed, reasoning that \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, \u201cmerely sets forth age-related circumstances which enhance the punishment for sexual assault otherwise provided in \u00a7 45-5-502(2), MCA.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6 30. In his special concurrence, Justice Leaphart argued that, for purposes of <em>Apprendi, </em>the age-differentiation requirement is an element that must be found by the jury. <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33-44 (Leaphart, J., specially concurring). Nevertheless, the Court held that the State is not required to prove penalty enhancements, such as age differentiation, at trial. <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b633 The Legislature effectively superseded this holding the following year when it passed House Bill 521 (2001), ultimately codified as \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA. The sponsor, Representative Brad Newman, explained to the House Judiciary Committee that Montana has some \u201cenhanced penalties.\u201d He gave \u201cassault against a person under the age of 14\u201d as an example, explaining that if a person assaults another adult, it is a misdemeanor, but if the assault is against a child, it is a felony. H. Jud. Comm., Mins., 57th Reg. Sess., at 4 (Mont. Feb. 14, 2001). Referring to <em>Apprendi, </em>which had been decided seven months earlier, he stated that the State now must prove an \u201cenhancing circumstance\u201d to the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">134 The original draft of House Bill 521 included a list of enhancing acts, omissions, or facts. Had this draft been enacted without amendment, \u00a7 46-1-401(3), MCA, would read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">(3) An enhancing act, omission, or fact is an act, omission, or fact, whether stated in the statute defining the charged offense or stated in another statute, that is not included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense and that allows or requires a sentencing court to add to, as provided by statute, an incarceration period provided by statute for the charged offense or to impose the death penalty instead of a statutory incarceration period provided by statute for the charged offense. <em>An enhancing act, omission, or fact includes hut is not limited to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">(a) bodily injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>(b) serious bodily injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">(c) property damage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">(d) use of a weapon or of a certain type of ammunition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">(e) <em>the age of the victim, or age difference between the defendant and the </em>victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">(f) monetary value or amount of loss, damage, or theft;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">(g) commission of an offense for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with one or more other persons; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">(h) commission of an offense at or in a certain place or within a specified distance of a certain place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">(Emphases added.) The Senate Judiciary Committee amended the bill to delete the foregoing list. This was done not because the senators disagreed with the contents of the list, but because there was concern that the list might be misunderstood as exclusive (i.e., as containing all possible enhancing acts, omissions, or facts), despite the \u201cis not limited to\u201d language. S. Jud. Comm., Mins., 57th Reg. Sess., at 9-10 (Mont. Mar. 23,2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">\u00b635 Section 45-9-132, MCA \u2014 also enacted in 2001 \u2014 further illustrates what the Legislature had in mind. Using the same structural framework as the sexual assault statute, the statutory definition of the elements of this offense is set out in subsection (1): \u201cA person commits the offense of operation of an unlawful clandestine laboratory if the person purposely or knowingly engages in [certain prohibited activities].\u201d Section 45-9-132(1), MCA. Subsection (2) sets forth the basic penalty: \u201ca person convicted of operation of an unlawful clandestine laboratory shall be fined an amount not to exceed $25,000, be imprisoned in a state prison for a term not to exceed 40 years, or both.\u201d Section 45-9-132(2), MCA. Subsections (3) and (4) then set forth enhanced penalties. If any phase of the operation created a substantial risk of death of or serious bodily injury to another, took place within 500 feet of a residence, business, church, or school, or took place in the presence of a person less than 18 years of age, then the fine increases to $50,000 and the term of imprisonment increases to 50 years. Section 45-9-132(3), MCA. If the operation involved the use of a firearm or booby trap, then the fine increases to $100,000 and the term of imprisonment increases to 50 years. Section 45-9-132(4), MCA. The statute states that before either of these enhanced penalties may be imposed, \u201c46-1-401 [must be] complied with.\u201d Section 45-9-132(3), (4), MCA. Thus, in order to impose a greater penalty based on age, the jury must enter \u201ca separate finding\u201d that the operation of the unlawful clandestine laboratory \u201ctook place in the presence of a person less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>18 years of age.\u201d Sections 45-9-132(3)(c), 46-l-401(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\u00b636 It is presumed that the Legislature, when it passes legislation, is aware of existing law, including this Court\u2019s decisions. <em>Gaustad v. City of Columbus, </em>265 Mont. 379, 382, 877 P.2d 470,472 (1994); <em>Sampson v. Natl. Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2006 MT 241, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 541, 144 P.3d 797. The Legislature did not overturn our holding in <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30, that \u00a7 45-5-502(1), MCA, sets forth the \u201celements\u201d of sexual assault while \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, sets forth \u201cage-related circumstances which enhance the punishment for sexual assault otherwise provided in \u00a7 45-5-502(2), MCA.\u201d In fact, \u00a7 46-1-401(3), MCA, is consistent with this holding in that the provision distinguishes \u201cthe statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense\u201d from \u201can act, omission, or fact... that allows or requires a sentencing court\u201d to impose an enhanced penalty. The structure of \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA (unlawful clandestine laboratory), also reflects this distinction, as discussed above. What the Legislature overturned when it passed House Bill 521 was our holding in <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6 30, that enhancing circumstances \u2014 such as the age difference between the defendant and the victim \u2014 do not have to be proved by the State at trial. Such enhancing facts now must be found by the jury in a separate finding. Section 46-l-401(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b637 Accordingly, in light of <em>Baker </em>and the legislative history discussed above, there can be no doubt that the age difference between Ghostbear and A.T. is an \u201cenhancing fact\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA. The State concedes this to be true, and the Court errs in holding to the contrary. Opinion, \u00b6 9. Significantly, the Court does not dispute the legislative history or the validity of our statutory construction <em>inBaker. </em>However, in an attempt to distinguish <em>Baker </em>from the present case, the Court devises a novel distinction betw\u00e9en the two cases premised on how Baker and Ghostbear were each charged. Opinion, \u00b6 9 n.2. Not only is the Court\u2019s approach unfounded, it will have the regrettable effect of nullifying the statutory protection of \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b638 The distinction the Court identifies is that Baker was \u201ccharged with a violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA,\u201d while Ghostbear was \u201ccharged with a violation of \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 9 n.2. Observing that \u201cGhostbear was charged with the specific felony under subsection (3),\u201d the Court implies that Baker was not similarly charged with the same felony and, thus, that the two cases are distinguishable. Opinion, \u00b6 9 n.2. The truth, however, is that Baker and Ghostbear were both charged with a felony for violating \u00a7 45-5-502(1) and (3), MCA. The Information in <em>Baker </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>That during the summer months of 1997, at Sheridan County, Montana, the above-named defendant committed the offense of SEXUAL ASSAULT, a felony, in violation of Montana law, Section 45-5-502, MCA 1997, punishable by life imprisonment or by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of not less than two years or more than 100 years and a fine not to exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">The facts constituting the offense are: The above-named defendant KENNETH WAYNE BAKER, knowingly subjected another person to sexual contact without consent. The victim is less than 16 years old and the defendant is three or more years older than the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">This language clearly incorporates subsection (3) of the sexual assault statute, which at the time stated: \u201cIf the victim is less than 16 years old and the offender is 3 or more years older than the victim ..., the offender shall be punished by life imprisonment or by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of not less than 2 years or more than 100 years and may be fined not more than $50,000.\u201d Section 45-5-502(3), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\u00b639 The Second Amended Information in the present case similarly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">COMES NOW, The Special Deputy Hill County Attorney and files this Information, charging the Defendant with the following offense:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">Count I: Sexual Intercourse Without Consent....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">Or in the Alternative</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">Count I: Sexual Assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-5-502(1)(3), MCA, when on or about a date or dates between January 1, 2011, and January 8, 2012, in Havre, Hill County, Montana, Defendant knowingly subjected another person to any sexual contact without consent of A.T. and when A.T. was unable to consent because she was less than 16 years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">PENALTY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-13\">Life imprisonment or incarceration for a term not less than four (4) years or more than one-hundred (100) years and/or a fine up to $50,000.00....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">Notably, the correct age for inability to consent is 14, not 16. Section 45-5-502(5)(a)(ii), MCA. Moreover, there is no allegation that Ghostbear was 3 or more years older than A.T. Hence, one could argue that the Information in <em>Baker </em>more accurately and adequately alleged an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>offense under \u00a7 45-5-502(1) and (3), MCA, than did the Second Amended Information in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b640 There is simply no merit to the Court\u2019s contention that Baker and Ghostbear were charged with different offenses. Opinion, \u00b6 9 n.2. It makes no difference that the charge in the present case expressly cites \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, while the charge in <em>Baker </em>did not do the same. Both charging documents alleged that the victim was less than 16 years old. Both charging documents incorporated the language of \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. In holding that there is a material and \u201cimportant\u201d distinction between the two charging documents, Opinion, \u00b6 9 n.2, the Court wrongly elevates form over substance. Section 1-3-219, MCA (\u201cThe law respects form less than substance.\u201d). Had the prosecutor in <em>Baker </em>sought leave to amend the Information to add a reference to subsection (3), this clearly would have been an amendment of form, not substance. <em>State v. Scheffer, </em>2010 MT 73, \u00b6 38,355 Mont. 523, 230 P.3d 462 (\u201cAn amendment is one of form when the same crime is charged, the elements of the crime and the proof required remain the same, and the defendant is informed of the charges against him.\u2019\u2019); <em>State v. Bahr, </em>2009 MT 378, \u00b6 9, 353 Mont. 294, 224 P.3d 610 (\u201cAn information that contains an erroneous name of the offense or an erroneous statutory reference is not necessarily invalid as long as the charging language passes the \u2018common understanding\u2019 rule.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b641 Accordingly, there is no question that Baker, like Ghostbear, was charged with a felony pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-502(1) and (3), MCA. We clearly held in <em>Baker </em>that subsection (1) of the statute sets forth the elements of sexual assault while subsection (3) sets forth an age-related penalty enhancement. <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30. This holding was based on a plain reading of the statute. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">Section 45-5-502(3), MCA, merely sets forth age-related circumstances which enhance the punishment for sexual assault otherwise provided in \u00a7 45-5-502(2), MCA. <em>Those age factors pertain only to the sentencing of a person convicted of sexual assault </em>and, as a result, we conclude that <em>Baker\u2019s age in relation to that of the victim is not an element of the offense of sexual </em>assault....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\"><em>Baker, </em>\u00b6 30 (emphases added). We reiterated this holding in <em>State v. Tichenor, </em>2002 MT 311, \u00b6 31, 313 Mont. 95, 60 P.3d 454: \u201cage factor in sexual assault statute pertains only to sentencing and is not an element of the offense.\u201d Nothing in our analysis in <em>Baker </em>indicates we were concerned with the statutory references contained in the Information \u2014 in particular, whether the prosecutor had expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>referenced \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. The Court\u2019s attempt to limit the holding of <em>Baker </em>on this ground simply has no foundation in the facts and analysis in that case, and is contrary to our precedents distinguishing between form and substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b642 Compounding the problem, the Court\u2019s proffered distinction between <em>Baker </em>and the present case nullifies \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA. What the Court holds is this: If the defendant is \u201ccharged with a violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA,\u201d then the age differential is a penalty enhancement pursuant to <em>Baker, </em>but if the defendant is \u201ccharged with a violation of \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA,\u201d then the age differential is an element of the crime pursuant to today\u2019s decision. Opinion, \u00b6 9 n.2. Restated, the age differential is an enhancement if subsection (3) <em>is not </em>expressly referenced in the charge but is an element if subsection (3) <em>is </em>expressly referenced in the charge. Setting aside the Court\u2019s failure to cite any supporting authority for this holding, the problem with the Court\u2019s approach is that \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, requires a statute containing an enhancing act, omission, or fact to be referenced in the charge. Section 46-l-401(l)(a), MCA (\u201cthe enhancing act, omission, or fact [must be] charged in the information, complaint, or indictment, <em>with a reference to the statute or statutes containing the enhancing act, omission, or fact\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Under the Court\u2019s reasoning, however, referencing a statute that contains an enhancing act, omission, or fact \u2014 such as \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA \u2014 renders that enhancing act, omission, or fact \u201can element of the crime.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 9 n.2. Hence, after today\u2019s decision, there can never be an enhancing act, omission, or fact under \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA. By citing the statute in the charge \u2014 as \u00a7 46-l-401(l)(a), MCA, requires \u2014 an act, omission, or fact that would otherwise constitute an enhancing act, omission, or fact becomes an element and, as such, not subject to the \u201cseparate finding\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-l~401(l)(b), MCA. Obviously, this is not what the Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b643 The age differential in \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, was alleged both in <em>Baker </em>and in the present case. The age differential is always an \u201celement\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes because it \u201calters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\u201d <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S. Ct. at 2160. In contrast, the age differential is always an enhancing fact for purposes of \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, because it is \u201cnot included in the <em>statutory </em>definition of the elements of the charged offense.\u201d Section 46-1-401(3), MCA (emphasis added); <em>Baker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30. The State concedes that the jury at Ghostbear\u2019s trial did not find the age difference between Ghostbear and A.T. in a separate finding, and that \u00a7 46-l-401(l)(b), MCA, thus was not satisfied. Hence, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>was precluded from imposing the felony penalty in \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA \u2014 unless the statutory error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b644 Because the \u201cseparate finding\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, is a statutory protection, it is subject to \u00a7 46-1-103, MCA, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">(2) This title is intended to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding. The purposes of this title are to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">(3) Any irregularity in a proceeding specified by this title that does not affect the substantial rights of the accused must be disregarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\"><em>Cf </em>\u00a746-20-701(2), MCA (\u201cAny error, defect, irregularity, or variance [in the trial court] that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded [on appeal].\u201d). Accordingly, Ghostbear\u2019s post-trial motion to be sentenced for misdemeanor sexual assault was subject to harmless-error analysis by the District Court, and is subject to such analysis on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u00b645 An error is \u201cstructural\u201d if it affects the framework within which the trial proceeds. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>2013 MT 221, \u00b6 37,371 Mont. 239, 306 P.3d 348. Structural error \u2014 for example, a biased judge or deprivation of the right to counsel \u2014 \u201c \u2018necessarily renders a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\u2019\u201d <em>Washington v. Recuenco, </em>548 U.S. 212, 218-19, 126 S. Ct. 2546, 2551 (2006) (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 9, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 1833 (1999)). Such error cannot be analyzed'for prejudice and consequently is automatically reversible. <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, \u00b6 45, 367 Mont. 503, 291 P.3d 1187; <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Charlie, </em>2010 MT 195, \u00b6 45, 357 Mont. 355, 239 P.3d 934. Trial error, on the other hand, is the type of error that typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the juxy and that can be reviewed qualitatively for prejudice. <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 45. \u00b646 Failing to submit an element of the offense to the jury is trial error and, therefore, subject to harmless-error review. <em>Recuenco, </em>548 U.S. at 219-20, 126 S. Ct. at 2551-52.1 see no principled basis for concluding differently as to the \u201cseparate finding\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-l-401(l)(b), MCA. Failing to obtain a separate finding on an enhancing act, omission, or fact does not render the trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence. Such error can be reviewed qualitatively for prejudice. I thus conclude that it is trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b647 Failing to submit an element \u2014 or, in this case, an enhancing fact \u2014 to the jury is harmless if the court \u201c \u2018finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the result \u201cwould have been the same absent the error.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 62, 336 Mont. 63, 153 P.3d 601 (quoting <em>United States v. Zepeda-Martinez, </em>470 F.3d 909, 913 (9th Cir. 2006), in turn <em>quoting Neder, </em>527 U.S. at 19, 119 S. Ct. at 1838). \u201c[I]f the record contains overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence supporting the sentencing factor,\u201d then the error is harmless, but \u201cif the defendant contested the omitted [fact] and reused evidence sufficient to support a contrary finding,\u201d then the error is not harmless. <em>Adams, </em>\u00b6 62 (citing <em>Zepeda-Martinez, </em>470 F.3d at 913).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b648 Although it is not designated as such, the Court\u2019s discussion at \u00b6 13 of the Opinion is essentially a harmless-error analysis. As the Court points out, A.T. testified that she was eight years old at the time of trial, making her six or seven at the time of the offense. In Ghostbear\u2019s interview with law enforcement, a recording of which was played at trial, he acknowledged that A.T. was just turning eight. In addition, he stated that his date of birth was in 1977, making him 33 or 34 at the time of the offense. At trial, Ghostbear was asked, \u201cDid you drink when you were a kid?\u201d to which he responded, \u201cNo, ... I didn\u2019t have a drink of alcohol until I was 18 years old.\u201d The evidence of A.T.\u2019s age and Ghostbear\u2019s age was uncontroverted. The evidence established that A.T. was roughly six or seven at the time of the offense and Ghostbear was three or more years older than A.T. Indeed, no rational trier of fact could have concluded that A.T. was over 16 years old or that there was less than a three-year age difference between A.T. and Ghostbear.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b649 On the record before us, I believe we can conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the result would have been the same absent the error. <em>Zepeda-Martinez, </em>470 F.3d at 913; <em>Adams, </em>\u00b6 62. In other words, had the jury been asked to make the separate finding required by \u00a7 46-l-401(l)(b), MCA, that A.T. was less than 16 years old and Ghostbear was 3 or more years older, I conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have made this finding, given the uncontroverted evidence presented at trial regarding age.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b650 Based on the foregoing analysis, I specially concur in the Court\u2019s decision to reverse and remand for felony sentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-9\">JUSTICE BAKER joins the Special Concurrence of JUSTICE McKinnon.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
