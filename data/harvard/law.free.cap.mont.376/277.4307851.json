S.J. was driving a van borrowed from a friend. The pair parked at Stodden Park to visit at approximately 9:40 a.m. Shortly after they arrived at the park, Butte Police Sgt. Ed Heard drove by on routine patrol. Sgt. Heard later explained that due to vandalism of the Korean War Memorial in the park, he tried to patrol the park at least once during his shift. He noticed the van, parked and not running, with two occupants inside. It was the only vehicle in the lot and though the park was open to the public at that time, Sgt. Heard believed it to be suspicious. He pulled up behind the van and parked his patrol car but did not activate his emergency lights. Based on the layout of the parking lot, and the fact that no other vehicles were in the lot, the van was not physically prevented from leaving the lot despite Sgt. Heard being parked behind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">\u00b65 After parking behind the van, Sgt. Heard left his patrol car and approached the driver\u2019s side of the van. Sgt. Heard testified that as he approached the van he noticed \u201chow young [S. J.] was\u201d so he asked for her driver\u2019s license. S.J. informed Sgt. Heard that she didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license and handed him her school ID. Sgt. Heard then asked Strom for identification and Strom provided an identification card. Sgt. Heard instructed S.J. and Strom to wait and took both IDs to his patrol car to check the driver\u2019s status and for warrants. He learned that S.J. did not have a driver\u2019s license and Strom had a warrant from Stillwater County for failure to appear. Sgt. Heard reapproached the vehicle from the passenger side, instructed Strom to step out of the vehicle, and placed her under arrest based on the outstanding warrant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>He handed S. J. back her school ID and informed her that she could not drive. S. J. informed Sgt. Heard that she had been in touch with the vehicle\u2019s owner and he was on his way to pick up the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b66 While beingheld in a cell at the detention center, Strom presented a detention officer with a baggie filled with a white substance and stated it was \u201ccrystal meth.\u201d The substance tested positive for methamphetamine, and Strom was charged with one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, on January 26,2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b67 Strom moved to suppress the evidence and statements pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-13-301 and -302, MCA. She argued that Sgt. Heard lacked particularized suspicion to perform an investigatory stop when he asked her and S.J. for identification, and that any evidence or statement obtained as a result of the illegal stop must be suppressed. The State countered that no investigatory stop had occurred and that Sgt. Heard had discovered the warrant after a voluntary conversation with citizens who were free to leave at any time. The District Court denied Strom\u2019s motion, finding that there had not been a seizure for which particularized suspicion was required. Strom subsequently pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, reserving her right to appeal the court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b68 We review a denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the lower court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous and whether it correctly applied the law to those findings. <em>State v. Graham, </em>2007 MT 358, \u00b6 10, 340 Mont. 366, 175 P.3d 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Defendant Strom\u2019s motion to suppress on the ground there had not been a seizure requiring particularized suspicion?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">\u00b610 In reviewing Strom\u2019s allegation of an illegal seizure, we must first determine whether a seizure has occurred. Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. However, we have recognized that \u201c \u2018not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u201cseizures\u201d of persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Wilkins, </em>2009 MT 99, \u00b6 8, 350 Mont. 96, 205 P.3d 795 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19-20 n. 16, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 1879 n. 16 (1968)). In determining whether a seizure has occurred, we apply the same test under both the federal and Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>constitutions. <em>State v. Case, </em>2007 MT 161, \u00b6 24, 338 Mont. 87, 162 P.3d 849. A person has been seized if, after viewing all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would not have believed that he or she was free to leave. <em>Case, </em>\u00b6 24. We adopted this test from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 100 S. Ct. 1870 (1980). <em>In Mendenhall, </em>the Supreme Court provided examples of circumstances that may indicate a person was seized, including \u201cthe threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S. Ct. at 1877. We have repeatedly relied on these factors, often referred to as the <em>Mendenhall </em>factors, in seizure cases but we have also explained that the test is an objective one and \u201cis necessarily imprecise and will vary depending on the setting in which the conduct occurs.\u201d <em>State v. Clayton, </em>2002 MT 67, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 309 Mont. 215, 45 P.3d 30. The <em>Mendenhall </em>factors may be helpful in certain cases, but we have recognized that they are not exhaustive. <em>Wilkins, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b611 As a preliminary matter, Strom argues that we should overrule our past cases utilizing the <em>Mendenhall </em>test. It appears that Strom advocates for a rejection of the \u201creasonable person/free to leave standard\u201d in favor of a more subjective test based on the age and knowledge of the citizen claiming to have been seized. The State counters that Strom\u2019s request to reject decades of case law in favor of a vague and poorly defined rule has scant legal support and \u201cno record facts to support her position.\u201d We agree that rejection of the <em>Mendenhall </em>test is not warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b612 The District Court agreed with the State\u2019s argument that, under the facts of this case, no seizure had occurred. The State argues that our holding in <em>Wilkins </em>is controlling. In <em>Wilkins, </em>an officer was on routine patrol at 1:30 a.m. when he noticed a vehicle with its lights on parked halfway down a side street next to a salvage yard. The location where the vehicle was parked was a dark, remote area occupied by mostly industrial businesses that were closed at that time. The officer drove past the vehicle and noticed that it was running. <em>Wilkins, </em>\u00b6 2. The officer found the vehicle to be suspicious because it was unusual for a vehicle to be in the area, running and with its lights on, at that time of night, and that there had been recent burglaries in the area. The officer was also concerned about the welfare of the driver because it was a cold night, near or below freezing, and the vehicle was in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>isolated location. The officer approached the vehicle and spoke to the driver. While speaking with her, the officer noticed the smell of alcohol and that Wilkins\u2019 speech was slurred. The officer then conducted a DUI investigation and arrested Wilkins for DUI. <em>Wilkins, </em>\u00b6 3. We upheld the district court\u2019s denial of Wilkins\u2019 motion to suppress, concluding that no seizure had occurred where the officer did not initiate the stop of the vehicle and did nothing to impede the driver\u2019s liberty by means of physical force or show of authority, such as activating his emergency lights or shining a spotlight in the vehicle. The initial contact with Wilkins was a voluntary exchange, and the later DUI investigation was supported by particularized suspicion gained through this exchange. <em>Wilkins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b613  Although there are similarities between this case and <em>Wilkins, </em>distinctions justify a different result here. Unlike the casual conversation with the driver initiated by the officer in <em>Wilkins </em>to check on her welfare and the unusual circumstances of the running and lighted vehicle\u2019s presence in the area at that time of day, Sgt. Heard\u2019s first communication with both S. J. and Strom, properly parked in a public-use area in broad daylight, was a demand of them to produce identification. After first obtaining a student ID from S. J., Sgt. Heard asked Strom if she \u201chad any type of driver\u2019s license or identification.\u201d He then took both women\u2019s IDs to his patrol car, instructing them to wait there, to check driver\u2019s status and warrants. Based on these facts, we conclude that a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave despite the fact that more compelling actions were not taken, such as the use of emergency lights, drawing of a weapon, or parking in such a way as to physically prevent the van from departing, and, therefore, both women were seized at that time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b614 A peace officer may stop an individual to conduct a brief investigation if the person or vehicle is \u201cobserved in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d Section 46-5-401(1), MCA. A peace officer who has lawfully stopped a person may \u201crequest the person\u2019s name and present address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>and an explanation of the person\u2019s actions and, if the person is the driver of a vehicle, demand the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license and the vehicle\u2019s registration and proof of insurance.\u201d Section 46-5-401(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b615 To have particularized suspicion for an investigative stop, \u201cthe peace officer must be possessed of: (1) objective data and articulable facts from which he or she can make certain reasonable inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the person to be stopped has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 20,349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842. Whether or not particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact determined by looking at the totality of the circumstances. <em>Moore v. State, </em>2002 MT 315, \u00b6 10, 313 Mont. 126, 61 P.3d 746. In evaluating the totality of the circumstances, a court must consider the quality and quantity of the information available to the officer. <em>State v. Flemings, </em>2008 MT 229, \u00b6 16, 344 Mont. 360, 188 P.3d 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b616  Sgt. Heard testified that the only reason he asked Strom for her identification was because S.J. had just informed him that she did not have a driver\u2019s license and he needed to \u201csee if we could have a licensed driver drive the vehicle.\u201d However, neither an inquiry from Sgt. Heard nor a statement from the women had been made establishing that Strom would drive the vehicle, or that she was licensed to drive. To the contrary, it was S. J.\u2019s intention to contact the van\u2019s owner about retrieving it, which is what she did while Sgt. Heard was checking the women\u2019s identifications in his car. Based on the scant information available to Sgt. Heard at the time, we see no objective data or resulting suspicion that justified an investigation of Strom.</p>\n<p id=\"AUT\">\u00b617  Although S.J. is not a defendant, neither was there particularized suspicion to stop or seize her that could support or properly lead to the subsequent investigation of Strom. The initial reason for requesting S. J.\u2019s driver\u2019s license was that, on his approach to the vehicle, Sgt. Heard \u201cnoticed how the age \u2014 how young [S. J.] was.\u201d This statement is the only evidence in the record supporting an investigation into the identity and driving status of S.J. In Montana, a person at least 15 years of age may obtain a license if he or she has passed a driver\u2019s education course, and a person at least 13 years of age may obtain a restricted license in cases of individual hardship. Section 61-5-105(1), MCA. While the apparent youthfulness of a driver may well constitute particularized suspicion for an officer to stop and check the driver\u2019s status, that concern was not the reason that Sgt. Heard stopped and approached the vehicle here. Rather, the stop and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the request for identification was premised on Sgt. Heard\u2019s assessment of suspicious activity, for which there was no objective data to support.</p>\n<p id=\"A76\">\u00b618 We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-4\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, COTTER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\"> In his testimony, Sgt. Heard briefly mentioned that his intention when first approaching the van included checking on the welfare of the occupants due to the fact that it was a cold morning and the vehicle was not running. However, he first testified that he approached the vehicle because \u201cit was \u2014 just looked suspicious to me,\u201d and the dispatch notes indicate that Sgt. Heard reported that he was checking on \u201csuspicious activity.\u201d The State affirmatively states in its appellate briefing that it is not relying on the community caretaker doctrine as an alternative theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
