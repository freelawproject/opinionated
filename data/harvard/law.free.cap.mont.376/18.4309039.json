We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\"><em>1. Did the District Court err by appointing J.A.L.\u2019s brother and sister-in-law as her guardians and conservators, rather than Ron, who had priority </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by ordering Ron to pay reasonable attorney fees?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u00b63 Ron and J.A.L. are married and have been together for over fifty years. J.A.L. has multiple sclerosis, which has limited her physical mobility. She also suffers from some cognitive impairments. Until 2011, she lived with Ron, who cared for her. Both she and Ron wished that she remain in the marital home. Unfortunately, over time Ron grew unable to care for her, even with assistance. As a result, she entered an assisted living facility. Due to Ron\u2019s behavior with medical personnel and staff at the assisted living facility, she was subsequently discharged. This sequence occurred more than once. In 2011, Ron suffered an emotional breakdown and spent time in the Montana State Hospital. Upon discharge he stopped taking psychiatric medications, because they were having deleterious physical side effects, and did not seek additional treatment for his mentad health issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\u00b64 Meanwhile, J.A.L.\u2019s son and daughter sought and obtained appointments as J.A.L.\u2019s co-guardians/conservators. She was placed at an assisted living facility in Helena, Montana, and appeared happy there. Contacts with Ron changed this. At his urging, she began acting out at the facility and was eventually discharged. Ron was disruptive when he visited the facility and would call as many as forty times a day. J. A.L.\u2019s son and daughter had difficulty dealing with Ron and had difficulty responding to the problems he caused in their mother\u2019s affairs. A Guardian ad Litem (GAL) was appointed for J.A.L., but Ron <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>interfered with J.A.L.\u2019s communications with the GAL. Ultimately, following an emergency court hearing, the court removed J.A.L.\u2019s son and daughter as her co-guardians/conservators and instead appointed her brother and sister-in-law (the Bugnis). J.A.L. was then readmitted to the assisted living facility in Helena for a probationary period on condition that she have no contact with Ron. Since readmission, she has been doing well there.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b65 Beginning in 2012, Ron has filed two petitions to either be appointed as guardian/conservator for J.A.L. or to terminate the guardianship. The District Court has held six hearings to determine whether J.A.L. is in need of a guardian and who is the appropriate person to serve. After the final hearing, on September 4, 2013, the District Court issued its order finding that J.A.L. is an incapacitated person in need of a permanent guardian and conservator; appointing the Bugnis as full co-guardians/conservators; and authorizing the Bugnis to facilitate limited future contact between Ron and J.A.L. Following appointment of the Bugnis as co-guardians/conservators, the District Court issued an order assessing attorney\u2019s fees against Ron. \u00b66 Ron appeals from these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b67 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s appointment of a guardian and determination of the scope of the guardian\u2019s responsibilities for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Estate of West, </em>269 Mont. 83, 91, 887 P.2d 222, 227 (1994). We exercise de novo review to determine whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the relevant statutes. <em>In re Mental Health of E.P.B., </em>2007 MT 224, \u00b6 5, 339 Mont. 107, 168 P.3d 662. We will not disturb the findings supporting a district court\u2019s determination unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of Gilroy, </em>2004 MT 267, \u00b6 16, 323 Mont. 149, 99 P.3d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees for an abuse, of discretion. <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 13, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">\u00b69 <em>1. Did the District Court err by appointing J.A.L.\u2019s brother and sister-in-law as her guardians and conservators, rather than Ron, who had priority ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">\u00b610 Section 72-5-306, MCA, provides that \u201c[g]uardianship for an incapacitated person may be used only, as is necessary to promote and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>protect the well-being of the person\u201d and may be ordered \u201conly to the extent that the person\u2019s actual mental and physical limitations require it.\u201d Section 72-5-312, MCA, sets forth priorities for appointment as guardian of an incapacitated person. Relevant to this proceeding, absent the incapacitated person\u2019s reasonably intelligent choice, the spouse of the incapacitated person has first priority, followed by the incapacitated person\u2019s adult child or children, followed by a relative who has demonstrated a sincere, longstanding interest in the incapacitated person\u2019s welfare. Section 72-5-312(2), MCA. These priorities are not binding, however, and the court may appoint \u201cthe person, association, or nonprofit corporation that is best qualified and willing to serve.\u201d Section 72-5-312(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b611  The evidence before the District Court supported the court\u2019s determination that J.A.L. had declining physical and cognitive capacities and needed a guardian/conservator. Section 72-5-312, MCA, vests the district court with discretion to appoint as guardian/conservator a person or entity who is best-qualified and willing to serve, regardless of the priorities set forth by the statute. The fact that Ron is J.A.L.\u2019s husband, standing alone, does not require the court to appoint him as her guardian. The District Court, in appointing the Bugnis as co-guardians/conservators, specifically found that \u201cRon\u2019s history of inappropriate behavior in caring for [J.A.L.], dealings with other persons and refusal to obey the orders of the Court\u201d gave rise to good cause not to appoint him as J.A.L.\u2019s guardian/conservator. The court found that the Bugnis \u201cdemonstrate a good understanding of [J.A.L.\u2019s] needs and make accommodations to ensure [J.A.L.\u2019s] needs are met and to protect her health and welfare.\u201d Accordingly, the court found that the Bugnis were best qualified to serve as permanent co-guardians/conservators. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b612 Ron\u2019s contention on appeal that the District Court erred by permitting the Bugnis to restrict contact between him and J.A.L. is no more persuasive. A court-appointed full guardian of an incapacitated person has the same powers, rights, and duties respecting the ward that a parent has respecting an unemancipated minor child, including the power to give consents or approvals required for the ward to obtain medical or other professional care. Section 72-5-321(2), MCA. While we have held that a guardian may not bring a marital dissolution proceeding on behalf of a ward, we have not held that a guardian may not in any way influence the ward\u2019s marital relationship. <em>In re Marriage of Denowh, </em>2003 MT 244, \u00b6 18, 317 Mont. 314, 78 P.3d 63. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Instead, we have explained that the guiding principle to evaluate a guardian\u2019s actions should be whether they seek some benefit to the ward, or are in the ward\u2019s best interests. <em>See In re Marriage of Denowh, </em>\u00b6 18. An incapacitated person may not be limited in the exercise of any civil or political rights \u2014 including any right to marital relations \u2014 except those that are clearly inconsistent with the exercise of the powers granted to the guardian. Section 72-5-316(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b613  Here, the Bugnis\u2019 agreement to limit contact between J.A.L. and Ron was necessary for J.A.L. to receive care from the assisted living facility where she had been thriving before Ron\u2019s interference. It is apparent from the facts set forth in the District Court\u2019s order, as well as the record as a whole, that the Bugnis were acting in J.A.L.\u2019s best interests when they decided to limit her contacts with Ron. Without these limitations, she likely would have been discharged from the assisted living facility at which she was improving, as she had been discharged from previous facilities due to Ron\u2019s behavior. Had the District Court\u2019s order not allowed for some limitations on Ron\u2019s contacts with J.A.L., it would have been inconsistent with the powers granted to the Bugnis to give consents or approvals necessary for J.A.L. to obtain needed professional care. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s order allowed for these limitations to continue, although it provided that \u201climited future contact between Mr. and Mrs. Lowney <em>shall </em>be facilitated through Robert and Debbie Bugni.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The District Court\u2019s order did not preclude Ron from seeing his wife, but rather <em>required </em>the Bugnis to facilitate those contacts. Thus, it is not the \u201cpractical dissolution\u201d of their marriage Ron would label it. While it appears that Ron loves J.A.L. and wants to be with her, we conclude that the District Court acted within its discretion in limiting Ron\u2019s contacts with J.A.L. and did not err in determining such limitations were necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b614 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by ordering Ron to pay reasonable attorney fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b615 Montana follows the American Rule that a party in a civil action is not entitled to attorney fees absent a specific contractual or statutory provision. <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 37. The District Court, however, also retains the power to grant complete relief under its equity power. <em>Foy v. Anderson, </em>176 Mont. 507, 511, 580 P.2d 114, 116 (1978). Such awards should not establish precedent, but should be granted on a case by case basis. <em>Foy, </em>176 Mont, at 511, 580 P.2d at 116-17. We have held that the <em>Foy </em>\u201cequitable\u201d exception applies only in situations where a party has been forced to defend against a wholly frivolous or malicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>action. <em>Braach v. Graybeal, </em>1999 MT 234, \u00b6 9, 296 Mont. 138, 988 P.2d 761. It is invoked \u201cinfrequently.\u201d <em>Youderian Constr. v. Hall, </em>285 Mont. 1, 15, 945 P.2d 909, 917 (1997). \u201c[T]he exception does not apply where the losing party had a reasonable basis to believe his cause might prevail.\u201d <em>Estate of Pruyn v. Axmen Propane, Inc., </em>2009 MT 448, \u00b6 75, 354 Mont. 208, 223 P.3d 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b616 While we can find no support for the District Court\u2019s sweeping statement that it \u201chas authority in a guardianship proceeding to order the payment of attorney fees by appropriate parties,\u201d we may still affirm a district court where it reaches the right result for the wrong reason. <em>See State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646. We conclude that here, although the District Court did not expressly invoke its equitable powers, the court correctly awarded the Bugnis attorney fees pursuant to those powers in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b6 17 The procedural history and facts of the case supported the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees pursuant to its equity powers. This proceeding has been before the same District Court judge for at least three years, over the cotuse of which the court held several hearings and considered many filings of the parties. The District Court is very familiar with the facts and had ample opportunity to observe the conduct of the parties and the witnesses. We \u201cmust give due regard to the trial court\u2019s opportunity to judge the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6). The District Court found that the \u201croutine\u201d guardianship proceeding had been complicated by Ron\u2019s filing two \u201cfrivolous\u201d petitions to terminate the guardianship; his interference with J.A.L.\u2019s care; and his many changes of attorney. The District Court also noted that Ron had not given any assets to the guardians and attorneys to meet the obligations of the proceeding \u2014 and the guardians had been forced to use their own money to pay for any of J. A.L.\u2019s needs that were not covered by government benefits. This occurred despite the fact that all of J.A.L.\u2019s assets had been transferred to Ron to make her eligible for Medicaid and he had been directed by court order to provide amounts for her support. Under these circumstances, the determination that equity required Ron to pay J.A.L.\u2019s attorneys\u2019 reasonable fees was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\u00b618  The record also supports the District Court\u2019s determination because Ron\u2019s petitions were frivolous: The facts show that Ron could have had no reasonable basis to believe his cause might prevail. Ron himself had acknowledged that he could not provide adequate care for J.A.L. Following that recognition, he spent time in a mental health facility. Upon release, he did nothing to care for his own mental health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>needs and instead consistently disrupted J.A.L.\u2019s care by harassing staff at her assisted living facilities and encouraging J.A.L. to behave badly so she would be dismissed from the facilities. His behavior was so egregious that the final assisted living facility would not agree to readmit J.A.L. unless Ron was prevented from contacting her. Particularly in a case such as this one, where the focus should have been on J.A.L.\u2019s best interests, Ron\u2019s petitions were frivolous because they ignored the reality of his ability to care for her. Thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in exercising its equitable power to award attorney fees to the co-guardians/conservators incurred in the defense of Ron\u2019s frivolous action.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b619 While it is with heavy hearts that we consider the facts of this case, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in appointing the Bugnis as full co-guardians/conservators and in requiring Ron to pay their attorneys\u2019 reasonable fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
