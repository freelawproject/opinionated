The only issue on appeal is whether an off-duty officer arrested Iosefo without probable cause. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\u00b62 Mark Fiorentino, an off-duty police officer, arrested Iosefo shortly after 3:00 a.m. on August 26, 2012. Black Knight Security had employed Fiorentino to work as a security guard at the River City Roots festival, held in Missoula on August 25-26,2012. Fiorentino had seen Iosefo enter the festival area through the exit of a parking garage and drive through yellow caution tape into the pedestrian area of the festival. When Iosefo attempted to turn around, he collided with a heavy plastic barricade and damaged the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">\u00b63 Fiorentino approached Iosefo\u2019s vehicle, but Iosefo continued his attempt to drive through the area. When Iosefo eventually stopped, Fiorentino instructed him to remain in his vehicle. Iosefo disobeyed Fiorentino\u2019s directive by exiting his vehicle and walking away. When Fiorentino attempted to contain him, Iosefo pulled away and began waving his arms and yelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">\u00b64 Fiorentino called 911, and the police arrived within minutes. The dispatcher asked whether Florentino thought Iosefo was intoxicated, and Fiorentino replied, \u201cUm, I can\u2019t tell. He backed-in the barricade here at the ... .\u201d Fiorentino did not finish his reply because he turned his attention back to Iosefo, who refused to stay in one place until the police arrived. Fiorentino recalled later that Iosefo had seemed \u201cagitated\u201d and \u201chyper.\u201d While they waited, Fiorentino tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>-unsuccessfully to handcuff Iosefo and threatened to \u201cput losefo on the ground.\u201d Florentino also threatened to put Iosefo. at gunpoint. Apparently, the threat failed to stop losefo from moving around. City police officers arrived and immediately assumed custody of Iosefo. Iosefo was charged in Municipal Court with careless driving for striking the barricade, with aggravated DUI, and with unlawful breath test refusal under a City ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b65 Iosefo filed a motion to suppress on November 16, 2012, arguing that Fiorentino lacked probable cause to effectuate a citizen\u2019s arrest. The Municipal Court denied the motion on January 23, 2013. Iosefo pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol, reserving the right to appeal the suppression order. The other charges were dropped. The Municipal Court sentenced losefo to one year in jail, with all but ten days suspended, and ordered him to pay a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b66 Iosefo appealed to District Court on February 15, 2013\u2019 The District Court affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Iosefo\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b67 On appeal from a municipal court, the district court functions as an intermediate appellate court. <em>City of Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461. This Court reviews cases that originate in municipal court \u201cas if the appeal originally had been filed in this Court,\u201d examining the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision and applying the appropriate standard of review. <em>Cantu, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>City of Helena v, Broadwater, </em>2014 MT 185, \u00b6 8, 375 Mont. 450, 329 P.3d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u00b68 We review the denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether it correctly applied those findings as a matter of law. <em>City of Missoula v. Fergunson, </em>2001 MT 69, \u00b6 6, 305 Mont. 36, 22 P.3d 198. The interpretation and construction of a statute present a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Brown, </em>2009 MT 452, \u00b6 6, 354 Mont. 329, 223 P.3d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\u00b69  A law enforcement officer outside of his jurisdiction \u201cmay make an arrest under circumstances which would authorize a private citizen to do so.\u201d <em>State v. Updegraff, </em>2011 MT 321, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 363 Mont. 123, 267 P.3d 28. Montana\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">(1) A private person may arrest another when there is probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>cause to believe that the person is committing or has committed an offense and the existing circumstances require the person\u2019s immediate arrest. The private person may use reasonable force to detain the arrested person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">(2) A private person making an arrest shall immediately notify the nearest available law enforcement agency or peace officer and give custody of the person arrested to the officer or agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Section 46-6-502, MCA. Thus, an off-duty officer may use reasonable force to arrest a person only \u201cif there is probable cause to believe that the person is committing or has committed an offense and the existing circumstances require the person\u2019s immediate arrest.\u201d <em>Updegraff, </em>\u00b6 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b610 Probable cause for an arrest exists \u201cif the facts and circumstances within an officer\u2019s personal knowledge, or related to the officer by a rehable source, are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that another person is committing or has committed an offense.\u201d <em>State v. Williamson, </em>1998 MT 199, \u00b6 21, 290 Mont. 321, 965 P.2d 231. The probable cause determination \u201cmust be based on an assessment of all relevant circumstances, evaluated in light of the knowledge of a trained law enforcement officer.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>\u00b6 21. Mere suspicion is not enough to establish probable cause to believe that another person is committing or has committed an offense. <em>Williamson, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b611 The Municipal Court held that Fiorentino, the off-duty officer, had probable cause to arrest Iosefo under the circumstances, remarking that \u201c[i]t is hard to imagine how Fiorentino could have improved in his compliance with the expectations of \u00a7 46-6-502.\u201d The District Court affirmed. Iosefo contends that the arrest was invalid for two reasons: Fiorentino lacked authority to arrest Iosefo for a non-jailable offense, and Fiorentino acted upon a particularized suspicion instead of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b612 We apply the plain language of the statute to determine whether the citizen\u2019s arrest was lawful; we cannot \u201cinsert what has been omitted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The citizen\u2019s arrest statute does not limit the type of offense upon which a citizen or out-of-jurisdiction officer may act in effecting an arrest. The plain language of the citizen\u2019s arrest statute requires only probable cause of \u201can offense.\u201d Section 46-6-502, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\u00b613 Iosefo argues that our decision in <em>Bauer </em>constrains all citizens\u2019 arrests to jailable offenses. <em>State v. Bauer, </em>2001 MT 248, 307 Mont. 105, 36 P.3d 892. We held in <em>Bauer </em>that \u201cit is unreasonable for a police officer to effect an arrest and detention for a non-jailable offense when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>there are no circumstances to justify an immediate arrest.\u201d <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 33. At issue in <em>Bauer </em>was the statute governing warrantless arrests by peace officers, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">A peace officer may arrest a person when a warrant has not been issued if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person is committing an offense or that the person has committed an offense and existing circumstances require immediate arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5\">Section 46-6-311(1), MCA. We determined that a peace officer\u2019s warrantless arrest was unlawful where no \u201cspecial circumstances!,] such as a concern for the safety of the offender or the public,\u201d existed that could justify subjecting a person \u201cto the indignity of an arrest....\u201d <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 33. Both the statute governing warrantless arrests by a peace officer and the citizen\u2019s arrest statute demand probable cause of \u201can offense\u201d arid \u201cexisting circumstances [that] require immediate arrest,\u201d not that the offense is \u201cjailable.\u201d Thus, Fiorentino needed probable cause of an offense, not necessarily a jailable one. <em>Bauer </em>interpreted the language \u201cexisting circumstances require immediate arrest\u201d to mean that, in the case of a non-jailable offense, there must be circumstances such as a concern for the safety of the offender or the public to justify the arrest. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 33. Here, Iosefo\u2019s dangerous conduct necessitated an immediate arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b614 Iosefo is incorrect when he argues that Fiorentino acted upon a mere particularized suspicion. Iosefo claims that probable cause did not exist until after Fiorentino effected his arrest, relying on Fiorentino\u2019s statement to the dispatcher that he could not tell whether Iosefo was intoxicated. Iosefo seems to argue that probable cause could be found only if Fiorentino had made observations that he was driving under the influence, such as \u201cbeer cans strewn about the vehicle,\u201d \u201cslurred speech,\u201d \u201cbloodshot eyes,\u201d \u201can odor of alcohol,\u201d or \u201cany other indicia of impairment.\u201d Iosefo emphasizes that his behavior prior to the arrest was, at most, merely suspicious. To support this argument, Iosefo relies on the District Court\u2019s use of particularized suspicion language when it found that Fiorentino \u201cobserved behavior that caused him to suspect\u201d that Iosefo was somehow impaired. Iosefo further suggests that the arrest was made for the sole reason that Fiorentino could investigate this suspicious behavior to determine whether a DUI was being committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b615  This argument fails because Fiorentino\u2019s observations were not limited to behavior that led him to suspect that Iosefo was impaired \u2014 he also witnessed Iosefo enter a parking garage going the wrong direction, drive through yellow caution tape, drive erratically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>into an area restricted for pedestrian use, and collide with a barricade in that area. This was not merely \u201csuspect\u201d or \u201csuspicious\u201d behavior; it was potentially dangerous behavior that would cause a reasonable person to believe that losefo was committing or had committed any of several offenses, including careless driving. The circumstances required an immediate arrest to protect pedestrians and property. Thus, authority to arrest existed regardless of whether Fiorentino believed that losefo was driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b616  We recognize that Fiorentino could not arrest losefo only to investigate a suspicion of impaired driving. The citizen\u2019s arrest statute \u201ccontemplates a public safety purpose, not a criminal investigation purpose.\u201d <em>Updegraff, </em>\u00b6 33. Iosefo\u2019s conduct, however, posed legitimate safety concerns to himself and the public that meet the citizen\u2019s arrest provision that the circumstances must require immediate arrest. In light of the imminent risks to pedestrians and property posed by Iosefo\u2019s continued presence behind the wheel, the Municipal Court properly determined that the circumstances required his immediate arrest here.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b617 Finally, although losefo attempts to portray Fiorentino\u2019s methods of arrest as \u201cvigilantism,\u201d the Municipal Court properly concluded that the force used to detain losefo was reasonable. Fiorentino did not draw his weapon and we are not confronted with a scenario where a citizen has elected to \u201c[take] the lawinto his own hands.\u201d Although Fiorentino possessed only the authority provided by the citizen\u2019s arrest statute, we do not need to ignore that Fiorentino is a trained officer of the law. <em>See Updegraff, </em>\u00b6 48 (\u201cObviously, peace officers do not suddenly forget all their training and experience simply because they cross an imaginary jurisdictional line in the sand.\u201d). In compliance with the statute, Fiorentino immediately notified proper authorities of the situation. On-duty Missoula police officers took control within minutes. Fiorentino\u2019s threats served briefly to detain losefo under circumstances where he was being unpredictable, unruly, and potentially endangering other citizens as well as himself. The force used by Fiorentino was reasonable in this situation \u2014 we need not speculate as to the potential of threats by another citizen under other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b6 18  Fiorentino had probable cause to arrest losefo and the existing circumstances required his immediate arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b194-10\">JUSTICES RICE, COTTER, WHEAT and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
