His daughters, Roberta Jean Mead (Roberta) and Bobbi Jo Harr (Bobbi Jo), survived him. Roberta and Bobbi Jo are half-sisters, born to different mothers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Robert\u2019s death, Roberta initiated intestate proceedings, but Bobbi Jo petitioned for formal probate of Robert\u2019s purported will. \u00b67 The will is dated July 18,2011. Robert\u2019s long-time neighbor Teryl Rouse (Teryl) wrote its contents by hand. The will reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A29\">On this date 7-18-2011 \u2014 I am here with my neighbor of over 30 years \u2014 Robert Mead (Bob) \u2014 I am here to write down his last \u201cwill\u201d \u2014 He is in good spirits, alert and sound of mind. On this date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Bob has asked me to write down the desires he has in regards to his earthly possessions. \u201cI (Bob) Robert Mead do will all my earthly possessions to my daughter Bobbi Jo Harr that lives in California, she can do with them what she likes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b68 Teryl and her husband Ralph Rouse (Ralph) each signed as \u201cwitnesses\u201d and dated their signatures \u201c7/18/2011\u201d near the bottom of the will; Robert\u2019s name and signature appear beneath the Rouses\u2019 signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b69 Ralph died before proceedings in this case occurred, leaving Teryl as the will\u2019s only surviving signatory. Teryl testified that, in July 2011, Robert talked to her about preparing his will. Robert was suffering from soon-to-be diagnosed terminal cancer and had just returned from the hospital. He asked Teryl to come over to his house and help prepare a will. Teryl came over and Robert handed her a piece of paper, explaining that he could not write the will himself because his hand was too shaky. Medical records show that Robert was prescribed hydrocodone at the time. Teryl wrote the part of the document not in quotation marks at her own bidding. Robert dictated the part of the document in quotation marks and Teryl wrote the dictation word-for-word.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b610 After completing the document, Robert and Teryl signed it. Teryl suggested that she should get her husband Ralph to sign the document also, and Robert agreed. Teryl went and got Ralph. According to Teryl, after Ralph arrived he looked at the will and said, \u201c[S]o [Teryl] wrote your will; did she sign it too?\u201d Robert then responded, \u201c[N]o; that\u2019s my shaky handwriting.\u201d Ralph then signed the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b611 After discovery, Roberta and Bobbi Jo filed cross-motions for summary judgment about the will\u2019s validity and enforceability. Concluding that the will is valid and enforceable, the District Court denied summary judgment for Roberta and granted judgment in favor of Bobbi Jo.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u00b612 In its October 16, 2013 Memorandum and Order, the District Court addressed three issues. First, the court determined that there was no issue of material fact about the execution of the will and that the will was properly executed as a matter of law. Second, the court ruled that Roberta failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact showing that Robert lacked testamentary capacity. Third, the court ruled that Roberta failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact about undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">\u00b613 Roberta challenges the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Bobbi Jo.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, using the standards set out in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Bailey v. St. Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149. We also apply de novo review to a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings made while resolving a motion for summary judgment. <em>In re Estate of Harmon, </em>2011 MT 84, \u00b6 14, 360 Mont. 150, 253 P.3d 821. If the moving party establishes an absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, the non-moving party must present substantial evidence reusing a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Smith v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639. Although a court draws all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the non-moving party, <em>Yellowstone II Dev. Grp., Inc. v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>2001 MT 41, \u00b6 32, 304 Mont. 223, 20 P.3d 755, its consideration is limited to admissible evidence; a cotut does not consider conclusory statements lacking specific factual support in the record. <em>PPL Mont., LLC. </em>v. <em>State, </em>2010 MT 64, \u00b6 84, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b6 15  In Montana, any adult of sound mind may make a will. Section 72-2-521, MCA. To be valid and enforceable, the will must be properly executed and not be the result of undue influence. Section 72-3-310, MCA. Roberta argues that Robert\u2019s will was not properly executed and was the result of undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u00b616 <em>1. Whether the court correctly concluded that the will was properly executed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u00b617 To be valid, an executed will must generally be (1) in writing, (2) signed by the testator, and (3) signed by two witnesses. Section 72-2-522(1), MCA. A valid witness signature is present when the witness \u201csigned within a reasonable time after having witnessed either the signing of the will ... or the testator\u2019s acknowledgement of that signature or acknowledgement of the will.\u201d Section 72-2-522(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\u00b618 Robert\u2019s will satisfies the first two execution requirements: it was in writing and Robert signed it. Roberta argues that the document does not satisfy the third requirement, however, because it lacks a second valid witness signature. Roberta does not dispute that Teryl\u2019s signature qualifies as a valid witness signature, but argues that Ralph\u2019s does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">\u00b619  To Roberta\u2019s point, Ralph indeed did not witness Robert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>signing the will. Ralph came over to Robert\u2019s house after Robert signed it. But a witness does not necessarily have to witness the testator signing the will. It is also proper to witness the testator\u2019s acknowledgment of his signature or of the will. Section 72-2-522(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b620 Bobbi Jo argues that the evidence demonstrates that Ralph witnessed Robert\u2019s acknowledgment of his signature on the will. Teryl testified that when Ralph came over to Robert\u2019s house, Ralph asked Robert whether the signature on the will was Teryl\u2019s, and Robert responded by stating, \u201c[N]o, that\u2019s my shaky handwriting.\u201d Robert\u2019s statement identified and acknowledged his signature on the document. Ralph signed shortly after that acknowledgment. Robert\u2019s statement, then, establishes Ralph\u2019s signature as a valid witness\u2019s signature, and establishes the will as properly executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b621 Although the District Court concluded as much, Roberta argues that the Gourt improperly considered Robert\u2019s statement. Roberta points out that, at the summary judgment stage, a court may consider only evidence that would be admissible at trial. <em>Alfson v. Allstate Prop. and Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 326, \u00b6 11, 372 Mont. 363, 313 P.3d 107. Roberta argues that the statement is not admissible because it is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and is inadmissible unless an exception applies. M. R. Evid. 801(c), 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b622 Robert\u2019s statement is indeed an out-of-court statement, but it is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Bobbi Jo offers the statement to prove that Robert acknowledged his signature. She does not offer the statement to prove what the statement asserted \u2014 that Robert was pointing to his own handwriting when he made the statement, or that Robert\u2019s handwriting was actually shaky. Those facts are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b623  Where the issue is the existence of a statement, not the truth of the matter asserted, Montana recognizes the verbal act doctrine. <em>Phillip R. Morrow, Inc. v. FBS Ins. Montana-Hoiness-Labor, Inc., </em>236 Mont. 394, 399, 770 P.2d 859, 862 (1989). The verbal act doctrine applies when an out-of-court statement \u201cis an <em>operative fact </em>which gives rise to legal consequences.\u201d <em>Morrow, </em>236 Mont, at 398,770 P.2d at 861 (emphasis in original). Under the verbal act doctrine, \u201cstatements may be admitted \u2018for the purpose of establishing the fact that the words had been said by the [declarant].\u2019 \u201d <em>Morrow, </em>236 Mont, at 399, 770 P.2d at 862 (quoting <em>State v. Collins, </em>178 Mont. 36, 44, 582 P.2d 1179, 1183 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u00b624 Here, what is material is the existence of Robert\u2019s statement acknowledging his signature. The statement\u2019s status as an acknowledgment is an operative fact because legal consequences flow from the fact\u2019s existence. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>710 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014) (defining an operative fact as a \u201cfact that affects an existing legal relation, esp. a legal claim.\u201d). The consequences are that Ralph signed after witnessing the acknowledgment, thereby rendering Ralph\u2019s signature a valid witness signature. As such, the document is rendered a properly executed will.</p>\n<p id=\"ATt\">\u00b625  We hold that the District Court properly considered Teryl\u2019s testimony about Robert\u2019s statement and correctly awarded summary judgment to Bobbi Jo on the issue of the will\u2019s execution. There is no dispute of material fact, and Bobbi Jo is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that the will was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b626 <em>2. Whether the court correctly concluded that Roberta failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact about undue influence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b627 The parly contesting a will bears the burden of establishing undue influence. Section 72-3-310, MCA. Undue influence consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">(1) the use by one in whom a confidence is reposed by another person or who holds a real or apparent authority over the other person of the confidence or authority for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage ov\u00e9r the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">(2) taking an unfair advantage of another person\u2019s weakness of mind; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">(3) taking a grossly oppressive and unfair advantage of another person\u2019s necessities or distress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Section 28-2-407, MCA. To establish undue influence, a party must present \u201cspecific acts\u201d showing that \u201cundue influence actually was \u2018exercised upon the mind of the testator directly to procure the execution of the will.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harmon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22 (quoting <em>In re Estate of Wittman, </em>2001 MT 109, \u00b6 21, 305 Mont. 290, 27 P.3d 35). A court should consider the opportunity for undue influence, including the testator\u2019s susceptibility to influence, and whether the disposition of property was natural. <em>In re Estate of Harms, </em>2006 MT 320, \u00b6 21, 335 Mont. 66, 149 P.3d 557. But \u2018\u2018[m]ere suspicion that undue influence may have or could have been brought to bear is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Wittman, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">\u00b628 The District Court ruled that Roberta failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact about undue influence. On appeal, Roberta argues that she raised a fact issue because (1) Bobbi Jo\u2019s birth certificate does not list Robert as Bobbi Jo\u2019s father, which suggests that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the d\u00edsp\u00f3sition of property to Bobbi Jo was unnatural, and (2) medical records show that Robert was taking heavy medication at the time of the will\u2019s execution, which shows that he was susceptible to undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b629 We agree with the District Court that Roberta\u2019s evidentiary submissions fall short for three reasons. First, although Roberta presents evidence that Robert was on medication, she fails to present substantial evidence that Robert was affected by that medication such that he was weak of mind. In her affidavit, Roberta states that, in 2011, she \u201cbecame concerned regarding [Robert\u2019s] mental capacity and noticed he was starting to fail.\u201d As we have observed, \u201c[g]eneral allegations of poor health are not sufficient to show undue influence.\u201d <em>Harmon, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b630 Second, that Robert is not listed on Bobbi Jo\u2019s birth certificate does not prove undue influence, particularly in fight of Roberta\u2019s admission that Robert was Bobbi Jo\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b631 Most importantly, Roberta fails to point to evidence of \u201cspecific acts\u201d of undue influence. <em>Harmon, </em>\u00b6 21. Roberta provides no evidence of any party actually using \u201cconfidence or authority\u201d over Robert, or taking \u201cunfair advantage\u201d of Robert\u2019s \"weakness of mind\u201d or \u201cdistress.\u201d Section 28-2-407, MCA. She does not specify who she believes unduly influenced Robert. Roberta instead points to evidence that perhaps could raise a suspicion of undue influence. But \u201cmere suspicion\u201d is not enough for Roberta to satisfy her burden. <em>Wittman, </em>\u00b6 21. \u201cSpecific acts\u201d are an essential element of Roberta\u2019s claim, <em>Harmon, </em>\u00b6 21; evidence bearing on Robert\u2019s mental state and kinship with Bobbi Jo is not evidence of \u201cspecific acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b632  When a party who carries the burden of production on a claim fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an essential element of that claim, there is no genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Harmon, </em>\u00b6 47. The law placed on Roberta the burden of establishing undue influence. Section 72-3-310, MCA. To meet that burden, Roberta \u201cwas required to present admissible evidence of specific acts of undue influence....\u201d <em>Harmon, </em>\u00b6 21. Because she failed to do so, she did not raise a triable issue of fact. The District Court correctly awarded summary judgment to Bobbi Jo on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">\u00b633  Because the will was properly executed and not the result of undue influence, the District Court was correct to conclude that the will is valid and enforceable. We affirm the District Court\u2019s October 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>2013 Memorandum and Order and its judgment in favor of Bobbi Jo. We remand for further proceedings consistent with the will.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-16\"> Bobbi Jo\u2019s birth certificate does not list Robert as her father.
