We affirm in part, reverse the judgment, and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">\u00b62 We review the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err hy departing from the plea agreement without giving Nauman the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by imposing conditions23,25,26, and 28-32 on Nauman\u2019s sentence?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-14\">\n<em>3. Does the use of the term \u201cpornography\u201d render condition 31 unconstitutionally vague?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">' \u00b63 In January 2001, Nauman was convicted of sexual assault, a felony, for molesting a 12-year-old girl. Nauman was sentenced to 20 years in Montana State Prison (MSP), with 10 years suspended upon conditions. As a result of the conviction, Naunian was required to register as a sexual offender pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-504, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">\u00b64 Upon his release in 2010, Nauman registered with the Kalispell Police Department as a sexual offender. He reported his address as an apartment building in Kalispell. In August 2011, Nauman\u2019s probation officer was informed that Nauman was no longer residing at that address. As Nauman failed to notify law enforcement about his changed address, he was charged on December 7,2011 with Failure to Register as a Sexual or Violent Offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u00b65 On November 21, 2012, Nauman entered into a plea agreement with the State. In exchange for a plea of guilty by <em>Alford</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>from Nauman, the State agreed to recommend that the District Court impose a suspended sentence of three years to the Department of Corrections (DOC). The plea agreement stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">Defendant understands that pursuant to Section 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA, the parties agree that the specific sentence set forth herein is the appropriate disposition of the case. Further, pursuant to 46-12-211(3), MCA, if the Court accepts the plea agreement, the court shall inform the Defendant that it will embody in the judgment and sentence the disposition provided for in the plea agreement. If the Court rejects the plea agreement, Defendant understands that pursuant to Section 46-12-211(4) the Court shall, on the record, inform the parties of that fact, advise him that the Court is not bound by the plea agreement, and afford him the opportunity to withdraw the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In the plea agreement, the parties also agreed to waive an updated Pre-sentence Investigation Report (PSI) and any further sex offender evaluation and to instead rely on the PSI prepared in 2001. The State agreed to recommend that the District Court impose the probation conditions recommended by the PSI and also agreed that the Defendant was free to argue against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b66 On November 21, 2012, Nauman objected to eight probation conditions recommended by the PSI prepared in 2001. In particular, he objected to the conditions that became conditions 23,25,26, and 28-32 of the District Court\u2019s judgment and sentence. As stated in the judgment and sentence, these conditions read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">23. The Defendant will participate in any counseling deemed necessary by his Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">25. The Defendant will have no contact with the victim of this crime ... or her family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">26. The Defendant will have no contact with minors without prior permission from his therapist and Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">28. The Defendant will enter in and successfully complete all phases of an MSOTA certified outpatient sex offender counseling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>program and follow all rules and requirements of said program. He will also complete an Abel Assessment of Deviant Arousal for program purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">29. The Defendant shall submit to polygraph examination upon the reasonable request of his supervising officer or therapist for purposes of case management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">30. The Defendant will not involve himself in any type of employment, service, or recreational pursuits, which involves the supervision of children^ Under no circumstances should the Defendant be in a position of authority over children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">31. The Defendant will not have possession of any pornography, nor will he frequent adult bookstores, or patronize establishments, where nude dancing is promoted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">32. The Defendant will not own a computer or have possession of and/or utilize access to Internet services without prior permission from his supervising officer and therapist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b67 Following hearings on November 21,2012 and December 6,2012, the District Court sentenced Nauman to MSP \u2014 not to the DOC, as agreed \u2014 for three years, all suspended, and imposed all eight probation conditions listed above. Nauman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u00b68 We review criminal sentences longer than one year for legality only. <em>State v. Holt, </em>2011 MT 42, \u00b6 7, 359 Mont. 308, 249 P.3d 470. We review the reasonableness of conditions or restrictions imposed on a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 8, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">\u00b69 <em>1. Did the District Court err by departing from the plea agreement without giving Nauman the opportunity to withdraw his guilty </em>plea? \u00b610 The State concedes and we agree that the parties reached a plea agreement of the type described in \u00a7 46-l2-211(l)(b), MCA, and that the District Court, when it sentenced Nauman to MSP rather than the DOC, erred by departing from the plea agreement without giving Nauman the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">\u00b611 Section 46-12-211, MCA, provides for three types of plea agreements. A (l)(b) agreement is formed when the parties agree that \u201cupon the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a charged offense ... the prosecutor will... agree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case.\u201d Section 46-12-2 ll(l)(b), MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Here, a (l)(b) agreement was formed when Nauman entered a guilty plea by <em>Alford, </em>and the State agreed that commitment to the DOC for three years, all suspended, was the appropriate disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ4\">\u00b612  If the court rejects a (l)(b) plea agreement, \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA requires \u201cthe court... [to] afford the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea... <em>.\u2019\u2019State v. Zunick, </em>2014 MT 239, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 16-19, 376 Mont. 293, 339 P.3d 1228. Here, it seems the District Court judge intended to accept the plea agreement, stating \u201cI have no problem... as to the basis for this agreement, which would be that the Court would commit you to Department of Corrections for a term of three years .... I would concur with that recommendation.\u201d However, the court ultimately rejected the (l)(b) plea agreement by sentencing Nauman to MSP for three years, all suspended. We have previously held that commitment to MSP is a more severe sentence than commitment to the DOC. <em>State v. Strong, </em>2009 MT 65, \u00b6 20, 349 Mont. 417,203 P.3d 848. Thus, the District Court here sentenced Nauman to a more severe sentence than contemplated by the plea agreement and rejected the plea agreement by doing so. It did not, however, give Nauman the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea, in violation of \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b613 For this reason, we reverse and remand with the instruction that the District Court either enter a sentence consistent with the plea agreement or allow Nauman to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b614 <em>2. Did the District Court err hy imposing conditions23,25,26, and 28-32 on Nauman\u2019s sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b615 Nauman argues that the District Court violated \u00a7 46-18-202(1), MCA, by imposing conditions 23, 25, 26, and 28-32 on his sentence. That statute and our case law require sentence conditions to have some nexus to the underlying offense or to the offender. <em>State v. Melton, </em>2012 MT 84, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 364 Mont. 482, 276 P.3d 900. Nauman claims that there was not enough evidence for the District Court to properly find a nexus in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b616 District courts are afforded broad discretion in criminal sentencing, and our review of sentencing conditions is correspondingly deferential. We will generally affirm a restriction or condition imposed pursuant to \u00a7:46-18-202(1), MCA, as long as the restriction or condition has some nexus to the underlying offense or to the offender. <em>Melton, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b617 A nexus to the offense or offender exists when the restriction or condition is \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim and society.\u201d <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>16, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 133,974 P.2d 620, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 12 n.l, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978; <em>State v. Malloy, </em>2004 MT 377, \u00b6 8, 325 Mont. 86, 103 P.3d 1064. A nexus to the offender is only sufficient to support the condition or restriction when a history or pattern of conduct to be restricted is recent, and significant or chronic. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b618  The District Court in this case properly based the conditions on such a history or pattern of conduct. It considered evidence that while on probation from his 2001 sexual assault sentence, Nauman concealed his true residence from his probation officer, had contact with children, kept photographs of underaged girls on his phone, resided with children in violation of his probation conditions, fled from his probation officer, and failed to register as a sexual offender. Additionally, the 2001 PSI, upon which the parties agreed to rely, portrayed Nauman as emotionally immature, inconsistent in his portrayal of certain events, and lacking remorse. Given this evidence, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing conditions reasonably related to rehabilitating Nauman or to protecting society from this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b619 Nauman argues, however, that his 2001 conviction should not have been considered in sentencing for the Failure to Register conviction. Yet, given similar evidence in <em>Melton, </em>we found that Melton\u2019s 1999 rape conviction was relevant to sentencing his 2010 Failure to Register conviction. Although Melton had a \u201clow risk\u201d to reoffend, he had failed to \u201caddressG his underlying issues which led him to engage in the unlawful sexual behavior in 1999.\u201d <em>Melton, </em>\u00b6 21. We, therefore, considered the 1999 rape conviction and held that the condition limiting Melton\u2019s contact with minors had an offender nexus. <em>Melton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Similarly, Nauman\u2019s behavior while on probation \u2014 keeping photographs of underage girls on his phone and contacting children \u2014 indicates that he has a continuing propensity to engage in the kind of behavior that led to his 2001 Conviction. For this reason, as in <em>Melton, </em>Nauman\u2019s 2001 conviction was relevant to sentencing for his Failure to Register conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b620 Nauman further argues that the crime he pled guilty to, Failure to Register, is not a sexual offense and, consequently, that there is no nexus to the conditions imposed, which include stock conditions imposed on sexual offenders. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-207(5), MCA; <em>State v. Brotherton, </em>2008 MT 119, \u00b6 16, 342 Mont. 511, 182 P.3d 88 (stating that stock conditions \u201care those which have been legislatively authorized\u201d). We have, however, declined to adopt such a categorical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>rule, stating that \u201c[e]ach case must turn on its specific facts.\u201d <em>State v. Bullplume, </em>2013 MT 169, \u00b6 24, 370 Mont. 453, 305 P.3d 753 (citing <em>Melton, </em>\u00b6 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b621 Furthermore, we have already found this argument to be unpersuasive in more than one instance. <em>See Melton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 26. In <em>Malloy, </em>the defendant was also charged with Failure to Register. Similarly to the present case, Malloy argued that conditions limiting his contact with minors and his access to pornography were inappropriate because failure to register is not a sexual offense. <em>Malloy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10, 12. We determined, however, that the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act was adopted \u201cto protect the public from the recidivism of sex offenders; to prevent victimization of vulnerable children; and to assist law enforcement in keeping track of the whereabouts of sex offenders.\u201d <em>Malloy, </em>\u00b6 13. Accordingly, we upheld the conditions on Malloy\u2019s Failure to Register sentence. <em>Malloy, </em>\u00b6 14. Similarly, Conditions 23, 25, 26, and 28-32 in this case were not improperly imposed merely because they were imposed on Nauman\u2019s Failure to Register sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b622  Thus, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing conditions 23, 25, 26, and 28-32, which were supported by evidence sufficient to demonstrate a nexus between the conditions and Nauman.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b623 <em>3. Does the use of the term </em>\u201cpornography\u201d <em>render condition 31 unconstitutionally </em>vague?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u00b624 In his November 21, 2012 sentencing memorandum, Naumafi argued that, in addition to lacking a nexus to the offense, condition 31 was unconstitutionally vague and a violation of his right to due process. He cited a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and one from the Ninth Circuit to support his argument, but otherwise Nauman limited his arguments to conclusory statements. The State\u2019s memorandum in response was limited to the nexus issue and did not address Nauman\u2019s constitutional vagueness argument. Similarly, the District Court did not address Nauman\u2019s constitutional challenge in any hearing or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\u00b625 We decline to review the issue here. Especially for those of constitutional importance, we will not review issues that the District Court has not ruled on and that have not been adequately briefed by the parties. If, on remand, the parties believe this issue needs to be decided, it should be briefed and ruled on by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b626 We hold that the District Court erred by rejecting the plea agreement without allowing Nauman the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. We also hold that the District Court did not err by imposing conditions 23,25,26, and 28-32 on Nauman\u2019s sentence. We decline to address Nauman\u2019s argument that the use of the term \u201cpornography\u201d in condition 31 renders the condition unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b627 We affirm in part, reverse the judgment, and remand to the District Court with the instruction that the District Court either enter a sentence consistent with the plea agreement or allow Nauman to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-6\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, SHEA and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\"> <em>North Carolina v.
