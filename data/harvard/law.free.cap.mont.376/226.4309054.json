We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b62 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it issued a commitment order without obtaining from A.M. an intentional and knowing waiver of his procedural rights as required by \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AAc\">\u00b63 A.M. is a 45-year-old male with a history of mental illness and attempted suicide. On July 13, 2013, A.M. voluntarily checked into Hope House in Bozeman, Montana. Upon his discharge on July 18, 2013, A.M. consumed all of his medications in an attempt at \u201crebirth.\u201d He walked to the emergency room where he was placed in the intensive care unit because his liver enzyme levels were elevated. When asked to describe his mental state, A.M. declined, stating: \u201c[It\u2019s] stuff I can\u2019t talk about. I\u2019d rather die than give things up.\u201d A:M. indicated that he does not consider himself suicidal; he said he had felt the need to rebirth and was still feeling that need. Becky Kronske, a certified professional person, interviewed A.M. and concluded that he appeared to be having grandiose delusions and was suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u00b64 On July 22, 2013, the State filed a petition for involuntary commitment and attached a report by Kronske. The District Court appointed the Office of the State Public Defender to represent A.M. and ordered a friend be appointed if the State could find a suitable person. Nothing in the record indicates that a friend was appointed. At an initial hearing that day, A.M. appeared with counsel via video conferencing. The District Court advised A.M. of his rights, and A.M.\u2019s counsel stated that A.M. had read a statement of rights before the hearing. A.M. said he had no questions about the rights. A.M.\u2019s counsel told the court: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">I talked to [A.M.], I came over at 11:30, or maybe a little bit before that, probably 11:00, and talked for a little while, and then I came back, again, before the hearing. And [A.M.] \u2014 his preference would simply be to go over to Warm Springs, at this point. He doesn\u2019t want to have a hearing to challenge the petition. He would stipulate that he has a mental disorder from a traumatic brain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>injury, but he\u2019s hopeful that a change of scenery would help him out with some of the matters that he\u2019s dealing with. And if that\u2019s incorrect, [A.M.], you just let me know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b65 A.M. responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">Well, it\u2019s just, already, in Livingston, I tried talking with people, attorneys and everything, and I got no response. I still have things at the Main Hotel, you know, personal belongings, paperwork, and everything, that I hope the Flacks haven\u2019t stolen, also, as they stole other things from me. So, I figured it\u2019d just be easier to just go up there. I\u2019d just as soon get the evaluation done and over with, since I\u2019ve already been up there, I\u2019ve worked in that area before, Butte, and everything, and maybe I can find an attorney up there that will help me in my case that the Courts consider going on in Livingston, and it shouldn\u2019t be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b66 The District Court approved the stipulation. Both the District Court and A.M.\u2019s counsel advised A.M. of his right to a second hearing. A.M. replied that there was no need for the hearing. The court then orally announced its finding that there was sufficient evidence in the record, together with the parties\u2019 stipulation, that A.M. had a mental disorder requiring a commitment. A.M. and his counsel expressed concern for A.M.\u2019s personal belongings at the hotel. A.M.\u2019s counsel suggested that someone from his office check on the items and attempt to secure them. Subsequently, the District Court entered a written order mandating that A.M. be committed to the Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs, Montana, for a period not exceeding 90 days. A.M. timely appealed the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b67 A.M. challenges his commitment as being implemented in violation of his procedural rights. Specifically, he argues that the District Court failed to follow the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-119( 1), MCA, in obtaining the waiver of these rights. The State counters that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, based upon A.M.\u2019s statements and his counsel\u2019s representations to the court, were more than sufficient to support the court\u2019s order and to meet the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s civil commitment order to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re R.W.K., </em>2013 MT 54, \u00b6 14, 369 Mont. 193, 297 P.3d 318 (citations omitted). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made after reviewing the entire record. <em>R.W.K., </em>\u00b6 14 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err when it issued a commitment order without obtaining from A.M. an intentional and knowing waiver of his procedural rights as required by \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b610 \u201cThis Court requires strict adherence to the statutory scheme governing involuntary commitment due to the critical importance of the constitutional rights at stake.\u201d <em>R.W.K., </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted). Involuntary commitment statutes afford a respondent many rights, includingrights to due process of law, to be present at any hearing, to offer evidence, and to present and cross-examine witnesses. <em>In re E.P.B., </em>2007 MT 224, \u00b6 12, 339 Mont. 107, 168 P.3d 662; <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 53-21-101(4), -115(2), and -115(4), MCA. \u201cAs these and other statutes make clear, a hearing on a petition for involuntary commitment is not merely a <em>pro forma </em>requirement, but an opportunity for the parties \u2014 both the petitioner and the respondent \u2014 to present evidence upon which the trial court can make required findings and enter appropriate orders.\u201d <em>E.P.B., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b611 Section 53-21-119(1), MCA, sets forth the requirements for a valid waiver of rights in a civil commitment action, and provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">A person may waive the person\u2019s rights, or if the person is not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision, these rights may be waived by the person\u2019s counsel and friend of respondent... acting together if a record is made of the.reasons for the waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">A district court must inquire into whether the person who is the subject of a petition for involuntary commitment is capable of making an intentional and knowing decision. <em>In re P.A.C., </em>2013 MT 84, \u00b6 12, 369 Mont. 407, 298 P.3d 1166. \u201cWhile \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, does not specify the type or level of inquiry necessary to constitute an intentional and knowing waiver ... [the court] and the parties must, make some record that the person who is the subject of the petition for involuntary commitment is capable of making a knowing and intelligent waiver of rights.\u201d <em>P.A.C., </em>\u00b6 13 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe nature and\u2019extent of the record will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d PA.C., \u00b6 14. At a minimum, the record must reflect that the attorney discussed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>waiver with her client, that the client desired to waive his rights, and that the attorney was satisfied that her client understood his rights and the nature of the proceeding. <em>P.A.C., </em>\u00b6 14; <em>R.W.K., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b612 In <em>R.W.K., </em>the respondent was accompanied at the commitment hearing by his attorney and appointed friend, and the district court opened the proceeding by reading R.W.K. a list of his rights. R.W.K\u2019s counsel made representations that he had met with R.W.K. and provided him with a copy of the petition, and that R. W.K had indicated he wished to waive his rights and stipulate to the allegations in the petition. His counsel represented to the court that though he was mentally ill, R.W.K. understood his rights and the nature of the proceedings, and that he had the capacity to knowingly and intentionally waive his procedural rights. Following statements from both counsel for R.W.K. and the State as to R.W.K.\u2019s knowing and intentional waiver of his procedural rights, the district court orally announced that the respondent had intelligently waived his rights; that he suffered from a serious mental illness; that he was a danger to himself; and that the least restrictive placement was a commitment to the Montana State Hospital. <em>R.W.K, </em>\u00b6 9. These oral findings were followed by a written order from the district court that included a full list of findings of fact and conclusions of law, including a finding that R.W.K. \u201cunderstands all procedural rights and that he waives those rights knowingly.\u201dR.W.K, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b613 We concluded in R.W.K. that the requisites of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, were met because the district court determined that the respondent was capable of making an intentional and knowing decision regarding his procedural rights, and that he validly waived those rights while accompanied in open court by his attorney and appointed friend. R.W.K., \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. We found no error in the district court\u2019s reliance on the representations of R.W.K\u2019s counsel given these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b614 Here, A.M. read the State\u2019s petition, and the District Court orally read a fist of A.M.\u2019s rights. However, neither A.M. nor his attorney made any representations to the District Court that A.M. understood his rights and the nature of the proceedings and that he had the capacity to knowingly and intentionally waive his procedural rights, nor did the District Court make any inquiry or record in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"Am-\">\u00b615  As the Court is encountering an increasing number of stipulations in involuntary commitment cases, we deem it necessary to reaffirm the principles of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, and our pronouncements in <em>P.A.C. </em>and R.W.K. We therefore hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>District Court may not accept a stipulation to an involuntary commitment without first making an affirmative determination on the record \u2014 based upon the evidence presented, including the representations of the respondent and/or his attorney and friend \u2014 that the person to be committed understands his procedural rights, and that he waives those rights intentionally and knowingly. In the alternative, if the respondent is not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision, the respondent\u2019s counsel and friend must make a record in compliance with \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA. Because no evidence was presented and no record was made in this case establishing a knowing and intentional waiver of A.M.\u2019s procedural rights, we must reverse the order of A.M.\u2019s commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b616 We emphasize that any waiver of rights should preferably be made by the respondent himself when he is capable of making that decision, rather than doing so through the representations of counsel. Though we recognize that each involuntary commitment proceeding presents unique circumstances, we encourage the court, where possible, to obtain on the record a personal waiver by the respondent of those rights he chooses to waive.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b617 Because the foregoing issue is dispositive, we do not reach the parties\u2019 remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">\u00b618  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, and supporting caselaw, thereby violating A.M.\u2019s statutory and due process rights. The District Court\u2019s order committing A.M. to the Montana State Hospital is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
