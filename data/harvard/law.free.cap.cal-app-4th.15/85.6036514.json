S.), J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlH\">Respondents Lee and Shirley Prentiss sought a building permit for construction of an addition to their single family home, from appellants the City of South Pasadena, its building and planning division, and its building and planning director. Respondents\u2019 application for the building permit became embroiled in controversy after appellants asserted that respondents\u2019 home was a \u201cqualified historic structure\u201d within the meaning of the State Historical Building Code. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 18950-18961.) Contending that the State Historical Building Code gave appellants discretion to require that alterations to respondents\u2019 home be done in a manner best preserving the historical character of the architecture, appellants insisted that an evaluation of the impact of the project on the \u201chistorical environment\u201d be conducted pursuant to the procedures of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.) Appellants thereafter offered to issue a \u201cmitigated negative declaration\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>under CEQA and to grant the building permit, on condition that respondents agree to recommendations of a consulting historical architect for changes in the building plans to preserve historical architectural compatibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">At that point respondents filed in superior court the present action for a writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085 or in the alternative \u00a7 1094.5) to compel issuance of the building permit without conditions. The trial court granted the writ on several alternative theories, including (1) CEQA does not apply, because issuance of a building permit free of the historical architectural conditions was a ministerial act, (2) even under CEQA, the project was categorically exempted based on the square footage involved, (3) even under CEQA, there is no substantial evidence of the likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the environment, and (4) appellants did not timely deny respondents\u2019 right to the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We affirm on the first ground and do not reach the others. Because respondents\u2019 application for a building permit required no variance or conditional use permit and fully complied with the Uniform Building Code, issuance of the requested building permit was a ministerial act to which CEQA does not apply. Appellants fail to show that any statute or ordinance gave appellants discretion to deny the permit on historical architectural grounds. In this respect appellants misinterpreted their authority under the State Historical Building Code, failing to distinguish between laws designed to <em>encourage voluntary </em>historical preservation by private property owners and zoning laws designed to <em>require </em>historical preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Respondents\u2019 home at 304 Oaklawn Avenue, along with several other residences on the same street, is considered part of the \u201cOaklawn District.\u201d This was a suburb developed shortly after the turn of the century. Many of the residences were designed by George Lawrence Stimson in the \u201cCraftsman Style.\u201d In fact, respondents\u2019 residence, constructed in 1907, was Stimson\u2019s own residence while he was developing most of the tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The Oaklawn District is \u201celigible\u201d for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470a.) Based on its eligibility for listing in the National Register, the Oaklawn District, including respondents\u2019 residence, was included in the State Historic Resources Inventory. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 5024.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Neither respondents\u2019 property nor the Oaklawn District was listed, however, in the city\u2019s own local inventory of cultural heritage landmarks, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>had the city by ordinance zoned the district as an historic district. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 5031, subd. (c); Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 37361, 50280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The existing residence is two stories. Respondents\u2019 proposed addition would make the height three stories.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Respondents\u2019 application for a building permit required no variance or conditional use permit, respondents\u2019 building plans complied fully with the Uniform Building Code, and respondents met all requirements for issuance of a building permit, under section 303 of the Uniform Building Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Appellants in fact <em>granted </em>the requested permit on August 27, 1990, but then issued a stop order on September 27,1990, contending that by virtue of the applicability of the State Historical Building Code, environmental review under CEQA was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In accordance with CEQA procedures (see Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21080, subd. (c)), the director of building and planning issued for public comment a proposed negative declaration that the project would have no significant adverse effect on the environment. Public opposition developed, however, and on December 5 and 19, 1990, the city council held public hearings. At the conclusion of the December 19 public hearing, the city council adopted a plan that a mitigated negative declaration would be issued, provided that respondents at their own expense consult an historical architect, that the consultant render an opinion as to the historic compatibility of the architecture and make recommendations for modification of the plans, and that respondents be issued the building permit upon agreement to the architect\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In January 1991, the consulting architect reported his opinion and recommendations for changes in the plans. The consultant noted that respondents\u2019 proposed plans were unquestionably \u201cin the Craftsman Style,\u201d that their design was not out of character with the neighborhood, that a three-story height was not itself objectionable, and that the location of the addition on the site was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The consultant suggested, however, that the height of the addition overpowered the original house, and certain vertical features and embellished ornamentation were inconsistent with the traditional horizontal emphasis and natural ornamentation of the Craftsman style. He recommended: (1) limiting to the first floor the new construction of an entry hall and covered porch, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>scaling back the massive appearance by eliminating a third floor artist\u2019s studio and depressing the ground floor game room, (3) changing the slope of the roof, and (4) deemphasizing vertical elements and overembellishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">On March 6, 1991, the city council gave respondents 90 days to comply with the consultant\u2019s recommendations. According to respondents\u2019 petition, the additional cost of complying with the consultant\u2019s recommendations is $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">On April 2, 1991, respondents filed the instant action. After a trial of less than one day on May 24, 1991, the trial court granted the writ of mandate, effectively upon all possible grounds. The court subsequently denied appellants\u2019 motion for new trial. The court entered a peremptory writ of mandate compelling appellants to reissue the building permit originally issued August 27, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Ordinarily issuance of a building permit for a project meeting the criteria of the applicable zoning ordinance and Uniform Building Code is a ministerial project to which CEQA does not apply. By asserting that the applicability of the State Historical Building Code made respondents\u2019 project a discretionary one which brought CEQA into play, appellants used CEQA to impose historical architecture conditions on the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The dispositive issue involves statutory interpretation as applied to essentially undisputed facts, and thus presents a question of law which we review independently of the trial court. <em>(Sutco Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Modesto High School Dist. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1220, 1228 [256 Cal.Rptr. 671].) We hold appellants\u2019 argument is based on an erroneous interpretation of the purpose of the State Historical Building Code, and that CEQA does not apply to respondents\u2019 project. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment granting a writ of ordinary mandamus to enforce a ministerial duty to issue a building permit. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085; see <em>Court House Plaza Co. </em>v. <em>City of Palo Alto </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 871, 880, 883 [173 Cal.Rptr. 161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">CEQA Applies Only to Discretionary Projects</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The purpose of CEQA procedures is to assist public agencies in evaluating whether projects which they have discretion to approve or disapprove will have a significant adverse effect upon the environment. (Pub. Resources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Code, \u00a7 21002.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By its own statutory definition, CEQA applies only to \u201cdiscretionary projects\u201d and does not apply to \u201cministerial projects.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21080, subds. (a), (b)(1).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If, under the applicable substantive law, an agency\u2019s approval is ministerial rather than discretionary, evaluation of environmental impact is unnecessary and CEQA does not apply. <em>(Friends of Westwood, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 259, 272 [235 Cal.Rptr. 788].)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The CEQA \u201cGuidelines\u201d (regulations issued by the Secretary for Resources) define discretionary and ministerial. \u201c \u2018Discretionary project\u2019 means a project which requires the exercise of judgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity, as distinguished from situations where the public agency or body merely has to determine whether there has been conformity with applicable statutes, ordinances or regulations.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u201c \u2018Ministerial\u2019 describes a governmental decision involving little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision. A ministerial decision involves only the use of fixed standards or objective measurements, and the public official cannot use personal, subjective judgment in deciding whether or how the project should be carried out. ... A building permit is ministerial if the ordinance requiring the permit limits the public official to determining whether the zoning allows the structure to be built in the requested location, the structure would meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>strength requirements of the Uniform Building Code, and the applicant has paid his fee.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u201cIn the absence of any discretionary provision contained in the local ordinance or other law establishing the requirements for a permit, . . . the following actions shall be presumed ministerial: [f] (1) Issuance of building permits.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15268, subd. (b)(1).) Appellants\u2019 own local ordinance implementing CEQA identifies building permits as ministerial projects not requiring CEQA compliance. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15268, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Building permits may sometimes be involved, however, in discretionary projects subject to CEQA. This includes when substantial discretion exists in the local ordinance <em>(Friends of Westwood, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d 259, 273-281 [\u201cmajor project\u201d permit involving 26-story building required substantial exercises of discretion]), when the permit is integral to a larger project subject to CEQA <em>(Orinda Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171-1172 [227 Cal.Rptr. 688]) or when other law vests discretion in connection with the permit <em>(People </em>v. <em>Department of Housing &amp; Community Dev. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 185, 190, 191-192, 194 [119 Cal.Rptr. 266] [construction permit ministerial under local law but subject to discretion of state agency under State Mobilehome Parks Act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">CEQA and Historical Buildings</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The distinction between ministerial and discretionary projects applies as well when an historic building is involved. Whether CEQA applies in the first place depends not on the historic character itself but on whether the <em>project </em>is ministerial or discretionary. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21080, subds. (a), (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">For example, in <em>Adams Point Preservation Society </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 203 [237 Cal.Rptr. 273], preservationists sought to require compliance with CEQA before issuance of a permit to demolish an historic dwelling. The court held CEQA did not apply, because the issuance of the demolition permit was a ministerial, not discretionary, act. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 206-208.) Similarly, in <em>Environmental Law Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Watsonville </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 711 [177 Cal.Rptr. 542], opponents of demolition of an historic building sought to require CEQA compliance before issuance of a demolition permit. The court held issuance of the demolition permit was ministerial, therefore CEQA did not apply. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 715-717.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The mere listing of a building on an official inventory of historic resources does not necessarily show that public officials exercise discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>over the private owner\u2019s projects involving that building. <em>(Foundation for San Francisco\u2019s Architectural Heritage </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 893, 914 [165 Cal.Rptr. 401].) In <em>Orinda Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.3d 1145, a theater building proposed to be demolished was eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1153 and fn. 3.) The court held the demolition involved a discretionary project, not because of the historic status but because it was part of a larger project which did involve official discretion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1171-1172.) In <em>San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Friends of Gill </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 203 [174 Cal.Rptr. 784], owners of a dwelling which was listed on both the local and national registers of historic sites sought a demolition permit. The reason CEQA was held to apply was not the historic status by itself. Rather, the city had a specific ordinance which required that no permit for demolition of a building listed in the city\u2019s register of historic sites could be issued without first being reviewed by an historical site board. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 206-207 and fn. 2.) It was because the court construed that ordinance to mean the board had discretion to delay the project pending a search for alternatives, that the project was held a discretionary one to which CEQA applied. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 209-214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Here, although it appears the City of South Pasadena\u2019s cultural heritage ordinance (Ord. No. 1591) contains a similar provision to delay the demolition or substantial alteration of its designated cultural landmarks, that ordinance does not apply to respondents\u2019 property or the Oaklawn District, which have not been so designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">We note that <em>if </em>a project involving an historic building is discretionary, so as to bring CEQA into play, the effect on the historical environment must be considered. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21001, subd. (b), 21084, subd. (e), 21084.1.) This would not necessarily mean the building must be preserved, because the public agency might find that other considerations outweigh the adverse effect on the historical environment. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21002, 21002.1, subd. (c); <em>Dusek </em>v. <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1039 [219 Cal.Rptr. 346]; <em>Foundation for San Francisco\u2019s Architectural Heritage </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at p. 917.) Neither evaluation of the historical effects nor their balancing against other considerations is reached, however, if the project is ministerial so that CEQA is not invoked in the first place. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21080, subds. (a), (b)(1); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15300.1; <em>Association for Protection etc. Values </em>v. <em>City of Ukiah </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 720, 733 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 488].)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Application of the State Historical Building Code</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The core question in this case is whether the applicability of the State Historical Building Code to respondents\u2019 residence changes respondents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>project from a ministerial to a discretionary one, so as to invoke CEQA and require environmental review or authorize environmental mitigation conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">In order to place the State Historical Building Code into context, we first provide a brief overview of governmental historical preservation measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Although the government may acquire privately owned historic property by eminent domain (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 37361, 25373), this is an economically impractical method of historical preservation. Many governmental programs seek by various incentives to encourage the private owner voluntarily to preserve the historical character of the property. (See 3 Manaster &amp; Selmi, Cal. Environmental Law and Land Use Practice (1992) \u00a7\u00a7 60.132-60.134; Gray, <em>A Guide to Historic Preservation for the California Practitioner </em>(1981) 21 Santa Clara L.Rev. 613, 645.) These include low-interest rehabilitation loans (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 37600 et seq.) and favorable tax treatment (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 439-439.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In recognition of the property rights of owners, Government Code section 50280 et seq., enacted in 1972, authorized a city, county, or city and county to create historic zones for the purpose of entering into <em>contracts </em>with owners to restrict the use of qualified historical property in order to preserve or restore it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>In contrast to these techniques of encouraging voluntary preservation of historic private property, mandatory zoning and land use restrictions raise issues of governmental taking of property. In <em>San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Friends of Gill, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.3d 203, the court construed an ordinance as giving the local historical site board discretion to <em>delay, </em>for a limited period, a permit for demolition of an historical dwelling, during which alternatives for preservation of the building could be explored. The court cautioned, however, that outright denial of the demolition permit might constitute inverse condemnation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 214.) In <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 104 [57 L.Ed.2d 631, 98 S.Ct. 2646], the Supreme Court upheld a municipal landmark law under which the owner of Grand Central Terminal was not allowed to alter the historic features of the structure, at least where the landmark law gave the owner compensating advantages. (See Annot. (1982) Validity and Construction of Statute or Ordinance Protecting Historical Landmark, 18 A.L.R.4th 990.) In California, cities and counties are authorized by Government Code sections 37361 and 25373 to enact ordinances and regulations for the protection of historic places or districts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Bohannan </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 416, 420 [106 Cal.Rptr. 333], the court upheld a San Diego architectural control ordinance (apparently based on Gov. Code, \u00a7 37361) which regulated buildings in the historic area known as \u201cOld Town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The mere listing of a private property on the State Historical Resources Inventory, based on its being \u201celigible\u201d for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (National Register), is not by itself a substantive restriction on the owner\u2019s use of the property. <em>(Foundation for San Francisco\u2019s Architectural Heritage </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d 893, 914; Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5024, 5020.1, 5024.1; see Rose, <em>Preservation and Community: New Directions in the Law of Historic</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>Preservation </em>(1981) 33 Stan.L.Rev. 473, 497-502.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to privately owned historical property, these statutes \u201cprovide only for the registration of state historical sites[,] impose no restraints on use of those sites and do not require preservation in any particular form. The only purpose of the state program is to list and mark significant sites.\u201d <em>(Foundation for San Francisco\u2019s Architectural Heritage </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at p. 914.) In its 1992 revamping of the statutes relating to compilation of lists identifying the state\u2019s historic resources, the Legislature expressly recognized \u201cthat the long-term preservation and enhancement of historical resources is dependent, to a large extent, on the good will and cooperation of the general public and of public and private owners of those resources. [][] Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that public agencies, including the [State Historical Resources Commission and the State Office of Historic Preservation], shall endeavor to carry out their responsibilities under this article in a manner designed to elicit the cooperation of the owners of both identified and unidentified resources, to encourage the owners to perceive these resources as assets rather than liabilities, and to encourage the support of the general public for the preservation and enhancement of historical resources.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 5020.7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">In the instant case, the City of South Pasadena has not, under either Government Code section 37361 or former section 50280, enacted any ordinance which regulates the properties in respondents\u2019 neighborhood or creates an historic zone. The record suggests that the city once considered, but rejected, the creation of an historic district zone for this neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The sole authority on which appellants rely for their discretion to control the architecture of respondents\u2019 property to achieve historical preservation is the State Historical Building Code and CEQA. In other words, appellants contend that even though the city has no local ordinance giving appellants discretion as to historical architectural control, the State Historical Building Code is an \u201cother law\u201d which makes respondents\u2019 project discretionary. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15268, subd. (b)(1), quoted, <em>ante, </em>p. 91.) This argument misinterprets the purpose and function of the State Historical Building Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The purpose of the State Historical Building Code, enacted in 1975, was explained in the enabling legislation and the code regulations. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 18950-18961; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 8.) \u201cIt is the purpose of this part to provide alternative building regulations and building standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>for the rehabilitation, preservation, restoration (including related reconstruction), or relocation of buildings or structures designated as historic buildings. Such alternative building standards and building regulations are intended to facilitate the restoration or change of occupancy so as to preserve their original or restored architectural elements and features, to encourage energy conservation and a cost-effective approach to preservation, and to provide for the safety of the building occupants.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 18951.) \u201cIt is the intent of this part to provide means for the preservation of the historical value of designated buildings and, concurrently, to provide reasonable safety from fire, seismic forces or other hazards for occupants of such buildings, and to provide reasonable availability to and usability by, the physically handicapped.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 18953.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">As explained in the introduction and historical preface preceding California Code of Regulations, title 24, part 8, section 8-100, \u201c[t]his new code will give enforcing authorities a tool previously not available in dealing with historical structures. . . . The intent of the SHBC is to save California\u2019s architectural heritage by recognizing the unique construction problems inherent in historical buildings and by providing a code to deal with these problems. . . . [The advisory committee found that] \\ . . restoration . . . is frequently made difficult by unnecessarily rigid interpretation of building . . . codes.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Health and Safety Code section 18954 provides \u201c[r]epairs, alterations and additions necessary for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, moving, or continued use of a historical building or structure <em>may be made if they conform to this part.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) <em>\u201cThese regulations control and allow alternatives to any and all prevailing codes when dealing with qualified historical buildings or sites.\u201d </em>(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 8, \u00a7 8-102, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The purpose of the State Historical Building Code is therefore clear, to <em>allow, </em>in the case of qualified historical buildings, alterations which otherwise would not meet the standards of the regular prevailing building code, such as the Uniform Building Code. The State Historical Building Code fits the pattern of laws designed to <em>encourage </em>private owners to preserve historically significant properties. The State Historical Building Code is not, however, a device by which a city or county may compel an owner to preserve the historical character of the property. Appellants erroneously interpreted the State Historical Building Code to give appellants discretion to <em>disallow </em>any alteration to an historical building even where, as in this case, the owner\u2019s proposed alteration <em>meets </em>all the requirements of the Uniform Building Code and the owner is not requesting any special treatment under the State Historical Building Code. Appellants\u2019 interpretation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>inconsistent with the purpose of the State Historical Building Code and with section 8-104 of the regulations, which provides, \u201cIt is not the intent of these regulations to allow non-historical expansion or addition to a historical building <em>unless such expansion or addition conforms to all prevailing codes and </em>regulations.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 8, \u00a7 8-104, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Appellants\u2019 argument correctly states several premises, but draws an erroneous conclusion as to respondents\u2019 project. Appellants contend: (1) by being on the State Historic Resources Inventory, respondents\u2019 property is a \u201cqualified historical building\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 18955); (2) the State Historical Building Code \u201cshall apply\u201d to all qualified historical structures (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 18952); (3) the \u201cbuilding department of every city or county shall apply the provisions of alternative standards and building regulations\u201d adopted by the State Historical Building Safety Board (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 18954); and (4) under the regulations in the code, discretion exists as to which of several alternative methods of construction may be allowed. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 8, \u00a7 8-108.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">From these premises appellants erroneously conclude that therefore respondents\u2019 project is discretionary. Respondents\u2019 project meets all the requirements of the Uniform Building Code and does not require the exercise of any discretion involving alternative methods of construction. The fact that discretion could conceivably be exercised in projects arising under the State Historical Building Code does not mean that <em>respondents' </em>project was discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The State Historical Building Code <em>allows </em>alterations to historical structures by alternative methods which would not meet the requirements of the otherwise prevailing code. The inclusion of respondents\u2019 property on the state inventory made the property eligible for the benefits of the State Historical Building Code. The requirement that every city and county building department \u201cshall apply\u201d the State Historical Building Code means that they <em>must </em>allow the owner to use the approved alternative methods. Appellants, however, would interpret the State Historical Building Code to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>authorize a building and planning department to <em>prevent </em>any alteration to an historical structure, if the alteration is not deemed \u201chistorically correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">We find no basis in law for appellants\u2019 interpretation. The city did not create an historic zone under former Government Code sections 50280 and 50281 to contract with owners for preservation. The city did not enact a regulatory historic district architectural control ordinance for this neighborhood. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 37361; <em>Bohannan </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d 416, 420-421.) The city did not even include this property within its inventory of cultural heritage landmarks so as to bring it within the permit requirements of the city\u2019s cultural heritage ordinance. <em>(San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Friends of Gill, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.3d 203, 206-207, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">If appellants\u2019 argument were correct, then merely because an owner\u2019s home was eligible for listing in the National Register, the local building and planning department could prohibit any alterations to the building. To adopt appellants\u2019 interpretation would mean that through the State Historical Building Code and CEQA, local building and planning authorities hold far more strict and pervasive power over private owners of historical property than would exist even under a properly drafted historical preservation ordinance, which must carefully draw the line between \u201cregulation\u201d and \u201ctaking.\u201d <em>(Penn Central Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, supra, </em>438 U.S. 104.) Appellants cannot use the guise of CEQA evaluation as a substitute for a proper zoning ordinance.
