Stop!,\u201d may the defendant be convicted of <em>two </em>counts of robbery? Our answer is <em>yes. </em>We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">The facts may be stated simply. Our perspective favors the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303-304 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>On December 31, 1991, at 10 a.m., Lorraine Dingman, a paraplegic, parked her car in the large Pico Rivera indoor swap meet parking lot. Her employer, Carolina Pantoja, also having just arrived for work, helped Ms. Dingman into her wheelchair. Ms. Pantoja gave Ms. Dingman her purse to hold so she could push Ms. Dingman\u2019s wheelchair. Ms. Dingman put both purses on her lap. The two women were accompanied by Ms. Pantoja\u2019s two young sons, one of whom was carrying a carpet sweeper. As Ms. Pantoja \u201cwas wheeling her [Ms. Dingman] in\u201d they stopped because Ms. Pantoja\u2019s son \u201cstarted having trouble with the carpet sweeper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Appellant approached from Ms. Pantoja\u2019s right, bent over Ms. Dingman, and grabbed both purses. Ms. Dingman held on to them. They \u201cstruggled back and forth.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ms. Dingman \u201cheld on as tight as [she] could.\u201d Appellant was \u201cfighting\u201d her.\u201d \u201cHe kept pulling them from [her].\u201d Ms. Dingman screamed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Ms. Pantoja, four to five feet away, realized Ms. Dingman \u201cwas being robbed\u201d and yelled at appellant: \u201cWhat are you doing? Stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Finally,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant pulled the purses from Ms. Dingman and began to run away. A station wagon approached and the driver opened the passenger door for appellant. Appellant, pursued by Ms. Pantoja and others, ran toward the station wagon. The driver,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> apparently seeing the pursuers, drove <em>off </em>without appellant. The driver drove to nearby Paramount Boulevard, stopped, let appellant enter, and drove off. A witness, who had observed the robbery and the foot pursuit, followed them in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">About 20 minutes later, having abandoned the car, appellant and the driver were arrested while seated on a bus bench. Appellant had Ms. Dingman\u2019s watch and money in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">By amended information appellant was charged with the robbery of Ms. Dingman (count I) and Ms. Pantoja (count II). A jury convicted him of both. The trial court sentenced appellant to a five-year state prison term on count I (the upper term for second degree robbery), and a concurrent five-year term on count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Appellant does not contest his robbery conviction of Ms. Dingman. Nor does he contest his sentence for that conviction. His sole contention<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is this: <em>as to Ms. Pantoja, </em>the elements of robbery are lacking. We consider this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u201cRobbery is the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211.) \u201cFear\u201d includes fear for \u201canyone in the company of the person robbed . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The elements of robbery<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are: (1) a taking (2) of personal property (3) in the possession of another (4) from her person or immediate presence (5) against her will (6) accomplished by means of force or fear (7) with an intent to permanently deprive.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Appellant argues three of these elements were not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">1. <em>An intent to permanently deprive</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Appellant does <em>not </em>claim insufficient evidence of an intent to steal. He concedes there was ample proof he intended to steal both purses.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Rather, he argues there was no proof he specifically intended to steal Ms. Pantoja\u2019s purse <em>because he didn\u2019t know one of the purses belonged to her.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The argument is specious. Knowledge of owner identity is not an element of robbery. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873, 880 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">2. <em>A taking from her immediate presence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Appellant suggests that since there was no physical contact with Ms. Pantoja, the taking was not from her person or immediate presence. Appellant is mistaken<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u201cThe generally accepted definition of immediate presence ... is that \u2018 \u201c[a] thing is in the [immediate] presence of a person, in respect to robbery, which is so within his reach, inspection, observation or control, that he could, if not overcome by violence or prevented by fear, retain his possession of it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, 626-627 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376].) \u201cUnder this definition, property may be found to be in the victim\u2019s immediate presence \u2018even though it is located in another room of the house, or in another building on [the] premises.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 627.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u201cImmediate presence\u201d is satisfied when: the victims have been put in a walk-in refrigerator while money is taken from a cash register <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 553 [180 Cal.Rptr. 266, 639 P.2d 908]); the victims are tied up in one room while property is taken from another room <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 519 [186 Cal.Rptr. 373]); the victim is assaulted in a motel room one hundred seven feet away from the motel office from which the property is stolen <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra, 52 </em>Cal.3d 577, 626-629); a robber crashes through a ceiling into an office, causing the victim to flee, and then steals from the office <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hays </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 534 [195 Cal.Rptr. 252]); the victim is lured one-quarter mile away from his car by robbers who attack and kill him and then steal his car <em>(People </em>v. <em>Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411, 439-442 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273]).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The taking of Ms. Pantoja\u2019s purse, while she was four to five feet away from it and seeing it taken, was from her immediate presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>3. <em>Accomplished by means of force or fear</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As appellant notes, it is not enough that there be \u201cforce\u201d or \u201cfear.\u201d The \u201cforce\u201d or \u201cfear\u201d must be the <em>means </em>by which the taking was accomplished.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to Ms. Dingman, this element was unquestionably satisfied. Appellant physically struggled with Ms. Dingman in order to take the purses and it was this force which resulted in the taking. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Welsh </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 209 [60 P.2d 124] [Defendant threw the victim into his car, drove away, told her he wanted sex, and while driving reached over, took her purse, removed cigarettes, returned her purse. Held: no robbery (of the cigarettes)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">But in order for Ms. Pantoja to also be a robbery victim appellant must have taken her property and he must have accomplished that taking by means of force or fear <em>as to her.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Since appellant used no force against Ms. Pantoja, the question becomes was <em>fear </em>used. An example may illuminate the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">If, after Ms. Pantoja gave her purse to Ms. Dingman, she had said \u201cOh, wait a moment I have to get something from my car,\u201d and was 100 feet away when she saw appellant wrench her purse from Ms. Dingman and escape\u2014 Ms. Pantoja would not be a robbery victim. Irrespective of any fear she might have felt for herself or for Ms. Dingman (Pen. Code, \u00a7 212), that fear would <em>not </em>have been the means by which appellant accomplished the taking of her purse. Being 100 feet away she was simply too distant to prevent the taking, fear or no fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">To return to the question: could a reasonable juror have believed appellant\u2019s conduct discouraged Ms. Pantoja from trying to prevent the theft of her purse?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">This very question was presented to the trial judge in ruling upon appellant\u2019s Penal Code section 1118.1 motion. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">\u201cThe element of fear in the crime of robbery may be either the fear of unlawful injury to the person, of the person robbed, or . . .of anyone in the company of the person robbed at the time of the robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">\u201cThis woman is pushing the other victim in the wheelchair, and the purse is in her lap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cSo it would certainly appear it\u2019s a jury question. I think you could argue it to the jury; but as far as 1118 is concerned, I think the people have made enough to get to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">\u201cBefore I heard this witness testify [Ms. Pantoja], I assumed she had\u2014she had laid her purse down and gone somewhere else. But the evidence now is that she was right there and it was\u2014and was pushing the chair and momentarily had her attention attracted <em>[sic] </em>by her son, who was having trouble with the sweeper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cThe motion under 1118 is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We agree. Substantial evidence permits the reasonable inference that appellant\u2019s forceful struggle to wrest the purses from Ms. Dingman caused Ms. Pantoja to be fearful and shocked. Accordingly, she was less inclined or able than she otherwise would have been to prevent appellant from taking her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">We therefore find appellant accomplished the taking of Ms. Pantoja\u2019s purse by means of fear. All the elements of robbery were satisfied as to Ms. Pantoja.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Lillie, P. J., concurred. Johnson, J., concurred in the judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 29, 1993. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\">As a result of the struggle Ms. Dingman sustained bruises across her stomach and shoulders. Also, her arms were sore.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Ms. Dingman estimated the struggle as taking two to three minutes, Ms. Pantoja\u2019s estimate was three to four seconds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Jointly charged with appellant, he pleaded guilty and is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b227-11\">Appellant\u2019s other contention\u2014that the trial court erred by not sua sponte instructing on the \u201cnecessarily included offense\u201d of grand theft from a person (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. 2.) regarding count II\u2014is spurious. No property was taken from the person of Ms. Pantoja. Further, grand theft from a person is not a necessarily included offense of robbery.
