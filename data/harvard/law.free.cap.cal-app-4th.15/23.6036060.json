Admin. Code, ch. 37). In a conditional order for entry of unlawful detainer judgment pursuant to stipulation, dated December 6, 1988, Sylve specifically reserved the right to sue the Rileys should their son and daughter-in-law not in fact move in. She vacated the premises on or about December 27. An amended order for stipulation for entry of unlawful detainer judgment, filed March 24, 1989, contained the same reservation of the right to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">In May 1989, Sylve noticed that her former apartment appeared to be vacant. In January 1990, when it still appeared vacant, she concluded the reasons stated in her eviction notice had been false. On December 31, 1990, Sylve filed a complaint against the Rileys for violation of the rent ordinance, negligence and fraud. On November 13, 1991, the Rileys filed a motion for summary judgment (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c) on the grounds the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. On November 26, they filed a cross-complaint alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress and trespass. After a hearing, the trial court granted the summary judgment motion. The judgment of dismissal entered on January 30, 1992, was not appealable because the cross-complaint was still pending. <em>(California Dental Assn. </em>v. <em>California Dental Hygienists\u2019 Assn. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 49, 59 [271 Cal.Rptr. 410].) On May 18, 1992, the trial court filed an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>dismissing the cross-complaint pursuant to stipulation. Sylve filed a timely notice of appeal. <em>(Chauncey </em>v. <em>Niems </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 967, 971 [227 Cal.Rptr. 718].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The mandatory treble damages provision of San Francisco Administrative Code section 37.9, subdivision (f) brings this action within the one-year statute of limitations prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (1). <em>(Menefee </em>v. <em>Ostawari </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 239, 243-245 [278 Cal.Rptr. 805].)  The limitations period begins to run upon service of a facially invalid eviction notice. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 245-246 [\u201cchange of ownership\u201d not statutorily authorized reason for eviction].)  Sylve contends the limitations period was tolled in this case until January 1990, when she concluded the Rileys had never intended to move their son into her former apartment, or in the alternative, that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether she knew the eviction was improper as early as May 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"> Under the delayed discovery rule,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the limitations period does not begin to run until a plaintiff discovers or could have discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence all facts essential to her cause of action. <em>(Leaf </em>v. <em>City of San Mateo </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 398, 407 [163 Cal.Rptr. 711].)  The Rileys contend Sylve was insufficiently diligent in investigating her suspicion that their son was not occupying the premises.  Whether reasonable diligence was exercised is generally a question of fact <em>(id. </em>at p. 409) precluding summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The Rileys cite <em>Jolly </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103,1111 [245 Cal.Rptr. 658, 751 P.2d 923], for the proposition that once Sylve suspected wrongdoing, she had a duty to investigate, and <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bechtel Corp. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 868 [191 Cal.Rptr. 619, 663 P.2d 177], for the proposition that Sylve\u2019s suspicion put her on inquiry notice of a potential wrongdoing which an investigation would have confirmed. Unlike these cases, however, this is not a case where the uncontradicted facts are susceptible of only one legitimate inference. <em>(Jolly </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 1112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The rent ordinance states that in order for a landlord to recover possession of a rental unit for use by a relative the relative must occupy the premises \u201cfor a period of at least 12 continuous months.\u201d (S.F. Admin. Code, \u00a7 37.9, subd. (a)(8).) It is silent as to how soon after eviction the landlord\u2019s relative must move in. It does not say how long the landlord has for renovation and/or repair after the tenant moves out.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, there are triable issues of fact as to when, if ever, the appearance of vacancy constituted inquiry notice of the Rileys\u2019 lack of intent to move their son into the premises, and what, if any, further investigation was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The problem this case presents, moreover, is inherent in the ordinance\u2019s language or lack thereof: Absent a visible \u201cfor rent\u201d sign or evidence someone other than the landlord\u2019s designated relative is in residence, when and how is any tenant evicted under San Francisco Administrative Code section 37.9, subdivision (a)(8) put on inquiry notice that she may have a cause of action for wrongful eviction? How long may a landlord relying on this subdivision leave a unit unoccupied before the relative takes possession? How much time does such a landlord have to complete repairs or renovation before the relative moves in?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Absent more precise time limits, there will always be a factual dispute as to when the statute of limitations begins to run. This is not fair to either the landlord or the former tenant. Both parties would be better served if San Francisco amended its ordinance to require the designated relative to occupy the premises within a specified period after the tenant vacates the premises. An extension could be granted for repairs or renovation.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The Rileys cite <em>Dept. of Social Welfare </em>v. <em>Stauffer </em>(1943) 56 Cal.App.2d 699, 704 [133 P.2d 692], for the proposition that the delayed discovery rule is not applicable to Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (1). They have inexplicably omitted from their discussion of that case, and replaced by an elipsis in a lengthy quotation therefrom, the repeatedly expressed qualification, \u201c[i]n the absence of allegations of fraud,\u201d which clearly distinguishes it from the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Since we hold the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because there is a triable issue of fact as to the tolling of the one-year statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>limitations (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 340, subd. (1)), we need not consider Sylve\u2019s contention that there are also common law causes of action for damages for eviction in violation of the rent ordinance, subject only to a three-year statute of limitations (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subds. (a), (d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Sylve shall recover her costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Peterson, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The Rileys point out that Sylve expressly eschewed reliance on the delayed discovery rule below, and insist she cannot assert a new theory on appeal. \u201cThe general rule is that a party to an action may not for the first time on appeal change the theory upon which the case was tried. . . . The exception to this rule exists where a question of law only is presented on the facts appearing in the record.\u201d <em>(Curcio </em>v. <em>Svanevik </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 955, 960 [202 Cal.Rptr. 499], citations omitted.) \u201cWhether the rule is to be applied is largely a question of an appellate court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>(Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc. </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 869, 874 [242 Cal.Rptr. 184].)</p>\n<p id=\"A6D\">In this case there is no significant difference between \u201cdelayed discovery\u201d and \u201cfraudulent concealment,\u201d the theory on which Sylve purportedly proceeded below and which she again raises on appeal. Whatever the label, Sylve\u2019s theory is that her cause of action did not accrue until the failure of the Rileys\u2019 son and daughter-in-law to occupy the premises revealed that she had been wrongfully evicted based on a false statement of reasons in the 30-day notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In a response to Sylve\u2019s interrogatories dated September 20, 1991, the Rileys claimed their son was inhabiting the premises part-time while repairs were being made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Section 37.9, subdivision (a)(ll), of the rent ordinance provides a landlord may evict a tenant in order to \u201ccarry out capital improvements or rehabilitation work\u201d for which \u201call the necessary permits\" have already been obtained, in which case the tenant retains a \u201cright to reoccupy.\u201d Subdivision (a)(12) of section 37.9 allows eviction in order to carry out \u201csubstantial rehabilitation\u201d for which all necessary permits have been obtained. The Rileys cited neither of these subdivisions in the 30-day notice they sent Sylve.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
