J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoNk\">After denial of his motion to compel disclosure of a confidential surveillance location, appellant Sean Michael Hollins pled no contest to one count of sale of cocaine. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352.) Having obtained a certificate of probable cause, he appeals the adverse ruling, contending that the court erred in upholding the officer\u2019s claim of privilege and in failing to strike his testimony or grant other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">On October 12, 1991, San Jose Police Sergeant Scott Cornfield observed intermittent contact between appellant, who was pacing back and forth in front of a liquor store, and Richard Chavez, who was riding a bicycle around a nearby parking lot. On one occasion, appellant handed Chavez a \u201csmall pebble-like object.\u201d Five minutes later, Chavez directed a car to pull up in front of the liquor store, and Chavez gave something to the driver and received a single piece of currency. Chavez got back on his bicycle, approached appellant, and gave him cash. Appellant handed Chavez another pebble-like object and then entered the liquor store.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">When appellant left the store, he was arrested. Chavez observed this, swallowed something he was holding in his hand, and rode quickly away.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Appellant\u2019s pockets were searched. He possessed one rock of base cocaine and less than an ounce of marijuana. Chavez was arrested later, and possessed neither money nor cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Cornfield testified at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing, but refused to identify the location from which he made the observations except to say that it was \u201cwithin 100 feet of the liquor store.\u201d He claimed \u201cthe privilege under 1040-1042 of the Evidence Code in that to be more specific would clearly hinder any further investigations that would be done in this area.\u201d Appellant objected, but the magistrate sustained this claim of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Defense counsel brought a \u201cmotion to suppress evidence\u201d in the superior court seeking disclosure of the surveillance location.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant pointed out that Cornfield\u2019s testimony was the sole evidence that he had not purchased for personal use the single rock with which he was found at the time of arrest. Appellant also questioned the accuracy of Cornfield\u2019s testimony because he claimed to have made his observations without the aid of binoculars.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The trial court ordered an in camera hearing on the issue. When it denied the motion, it declared itself satisfied that the officer was justified in claiming a privilege against disclosure due to ongoing surveillance from the site. The court also found that the officer had adequate opportunity to observe and concluded that appellant had not suffered interference with his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">After ruling, the court stated that defense counsel would be permitted to cross-examine Cornfield at trial with regard to all aspects of his opportunity to observe except for his exact location, and the court agreed to issue a certificate of probable cause for appeal. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1237.5.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant entered a nolo contendere plea, and received a three-year mitigated term in state prison concurrent with his sentence in an unrelated robbery. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Appellant claims that the court erred in upholding Cornfield\u2019s assertion of privilege pursuant to Evidence Code section 1040 because there was no showing that Cornfield\u2019s discovery of a desirable surveillance site amounted to information acquired by him \u201cin confidence.\u201d He also complains that the need to preserve secrecy to protect subsequent investigations is not a sufficient justification for a claim of privilege. Finally, even if Cornfield properly claimed a privilege, the court erred in refusing to provide appellant with a meaningful remedy, such as striking Cornfield\u2019s testimony. Appellant contends he is entitled to reversal on appeal even if the error is not otherwise appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">1., 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>3. <em>Availability of Writ Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">After the change of plea, in clearing up \u201csome confusion in the record,\u201d the trial court also informed appellant that \u201cthe 995 motion . . . [was] subject to a writ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">This too was error. The purpose of the writ procedure is to provide a forum for a speedy <em>pretrial </em>challenge of irregularities so that \u201cthe matter can be expeditiously returned to the magistrate for proceedings free of the charged defects.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pompa-Ortiz </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 519, 529 [165 Cal.Rptr. 851, 612 P.2d 941].) Section 999a requires a dissatisfied defendant to file a petition for a writ of prohibition within 15 days of the denial of the motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Just as a guilty or nolo contendere plea waives appellate review of \u201cirregularities in the preliminary examination procedures which are not jurisdictional in the fundamental sense\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pompa-Ortiz, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 529), so does a guilty or nolo contendere plea render unavailable the section 999a writ procedure. Once a defendant admits guilt, there is no reason to litigate \u201cirregularities which could be cured, or which would not preclude subsequent proceedings to establish guilt.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 116, 126 [214 Cal.Rptr. 572].)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In this case, denial of appellant\u2019s motion followed by an immediate change of plea rendered review of the issue by way of a writ petition as unavailable to him as review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">4. <em>Appealability as Inducement for Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Appellant moves to firmer ground with his claim that his nolo contendere plea was induced by the promise that the issue was preserved for appeal. This is disputed by the Attorney General, who asserts that \u201cit is not obvious at all that appeal <em>on the merits of the in limine ruling </em>formed any part of <em>this </em>bargain.\u201d (Italics original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The first mention of plea negotiations appears in the record immediately after the court clarified the effect of its ruling on the cross-examination of Cornfield. Defense counsel stated: \u201cAnd as we discussed in chambers, . . . it seems to me a ruling has been made now on the 995 motion or 1538.5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>motion, whatever it is, anyway, the claim of privilege by the officer, the court has sustained the claim of privilege. And to the extent we have a right of appeal, and to the extent it would be necessary to get a certificate of probable cause or whatever is indicated, it is my understanding that the court is willing to preserve that right of appeal for us.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u201cThe Court: Absolutely, [ft] [ ] It is my understanding that the district attorney also understands that and anticipates that there might very well be such an appeal; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u201c[District Attorney]: That is what defense counsel has represented to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I went a little bit further. In the event there was anything required to assist him to perfect that right of appeal, such as\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: There used to be a certificate of probable cause, and it seems to me that I read somewhere recently, maybe that was reinstated in situations where a plea was entered, or something of that sort. To the extent that was required I just wanted to get an indication from the court that they would be willing to cooperate in securing whatever was necessary to perfect an appeal. I\u2019m not sure that that is necessary, but to the extent it is I want it protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u201cThe Court: And that is our understanding, [ft] [] And so between now and the time that [defendant] [h]as to go to jury trial, it is my understanding that there has been some discussion with the defendant, and the district attorney has made an offer, counsel has indicated that possibly the defendant wants to accept that offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Defense counsel stated the plea bargain, and the court began the preplea voir dire. After asking appellant if he understood the effect of a nolo contendere plea, the court continued, \u201cyou understand that you are preserving your right to an appeal under the 995 motion, but that that may or may not avail you of anything, you understand that? [ft] A: Yes, ma\u2019am, I do.\u201d The court finished the advisement of and waiver of rights, and appellant entered a plea of \u201cno contest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Sentencing was continued until the next morning. At that hearing, the court stated: \u201cBefore I actually arraign Mr. Hollins for purpose of sentence, I want to make it clear on the record, I think we may have some confusion in the record on the right of appeal. Obviously Mr. Hollins can appeal the judgment in this case, but the 995 motion I think is not subject to appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>although it is subject to a writ. And so there may be no confusion about that, if any document or certificate is required, [defense counsel] will provide you with that. H] [ ] A certificate of probable cause or anything else that would facilitate a writ. But I do not believe that there is a right of appeal on that kind of a motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">After the court imposed sentence and advised appellant of his right to appeal the judgment in whole or in part, the court added: \u201c[a]nd in this case we have already discussed that the 995 motion probably has to be attacked by a writ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Because of these comments, the Attorney General asserts, \u201cthe court\u2019s flat statement at sentencing that the ruling was <em>not </em>appealable,\u201d cannot be reconciled with \u201cappellant\u2019s claim on appeal that the trial court purportedly promised him the ruling was appealable.\u201d Respondent also finds significance in the fact that defense counsel, hearing from the court that denial of the \u201c995 motion probably has to be attacked by a writ,\u201d did not immediately move to withdraw the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">First, the trial court\u2019s postplea attempt to clarify the \u201cconfusion\u201d was not a \u201cflat statement\u201d that appellant had not preserved any sort of appellate review. The clear import of both the pre- and postplea statements was that review by a higher court (whatever the procedural vehicle) remained available despite the change of plea. While the statement might alert counsel of the necessity of following one procedure rather than another, as our Supreme Court stated in a case where a defendant who pled guilty requested (and received) relief from failure to comply with section 1237.5, \u201c[i]t is readily apparent that where a defendant has been convicted upon a plea of guilty, his right to appeal may be dependent on many technical requirements of which he may be unaware.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ribero </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 55, 64 [92 Cal.Rptr. 692, 480 P.2d 308].) From our record, it is clear that difficulties with the \u201cmany technical requirements\u201d permeated the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">As a result, the trial court\u2019s postplea advisement that denial of the 995 motion \u201cis subject to a writ\u201d and its assurance of \u201ca certificate of probable cause or anything else that would facilitate a writ,\u201d intimated that the change of nomenclature had no practical effect on appellant\u2019s ability to submit his dispute to a higher court. Consequently, appellant would have no reason to believe that a motion to withdraw his plea was warranted. Both advisements\u2014preplea and postplea\u2014erroneously led appellant to believe that appellate review was preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Appellant observes that the trial court\u2019s \u201ccomment that the proper vehicle for post-conviction challenge might be a writ,\u2014came at <em>sentencing </em>and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>at the time of the plea; the remark is therefore <em>irrelevant </em>to construing the terms of the plea bargain.\u201d (Italics original.) Nevertheless, we refer to it because if, when the court mentioned the writ procedure, appellant had been advised that <em>before </em>a change of plea a defendant \u201calready had the right of limited review under section 999a and that by pleading guilty he was abandoning any chance for a trial and appeal on all grounds\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 1052, 1055 [96 Cal.Rptr. 476]), from the emphasis appellant and the court placed on preservation of appeal rights, and from the points appellant raised in his briefs, \u201cit appears doubtful that. . . he would have changed his plea.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u201cWhere a defendant\u2019s plea is \u2018induced by misrepresentations of a fundamental nature\u2019 such as a bargain which is beyond the power of the trial court, a judgment based upon the plea must be reversed. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 287, 292 [139 Cal.Rptr. 908].)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The situation in <em>Coleman </em>is almost identical to appellant\u2019s. In that case, codefendant Duke agreed to plead guilty to an included offense in a bargain which \u201cincluded the preservation of Dukes\u2019 right \u2018to appeal the denial of the request for the informant.\u2019 The trial judge responded: \u2018[t]he record can indicate the representations you are making. As far as the legal effect of it, that will be up to the Court of Appeal. An appeal from a guilty plea requires a certificate .... And if you file the appropriate document the Court will consider that certificate.\u2019 Defense counsel answered: \u2018Fine, Your Honor.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201cThe trial court issued its certificate purporting to permit an appeal from the judgment, raising the issue of the propriety of the trial court action denying Dukes\u2019 motion for disclosure of the identity of the informer.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.3d at p. 292.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The appellate court stated: \u201cDukes\u2019 plea of guilty was induced by a material mistake in which the trial court participated so that the judgment based upon the plea must be reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court with instructions to permit Dukes to withdraw the plea.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.3d at p. 293.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In the instant case, relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>DeVaughn </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 889, 896 [135 Cal.Rptr. 786, 558 P.2d 872], appellant also desires to \u201cavail himself of the right to move to withdraw his plea as improperly induced by the nugatory promise of a right to appeal.\u201d This contention is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s guilty plea precludes him from seeking review of the denial of his motion pursuant to Penal Code section 995, notwithstanding the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>court\u2019s promise to the contrary. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Truman </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1816, 1820-1821 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 138].) \u201cThe promise was illusory and therefore was an improper inducement which voids the plea. [Citation.] We recognize [defendant] should be given an opportunity to reevaluate his guilty plea and withdraw that plea and proceed to trial if he so desires. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonwit </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 828, 833 [219 Cal.Rptr. 297].)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The matter is remanded to the superior court to allow appellant the opportunity to withdraw his plea.
