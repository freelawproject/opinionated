[ft (c) State the specific grounds on which the claim is founded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">This appeal from an order refusing to certify a class action seeking a judicial refund of taxes collected by the Franchise Tax Board (Board) presents the issue of whether section 19055 means what it says. We hold that it does and that it is to be enforced on that basis. We further hold that would-be representatives who fail to take section 19055 at face value cannot invoke the doctrine of substantial compliance otherwise applicable to class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In a very real sense, it all began with Sandra Brown. It was she who in the early 1980\u2019s instituted a class action for refund of income taxes the Board had assessed and collected on dividends paid to class members by a trio of mutual funds for the tax years 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981. She claimed that the Board had no power to tax the dividends because they derived from\u2014 and thus in legal effect were\u2014nontaxable obligations of the federal government. The trial court sustained this claim, certified the class, and ordered the Board to provide notice to the members of the class identified from the funds\u2019 records.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Approximately 40,000 claims were received and allowed by the Board. The ensuing judgment ordering refunds of almost $6 million plus substantial interest was affirmed by this court in December of 1987. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 300 [242 Cal.Rptr. 810].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Several very relevant events occurred during the pendency of the <em>Brown </em>litigation. First, having incurred extraordinary and unanticipated expenses of more than $1 million, the Board drafted amendments to section 19055 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the Legislature enacted and which became effective in September of 1986.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See fn. 8, <em>post.) </em>Second, in April of the following year, the administrative preliminaries to this case commenced when plaintiffs Donald and Joan Farrar filed a joint claim for refund of taxes they paid on dividends from the same three funds involved in Brown; plaintiffs\u2019 claim picked up where Sandra Brown\u2019s claim ended\u2014with the tax year 1982\u2014and extended through the three succeeding years. Mr. Farrar purported to make the claim as a class representative for all persons who paid California income tax on the dividends from the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Hearing nothing from the Board, plaintiffs deemed their claim disallowed (see \u00a7 19085) and commenced this action in April of 1988. Plaintiff Donald Farrar identified himself in the complaint as suing \u201cindividually and on behalf of all others similarly situated.\u201d Plaintiffs alleged that the Board\u2019s continued collection of tax on dividends from federal government obligations violated a host of state and federal constitutional and statutory provisions. The Board\u2019s silence ended in late June of 1988\u2014about the time our decision in <em>Brown </em>became final\u2014when it answered plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and asserted for the first time that plaintiffs\u2019 administrative claim did not comply with section 19055.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Plaintiffs thereafter submitted five \u201csupplements\u201d to their administrative claim with more than 600 written authorizations from other taxpayers purporting to designate plaintiffs to prosecute the action on their behalf. The Board responded by informing plaintiffs in effect that (1) exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 claim was now with the court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) the authorizations were invalid because they had not been filed with, and \u201ccannot retroactively cure the defects\u201d in plaintiffs\u2019 administrative claim, and (3) each of the authorizations was \u201cconsidered to be a new claim\u201d that was untimely because \u201c[t]he limitations period for filing such claims, prescribed by . . . Section 19053, has expired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Plaintiffs then moved for certification of a class and two subclasses defined so as to \u201cinclude all [individual and corporate] investors who paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>California tax on distributions from the Funds in the relevant years irrespective of whether the investors brought individual claims for refunds.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion, concluding that \u201cplaintiffs have failed to meet the class claim filing requirements of . . . Section 19055\u201d and \u201cin view of that statute, and how specific it is, there was not substantial compliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"> Plaintiffs perfected a valid appeal from the formal order denying their motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Both sides have throughout this litigation received exceptionally competent representation. Fresh from her triumph in <em>Brown, </em>plaintiff\u2019s counsel is understandably anxious to achieve a similar victory by establishing that the investment dividends of her actual and putative clients are beyond the Board\u2019s taxable domain. That far we need not go, for the dispositive issues on this appeal are purely procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The progression of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments runs as follows: First, relying on the proposition stated by our Supreme Court that administrative claims statutes were not intended to \u201cthwart class relief\u2019 <em>(City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 457 [115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d 701, 76 A.L.R.3d 1223]), plaintiffs urge that section 19055 be given a construction that will avert such a result. Second, they submit that section 19055 and 19085 should not be read as permitting the Board to \u201csandbag\u201d the unwary by waiting until the administrative process is concluded and judicial proceedings begun before raising a defect in the form of the administrative claim.  Third, they contend that the class claim they filed with the Board should be treated as adequate for purposes of section 19055 by application of the doctrine of substantial compliance adopted in <em>City of San Jose </em>and subsequent decisions.  Finally, plaintiffs urge that ratification of the construction given section 19055 by the Board and the trial court would allow a taxing practice prohibited by federal law (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124) and our <em>Brown </em>decision to go unchecked, thereby violating the supremacy clause of article VI of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The well-known advantages of the class action are convenience, efficiency, and completeness. (E.g., <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>29 Cal.3d 462, at p. 469; <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800, 807-808 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964, 53 A.L.R.3d 513].) Its general but limited codification in Code of Civil Procedure section 382<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> notwithstanding, the class action retains the essence of its origins as an invention of equity. (See <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 447 at pp. 458, 463; <em>Hansberry </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1940) 311 U.S. 32, 41 [85 L.Ed. 22, 26-27, 61 S.Ct. 115, 132 A.L.R. 741]; <em>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble </em>(1921) 255 U.S. 356, 363, 366 [65 L.Ed. 673, 678, 679, 41 S.Ct. 338]; Note, <em>Class Actions and Interpleader. California Procedure and the Federal Rules </em>(1953) 6 Stan.L.Rev. 120, 121-123.) Our Supreme Court has reinforced this heritage by urging trial courts to adopt flexible and innovative procedures from common law sources and analogous statutes. (See <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em>at pp. 469-470, fn. 7; <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at pp. 820-821.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In light of the fact that the class action remedy continues to be essentially equitable in nature, and given that equity will defer to statute, the common law features of class action administration are subject to legislative displacement. (See <em>City of South San Francisco </em>v. <em>Cypress Lawn Cemetery Assn. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 922-923 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 323]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Tago, Inc. </em>(1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 507, 518 [233 CahRptr. 503].)  Section 19055 is a statute that is recent in origin, unambiguous in phrasing, and specific in the scope of its application. It therefore is to be accepted as stating the governing rule of decision and to be applied according to its plain language. <em>(Great Lakes Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of El Segundo </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 152, 155 [137 Cal.Rptr. 154, 561 P.2d 244].)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">That plain language does not evidence any legislative intent to thwart class relief for tax refunds. On the contrary, section 19055 reflects the Legislature\u2019s express sanction for class actions. All that section 19055 does is establish conditions to the availability of that remedy. With the exception of their supremacy clause argument, plaintiffs raise no challenge to the Legislature\u2019s power to impose such conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Plaintiffs second point requires that section 19055 be considered in conjunction with section 19085, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf the . . . Board fails to mail notice of action on any refund claim within six months after the claim was filed, the taxpayer may, prior to mailing of notice of action on the refund claim, consider the claim disallowed and bring an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>action against the . . . Board on the grounds set forth in the claim for recovery of the whole or any part of the amount claimed . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Section 19085 is obviously designed to provide a measure of certainty and protection to both taxpayers and the Board. By requiring the taxpayer to state the grounds for a refund claim, section 19055 gives the Board notice of the claim and the underlying substantive reasons. If, for whatever reason, the Board takes no action on the claim, the Board knows what it will confront if the taxpayer initiates a judicial action for a refund. On the other hand, the taxpayer is given a clear timetable for commencing judicial action instead of endlessly wondering if an administrative refund claim has been lost down a bureaucratic rat hole. (Cf. <em>Shell Western E &amp; P, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Lake </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 974, 984-985 [274 Cal.Rptr. 313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Plaintiffs appear to believe that section 19085 somehow obliges the Board to notify a taxpayer of any defect in the form of an administrative claim in order to preserve the defect as an issue in subsequent court action. In other words, the Board is not required to respond to the substantive merits of the claim but, on penalty of forfeiting the issue, the Board is required to point out defects in the form of the claim. This conjures up the bewildering possibility of the Board telling a taxpayer \u201cYour claim is not in the correct form, but don\u2019t assume that our telling you about this problem means we will make a decision on your claim if you correct the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Any possible merit to plaintiffs\u2019 position is obliterated by the indisputable fact that plaintiffs made no real attempt to comply with section 19055 until after they commenced this action, which was 17 months after the amended version of that statute took effect. For 12 of those 17 months plaintiffs were represented by counsel who would have particular reason to know that section 19055 had been amended, because it was that counsel\u2019s success in the <em>Brown </em>litigation which was a proximate cause of the statute\u2019s revision. Actual as well as imputed or constructive knowledge is shown by plaintiffs\u2019 identifying their administrative claim as being on behalf of a class, a requirement of the amended section 19055 not present in its original form. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>But beyond this plaintiffs made not even a perfunctory effort to comply with the more detailed requirements specified by section 19055 for a class claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that something akin to a waiver or estoppel results from the Board not invoking section 19055 earlier is also defeated by constitutional considerations.  Article XIII, section 32 of the California Constitution specifies that \u201cAfter payment of a tax claimed to be illegal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid, with interest, in such manner as may be provided by the Legislature.\u201d In light of our Supreme Court\u2019s acceptance that this provision \u201cmeans what it says\u201d <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 277, 284 [165 Cal.Rptr. 122, 611 P.2d 463]), Courts of Appeal have held that they \u201care without authority to alter the statutory procedures for tax refunds enacted by the Legislature pursuant to the . . . command of article XIII, section 32.\u201d <em>(Shiseido Cosmetics (America) Ltd. </em>v. <em>Franchise State Bd. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 478, 486-489 [286 Cal.Rptr. 690]; accord, <em>Masi </em>v. <em>Nagle </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 608, 611-612 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 423]; <em>Patane </em>v. <em>Kiddoo </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1214 [214 Cal.Rptr. 9].)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The recent validation of this approach by our Supreme Court dooms plaintiffs\u2019 third argument\u2014that their purported class action may go forward under the substantial compliance doctrine of <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 447. There, the court held that to satisfy the administrative claim provision of the Government Torts Claims Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 810 et seq., especially \u00a7 910) \u201cthe class claim must provide . . . specified information concerning the representative plaintiff and then sufficient information to identify and make ascertainable the class itself. . . . Beyond this, the sufficiency of the identifying information must be measured by the substantial compliance test.\u201d <em>(City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 457, original italics omitted.) A number of Court of Appeal decisions extended this reasoning to class claims for tax refunds. (See e.g., <em>Schoderbek </em>v. <em>Carlson </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 1029 [170 Cal.Rptr. 400]; <em>Lattin </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 377 [142 Cal.Rptr. 130]; <em>Santa Barbara Optical Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 244 [120 Cal.Rptr. 609].) This trend was halted in <em>Woosley </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 758 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 838 P.2d 758].</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\"><em>Woosley </em>involved a class action challenging the imposition of certain license fees and use taxes. Woosley filed an administrative refund claim on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated. The claim was denied, whereupon Woosley commenced a successful class action for refund. On its own initiative the Supreme Court raised and considered the issue of the adequacy of the class claim, concluding that the substantial compliance portion of <em>City of San Jose </em>\u201cshould not be extended to include claims for tax refunds.\u201d <em>(Woosley </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 758 at pp. 788-789.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">With respect to the statute governing use tax refund claims, the court stated: \u201cWhen Woosley filed his claim in 1977, section 6904 read: \u2018Every claim shall be in writing and shall state the specific grounds upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>claim is founded.\u2019 In 1987, approximately 10 years after Woosley filed Ms claim, the Legislature amended section 6904 to add the following language . . . : \u2018A claim filed for or on behalf of a class of taxpayers shall do all of the following: [f] (1) Be accompanied by written authorization from each taxpayer sought to be included in the class. [1] (2) Be signed by each taxpayer or taxpayer\u2019s authorized representative, [f] (3) State the specific grounds on wMch the claim is founded.\u2019 (Stats. 1987, ch. 38, \u00a7 5, p. 101.) [1] The statute as amended in 1987 expressly permits, for the first time, the filing of a class claim, but requires that each member of the class authorize Ms or her inclusion in the class and that each member of the class, or the class member\u2019s authorized representative, sign the claim. A class claim for refund of sales and use taxes may not be submitted, as it was in the present case, without the knowledge and express consent of each member of the class.\u201d <em>(Woosley </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 758 at p. 791.) Noting that in 1986 \u201cthe Legislature had amended section 19055, governing claims for refunds of personal income taxes, and section 26074, governing claims for refunds of bank and corporate taxes, to add language nearly identical to that later added to section 6904,\u201d the court construed these amendments as evidencing the Legislature\u2019s aim \u201cto allow a narrowly circumscribed form of class claims,\u201d specifically, \u201conly those class claims where each member of the class expressly authorizes and signs the claim.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 791-792.) Disapproving the line of Court of Appeal decisions allowing class claims, the court concluded that \u201carticle XIII, section 32 of the Califorma Constitution precludes tMs court from expanding the methods for seeking tax refunds expressly provided by the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 792.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Plaintiffs argue in a supplemental brief that Woosley\u2014wMch was decided during the pendency of tMs appeal\u2014is dicta on the issue of the construction of section 19055. Strictly speaking, plaintiffs may be correct. But as <em>Woosley </em>did construe a statute characterized as \u201cnearly identical\u201d to section 19055, the discussion of the in pari materia section 6904 is clearly germane for present purposes. (See <em>In re Phyle </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 838, 845 [186 P.2d 134]; <em>Security Pacific Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Casavant </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 127, 130 [252 Cal.Rptr. 175].) If <em>Woosley </em>is dicta, it has an especially muscular nature and relevancy.  The lesson of <em>Woosley </em>we take to be that statutes governing admimstrative tax refund procedures, backed as they are by a plenary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>constitutional authority, are to be strictly enforced.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See also <em>Barclays Bank Internat. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1742, 1749 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 537].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In any event, the court has held that the doctrine of substantial compliance kicks in only after the aspiring class representative plaintiff establishes <em>\u201csome </em>compliance with <em>all </em>of the statutory requirements.\u201d <em>(City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 447 at pp. 456-457, original italics.) By any stretch of the imagination, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate any pretense of timely compliance with the written authorizations requirement section 19055 demands of all members of a class refund claim. The inescapable consequence of plaintiffs\u2019 noncompliance is that their administrative claim was, and their refund action is, valid only as to them in their individual capacities. (See <em>Woosley </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 758 at p. 788.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s final argument looks to avoid all of the foregoing by interposing the supremacy clause. Again, plaintiffs are looking ahead to the merits of their substantive attack on the tax. As we have just concluded, plaintiffs are properly in court and able to make that attack on their own behalf. But insofar as they are forced to go it alone, they are not aggrieved or hindered in that quest by the absence of a class behind them. (Cf. <em>County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Carleson </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 737 [97 Cal.Rptr. 385, 488 P.2d 953].) Nothing in the supremacy clause requires them to be generals at the head of an army. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has held that a state may, consistent with constitutional demands, ensure its \u201cexceedingly strong interest in financial stability\u201d by enacting a variety of procedural protections, among which are \u201ctimely notice of complaint\u201d provisions and \u201crelatively short statutes of limitations.\u201d <em>(McKesson Corp. </em>v. <em>Florida Alcohol &amp; Tobacco Div. </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 18, 37, 45 [110 L.Ed.2d 17, 36, 41, 110 S.Ct. 2238].) This is the net effect of the provisions considered here; plaintiffs did not provide timely notice of a class claim in compliance with section 19055, and, when they took advantage of section 19085 to go into court, they deprived themselves of the ability to correct any defects in their administrative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In sum, the trial court correctly recognized that plaintiffs had not complied with the plain language of section 19055, and that no federal constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>consideration existed to enforcing compliance with that plain language. Denial of plaintiffs\u2019 certification motion was therefore not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Anderson, P.
