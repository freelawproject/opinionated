(Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 22500 et seq.) The trial court concluded they do and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants Whittier Union High School District and Bonita Unified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>School District. Plaintiffs Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association et al. appeal, challenging that determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Respondent Whittier Union High School District owns and operates the facilities and grounds at six high schools located within its established geographic boundaries. Respondent Bonita Unified School District owns and operates a total of 13 elementary, middle and high schools serving the area within its established boundaries. The facilities and grounds at these various locales include auditoriums, meeting rooms, gymnasiums, stadiums, tracks, playing fields, courts and swimming pools.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">A majority of the time the foregoing facilities serve as recreation and civic centers for groups and individuals who live and work within the school districts\u2019 geographic boundaries. The activities engaged in by community members are numerous and varied: meetings involving groups like the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and Camp Fire Girls; classes ranging from crafts and dance instruction to music and reading programs; day care programs; drama productions and musicals; and numerous sports activities, such as regularly scheduled soccer, football and baseball league play and practice, \u201cpick-up\u201d basketball games, volleyball, tennis, jogging and individual workouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">As a result of the constant, heavy community use of the facilities and grounds during nonschool hours, they have deteriorated and are in need of a number of improvements: installation and replacement of night lighting, fencing and retaining walls; renovation of grandstands and seating; repair and resurfacing of blacktops, playing fields and running track facilities; regrading, reseeding and other general field improvements; refinishing of gymnasium floors; and installation of sprinkler systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Lacking sufficient funds to finance the needed improvements, respondents in 1991 initiated proceedings to form special assessment districts under the Act. The proceedings culminated in July 1991 with the adoption of separate resolutions ordering the formation of recreation improvement and maintenance districts encompassing all of the parcels located within the school districts\u2019 geographic boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The Act prescribes procedures for the formation of special assessment districts and the levy and collection of assessments to fund the installation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>construction, maintenance and acquisition of specified improvements. Assessment districts may be formed by local agencies, which are defined to include, \u201ca county, a city and county, a city, <em>a special district, </em>or an agency or entity created pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 6500) of Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code and made up solely of local agencies whose annual taxes are carried on the county assessment roll and are collected by the county.\u201d (Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 22530; italics added.) \u201c \u2018Special district\u2019 means any public corporation, other than a county or a city, formed pursuant to general law or special act for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries and which is authorized by such law or act to make any of the improvements or to furnish the maintenance or services provided for in this part.\u201d (Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 22539.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">It has long been recognized that school districts represent a type of nonmunicipal public corporation which \u201cderives its authority directly from the legislature, through the general law providing for the establishment of schools throughout the state,\u201d and performs its services locally within a limited geographic area. <em>(Ward </em>v. <em>San Diego School Dist. </em>(1928) 203 Cal. 712, 715 [265 P. 821]; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1893) 97 Cal. 429 [32 P. 558]; <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1524 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 699]; <em>Yreka etc. School Dist. </em>v. <em>Siskiyou etc. </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 666, 670 [39 Cal.Rptr. 112], See also 45 Cal.Jur.3d, Municipalities, \u00a7 5, pp. 25-27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>It is also manifest that school districts are authorized to make the types of improvements and to furnish the maintenance and servicing provided for in the Act. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>They possess broad statutory powers, including the right of their governing boards to \u201cinitiate and carry on any program, activity, or . . . otherwise act in any manner which is not in conflict with or inconsistent with, or preempted by, any law and which is not in conflict with the purposes for which school districts are established.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 35160.) Any doubts that may have existed regarding the scope of authority granted to school districts under section 35160 of the Education Code were laid to rest by portions of Senate Bill No. 998, enacted as chapter 1452 of Statutes 1987.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Not only was respondents\u2019 formation of recreation improvement and maintenance districts consistent with the general authority of Education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Code section 35160, it was entirely in keeping with the express statutory authority of school districts to make school facilities and grounds available for public use as civic centers.  The legislative purpose of the Civic Center Act (Ed. Code, \u00a7 40040 et seq.) is \u201cto make school buildings centers of free public assembly insofar as such assembly does not encroach upon the educational activities, which constitute the primary purpose of the schools.\u201d <em>(Ellis </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 322, 329 [164 P.2d l].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In addition, respondents\u2019 formation of recreation improvement and maintenance districts helps ensure there will be \u201cadequate programs of community recreation\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 10900, subd. (a)), a goal the Legislature sought to achieve by authorizing school districts \u201cto organize, promote, and conduct programs of community recreation as will contribute to the attainment of general educational and recreational objectives for children and adults of the state.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 10900, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>None of the arguments raised by appellants or by amicus curiae on appellants\u2019 behalf persuade us that respondents should not be treated as \u201cspecial districts\u201d within the meaning of the Act. We have been presented with an opinion letter to former Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle dated July 2, 1991, in which the Legislative Counsel opines, \u201cit seems questionable whether the term \u2018special district\u2019 in the [A]ct was intended to refer to and include school districts.\u201d The Legislative Counsel apparently arrived at this conclusion based on the misapprehension that \u201cthe authority of a school district to provide athletic and recreational facilities, and to furnish lighting therefor, <em>must be in promotion of the district\u2019s educational functions. . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.) This is incorrect. Educational operations are, of course, a school district\u2019s primary responsibility. Nonetheless, as we have seen, school districts also serve an important secondary function as providers of recreational facilities for the community. (See Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10900 et seq., 40040 et seq.) This purpose was entirely overlooked by the Legislative Counsel, resulting in a flawed analysis of the \u201cspecial district\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Appellants claim the absence of any reference to school districts in the express language of the Act or its legislative history demonstrates the Legislature never intended the Act to be used by school districts. We disagree. Regardless of its genesis,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the bill as drafted and enacted did not limit the legislation\u2019s application to cities, counties, or cities and counties, but extended it to \u201cspecial districts\u201d as well. Although the meaning of the latter term is not discussed in the legislative history of the Act, the definition set forth in section 22530 of the Streets and Highways Code is certainly broad enough to encompass school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Appellants\u2019 contention that interpreting Streets and Highway Code section 22530 to include school districts is \u201cuntenable\u201d because it would render language in another unrelated statutory scheme \u201cmere surplusage\u201d is itself untenable. As respondents quite correctly point out, the Legislature has employed the term \u201cspecial district\u201d in a number of different ways on different occasions. No attempt need be made to reconcile them all. We need concern ourselves only with the meaning of the term as it is used in the legislation under review. This can be accomplished without resort to the rule that courts should avoid constructions that make some words in an act surplusage. <em>(Woosley </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 758, 776 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 838 P.2d 758].)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Equally unavailing is appellants\u2019 suggestion that construing the Act to include school districts may result in constitutional violations. In <em>Serrano </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>Priest </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 728 [135 Cal.Rptr. 345, 557 P.2d 929], cited by appellants, our Supreme Court declared invalid the state public school financing system there under review because the quality of educational opportunity available to the student was dependent on the wealth of the district in which he or she lived. Unlike the situation in <em>Serrano, supra, </em>the charges at issue in our case are not \u201ctaxes\u201d based upon the assessed valuation of the real property within the affected districts. Rather, they are \u201cspecial assessments\u201d which have been levied against that property in order to recoup the cost of the improvements \u201c \u2018made for the special benefit\u2019 \u201d of the property. <em>(Knox </em>v. <em>City of Orland, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 142.) That being so, it cannot be said that the assessments are based on the wealth of district residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In addition, the assessments are being levied not for educational purposes, but to finance recreational improvements to certain school facilities and grounds used for community recreational purposes during nonschool hours. Respondents calculated the percentage of total facilities usage attributable to community activities in order to determine what percentage of the total improvement costs would be financed by the special assessments. Those facilities costs associated with school usage are not being financed by the assessment funds. The infirmity which existed in <em>Serrano, supra, </em>is therefore not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Neither is there a basis for concluding there has been a violation of the free school guarantee. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 5.) The special assessments respondents seek to levy are statutorily authorized and are more in the nature of \u201cnoneducational supplemental services\u201d <em>(Arcadia Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>State Dept. of Education </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 251, 263 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 545, 825 P.2d 438]) than activities which constitute \u201can integral, fundamental part of education or a necessary element of any school\u2019s activity . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 262.
