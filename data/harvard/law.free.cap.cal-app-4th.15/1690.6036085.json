Code, \u00a7 288.5) and an allegation that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1693\">*1693</page-number>occupied a position of special trust and committed an act of substantial sexual conduct, rendering him presumptively ineligible for probation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.066, subd. (a)(9)).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">On appeal, defendant contends: (1) the court was unaware of its discretion to grant probation under Penal Code section 1203.066, subdivision (c); (2) the court\u2019s restitution order is improper in that it fails to specify the amount of restitution and identify the losses to be reimbursed; and (3) the court erred in imposing attorney fees because it failed to hold a hearing to determine defendant\u2019s ability to pay. For reasons stated below, we strike the court\u2019s attorney fee order. We reverse that portion of the judgment imposing restitution and remand for further proceedings on restitution only.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In the published portion of this opinion, we address the court\u2019s power, under Penal Code section 987.8, to correct an erroneous order imposing attorney fees after a successful appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Defendant began molesting his stepdaughter when she was eight years old. The acts of molestation continued for a period of four years and included fondling the breasts and genitals of the victim, oral copulation, masturbation of defendant, and an attempt to perform an act of sexual intercourse. The molestations occurred once a week and continued until October 1991, when the victim\u2019s mother, M., discovered defendant in the act of molesting her daughter and telephoned the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">When apprehended by the police, defendant stated that he did not know why he was molesting his stepdaughter, but \u201cjust [couldn\u2019t] help [him]self.\u201d He also indicated that he had been molested as a child by his own father. When interviewed the following morning, defendant told police the victim had been a willing participant. In a subsequent interview with the probation officer, however, defendant expressed remorse for his actions and admitted that he had verbally intimidated the victim, as his father had done with him. Defendant told the probation officer that his father had performed acts of sodomy and oral copulation upon him from the time he was eight years old until he left home at the age of seventeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">When defendant appeared for judgment and sentence, the matter of probation eligibility was not addressed by the court or the parties. The court denied probation and imposed the midterm of imprisonment. It then ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1694\">*1694</page-number>defendant \u201cto pay restitution to the victim for all losses sustained and attorney\u2019s fees in the sum of two hundred dollars ($200).\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">A, B<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">C. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Penal Code<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> section 987.8,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> sets forth the statutory procedure by which a trial court may order a criminal defendant to reimburse the county for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1695\">*1695</page-number>costs of providing court-appointed counsel.  Under the terms of the statute, the trial court may order a defendant to pay all or a portion of the costs of his legal representation if the court determines the defendant has the \u201cpresent ability to pay\u201d such costs \u201cupon the conclusion of the criminal proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This latter phrase has been interpreted to refer to the date of judgment <em>(People </em>v. <em>Spurlock </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 323, 328 [169 Cal.Rptr. 320]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barger </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 661 [158 Cal.Rptr. 825]), which, in a criminal case, constitutes the date on which the trial court orally pronounces sentence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karaman </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 335, 344, fn. 9 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 801, 842 P.2d 100].) The statute permits an additional hearing on defendant\u2019s ability to pay so long as it takes place within six months of the judgment. (\u00a7 987.8, subd. (b); <em>People </em>v. <em>Spurlock, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at pp. 328-329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In the instant case, the court ordered defendant to pay $200 in attorney fees for the services of the public defender. Defendant challenges the court\u2019s order on the ground that the court failed to first hold a hearing to determine his present ability to pay such costs as required under section 987.8, subdivision (b). The People concede that the court\u2019s order violated the statutory mandate, and we find their concession to be appropriate. The more difficult question, however, is whether' the trial court retains jurisdiction to modify its order, following the issuance of our remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">It is the general rule that \u201c[t]he filing of a valid notice of appeal vests jurisdiction of the cause in the appellate court until determination of the appeal and issuance of the remittitur\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 554 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63]), thereby divesting the trial court of jurisdiction over anything affecting the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lockridge </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1752; 1757 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 340]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schulz </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 563, 570 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 269].) Jurisdiction survives, however, where provided by statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Karaman, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 335, 351-352; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lockridge, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 1757.) In such cases, the jurisdictional period generally is not tolled during the pendency of an appeal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lockridge, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1755, 1757-1758.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">In the case at bench, both parties agree that section 987.8 constitutes a statutory exception to the general rule. Principles of statutory construction support this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1696\">*1696</page-number>\u201c[0]ur first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining such intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose. A construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided. The words of the statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose . . . .\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) \u201c[Statutes must be construed so as to give a reasonable and common-sense construction consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers\u2014a construction that is practical rather than technical, and will lead to wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinsen </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 843, 848 [238 Cal.Rptr. 530].)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Under the plain language of the statute at issue here, the ability-to-pay-hearing need not be held on the date judgment is pronounced; rather, the statute empowers the court to hold such hearing within six months of the pronouncement of judgment. As noted by <em>People </em>v. <em>Spurlock, supra, </em>the statute also authorizes the court to cause a county officer to make inquiry into the defendant\u2019s ability to pay, and \u201cpresumably report back to the court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Spurlock, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at p. 328.) Since, from a practical standpoint, such reports could not always be prepared and filed on the day of judgment, it must be concluded that the Legislature intended the trial court to retain jurisdiction over the matter of attorney fees for a reasonable period of time\u2014that is, a six-month period\u2014following the pronouncement of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">A notice of appeal, however, must be filed within 60 days of judgment. Hence, if we were to apply the general rule divesting the trial court of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal, that provision of the statute providing for an additional hearing within six months of judgment would be effectively defeated in every case where an appeal was filed. Such a result would frustrate the intent of the Legislature and render the provision surplusage. Thus, we agree with the parties that the trial court is not divested of jurisdiction to act on the question of attorney fees under section 987.8 upon the filing of a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">This brings us to the crucial question of whether the six-month period prescribed in the statute for the ability-to-pay hearings is jurisdictional\u2014in other words, does the court lose jurisdiction to conduct further proceedings under section 987.8 once the six-month period has expired? An affirmative answer would deprive the trial court of the opportunity to correct error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1697\">*1697</page-number>imposition of attorney fees in virtually every case where an appeal is filed. To avoid such a result, the People suggest that the six-month period be interpreted as \u201cdefin[ing] the outer limits of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to act in the first instance, not forever.\u201d Although we are not insensitive to the People\u2019s concerns, section 987.8 simply does not lend itself to such an interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">At least two published decisions have implied that the time period is jurisdictional. In <em>Spurlock, </em>the trial court sentenced the defendant to a prison term, stayed execution of sentence, and placed the defendant on probation. As a condition of probation, the court imposed a county jail term of 15 months. The court also purported to reserve jurisdiction over the matter of attorney fees, indicating that it would hold a hearing 60 days after the defendant\u2019s release from custody to determine the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the costs of court-appointed counsel. (112 Cal.App.3d at p.322.) Recognizing that such a hearing would have to occur more than six months after imposition of sentence, the Court of Appeal found the court\u2019s order to be void. The matter was remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the order. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 329.) In so holding, the court interpreted that provision of the statute permitting an additional hearing within six months of the conclusion of the criminal proceedings as requiring that the ability-to-pay hearing be held within six months of judgment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 328-329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">This court reached a similar conclusion in our recent decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Faatiliga </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1276 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 190], a case wherein we struck an attorney fee order imposed as a condition of probation. Since the six-month period for hearing on Faatiliga\u2019s present ability to pay had elapsed, we held that it was \u201ctoo late for the court to hold a hearing\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Faatiliga, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 1280, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Spurlock, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at p. 329), thus suggesting that the jurisdictional period runs from the date of sentencing and is not tolled by the filing of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Comparison of the language employed in section 987.8 with that used in other recoupment statutes also supports the conclusion that the Legislature intended the six-month period specified by the statute to be jurisdictional. Section 1203.1b, for example, provides for the recoupment of the costs of probation, the presentence investigation, and preparation of the presentence report. In contrast to section 987.8, which refers to a defendant\u2019s <em>present </em>ability to pay, section 1203.1b speaks only of an \u201cability to pay.\u201d In contrast to section 987.8, which imposes a six-month limitations period for the ability-to-pay hearing, section 1203.1b permits an additional hearing at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1698\">*1698</page-number>time during the probationary period. Similarly, section 1203.1c, which governs reimbursement for local incarceration costs, also speaks of the defendant\u2019s \u201cability to pay,\u201d and provides for additional hearings any time within the probationary period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"> It is a well-settled principle of statutory construction that where \u201ca statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Garat </em>v. <em>City of Riverside </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 259, 296 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 504]; internal quotations omitted.) The dissimilarities among these recoupment statutes are significant in that they evidence a particular concern on the part of the Legislature to complete the proceedings conducted under section 987.8, and to limit the time within which a defendant\u2019s financial status may be evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that although the trial court ordinarily loses jurisdiction for most purposes upon the filing of an appeal, it retains jurisdiction to act on the question of attorney fees pursuant to section 987.8. Thus, the filing of a notice of appeal does not toll the running of the six-month period; once that period has expired, the court loses jurisdiction to reconsider or modify its order. Our holding necessitates the conclusion that the trial court in the instant case is without jurisdiction to conduct further proceedings under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The judgment is modified by striking the trial court\u2019s order imposing attorney fees under section 987.8. That portion of the judgment imposing restitution is reversed and remanded for farther proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Premo, Acting P.
