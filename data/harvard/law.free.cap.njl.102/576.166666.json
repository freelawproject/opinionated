The assessments are for the years 1921 and 1922. The properties are owned by the prosecutors, but not used for railroad purposes. They are located in the downtown and southern sections of the city, in the tide water basin and in the New York bay zone. The assessments were made by the local assessors of Jersey City under the act of 1918, page 847. The valuations were made as of October 1st in each year. Each assessment was a distinct entity and process. The valuations, however, are substantially the same for each year. The valuations on appeal were confirmed by the Hudson county board of taxation and for the most part by the state board of taxes and assessment. The testimony taken before the state board is returned with the record and consists of three printed volumes. The prosecutors file eleven reasons for setting aside the assessments and valuations which are identical in each case. They may be summarized thus: First, the assessments are excessive, and, second, the assessments are not supported by any evidence. These substantially are the points argued in the prosecutors\u2019 brief with the exception of two pieces; one owned by the Long Dock Company, located on the Hudson river and known as the Erie elevator tract, and the second one owned by the Lehigh Valley Harbor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Terminal Railway Company, located on the New York bay. The first -piece, that of the Long Dock Company, the Erie elevator tract, block 16, lot B-l, is located at the foot of Pavonia avenue, on the Hudson river, 10.298 acres. The assessment was made as of October 1st, 1921, for the taxes of 1922. The point is made that at that time the property was used for railroad purposes by the Erie Railroad Company. The claim is based upon the fact that prior to 1920 the property was leased to and operated by the Erie company and the lease was canceled on December 31st, 1920, and thereafter the property was used and operated by the Long Dock Company in the Erie Railroad System. This identical property was under consideration by this court and in the Court of Errors and Appeals in the case of taxation of the Erie Railroad Company. 64 <em>N. J. L. </em>123; 65 <em>Id. </em>608. In that case it was held that the property was taxable in Jersey City under the General Tax law by the local assessors of Jersey City; but the facts then under discussion were different from the facts now presented in this record. The present case is more like the case of <em>United New Jersey, &amp;c., Co. </em>v. <em>Jersey </em>City, 57 <em>Id. </em>563. We think this piece of property should have been assessed by the stat\u00e9 board of taxes and assessment, as property used for railroad purposes under the act of 1884, and supplements, for the year 1922. It was so assessed for subsequent years. As this class of railroad property has applied to it the same rates as that locally assessed under the act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1905, <em>p. </em>189), it probably makes little or no difference in the amount of taxes to be paid, under which system it was assessed, as under both systems the taxes are for the use of the municipality and not the state. So it is argued. Blocks 1500 and 1507 consist of 170.181 acres of land, owned by the Lehigh Valley Habor Terminal Railway Company. This land is located on the shore of New York bay, assessed as of October 1st, 1922, for the taxes of 1923 at that time; so it is argued it was \u00e1 part of the construction of the Lehigh Yalley Terminal lands. The terminal had been completed on that day and was used for railroad purposes. The fact that the company had not returned the property to the state board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>of taxes and assessment for assessment does not decide the question, citing <em>Jersey City </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization of Taxes, </em>74 <em>N. J. L. </em>382.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The answer is the land was not used for railroad purposes January 1st, 1922, as stated in the opinion of the state board.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The solution of this question involves, first, a matter of fact, viz., the ascertainment of the particular purpose for which the property was being used, and, second, a matter of law, viz., whether the ascertained user is or is not a railroad use within the meaning of the act of 1884. <em>Sisters of Charity </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>699, 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The state board in its opinion, at page 48, of volume 3 (taxes 1923 and 1924), found as a fact that the land was not used for railroad purposes on January 1st, 1922 \u2014 it was being filled and reclaimed from the tides. On that date the improvement was not sufficiently advanced to determine the use to which the land was to be devoted. The character of the improvement at that time rendered the land fit for many purposes other than railroad use. An inspection of the land failed to indicate that it was either in railroad use or being prepared for railroad use. There was nothing to indicate that the land was being put in shape to be used for transportation purposes. After January 1st it was subject to local assessment, as of October 1st of that year. We agree with this determination by the state board of taxes and assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">There is no question but that, under the General Tax act of 1918, p. 870, \u00a7\u00a7 512, 513, as well as under the <em>Certiorari </em>act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1907, <em>p. </em>95), the Supreme Court has the power to determine questions of fact, as well as questions of law. <em>Trenton, &amp;c., Traction Corp. </em>v. <em>Mercer County Board of Taxation, </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>398. The assessments to be sustained must be based upon evidence. <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>State Board of Taxes and Assessment, </em>101 <em>N. J. L. </em>371. The Supreme Court has the power when satisfied, that the value of taxable property is assessed too high, to reduce the same to the proper and just amount, as shown by the evidence. The assessments were confirmed by the Hudson county board of taxation. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>were on appeal reduced in part and affirmed in part by the state board of taxes and assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The principles underlying a review by the Supreme Court of the assessments made by the local assessors have been quite fully stated in case No. 204, <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. et al. </em>v. <em>State Board of Taxes and </em>Assessment, the present May term of the court. It would serve no useful purpose to restate them in this series of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The properties assessed, and now under investigation, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">LEHIGH VALLEY EAILEOAD OASES.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">1.
