The highlights are that opposer\u2019s registered marks have been used extensively on paper towels designed and sold to' automotive service stations for cleaning windshields and the like. Applicant\u2019s goods include paper towels and there is, therefore, identity of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">A key factor in the board\u2019s decision of no likelihood of confusion is the descriptiveness of the term \u201cdry\u201d or \u201cdri\u201d as applied to any kind of towel and the apparent commonplace use of that term as a syllable or part of trademarks adopted and used by applicant-appellee and third parties for towels of both paper and cloth. The record shows use by what is now a division of applicant, Kimberly-Clark, since 1911, of \u201cDriwell\u201d on paper towels, Reg. No. 522,321, except for the period 1924-1934 when \u201cDrytex\u201d was used instead. In the 1941-1964 period some 2,000,000 cases of \u201cDriwell\u201d towels were sold. Kimberly-Clark also has a registration of \u201cKaydry,\u201d No. 774,-552, for disposable towels which the record shows to be paper towels. There are, in addition, 25 third-party registrations of record of marks containing \u201cdry\u201d or \u201cdri,\u201d 11 of them for paper towels and 14 for cloth towels. The paper towel marks are in several instances the subject of recent or renewed registrations, indicating a probability of recent or present use..</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">Notwithstanding the apparent similarities between \u201cSo-Dri\u201d in particular and \u201cHi-Dri,\u201d the board concluded there would, be no likelihood of confusion on the following basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-7\">Opposer\u2019s marks \u201cSo-Dri\u201d and \u201cShur-Dri\u201d and applicant\u2019s mark \u201cHi-Dri\u201d obviously were adopted to suggest that the paper towels sold thereunder possess superior drying qualities. It likewise appears from the record that it has been a common practice for producers of paper towels and of such competitive products as cloth towels to adopt as trademarks for their products designations comprising the word \u201cDry\u201d or \u201cDri\u201d, having a similar suggestive connotation, such as \u201cDri-N-Shine\u201d, \u201cDri-Kleen\u201d, \u201cDry-Mor\u201d, \u201cSparkle-Dri\u201d, \u201cEasi-Dri\u201d, \u201cDryfast\u201d, and \u201cWipemdri\u201d. Under such circumstances, the scope of protection afforded opposer\u2019s marks must necessarily be narrow and manifestly cannot extend to preclude the registration by others of similar but otherwise distinguishable notations or trademarks for towels. [Cases cited.] * * * The fact, as urged by opposer, that its marks and that of applicant are hyphenated marks and the syllable \u201cDri\u201d appears therein as a prefix instead of a suffix as in the third-party registrations is of no particular significance * * *. Accordingly, although the designations \u201cSo-Dri\u201d, \u201cShur-Dri\u201d, and \u201cHi-Dri\u201d may have similar meanings, the differences between them in both sound and appearances are sufficient, in view of the nature of the marks, to preclude a likelihood of confusion or mistake as to the source of the goods sold thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-12\">We see no clear error in that conclusion or in the reasoning by which it was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-13\">Compare Fort Howard Paper Co. v. Gulf States Paper Corp., 376 F.2d 904, 54 CCPA 1375, where opposition to registration of \u201cE-Z NAPS\u201d by the owner of \u201cHANDINAP\u201d and \u201cHANDINAPS\u201d was dismissed, the goods of both parties being paper napkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-14\">On the second issue, it is op-poser\u2019s contention that there was no bona fide use of \u201cHi-Dri\u201d in commerce adequate to support a registration. Briefly, the facts are as follows. Kim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>berly-Clark\u2019s legal department made careful arrangements for the interstate shipment and sale on December 12, 1962, from its plant in Neenah, Wisconsin, to a drugstore in Waukegan, Illinois, of six boxes each of facial tissues, table napkins, toilet tissues and paper towels, all boxed or wrapped in coverings bearing the \u201cHi-Dri\u201d trademark printed thereon. No further sales were made until July 1964, a period of eighteen months. Then sales under the mark were made as follows: July, 40 cases of toilet tissue and 260 cases of facial tissue; October, 700 cases of toilet tissue, 530 cases of facial tissue, and 357 cases of towels; November, 350 cases of toilet tissue and 50 cases of napkins. The total value of 1964 sales under the mark was $15,013.-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Appellant argues that the first sale was not \u201cbona fide,\u201d that the mark was not actually in use at the time the application was filed, some 18 days later, and that the 1964 sales were obviously stimulated by the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">The board characterized this issue as an \u201cex parte\u201d matter but considered it anyway, \u201cin the interest of removing any cloud that may be placed on applicant\u2019s activities in regard to its use of \u2018Hi-Dri\u2019 * * Since the board considered it, we will consider it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">The board held, in effect, that applicant has complied with the law, and that although the initial sale was deliberately made expressly for federal registration purposes, this fact \u201cis not damning per se\u201d where the record shows there was an intent to continue to use the mark, and that such use was in fact continued. The board relied on the following cases: Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 49 F.2d 842, 18 CCPA 1386; California Spray-Chemical Corp. v. Ansbacher Siegle Corp., 55 USPQ 298 (Comm\u2019r); Western Stove Co. v. Geo. D. Roper Corp., 82 F.Supp. 206 (S.D.Cal.1949); and Maternally Yours, Inc. v. Your Maternity Shop, Inc., 234 F.2d 538 (2d Cir. 1956). Appellant attempts, unsuccessfully we think, to distinguish these cases. Appellee\u2019s testimony was that it normally takes it about three years after adoption and first use of a new mark to take the necessary steps leading to national distribution of a product under it, during which time marketing and advertising tests and preparation for production and sale are progressing. An eighteen-month hiatus in sales, absent any indication of an intent not to proceed, does not seem to us unreasonable. We think it appropriate that appellee should proceed with caution to try out its right to registration of \u201cHi-Dri,\u201d as it is doing in this proceeding, before plunging into the market with more extensive sales than it did. We agree with the Board\u2019s decision that appellee complied with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision dismissing the opposition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"axv-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">WORLEY, C. J., did not participate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1087-16\">. Reg. No. 651,198, Sept. 3, 1957, for paper towels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1087-17\">. Reg. No. 165,832, Mar. 20, 1923, twice renewed, last renewal for paper towels only, and No. 651,196, Sept. 3, 1957, for paper towels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1087-27\">. Reg. No. 720,359, Aug. 22, 1961, foe paper towels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1087-28\">. Appellant makes two issues out of this by separately stating them as \u201cconfusing similarity\u201d of the marks and likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception. These are, however, inseparable aspects of a single issue, as we view the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">. There is no question but that the mark \u25a0was used, under conditions hereinafter explained, and appellant disavows any reliance on a theory of abandonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">. We do not know wliy an opposer should be precluded from raising this reason for denying registration in an <em>inter partes </em>proceeding. See Roger &amp; Gallet v. Janmarie, Inc., 263 F.2d 350, 46 CCPA 787, on the delay of final disposition which may result from the characterization of rulings as \u201cex parte.\u201d Here both parties are arguing the question and neither questions our right to pass upon it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
