According to the specification the \u201cessence\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the composition comprises asbestos in conjunction with sawdust and binding agents. Claim 5 is representative of the composition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">5. Improved veneer filling compound which comprises in combination a composition containing asbestos fiber, sawdust and a binder wherein the amount by weight of asbestos fiber present is in the range from about 1 to 15%, the amount of binder present is in the range from about 1 to 15%, and the amount of sawdust present is in the range from about 70 to 98%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Claims 9 and 10 are directed to plywood in which one of the plies has a cavity filled with the composition. Claims 11-15 are directed to a process of preparing the composition. The claims have been treated below as standing or falling together. We so treat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Before directing our attention to the merits of the rejection, appellant raises a preliminary issue in his brief, urging that the Commissioner of Patents, through the director, Chemical Examining Operations, erred in refusing to return his application to the examiner for further prosecution after he cited two new references in his Answer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant contends that the alleged \u201csummary,\u201d \u201ckangaroo\u201d practice accorded him by the Patent Office deprived him of an opportunity to amend his claims, thus denying him due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">We are of the opinion that appellant\u2019s request for review by this court of the action of the Commissioner is, under the present circumstances, both frivolous and futile. We would not otherwise comment upon it were not a fair portion of the brief and some discussion at oral argument devoted to the issue. The record speaks for itself as to the merits of appellant\u2019s claim. In any event, and aside from the fact the issue is not alluded to in any reason of appeal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we are without authority to review decisions of the Commissioner in matters of this nature. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141; In re Jewett, 247 F.2d 953, 45 CCPA 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">Turning to the merits of the rejection, the examiner noted that Brown discloses a composition containing sawdust, asbestos fiber and 7.5-10% thermosetting resin binder which is useful in the manufacture of artificial wood board. Describing a procedure to make a three-ply board, Brown states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-16\">* * * we take 38 parts of sawdust and thoroughly mix with 5 parts of synthetic resin, preferably of the thermo-setting type * * * [yielding approximately an 88/12 ratio by weight]. When thoroughly mixed, 25% of the impregnated sawdust is reserved for veneering the top and bottom face of the board. The remaining 75% impregnated sawdust is then thoroughly mixed with 57 parts (by weight) of wood chips. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-18\">It further appears from the disclosure and claims of Brown that asbestos fibers are added to both the core and veneering compositions to render them fire-resisting.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-19\">Avedikian discloses a moldable composition useful as a building material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>comprising phenolic resin binder and sawdust filler or \u201cother fibrous and/or comminuted material which is capable of being compacted or molded,\u201d such as \u201ciron filings and asbestos.\u201d Small amounts of paraffin wax are added to reduce water absorption of the final product.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Meiler discloses a composition of 1-40% synthetic rubber-phenol aldehyde binder and \u201cmineral or vegetable\u201d filler, such as \u201csawdust or wood flour,\u201d which, when applied as overlayers on pieces of plywood, \u201cconceals any blemishes and defects which may be present on the surface of the material\u201d and \u201cfills in knot holes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The examiner and board were of the view that the selection of the particle sizes and proportions of sawdust and asbestos fiber recited in one or more of the claims was \u201cwithin the ordinary ability of one skilled in the art,\u201d and that there \u201cis nothing of record to indicate the criticality of the limitations.\u201d Reliance was placed upon Avedikian to establish obviousness of the addition of wax to the composition as recited in some of the claims and upon Meiler to show that similar compositions including rubber binders had been used to fill defects in plywood sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument is premised principally on the contention that Brown does not disclose adding asbestos to a composition containing only resin and sawdust, but includes wood waste other than sawdust \u2014 wood chips, for example \u2014in the composition as well. Apart from the fact that appellant\u2019s claims do not preclude the presence of such wood waste as wood chips in his composition, we think that Brown does clearly disclose to those in the art adding asbestos to the wood waste-free resin and sawdust composition he reserved for veneering the core of his board. Nor do appellant\u2019s arguments convince us of error in the board\u2019s conclusion that the limitations in the claims relating to amounts or sizes of sawdust and asbestos particles lack patentable significance because well within the skill of the art. Merely because appellant\u2019s specification denotes those limitations as \u201cpreferred\u201d does not, without more, establish them as critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-14\">.

The record shows that the examiner first cited Brown and Meiler in his Answer, stated that he was entering a new ground of rejection, and gave appellant 60 days in which to file a reply. Said the examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\"><em>Such, reply may include any amendment </em>or material appropriate to the new ground of rejection and may request remand to the Examiner to consider such <em>amendment </em>or material. * * * [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Without filing further amendment or material, appellant petitioned the Commissioner to return the case to the examiner, apparently only for further argument. The Director, acting for the Commissioner, pointed out that the examiner\u2019s action was in accord with Patent Office Rule 193(b), and gave appellant 30 more days to file any appropriate reply and to proceed in the manner indicated in the above-quoted portion of the examiner\u2019s Answer. It appears appellant then simply filed a reply brief, which is not a part of the present record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b833-21\">.
