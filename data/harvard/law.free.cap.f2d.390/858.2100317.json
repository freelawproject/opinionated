SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b931-17\">The single question presented by this appeal is whether the food demonstrator clause<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sought by the unions for inclusion in their proposed bargaining agreement with two northern California retail grocers is prohibited by Section 8 (e)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the National Labor Relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Act. The Board, reversing its trial examiner, found that it is, and that the unions\u2019 striking and picketing of the retailers who refused to accept the clause violated Sections 8(b) (4) (i) (ii) (A)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 8(b) (3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Act. The demonstrator clause required that demonstrators, whether employed by the retailer or the supplier, be covered by the terms of the Retail Clerks\u2019 contract with the retailers. We agree with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">In the retail food industry demonstrators have long been used to pass out samples of particular products and to say a good word about them to customers. Initially demonstrators were simply clerks in the retail store on the payroll of the retailer. After World War II, although the work of the demonstrator remained essentially the same, the practice arose of having the food suppliers furnish the demonstrators to the retail store for the duration of the demonstration. The retail grocery industry of northern California generally has signed agreements including the demonstrator clause with the International and appropriate affiliated local unions. It was the refusal of the retailers here, Nickel<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Mead,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to agree to inclusion of the demonstrator clause in contracts covering their employees, followed by the striking and picketing, which brought about the unfair labor practice charges in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">In determining whether the demonstrator clause here violates Section 8(e), the trial examiner found it unnecessary to decide whether demonstrators are employees of the suppliers or the stores. He found that the work of the demonstrator and the food clerk \u201cmust be regarded as bearing a close functional relationship,\u201d that \u201c[d]emonstrators\u2019 jobs are not only fairly claimable functionally, but historically we find the locals claiming the jobs to be subject to contract standards, and both the suppliers and the store owners acquiescing in the claim to the extent of using the locals as a source of supply and paying demonstrators the contract clerks\u2019 scale.\u201d Thus he found that the demonstrator clause was \u201cprimarily designed for the lawful objective of unit preservation,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe nature of the work, the character of the clauses, and the historical development considered together signify that the demonstrator clauses may properly be regarded as aimed at preserving unit work.\u201d Accordingly, he recommended that the complaint charging the unions with unfair labor practices in striking and picketing Nickel\u2019s and Mead\u2019s be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>In reversing the trial examiner, the Board found that the question whether the demonstrators are employees of the suppliers or the retail stores \u201cis the central issue of the case.\u201d It held that \u201c[i]f the demonstrators are actually employees of the stores and members of the bargaining units represented by [petitioners], the demonstrator clauses would serve the primary function of protecting unit work.\u201d On the other hand, the Board held that if the demonstrators are employees of the suppliers, and outside the units, the demonstrator clauses would be unlawful for they would subject the employees of another employer to the union security provisions of the stores\u2019 contracts. Finding the demonstrators to be employees of the suppliers and not the stores, the Board concluded \u201cthat the demonstrator clauses are designed, not to protect or to preserve the jobs and working conditions of employees in the unit, but to control the employment practices of other employers who would do business with the Charging Parties, and to aid union members generally.\u201d Thus the clause would violate Section 8(e). The Board ordered the unions to cease and desist from their unfair labor practices designed to have the clauses included in the bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">This case presents again the difficult issue of primary <em>versus </em>secondary activity on the part of unions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is now clear that, where the jobs concerned are fairly claimable by the bargaining unit, the unions may, without violating either Section 8(e) or Sections 8(b) (4) (i) (ii) (A) and 8(b) (3), strike and picket to obtain no-subcontracting<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and union standards clauses<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in bargaining agreements, since such activity to protect fairly claimable jobs is primary under the Act and incidental secondary effects of such activity do not render it illegal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Striking and picketing, however, to obtain union recognition subcontracting clauses in bargaining agreements are illegal, since such clauses concern themselves, not with protecting unit jobs, but with the union affiliation of employees of another employer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>\u201cThe touchstone is whether the agreement on its maintenance is addressed to the labor relations of the contracting employer <em>vis-a-vis </em>his own employees.\u201d National Woodwork Manufacturers Ass\u2019n v. N. L. R. B., 386 U.S. 612, 645, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 1268, 18 L.Ed2d 357 .(1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">In this case, as both the trial examiner and the Board found, the demonstrators at Mead\u2019s and Nickel\u2019s were employees of the suppliers, and the demonstrator clause would permit this relationship to continue. Thus the demonstrator clause, since it would require the demonstrator employees of the suppliers of Mead\u2019s and Nickel\u2019s to be members of the union, violates Section 8(e) of the Act, and the unions\u2019 striking and picketing to obtain the clause constitute unfair labor practices in violation of Sections 8(b) (4) (i) (ii) (A) and 8(b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">We do not enforce the Board\u2019s order as issued, however, because it sweeps too broadly. In Meat and Highway Drivers, Dockmen, etc. v. N. L. R. B., 118 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 295, 335 F.2d 709, 717 (1964), the Board, while finding objectionable only a portion of a union signatory clause, banned the clause in its entirety. Since the objectionable portion could have been excised from the clause, we held that the Board\u2019s ban should have been limited to the objectionable portion only.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here the Board finds objectionable only that part of the clause which would permit employees of licensees to be members of the bargaining unit. The Board\u2019s opinion makes clear that \u201c[i]f the demonstrators are actually employees of the stores and members of the bargaining units represented by [petitioners], the demonstrator clauses would serve the primary function of protecting unit work.\u201d Since the demonstrator jobs are fairly claimable by the bargaining unit, the demonstrators could legally be covered by the bargaining agreement, provided they were employees of the contracting employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">The order as issued by the Board required the unions to notify Nickel\u2019s and Mead\u2019s that they \u201cwill not insist upon inclusion of the demonstrator clauses in any collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d Since, in the context of this case, the demonstrator clause would be unobjectionable if the language permitting the demonstrators to be on the payroll of another employer is excised, that language should be severed without condemning the entire clause. Consequently, Paragraph A. 2. (a) of the Board\u2019s order is amended to read: \u201cNotify Nickel\u2019s that it will not insist upon inclusion of the words \u2018or a licensee of said employer\u2019 in the demonstrator clause of any collective bargaining agreement.\u201d Paragraph B. 2. (a) is similarly amended, substituting \u201cMead\u2019s\u201d for \u201cNickel\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">As amended, the Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">Enforced as amended.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-9\">.

In Meat and Highway Drivers, <em>supra </em>Note 8, this court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-9\">\u201cResolution of the difficult issue of primary <em>versus </em>secondary activity, as it relates to this case, involves consideration of two factors: (1) jobs fairly claimable by the bargaining unit, and (2) preservation of those jobs for the bargaining unit. If the jobs are fairly claimable by the unit, they may, without violating either \u00a7 8(e) or \u00a7 8(b) (4) (A) or (B), be protected by provision for, and implementation of, no-subcontracting or union standards clauses in the bargaining agreements. Activity and agreement which directly protect fairly claimable jobs are primary under the Act. Incidental secondary effects of such activity and agreement do not render them illegal. Thus the \u2018cease doing business\u2019 language in \u00a7 8(e) cannot be read literally because inherent in all subcontracting clauses, even those admittedly primary, is refusal to deal with at least some contractors.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 118 U.S.App.D.C. at 291-292, 335 F.2d at 713-714.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b933-16\">. <em>See </em>A.
