As worded, the trial judge was justified in finding this request confusing on this record. See Mahon v. Reading Company, 367 F.2d 25, 33 (3d Cir. 1966). Request 19 did not take into consideration the testimony of the ship\u2019s mate from which the jury might have found that the ladder was acceptable to the ship for use by the stevedores. See Thompson v. Trent Maritime Co., 353 F.2d 632, 641 (3d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> Also the law governing appellee\u2019s warranty was correctly explained in the charge and hence it was not reversible error for the court to refuse these requests even if they were correct. See Gerhart v. Henry Disston and Sons, Inc., 290 F.2d 778, 795 (3d Cir. 1961); Sizemore v. United States Lines Company, 323 F.2d 774, 777 (3d Cir. 1963); Mannke v. Benjamin Moore &amp; Company, 375 F.2d 281, 283 (3d Cir. 1967); Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Co. v. Emery, 233 F.2d 848, 850 (8th Cir. 1956). Similarly we can find no reversible error in the supplemental charge. See F.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The February 1, 1967 judgment of the district court in favor of appellee will be affirmed in No. 16,776.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The protective appeal in No. 16,-777 challenges the refusal of the trial judge to permit counsel for appellee to argue to the jury that the ship was not liable to plaintiff. Although this appeal is now moot, we agree with the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that counsel for a third-party defendantindemnitor has the right to argue to the jury on this issue on facts such as those in this record. See DiBello v. Rederi A/B Svenska Lloyd, 371 F.2d 559, 561 (2d Cir. 1967); cf. Hagans v. Ellerman &amp; Bucknall Steamship Company, 318 F.2d 563, 586-587 (3d Cir. 1963).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">The appeal in No. 16,777 will be dismissed as moot in view of the above-described decision in No. 16,776 affirming the February 1, 1967 judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-14\">. Although appellee would appear to be correct that the appeal should have been taken from the judgment (not the order denying a new trial), such a mistake will be treated as harmless error and this appeal will be treated as if arising from the judgment of February 1, 1967. See United States v. Certain Land In City of Paterson, N. J., 322 F.2d 866, 869 (3d Cir. 1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\">. There may be times when the facts will require the severance of the third-party action for a separate trial, but, if the usual situation of a joint trial of both actions is held, the third party defendant\u2019s counsel must be granted the rights stated in the above cases. See Weitort v. A. H. Bull &amp; Company, 192 F.Supp. 165 (E.D.Pa.1961) and cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
