Appellee, Colonial Oil Company, is a Florida corporation engaged in supplying at wholesale petroleum products to independent dealers and of selling petroleum products at retail through service stations operated by Colonial. The Abramsons\u2019 suit is bottomed on allegations that they were under contract to purchase petroleum products from the appellee and that during the contract period Colonial discriminated against them by selling petroleum products of like grade and quality to other service stations in the Orlando area at lower prices, thereby lessening competition and injuring appellants\u2019 business in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-23\">Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and it is now undisputed in the record that during the period in question all outlets in the Orlando area which were supplied with petroleum products by Colonial, including the Abram-sons\u2019 service station, were supplied with <em>petroleum products which were purchased by Colonial within the State of Florida. </em>Thus, the acts complained of did not occur in interstate commerce within the meaning of this statute, and this case is controlled by Jones v. Metzger Dairies, Inc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>334 F.2d 919 (5 Cir. 1964). See, also, Food Basket, Inc. v.
