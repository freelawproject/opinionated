NLRB v. Aerovox Corp., 389 F.2d 475 (4th Cir., Dec. 20, 1967). We conclude that the Board has not met this standard and deny its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-24\">The charge that the company violated \u00a7 8(a) (5) and (1) of the act [29 U.S. C. \u00a7 158(a) (5) and (1)] by its refusal to recognize and bargain in good faith raises in part the same issues that were decided adversely to the Board in NLRB v. Heck\u2019s Inc., 386 F.2d 317 (4th Cir., Oct. 12, 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The \u00a7 8(a) (1) charges involve interrogation of employees with regard to their union sympathy, threatened reprisals, and interference with employees in 1964 and 1965 in connection with the same organization campaign that led to the \u00a7 8(a) (5) and (1) charges. While the charges are not inseparable, they are closely connected and we believe that both issues should be considered together when this case is heard on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In denying the motion, we, of course, do not intimate an opinion on the merits. We simply hold that the Board has not shown the necessity for <em>pendente lite </em>relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-17\">. The Board\u2019s orders are found in Heck\u2019s, Inc., 166 NLRB 38 (June 30, 1967), and Heck\u2019s, Inc., 166 NLRB 32 (June 28, 1967). During oral argument, the Board withdrew its motion for <em>pendente lite </em>reinstatement of the employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
