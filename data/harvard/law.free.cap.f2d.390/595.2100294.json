The Board also discredited a witness whose testimony was credited by the examiner. 155 NLRB 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We are of the opinion that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings and order affirming the examiner as to the Section 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) violations, and that the Board\u2019s order with respect thereto should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The Board\u2019s findings with respect to the Section 8(a) (5) violation, in our judgment, are not supported by substantial evidence when the record is viewed as a whole. The authorization cards had two faces. One face contained an authorization for representation with a line for signature. Undeneath the signature line were the words \u201cThis card is for use in support of the demand of UAW-AFL-CIO for recognition, or for an NLRB election.\u201d The other face contained in large, bold faced type, the words \u201cSECRET BALLOT ELECTION\u201d, and underneath, in smaller type were the words, \u201cThis card will be filed with the National Labor Relations Board to secure a secret ballot election conducted by representatives of the United States Government.\u201d Under that statement, in large, bold face type, were the words, \u201cTHIS CARD IS CONFIDENTIAL.\u201d In our opinion these cards were ambiguous. They were calculated to and did indicate a purpose to secure an election. This is all the more clear from evidence that the card solicitors did in fact represent to a number of employees that their purpose was to secure an election. The examiner in his decision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">\u201cSeveral witnesses testified that the talk all over the plant during the campaign was about having an election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Under these circumstances the examiner was correct in ruling that the cards cannot be relied upon to support the bargaining order. NLRB v. Swan Super Cleaners, 384 F.2d 609 (6th Cir. 1967); Dayco Corp. v. NLRB, 382 F.2d 577 (6th Cir. 1967); Peoples Serv. Drug Stores Inc. v. NLRB, 375 F.2d 551 (6th Cir. 1967); Pizza Prod. Corp. v. NLRB, 369 F.2d 431 (6th Cir. 1966). This case is readily distinguishable on its facts from NLRB v. Cumberland Shoe Corp., 351 F.2d 917 (6th Cir. 1965); NLRB v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 341 F.2d 750 (6th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 830, 86 S.Ct. 69, 15 L.Ed.2d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Moreover, the evidence disclosed that the company had a good faith doubt that the union had a majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">The Board\u2019s order with respect to Section 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) violations is enforced. Enforcement is denied with respect to the Section 8(a) (5) bargaining order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-21\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
