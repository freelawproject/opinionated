His major defense was insanity. On appeal, he contends that the trial judge should have entered a judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b517-23\">This court has always been reluctant to order such judgments of acquittal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our reluctance is rooted in the nature of the jury\u2019s role in insanity cases. In the early eighteenth century, the test for criminal responsibility was whether the accused \u201cdoes not know what he is doing, no more than * * * a wild <em>beast.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Under this test, the jury did not need to hear and evaluate a complex body of evidence. Presumably the jury and the witnesses knew a wild beast when they saw one. Later, English courts began to focus on whether the accused could distinguish between right and wrong. They also began to hear medical testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The landmark <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>case<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> made both these trends a standard part of English and American law. Under <em>M\u2019Naghten, </em>the test for insanity was whether the accused was \u201claboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of what he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The use of the term \u201cdisease of the mind\u201d was significant since it firmly established the relevance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>of medical testimony. The jury now had a broader role \u2014 to evaluate medical testimony in light of the right-wrong criterion. Soon, however, doctors began to complain that the right-wrong test permitted too narrow an inquiry into the accused\u2019s mental condition, that it precluded doctors from presenting important medical data.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In Durham v. United States,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we announced a new test for insanity: \u201cAn accused is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act was the product of a mental disease or defect.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We intended to widen the range of expert testimony in order to enable the jury \u201cto consider all information advanced by relevant scientific disciplines.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">This purpose was not fully achieved, largely because many people thought <em>Durham, </em>was only an attempt to identify a clearly defined category of persons\u2014 those classified as mentally ill by the medical profession \u2014 and excuse them from criminal responsibility. In fact, the medical profession has no such clearly defined category, and the classifications it has developed for purposes of treatment, commitment, etc., may be inappropriate for assessing responsibility in criminal cases. Since these classifications were familiar, however, many psychiatrists understandably used them in court despite their unsuitability. And some psychiatrists, perhaps unwittingly, permitted their own notions about blame to determine whether the term mental illness should be limited to psychoses, should include serious behavior disorders, or should include virtually all mental abnormalities. To ensure that the views of the experts would not bind the fact-finder, we decided to give mental illness a legal definition independent of its medical meaning. We announced in McDonald v. United States that mental illness \u201cincludes any abnormal condition of the mind which substantially affects mental or emotional processes and which substantially impairs behavior control.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We recognized that there may be many reasons why a person\u2019s ability to control is impaired. His mental or emotional processes may have been adversely affected by his genetic structure, his physical condition, his family, educational or cultural backgrounds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus we called upon the jury to \u201cconsider testimony concerning the development, adaptation and functioning of these processes and controls.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">In insanity cases today, the jury must be prepared to hear evidence concerning diverse aspects of defendant\u2019s life and then to make difficult judgments regarding the impairment of behavioral processes and controls. By their very nature these judgments cannot be precise. Thus, within the confines of the <em>Durham-McDonald </em>standard, the jury must be allowed a wide latitude in its task. A judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity is appropriate only when a jury verdict of guilty would clearly violate the law or the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">We cannot say that this was the situation in Washington\u2019s case. The district court did not err in its refusal to enter a judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">We all agree that this court\u2019s limited role in supervising the verdict does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>imply an equally limited role in supervising the evidence which is put before the jury. To the contrary, the jury\u2019s wide latitude in deciding the issue of responsibility <em>requires </em>that trial judges and appellate judges ensure that the jury base its decision on the behavioral data which are relevant to a determination of blameworthiness.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree, however, on the quality of the data in this ease. Judge Robinson and I are deeply troubled by the persistent use of labels and by the paucity of meaningful information presented to the jury. Experience with the administration of the insanity defense has revealed that, despite the earnest efforts of witnesses, counsel and judges, these defects are a recurring problem. We will therefore describe them in detail in this section. Judge Fahy will state his views on this matter in a separate concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The testimony of the defense psychiatrist, Dr. Adland, was based solely on a one hour and fifteen minute interview with defendant. Dr. Adland did not administer electroencephalogram, neurological, or physical tests, and did not have the benefit of reports of the tests given at Saint Elizabeths Hospital. He requested permission to see them, but permission was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Since the defendant was at Saint Elizabeths Hospital for two months, the two Government psychiatrists had an opportunity for more prolonged observation. Yet both Dr. Owens and Dr. Ham-man testified that they had seen Washington for approximately the same amount of time as Dr. Adland. Of course, they did have the benefit of the testing and observations performed by others at the Hospital. As Dr. Owens explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">When a patient is under constant observation, the examinations that were conducted in St. Elizabeth\u2019s by the psychiatrists, laboratory studies, psychological examinations, social service, interviews with relatives, all of this was part of the basis of my opinion that I rendered and the examination which I conducted at the medical staff conference on November 16, 1965. * * * By [constant observation] I mean 24 hours a day, and reports are submitted to the physicians as to their behavior, actions or activity while on the ward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Unfortunately, except for brief references to a Rorschach test, none of this information was presented to the jury. The Government psychiatrists claimed to have based their conclusions on these studies, but they told the jury only the conclusions without any explanation of the studies themselves, what facts the studies uncovered, and why these facts led to the conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">There was other available information, as well, which the jury was not told about. When Washington was twelve or thirteen, he was committed to Cedar Knolls, the District of Columbia School for Children. Apparently the records of that institution contained a lengthy history of Washington\u2019s childhood. At first, defense counsel moved them into evidence, but later he withdrew that request, perhaps because he thought it would be tactically unwise to make the jury read such a long report. Whatever the reason, the jury was forced to make its decision without any historical background on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">The omission of significant underlying information was one defect in the testimony. Another was that the jury was often subjected to a confusing mass of abstract philosophical discussion and fruitless disputation between lawyer and witness about legal and psychiatric labels and jargon. Dr. Hamman\u2019s entire testimony on direct examination was that Washington did not have a \u201cpassive-aggressive personality,\u201d did not suffer from any \u201cpersonality trait disturbance,\u201d did not have \u201can irresistible impulse,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>was \u201cnot mentally ill,\u201d and was not \u201cabnormal from the standpoint of psychiatric illness.\u201d A substantial part of Dr. Owens\u2019 testimony was similar. He was familiar with the defendant, had participated in a staff conference at which the defendant was discussed, and had formed an opinion about him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">Q. All right. And what was that opinion ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">A. It was my opinion that he did not have a mental disease or mental defect. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">He testified also that the defendant did not have \u201can irresistible impulse\u201d to rape, did not have a \u201cpassive-aggressive personality,\u201d and that in any event someone with a \u201cpassive-aggressive personality\u201d was not necessarily \u201cmentally ill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Even if these labels had meaning for the witnesses,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the testimony was useless unless that meaning was communicated to the jury. Explanation was attempted but it was often more confusing than clarifying. Dr. Owens explained that a \u201cpassive-aggressive personality\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">is a type of personality that an individual has, that is, everybody has some-type of personality. We all have a type of personality. I mean no one has no personality. We have some type. Well, you may say schizoid personality, or compulsive personality, but speaking of the one that you ask, such [as] the passive aggressive personality, these are broken down into two different categories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">One is passive and one is aggressive. Usually in these people the aggressive type acts out in an aggressive manner, to either major or minor stressful situations, they maneuver under close confinement or under strict rules and regulations except maneuvering into a psychosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">It is generally considered that the passive type or the aggressive type frequently or sometimes an aggressive personality will also behave in a passive manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">This is where we get the term \u201cpassive-aggressive.\u201d This is more a classification of the type of personality that the individual has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">We all have a type of personality. For example, physicians are generally considered to be compulsive personalities. That is, they are very meticulous to details and work things out or in a very orderly and organized fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">Generally speaking lawyers are considered to be aggressive or to have an aggressive personality. If they are not, they cannot be real passive [sic] and really do an expert job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-16\">They have to be aggressive. Everybody has a type of personality. I mean, you have to be categorized somewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-17\">Other explanations cast serious doubt upon the basis for many of the experts\u2019 conclusions as expressed in their labels. For example, Dr. Owens did not think the defendant had an \u201cimpulse to rape.\u201d Here is his explanation: \u201cI think it was not an impulse to rape. It was an impulse to have sexual relations with a lady and if she did not agree with it, why, they forced her.\u201d Dr. Hamman agreed that Washington did not have an irresistible impulse to rape. But here is what \u201cirresistable impulse\u201d meant to Dr. Hamman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-18\">Q. Isn\u2019t this almost irresistible, this antisocial act when he is in this situation with the urge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-19\">A. Not from the way I understand irresistible impulse. An irresistible impulse means to me that there is a conflict and the unwanted behavior breaks through. I do not think there is a conflict in Mr. Washington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-20\">Q. But, without the theory of conflict, without the conflict, isn\u2019t it a fact that he is in the situation with the urge for sexual contact, he cannot stop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>A. Well, he will just do it. no desire to stop. He has</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-2\">Q. He has no power to stop ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-3\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">Q. And, doctor, isn\u2019t it a fact that he has no power to stop an irresistible impulse ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">A. Not as I understand it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">Q. And you understand it from a legal terminology?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">A. I understand it both from legal terminology and from a psychiatric terminology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Dr. Owens testified also that Washington\u2019s difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses did not affect his \u201cvoluntary controls.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">Q. Didn\u2019t this impulse to have sexual relations affect his voluntary behavior controls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">A. No, I would not think so. I think, had a policeman, or witnesses or say, if he and two or three men had been going to rape a lady. and there had been thirty other men present, where their force would not overpower the woman, that they would have backed off for another lady somewhere else to have raped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">I think when I say it impairs his voluntary control, I would say that it did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">Dr. Hamman thought that Washington was \u201cpsychiatrically normal.\u201d Then he added, \u201cThe best definition of normal I have ever heard is the person is not too neurotic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">These labels and definitions were not merely uninformative. Their persistent use served to distract the jury\u2019s attention from the few underlying facts which were mentioned. For example, the fact that Washington\u2019s difficulties \u201cin relating adequately to other people are more severe or more extreme than the average [person\u2019s]\u201d was immersed in a dispute about whether to classify these difficulties as a \u201cpersonality defect,\u201d a \u201cpersonality problem,\u201d a \u201cpersonality disorder,\u201d a \u201cdisease,\u201d an \u201cillness,\u201d or simply a \u201ctype of personality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">The psychological examinations suggested a person of \u201cgeneral intellectual ability, with little feelings for others,\u201d a person \u201cwho acts out in an antisocial way, has little control over his desires and his needs * * * has little guilt * * * does not feel things are wrong. * * * \u201d But these facts were obscured by a dispute about whether a person with \u201csoeiopathie symptomology\u201d is or is not \u201cmentally ill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-19\">Again and again the jury was diverted from evidence of the defendant\u2019s underlying mental and emotional difficulties by the emphasis on eonclusory phrases. After defense counsel vigorously cross-examined Dr. Owens and brought out some facts which indicated that Washington\u2019s mental and emotional processes of control may have been impaired, the prosecuting attorney rehabilitated his witness as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-20\">Q. Notwithstanding that history, doctor, and after that thorough study of Mr. Washington, you are of the opinion that he was not suffering with a mental illness on August 9, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-21\">A.. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-22\">In this regard Dr. Hamman\u2019s testimony epitomized the whole trial. At times his testimony was more favorable to the defendant than the defense psychiatrist\u2019s testimony. According to Dr. Hamman, Washington had a twelve or thirteen year history of aggressive behavior. He has \u201cvery little regard for * * * people. And when he wants something, he takes it.\u201d \u201cHe has a tendency to be withdrawn, does not relate to people, tends to stay by himself.\u201d \u201cHe act out his impulses.\u201d \u201cMr. Washington [does not have] much control.\u201d \u201cHe is a very aggressive individual.\u201d Dr. Ham-man agreed that Washington \u201cdoes not have any brakes, things that stop him from doing antisocial acts\u201d and that \u201che has no power to stop.\u201d But these underlying facts were muddied by disputes and conclusions about medical and legal terminology \u2014 about whether a person is \u201cnormal\u201d if he is not \u201ctoo neurotic,\u201d about whether Washington was suffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ing from a \u201cneurosis,\u201d about whether he has a \u201cschizoid personality\u201d as opposed to \u201ctraits of a schizoid nature,\u201d about whether \u201che has sociopathic symp-tomology,\u201d or whether instead \u201che has aggressive antisocial activity,\u201d about whether he was a \u201csociopath,\u201d had \u201cpersonality difficulty,\u201d \u201cpersonality disorder,\u201d or merely \u201cpersonality problems,\u201d about whether he suffered from \u201cirresistible impulses,\u201d about whether his aggression indicated that he had a \u201ccharacter disorder,\u201d and about whether his aggressive acts were caused by a \u201cpersonality pattern the way he reacts, rather than [a personality] disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Whatever opportunity the jury may have had to focus upon the underlying information provided by Dr. Hamman, this opportunity was materially diminished by a series of redirects and recrosses which dealt entirely with labels. The prosecutor asked on redirect examination :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">Q. Now, the mere fact that this defendant has somewhat of a weird background according to what has come out here, and a very interesting sexual background, do you feel \u2014 I mean, as a result of all of this information you have assembled concerning him, is it still your opinion that this defendant was not suffering with a mental illness on August 9, 1965 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">A. That is correct. I do not think he was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The defense attorney responded on recross :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">Q. Doctor, he still has this behavior problem and the control problem with these sexual urges, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">A. I am hesitating because I want to condense this as much as possible. He has problems in society. He does not have a problem with himself, and I think mental illness \u2014 it is my opinion that mental illness is one of the problems between he [sic] and himself. He may act it out and he may not. But I do not think he has much problem with himself about this. He takes what he wants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">Q. He is an emotional cripple, is he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">Q. Doctor, wouldn\u2019t you say, based upon the history that Mr. Washington is chronically ill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">A. No. I do not think he is ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">Q. You do not think he is ill at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agy-dedup-0\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-18\">Q. He just cannot control what he is doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-19\">A. Well, now, again when you say \u201ccan\u2019t,\u201d you imply that he would like to, and has a conflict. I don\u2019t think he wants to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-20\">And finally, on redirect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-21\">Q. * * * The mere fact that he is emotionally crippled, does that mean he is mentally ill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-22\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-23\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-24\">Q.- Now, I will ask you this. You have been asked, or in reply to a question you indicated that this defendant will take what he wants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-25\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-26\">Q. Well, now, the mere fact that he will take what he wants even if it is in the field of sex, does that mean he is mentally ill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-27\">A. No.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-28\">It seems clear to Judge Robinson and me that the persistent use of conclusory labels may have hindered the jury in getting to the underlying facts.__But~w.e_ tbinlr fhat the jury obtained enough concrete information to preclude usJxom disturbing the verdict. The defense psychiatrist and, on pross-fixaiwnatwn.J-.he Government psychiatrists gave some meaningful descriptions of ripfondafft\u2019s mental and emotional processes as emphasized iir\" Judge b'ihy\u2019s concurring opinion herein. Moreover, we recognize that, taken as a whole, the testimony in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>this case was, if anything, a little better than that in most insanity cases. Under these circumstances, reversal seems inappropriate. We conclude, therefore, that the conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We all agree that more effort is needed in future cases to ensure that the issue of responsibility is decided upon sufficient information. Unfortunately, we have no easy solution. The history of the insanity defense in this jurisdiction shows that the misuse of conclusory labels has always been a central concern. The <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>test, which we have quote above,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> had two major defects. First, it encouraged psychiatrists to say whether the defendant knew \u201cright\u201d from \u201cwrong.\u201d terms which have -no particular mpriiV.p] mpgnjqjr Consequently, because the psychiatrist\u2019s attention was focused on these judgments and not on the medical facts, the jury was diverted from and perhaps even deprived of his expert knowledge. Second, and perhaps more important, the right-wrong test required psychiatrists to make a moral judgment about the defendant. It has often been argued that in the guise of an expert, the psychiatrist became the thirteenth juror, and unfortunately the most important one.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, the labels of \u201cright and wrong\u201d precluded the jury from considering all the relevant information and also encouraged the psychiatrist to impose his moral judgment upon the jury.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In Part I we described the steps taken in <em>Durham </em>and <em>McDonald </em>to enable the jury to consider all the relevant information about the defendant. <em>Durham </em>and <em>McDonald </em>were also attempts to clarify the respective roles of the expert<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the jury by reducing the emphasis on conclusory labels. We thought the new test announced in <em>Durham </em>would allow the expert to testify in <em>medical </em>terms familiar to him and to his profession. The jury would no longer be forced to focus on the conclusory labels used by the expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">Soon after <em>Durham </em>we found that, although the jury was being given more information, still too much emphasis was being placed upon the labels used by the psychiatrist, upon whether he concluded that the defendant did or did not have a \u201cmental illness.\u201d In Carter v. United States<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we pointed out again that <em>Durham </em>was designed to eliminate this kind of labeling.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">Unexplained medical labels \u2014 schizophrenia, paranoia, psychosis, neurosis, psychopathy \u2014 are not enough. Description and explanation of the origin, development and manifestations of the alleged disease are the chief functions of the expert witness. The chief value of an expert\u2019s testimony in this field, as in all other fields, rests .upon the material from which his oninion is fashioned and tne reasoning by which he progresses from nis material \u2014 to\u2014his\u2014coirdu&amp;Tuiu\u2014in\u2014tfe\u00bb explanation ox file disease and its dynamics, that is, how it occurred, developed, and affected the mental and emotional processes of the defendant; it does not lie in his mere expression of conclusion. * * * Durham was intended to restrict to their proper medical function the part played by the medical experts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">This warning was not effective enough, so in McDonald v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>States<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we gave the terms \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201cdefect\" a <em>legal </em>definition independent tiftneir medical meanings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">Our eight-year experience under <em>Durham </em>suggests a <em>judicial </em>definition, however broad and general, of what is included in the terms \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201cdefect.\u201d In <em>Durham, </em>rather than define either term we simply sought to distinguish disease from defect. Our purpose now is to make it very clear that neither the court nor the jury is bound by <em>ad hoc </em>definitions or conclusions as to what experts state is a disease or defect. What psychiatrists may consider a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d for clinical purposes, where their concern is treatment, may or may not be the same as mental disease or defect for the jury\u2019s purpose in determining criminal responsibility. Consequently, for that purpose the jury should be told that a mental disease or defect includes any abnormal condition of the mind which substantially affects mental or emotional processes and substantially impairs behavior controls. Thus the jury would consider testimony concerning the development, adaptation and functioning of these processes and controls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">We emphasize that, since the question of whether the defendant has a disease or defect is ultimately for the triers of fact, obviously its resolution cannot be controlled by expert opinion. The jury must determine for itself, from all the testimony, lay and expert, whether the nature and degree of the disability are sufficient to establish a mental disease or defect as we have now defined those terms. What we have said, however, should in no way be construed to limit the latitude of expert testimony.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">We clearly separated the legal and moral question of culpability from the medical-clinical concept of illness. We hoped thereby to separate the roles of the psychiatrist and the jury, with the former stating medical-clinical facts and opinions and the latter making the judgments required by the legal and moral standard.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Also, we hoped that the expert\u2019s conclusion would not be so heavily weighted in the jury\u2019s minds if we made plain that the expert and the jury had different judgments to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">Even after <em>McDonald, </em>though, we allowed the experts to state whether they thought the defendant had a mental disease or defect. We assumed that the expert could separate the medical judgments which he was supposed to make from the legal and moral judgments which he was not supposed to make. .It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>has become abundantly apparent that this theory has not worked out. Too often conclusory labels \u2014 both medical and legal \u2014 have substituted, albeit unwittingly, for the facts and analysis which underlie them.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The transcript in this case illustrates that they may have served more to confuse the jury than to guide it. Also, testimony in terms of \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d seems to leave the psychiatrist too free to testify according to his judgment about the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">This kind of testimony does not give the jury a satisfactory basis for determining criminal responsibility. A proper adjudication requires that the jury be fully informed about the defendant\u2019s mental and emotional processes and, insofar as it affects these processes, his social situation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Of course, we cannot hope to obtain <em>all </em>the relevant information about a defendant. We cannot explore in full the effects of his genetic structure, his family relationships, his upbringing in slum or suburb. But within the limits imposed by the courtroom context and the level of scientific knowledge we should provide the jury with as much of this information as is reasonably available. We are not excused from doing what we can do simply because there are things we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">With the relevant information about defendant, and guided by the legal principles enunciated by the court, the jury must decide, in effect, whether or not the defendant is blameworthy. Undoubtedly, .the decision is often painfully difficult, and perhaps its very difficulty ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>counts for the readiness with which we have encouraged the expert to decide the question. But our society has chosen not to give this decision to psychiatrists or to any other professional elite but rather to twelve lay representatives of the community. The choice was not made on a naive assumption that all jurors would be fully capable of dealing with these difficult questions or with the underlying information. Nonetheless, this decision, along with many equally difficult ones in other areas, ranging from negligence to antitrust, was given to a jury.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As long as this is our system, we should try to make it work.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The trial judge should limit the psychiatrists\u2019 use of medical labels\u2014 schizophrenia, neurosis, etc.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It would be undesirable, as well as difficult, to eliminate completely all medical labels, since they sometimes provide a convenient and meaningful method of communication. But the trial judge should ensure that their meaning is explained to the jury and, as much as possible, that they are explained in a way which relates their meaning to the defendant.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The problem with labels, such as, \u201cproduct\u201d and \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d is even more difficult. Because these labels are employed in the legal test for responsibility, there is a danger that the psychiatric witness will view them as a legal-moral rather than a medical matter. There are two possible solutions. We could simply prohibit testimony in terms of \u201cproduct\u201d and \u201cmental disease or</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">defect.\u201d Or we could clearly instruct the expert to stick to medical judgments and leave legal-moral judgments to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">A strong minority of this court has consistently advocated that psychiatrists be prohibited from testifying whether the alleged offense was the \u201cproduct\u201d of mental illness, since this is part of the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We now adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that view. The term \u201cproduct\u201d has no clinical significance for psychiatrists. Thus there is no justification for permitting psychiatrists to testify on the ultimate issue. Psychiatrists should explain how defendant\u2019s disease or defect relates to his alleged offense, that is, how the development, adaptation and functioning of defendant\u2019s behavioral processes may have influenced his conduct. But psychiatrists should not speak directly in terms of \u201cproduct,\u201d or even \u201cresult\u201d or \u201ccause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">It can be argued that psychiatrists should also be prohibited from testifying whether the defendant suffered from a \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d since this too is part of the ultimate issue. But unlike the term \u201cproduct,\u201d the term \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d may have some clinical significance to the psychiatrist. Moreover, prohibition of testimony about \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d would not be a panacea. Other words and other concepts may similarly be transformed into labels. For example, in <em>McDonald </em>we spoke about \u201cabnormal\u201d conditions of the mind, about impairment of mental and emotional processes, and about control mechanisms.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The transcript of this trial illustrates how easily these concepts can become slogans, hiding facts and representing nothing more than the witness\u2019s own conclusion about the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">At least for now, rather than prohibit testimony on \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d we shall try to help the psychiatrists understand their role in court, and thus eliminate a fundamental cause of unsatisfactory expert testimony. A copy of the explanatory instruction to psychiatrists which we have set out in the Appendix should accompany all or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ders requiring mental examinations so that the psychiatrists will be advised of the kind of information they are expected to provide. To ensure that counsel and the jury are also so advised, the trial judge should give the explanatory instruction in open court to the first psychiatric witness immediately after he is qualified as an expert. It need not be repeated to later witnesses. Some of it will be repeated in the court\u2019s instruction to the jury at the end of the trial, but we think the jury should hear it in full and <em>before </em>the testimony. Although an instruction at this juncture is not usual, this court has required one in somewhat analogous circumstances.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZo\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Court\u2019s Instruction to Expert Witness in Cases Involving the \u201cInsanity Defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Dr. _, this instruction is being given to you in advance of your testimony as an expert witness, in order to avoid confusion or misunderstanding. The instruction is not only for your guidance, but also for the guidance of counsel and the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Because you have qualified as an expert witness your testimony is governed by special rules. Under ordinary rules, witnesses are allowed to testify about what they have seen and heard, but are not always allowed to express opinions and conclusions based on these observations. Due to your training and experience, you are allowed to draw conclusions and give opinions in the area of your special qualifications. However, you may not state conclusions or opinions as an expert unless you also tell the jury what investigations, observations, reasoning and medical theory led to your opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">As an expert witness, you may, if you wish and if you feel you can, give your opinion about whether the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect. You may then explain how defendant\u2019s disease or defect relates to his alleged offense, that is, how the development, adaptation and functioning of defendant\u2019s behavioral processes may have influenced his conduct. This explanation should be so complete that the jury will have a basis for an informed judgment on whether the alleged crime was a \u201cproduct\u201d of his mental disease or defect. But it will not be necessary for you to express an opinion on whether the alleged crime was a \u201cproduct\u201d of a mental disease or defect and you will not be asked to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">It must be emphasized that you are to give your expert diagnosis of the defendant\u2019s mental condition. This word of caution is especially important if you give an opinion as to whether or not the defendant suffered from a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d because the clinical diagnostic meaning of this term may be different from its legal meaning. You should not be concerned with its legal meaning. Neither should you consider whether you think this defendant should be found guilty or responsible for the alleged crime. These are questions for the court and jury. Further, there are considerations which may be relevant in other proceedings or in other contexts which are not relevant here; for example, how the defendant\u2019s condition might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>change, or whether he needs treatment, or is treatable, or dangerous, or whether there are adequate hospital facilities, or whether commitment would be best for him, or best for society. What is desired in this case is the kind of opinion you would give to a family which brought one if its members to your clinic and asked for your diagnosis of his mental condition and a description of how his condition would be likely to influence his conduct. Insofar as counsel\u2019s questions permit, you should testify in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">When you are asked questions which fall within the scope of your special training and experience, you may answer them if you feel competent to do so; otherwise you should not answer them. If the answer depends upon knowledge and experience generally possessed by ordinary citizens, for example questions of morality as distinguished from medical knowledge, you should not answer. You should try to separate expert medical judgments from what we may call \u201clay judgments.\u201d If you cannot make a separation and if you do answer the question nonetheless, you should state clearly that your answer is not based solely upon your special knowledge. It would be misleading for the jury to think that your testimony is based on your special knowledge concerning the nature and diagnosis of mental conditions if in fact it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In order that the jury may understand exactly what you mean, you should try to explain things in simple language. Avoid technical terms whenever possible. Where medical terms are useful or unavoidable, make sure you explain these terms clearly. If possible, the explanation should not be merely general or abstract but should be related to this defendant, his behavior and his condition. Where words or phrases used by counsel are unclear, or may have more than one meaning, you should ask for clarification before answering. You should then explain your answer so that your understanding of the question is clear. You need not give \u201cyes or no\u201d answers. In this way any confusion may be cleared up before the questioning goes on.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Some final words of caution. Because we have an adversary system, counsel may deem it is his duty to attack your testimony. You should not construe this as an attack upon your integrity. More specifically, counsel may try to undermine your opinions as lacking certainty or adequate basis. We recognize that an opinion may be merely a balance of probabilities and that we cannot demand absolute certainty. Thus you may testify to opinions that are within the zone of reasonable medical certainty. The crucial point is that the jury should know how your opinion may be affected by limita-tations of time or facilities in the examination of this defendant or by limitations in present psychiatric knowledge. The underlying facts you have obtained may be so scanty or the state of professional knowledge so unsure that you cannot fairly venture any opinion. If so, you should not hesitate to say so. And, again, if you do give an opinion, you should explain what you did to obtain the underlying facts, what these facts are, how they led to the opinion, and what, if any, are the uncertainties in the opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-16\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>King v.

An alternative to <em>Durham-McDonald </em>would be to make the ultimate test whether or not it is just to blame the defendant for his act. If the question were simply whether it is \u201cjust\u201d to \u201cblame\u201d the defendant, then mental illness, productivity, ability to control oneself, etc., might be factors which the jury could consider in reaching its conclusion on the justness of punishment. Since the words \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cblame\u201d do not lend themselves to refined definition, the charge to the jury under this test probably would not be detailed. <em>But the </em>words that have been used in other charges, such as \u201cdefect of reason,\u201d \u201cdisease of the mind,\u201d \u201cnature and quality of the act,\u201d \u201cbehavior controls,\u201d \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d \u201ccapacity * * * to appreciate the criminality of his conduct,\u201d and \u201ccapacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law,\u201d are also vague \u2014 the chief difference being that these words give a false impression of scientific exactness, an impression which may lead the jury to ignore its own moral judgment and defer to the moral judgment of scientific \u201cexperts.\u201d However, we are unaware of any test for criminal responsibility which does not focus on the term \u201cmental illness,\u201d or some closely similar term.

The phrase \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d has been criticized for not giving enough guidance to the jury. In this regard the phrase is similar to other conclusory labels in the law. For example, \u201cnegligence\u201d is a vague label given content primarily by the conclusions for which it stands. A person is \u201cnegligent\u201d if he is at \u201cfault\u201d (blameworthy?), or if he has not exercised \u201cdue care,\u201d or if he has not met some standard of reasonable conduct. We are comfortable with a concept like negligence because we understand that it is a conclusion based on other considerations.

The Department of Defense has directed medical officers to avoid \u201cthe use of scientific jargon\u201d in court martial proceedings. \u201cThe witness should use the approximate lay equivalents, or, if technical terms are unavoidable, should define them.\u201d Moreover, the expert witness is instructed that it is his \u201cobligation to make his method and techniques intelligible to the court\u201d and that he \u201cshould never hesitate to admit before a court the limitations of his medical knowledge and experience.\u201d Department of Defense, Psychiatry in Military Law 35, 37 (approved draft 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In the Soviet Union, courts reject psychiatric reports which employ too many technical and evaluative terms.

A diagnosis of the defendant\u2019s condition, while involving conclusions of a kind, is admissible even though a jury is not bound by a diagnosis or a particular diagnostic label on a mental disorder. The jury wants and needs help from the expert, but it does not help a jury of laymen to be told of a diagnosis limited to the esoteric and swiftly changing vocabulary of psychiatry. Every technical description ought to be \u201ctranslated\u201d in terms of \u201cwhat I mean by this,\u201d followed by a down-to-earth concrete explanation in terms which convey meaning to laymen. A psychiatrist who gives a jury a diagnosis, for example, of \u201cpsychoneurotic reaction, obsessive compulsive type\u201d and fails to explain fully what this means, would contribute more to society if he were permitted to stay at his hospital post taking care of patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">It is at this point where trial counsel\u2019s responsibility comes into play. It is for him to elicit, either by direct or cross-examination, \u201cthe material from which [the psychiatric] opinion is fashioned\u201d and the steps by which the raw material of the tests, observations and other data led to the diagnosis and opinion. The value of an expert opinion can rise no higher than the facts and premises on which it is based. But it is only a rare medical witness who is so skilled in the forensic art that he can present testimony adequately even where there is inept interrogation by counsel. If trial counsel fail in their role the trial judge would be well advised to urge them, out of the presence of the jury, to explore and develop the subject so that the witness can translate all of his medical observations to the jury. This is the area in which the deterioration if not breakdown of the trials of these \u201cinsanity\u201d cases is to a large extent the fault of the trial counsel. If lawyers want the views of the experts to be accepted by lay jurors their first duty is to draw out expert testimony in terms which are intelligible and meaningful. [Campbell v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 260 at 277-78, 307 F.2d 597 at 614-15 (1962) (Burger, J., dissenting).]</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The need for judicial supervision may be heightened by the \u201cbreakdown\u201d of the adversary system in these cases, a failure caused largely by the complexity of the issue, the indigency of the defendant, or both.

Indeed McCormick says that the \u201ccore\u201d of the opinion evidence rule would be preserved by a rule \u201cprescribing that the trial judge in his discretion may require that a witness, before giving testimony in terms of inference on general description, shall first give the concrete details upon which the inference or description is founded, so far as feasible. [Citing Uniform Rules of Evidence, Rule 57.]\u201d McCobmick, Evidence 24 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">. In a number of cases in this court appellants have protested the \u201ctrial by label\u201d especially the practice of allowing a psychiatrist to tell the jury that the defendant\u2019s act, for which he is on trial, is <em>not </em>the \u201cproduct\u201d of mental disease. The reason is obvious: when a qualified expert psychiatrist with the mantle of professional standing, and medical degrees in a high calling, tells a jury that the act charged is <em>not </em>the \u201cproduct\u201d of any \u201cmental disease\u201d he is stating a conclusion <em>that the defendant ought to be found guilty. </em>As I view it, no witness, expert or otherwise, should ever be allowed to state that conclusion to a jury. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">I suggest also that if contending counsel and the psychiatrists are forbidden to take the \u201ceasy way\u201d by testifying on the causal connection in terms of \u201cproduct\u201d this very fact will <em>compel </em>compliance with our unanimous opinion in Carter * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">The pernicious practice of allowing the conclusion opinions on \u201cproduct\u201d by experts, apart from its other vices, has operated to <em>narrow </em>and constrict the scope of psychiatric testimony when what we want is to <em>broaden </em>that scope. * * * The function of the psychiatrist is not to try to tell the jurors what verdict they should render but rather to portray, as fully and completely as possible, the mental and emotional makeup of the defendant, how his emotional and intellectual processes work and how they affected his capacity to control his conduct, both generally and in the specific situation surrounding the crime charged. They should try to portray the \u201cinner man\u201d as best they can without fanciful speculation. The opinions must be based on \u201creasonable medical certainty\u201d which has always been the legal standard for expert medical opinions. The experts cannot be expected to know all these answers as to every defendant but these are the areas in which they should be examined and cross-examined extensively. Only by doing this can we avoid the sterile, atrophying process of letting these trials continue to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>contests of labels in which the prosecution strains to get at least one expert to say \u201cno disease\u201d or \u201cno product\u201d and defense strains for the opposing labels. The natural tendency of advocates is to stop as soon as they have made a record which will assure that they will get to the jury \u2014 or get a directed verdict. The ultimate responsibility \u2014 and power \u2014 to prevent witnesses from violating rules of evidence lies with judges. [Campbell v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 30 [113 U.S.App.D.C.] at 276-77, 307 F.2d at 613-14 (Burger, J., dissenting).]</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">See also Blocker v.

Spaulding, 293 U.S. 498, 55 S.Ct. 273, 79 L.Ed. 617 (1935); Simmons v. United States, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 122, 206 F.2d 427 (1953); Deaver v.

And <em>cf. </em>Engle v. Stull, 126 U.S.App. D.C. 291, 377 F.2d 930 (1967) (Fahy, J., concurring). There are cases to the contrary, but they seem to be based on the theory that the conclusion was simply a summary of the underlying facts. See, <em>e.g., </em>Ewing v. United States, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 23, 135 F.2d 633, 642 (1942); MacAfee v. Higgins, 31 App.D.C. 355 (1908); Turner v. American Security &amp; Trust Co., <em>supra </em>note 30; In re Cottrill\u2019s Estate, 39 F.Supp. 689 (D.C.D.C. 1941). A conclusion about \u201cproduct\u201d is not merely a summary of the underlying medical psychological and social facts. It is an opinion on whether or not the defendant should be found guilty. \u201c * * * [T]here is a kind of statement by the witness which amounts to little more than an expression of his belief as to how the case should be decided. * * * Such extreme expressions as these all courts, it is believed, would exclude. [Citing cases.] There is no necessity for such evidence, and to receive it would tend to suggest that the judge and jury may shift responsibility for decision to the witnesses.\u201d McCormick, Evidence 25 (1954). According to McCormick, even Dean Wigmore, the leading proponent of opinion testimony, would exclude this kind of conclusion, <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">If testimony about \u201cproduct\u201d were prohibited, then, the reason would not simply be that it is part of the ultimate conclusion but that it is a legal and moral conclusion about which psychiatrists and other experts have no more expertise than jurors.

I agree, however, that <em>McDonald </em>was helpful in clarifying the respective role of witness and jury; and I shall comment later with respect to blame in this type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Part II</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">As to Part II of the opinion I too would have welcomed fuller information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>about the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I do not feel justified, however, in joining in the court\u2019s appraisal of the testimony on the issue of defendant\u2019s mental condition. It is true that labels were used by the psychiatrists but the record I think discloses rather full explanations of their medical terminology.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In addition to the opinion\u2019s excerpt from Dr. Owens\u2019 explanation of \u201cpassive-aggressive personality,\u201d which seems to me to clarify his views, the doctor went further in explanation. I dislike to burden the opinion with lengthy quotations from his testimony, but do need to be indicative. Thus, the following appears during his examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">Q Now, doctor, do you feel that Mr. Washington has any personality de-defect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">A Not in the sense of \u201cdefect.\u201d I would prefer to say he has personality problems, that is a difficulty in getting along or adjusting, that probably the difficulties that he experiences in relating adequately to other people are more severe or more extreme than the average person has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">Q Is it accurate to say that he has a personality disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">A I generally would prefer not to say \u201cdisorder,\u201d because when you say \u201cdisorder,\u201d this denotes that you mean something is wrong, that is a disease or an illness or some disorder. I would prefer to say that he has a personality, a type of personality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">Q What type of personality do you think he has?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">A My opinion would be that he was generally or would generally be described as somewhat schizoid, that is, he has difficulty relating to people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">He gets angry if he does not have his way. He tends at times to spend his time alone, or has difficulty relating to people with some aggression when he does not \u2014 when things do not go exactly his way, he acts out in an aggressive manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">* *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-15\">Q Doctor, do you believe, based upon the examination of Mr. Washington and the records that he would be classified with this terribly ambiguous term \u201cnormal\u201d \u2014 is he normal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-16\">A Well, a lot depends, if you mean by \u201cnormal,\u201d that he has no mental illness, then he would be normal in my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-17\">However if you mean normal by his behavior, being socially acceptable, then he would not be normal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">This was pursued still further in ordinary language of explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-19\">When the doctor used the term \u201csocio-pathic symptomology\u201d he was asked its meaning and replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-20\">A By sociopath, we mean an individual who is antisocial. That is a type of personality who acts out in an anti-social way, has little control over his desires and his needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-21\">He is constantly repetitiously being involved in criminal activity. He has little guilt. He does not feel that things are wrong. The only time he feels it is wrong is when he gets caught.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-22\">Q Little anxiety?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-23\">A Very little. They usually act out, behave in an anti-social manner before they get anxiety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-24\">Q Rape is consistent with a soeio-pathic personality, is not that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-25\">A Any crime would be consistent with it. There are sociopaths who commit crimes and sociopaths who do not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-26\">During Dr. Hamman\u2019s testimony for the United States he was asked, \u201cCould you tell us in psycho-dynamic terms how you analyze Mr. Washington\u2019s personality?\u201d He responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>A I think he is an individual, it is my opinion that he is an individual who does have impulses. He does have drives. Who has very little regard for the people. And when he wants something, he takes it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">Q He will act out these impulses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">Q The impulses, if they are strong, he will act strongly ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">Q Psychiatrically considering this picture of Mr. Washington, don\u2019t you think he has a personality difficulty or personality disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">A No. I think he has personality problems. But I don\u2019t think they are marked to the extent that I would call them character neurotic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">Q I don\u2019t understand what you mean, doctor. Would you explain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">A Well, he is not the best adjusted person in the world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-14\">A He is a very aggressive individual, there is no question about that. But I do not think he has a mental illness. I do not think he has \u2014 I do not think he shows symptoms that would justify a diagnosis of a character disorder, personality disorder, or a neurosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-15\">Q Doctor, isn\u2019t it all a question of degree in reaching your diagnostic impression ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-16\">A Absolutely right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-17\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-18\">Q And isn\u2019t this behavior, which is this aggressive behavior, directly caused by this personality problem which is of a sociopathie nature ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-19\">A It is caused \u2014 no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-20\">Q No?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-21\">A Look, anything that any of us do is caused by our personality, by our character. I would not know whether you want to call this illness or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-22\">It seems to me the witnesses\u2019 explanations of their opinions were understandable. One might not be persuaded by them, but that is a different matter. Doctors Owens and Hamman, both witnesses for the Government, readily conceded impulsive conduct by defendant, his \u201clack of brakes\u201d in his sexual urge; but in their opinion this was not due to mental disease and they explained in understandable language the situation as they saw it. I think it was fairly put to the jury on the evidence to decide whether defendants\u2019 weakness in sexual matters amounted to mental disease excusing him from criminal responsibility, or, on the other hand, was a character or personality weakness which did not absolve him of such responsibility. I agree with the court that we should seek improvement, and that the witnesses should inform the jury clearly of the meaning of their medical terms, and of the basis for their opinions; but I do not feel justified in saying that the use of labels, when considered with all the testimony, left the jury confused in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-24\">Part III</p>\n<p id=\"b532-25\">I have no particular comment upon the court\u2019s analysis of the development of the law in this jurisdiction which led to our unanimous <em>McDonald </em>decision. There we pointed out the needed distinction between a courtroom test and a clinical test, to be made clear to the jury in deciding the issue of criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-26\">As to this part of the opinion I add: (1) I have no difficulty in adhering to our decision permitting the psychiatrist to give his opinion as to the existence of a mental disease or defect, provided the basis for the opinion is explained to the jury in understandable terms and has substantial factual basis of which the jury is also advised by the witness; and (2) I think it probable as matters have developed that to permit the witness to give his opinion in exact \u201cproduct\u201d language is likely to give undue weight to his view on the ultimate issue, tending to detract from the responsibility of the jury. But I do not wish to decide in the abstract that in a particular case, in explaining the relation of the disease or defect, if any, to the conduct charged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>should the witness find it useful to speak in \u201ccausal\u201d language, or use the term \u201cproduct\u201d in that connection, I would for that reason alone find error. We have not in the past, and I do not now, construe United States v. Spaulding, 293 U.S. 498, 506, 55 S.Ct. 273, 79 L.Ed. 617, to bar such testimony in this type of case. The issue there was whether Spaulding was totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of a federal policy of insurance and statute. The record was replete with factual evidence as to his physical condition and his activities. The Court stated that the issue of total and permanent disability was the ultimate question to be decided by the jury, was not a question to be resolved by opinion evidence, and the experts ought not to have been asked or allowed to state their conclusions \u201con the whole case.\u201d The particular scope of this ruling, however, is indicated by the decisions the Court cites, of which Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 472, 24 L.Ed. 256 is illustrative. There the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">The subject of proposed inquiry was a matter of common observation, upon which the lay or uneducated mind is capable of forming a judgment. In regard to such matters, experts are not permitted to state their conclusions. On questions of science their opinions are received, for in such questions scientific men have superior knowledge, and generally think alike. Not so in matters of common knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">And see our own case of Henkel v. Var-ner, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 138 F.2d 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In the present case to give an opinion in terms of product or cause<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not to state an expert conclusion on \u201cthe whole case,\u201d for independent evidence supporting the existence of mental disease or defect is required before the causal issue is reached. For the same reason the product or causal issue is not the whole of the ultimate issue, which is a combination of the two factors, the factor of mental condition and of its relation to the act charged. More important, such an opinion does not relate to a matter of common knowledge or observation as to which the expert in psychiatry does not often have knowledge superior to that of the \u201clay or uneducated mind.\u201d True it is that the jury of laymen must form a judgment on the issue of criminal responsibility, but this does not bar from the jury such assistance in forming that judgment as a person specially qualified by education and experience in psychiatry might afford. Such a problem as we now consider is not like a case of physical disability, as was <em>Spaulding. </em>While I think for the reason I have given the expert ordinarily should avoid testifying in the language of \u201cproduct,\u201d I do not think such testimony is barred by <em>Spaulding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">I join in the requirement of an instruction to the witness, referred to in Part III of the opinion. This seems to me a very desirable and helpful development which I hope the trial judges as well as counsel and witnesses will welcome. ' I assume the substance rather than the exact form of instruction as it appears in Appendix A would suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">A few remarks are offered upon the court\u2019s reference to blameworthiness and moral judgment. Blame, in the sense and to the extent of criminal responsibility, does not attach where, under the standards applicable to the defense of insanity,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the jury has at least a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>doubt that the act stemmed from a mind free of any mental disease or defect which was causally related to the commission of the act. But this basic moral decision is made by society, not by juries. Society, acting through law, has established the defense of insanity, which relieves the accused of criminal responsibility for an act which results from a mental disease or defect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether or not this defense is established in a particular case is a factual decision to be made by the jury on the evidence bearing on the mental condition of the accused and on the relation of that condition to the conduct charged. In reaching this factual decision the jury is aware that blame \u2014 to the extent of criminal responsibility \u2014 will or will not attach under the law. In this very limited sense perhaps the jury\u2019s decision can be said to be a moral judgment, but only because the jury\u2019s factual decision does or does not bring the defendant within the coverage of the law\u2019s moral decision. The jury is called upon to decide on evidence respecting the defense of insanity. The jury is not free to express by its verdict its view of blame or morals unrelated to its appraisal of the evidence on the issue of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Juries generally, not only in these cases, are influenced by what they think is right and just in the context of the facts and law of the case they decide. Their task is different here only because they are required often in these cases to make a difficult and subjective factual decision about the state of a person\u2019s mind, and its relation to particular conduct, \u201ca subtle issue of a person\u2019s mental condition in relation to criminal responsibility.\u201d Douglas v. United States, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 232, 239, 239 F.2d 52, 59. It was this nature of the issue no doubt that led the court in <em>Holloway, swpra </em>n. 3, to state that in a \u201cborderline case\u201d the application of the tests \u201ccan be nothing more than a moral judgment that it is just or unjust to blame the defendant * * <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"At6\">. As to the Cedar Knolls record, it is clear that counsel\u2019s decision not to press for its admission in evidence was deliberate and well considered. I have no basis for concluding that a different decision would have been helpful to defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\">.
