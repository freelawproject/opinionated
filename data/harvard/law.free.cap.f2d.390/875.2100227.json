The court below denied relief, upon the theory there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>proof of such request, and that appellant had waived any right to such representation (C.T. 13, 18-19).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The real issue on this appeal is whether appellant did have assistance of counsel on his appeal. The record discloses that Thomas Lefner, his retained counsel below, reviewed the trial transcript and prepared the Opening Brief, after consulting with Lofland. Lefner\u2019s oral argument attempted to rebut the contentions put forth in the Appellee\u2019s Brief. These proved facts overcome Lofland\u2019s vague allegations that Lefner was an \u201camicus curiae\u201d only, and was not formally appointed \u201cimmediately.\u201d Appellant has failed to allege specific facts showing that he was actually deprived of the assistance of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The denial of appellant\u2019s motion to vacate is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
