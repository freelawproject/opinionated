The agreement contained no provision to pay attorney fees upon default. Cupples sold goods to Trimble and presented to the Bank Trimble\u2019s check for $9,903.64. The Bank refused payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-28\">Cupples\u2019s diversity action against the Bank was dismissed for want of jurisdictional amount. On this appeal Cupples claims that jurisdictional amount is met by the liability of the Bank for attorney fees under Texas law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Attorney fees are includible in the jurisdictional amount in controversy, Missouri State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Life Ins.
