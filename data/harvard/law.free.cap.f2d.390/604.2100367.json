(Alexander\u2019s), motion for summary judgment in its favor and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint and action.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-18\">In its complaint, plaintiff alleged that it manufactures and sells ladies\u2019 intimate apparel, including undergarments and panties; that it is the owner of the registered trademarks \u201cKiki,\u201d \u201cKiki Magic,\u201d \u201cKiki Control\u201d and \u201cKiki Satin-ette\u201d; that its products bear its trademark \u201cKiki\u201d or one of the other marks; that defendant has adopted and is using the trademark \u201cKicky\u201d on ladies\u2019 and misses\u2019 skirts and \u201cpossibly\u201d on goods of the same character as bear plaintiff\u2019s \u201cKiki\u201d trademark; that the trademark \u201cKicky\u201d is confusingly and deceptively similar to the trademark \u201cKiki\u201d and constitutes a colorable imitation thereof; that Alexander\u2019s adopted the trademark \u201cKicky\u201d to sell and palm off its merchandise as that of plaintiff; that Alexander\u2019s purpose was to deceive the public into believing that its products originated or were connected with plaintiff; and (by amendment) that the public has come to recognize products bearing the \u201cKiki\u201d trademark as originating with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-19\">The answer, in substance, pleaded a general denial and defenses of laches and the descriptive word quality of \u201ckicky\u201d which foreclosed infringement as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-20\">The motion for summary judgment (Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P.) called for the .resolution of whether there were genuine issues as to material facts. The proof adduced before the court established clearly that the word \u201ckicky\u201d was used by Alexander\u2019s only as a descriptive adjective to indicate a youthful, sporty, \u201cpert\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or \u201csassy\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appearance; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the adjective was applied by Alexander\u2019s in its newspaper advertising to jumpers, sweaters, dresses, shifts, slacks, winter\u2019 coats, ski jackets, tights, hats, shoes and handbags; and that the word \u201ckicky\u201d was also used as an adjective by many other manufacturers and stores in advertisements appearing in such magazines as \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d \u201cIngenue,\u201d \u201cHarper\u2019s Bazaar,\u201d \u201cGlamour,\u201d \u201cVogue\u201d and \u201cSeventeen\u201d in describing such articles of apparel as skirts, coats, shoes and heels and, more technically, pleats and hemlines. Even more significant is the fact that plaintiff has offered no proof that Alexander\u2019s used \u201ckicky\u201d as a trademark or other than as a descriptive adjective. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b) (4) provides in part that a term \u201cdescriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe to users the goods * * * of such party\u201d does not constitute infringement. See, Feathercombs, Inc. v. Solo Products Corporation, 306 F.2d 251, 256 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 910, 83 S.Ct. 253, 9 L.Ed.2d 170 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">As to the unfair competition claim, although plaintiff asserts that there are questions of fact to be resolved, the record is completely devoid of such facts. No proof was offered that the public in buying coats, sweaters, or shoes described as \u201ckicky\u201d believed that it was receiving merchandise manufactured by the producers of \u201cKiki\u201d panties. Nor was any proof submitted that \u201ckicky\u201d was unfairly used as a \u201ctrade-mark or trade name by a competitor seeking to palm off his products as those of the original user of the trade name.\u201d Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., 305 U.S. 315, 335-336, 59 S.Ct. 191, 83 L.Ed. 195 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The court below in a careful analysis of the facts, the statutory defense, and the case law properly determined \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s claim to be without merit,\u201d both as to trademark infringement and unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-14\">.
