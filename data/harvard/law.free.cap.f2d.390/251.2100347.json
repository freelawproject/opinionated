(\u201cHaupt\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Haupt had been engaged in a general brokerage and commission business. In the fall of 1963, as a result of what has come to be known as the \u201cSalad Oil Swindle,\u201d Haupt found itself in dire financial straits and was suspended from trading by the New York Stock Exchange. On March 23, 1964, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed with the district court against Haupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Between December 1963 and March 1964, appellant had received transfers of property worth some $20,700 from Haupt. These transfers, occurring as they did within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, could have, if they met certain other requirements, constituted voidable preferences as described in Section 60 a of the Bankruptcy Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 96 a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, if so, might be avoided by the Trustee in Bankruptcy under Section 60 b, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 96 b.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">On March 30, 1964, a petition under Section 321 of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 721, was filed with the District \"Court\" in the pending bankruptcy proceeding, purportedly on behalf of Haupt. This petition called for the initiation of a Chapter XI [\u00a7\u00a7 301-399 of the Act] \u201carrangement\u201d which is defined as \u201cany plan of a debtor for the settlement, satisfaction, or extension of the time of payment of his unsecured debts upon any terms.\u201d Section 306(1), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>On June 10, 1964, the Referee in Bankruptcy granted a motion to dismiss the Chapter XI petition on the ground that the petition was not the voluntary act of Haupt in that Haupt\u2019s managing partner, Morton Kamerman, did not join in the Chapter XI petition. The Referee\u2019s order was affirmed, In re Ira Haupt &amp; Co., 234 F.Supp. 167 (S.D. N.Y.1964), affirmed, 343 F.2d 726 and 348 F.2d 907 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">By order and decree dated June 26, 1964, Haupt was adjudged bankrupt. Appellee was appointed Trustee and has acted as such since he qualified on October 7, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Meanwhile, appellant had filed with the Bankruptcy Court a proof of debt in the amount of $11,600 against Haupt which has never been allowed or disallowed. By notice of motion dated May 20, 1966, the Trustee instituted a proceeding objecting to the claim of appellant and requesting that the claim be disallowed unless appellant surrendered and turned over to the bankrupt estate the sum of $20,700 with interest, which represented the voidable preference mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Appellant moved to dismiss the Trustee\u2019s application and objection as time barred. In his original decision, the Referee agreed with appellant and dismissed the Trustee\u2019s application. However, on reargument, he reversed himself and held that the Trustee\u2019s application was timely. The District Court affirmed and appellant brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Both parties agree that the two-year statute of limitations of Section 11 e, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 29 e, is applicable. See Herget v. Central National Bank, 324 U.S. 4, 65 S.Ct. 505, 89 L.Ed. 656 (1945). Section 11 e provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\"><em>\u201cA </em>receiver or trustee may, within two years subsequent to the date of adjudication or within such further period of time as the Federal or State law may permit, institute proceedings in behalf of the estate upon any claim against which the period of limitation fixed by Federal or State law had not expired at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">The issue on this appeal centers on the question of when does the period of limitation begin to run, i. e., what is the \u201cdate of adjudication\u201d referred to in Section 11 e.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Trustee argues that it is the actual date that Haupt was adjudged a bankrupt \u2014 June 26, 1964. Thus, the Trustee\u2019s claim made on May 20, 1966, would be within the two-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">Appellant claims that the \u201cdate of adjudication\u201d is the date on which the Chapter XI petition was filed \u2014 March 30, 1964. In support of this contention, appellant relies on Section 302, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 702,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which provides in part: that \u201cthe date of adjudication shall be taken to be the date of the filing of the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>tion under section 321 or 322 of this Act except where an adjudication had previously been entered.\u201d If the \u201cdate of adjudication\u201d is taken to be the date of the filing of the Chapter XI petition, March 30, 1964, the Trustee\u2019s application to avoid the preferential transfer, filed on May 20, 1966, was beyond the two-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The Referee\u2019s opinion on the reargument and the District Court\u2019s opinion affirming the Referee\u2019s order, both determined that Section 391, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 791, was applicable to this case to <em>suspend </em>the two-year statute of limitations of Section 11 e while the arrangement proceeding was pending. Section 391 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201cAll statutes of limitation affecting claims provable under this chapter [Chapter XI] and the running of all periods of time prescribed by this title in respect to the commission of acts of bankruptcy, the recovery of preferences and the avoidance of liens and transfers shall be suspended while a proceeding under this chapter is pending and until it is finally dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The District Court, however, also held that the \u201cdate of adjudication\u201d which started the running of the statute of limitations of Section 11 e, was the date Haupt actually was adjudicated a bankrupt on June 26, 1964. In support of this holding, the district court relied upon Section 378(1), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 778(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\u201cUpon the entry of an order directing that bankruptcy be proceeded with-\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">(1) in the case of a petition filed under section 321 of this title, the bankruptcy proceeding shall be deemed reinstated and thereafter shall be conducted, so far as possible, as if such petition under this chapter had not been filed; * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">If the Chapter XI petition \u201chad not been filed,\u201d the date of adjudication would be the date that Haupt was actually adjudged a bankrupt \u2014 June 26, 1964. The statute of limitations not beginning to run until that date, the Trustee\u2019s application on May 20, 1966, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">It is obvious that if a statute of limitations has not yet commenced to run, there will be no need to suspend its running. We believe that the court below was correct in holding that Section 378 (1) is controlling in this case and that the statute of limitations of Section 11 e did not begin to run until the date Haupt was actually adjudged a bankrupt. Consequently, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the Referee and \u25a0 the - court below were correct in their holding that Section 391 operates to suspend the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">\n<em>Section 302</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">We cannot agree with appellant\u2019s contention that by virtue of Section 302, the statute of limitations began to run from the date of the filing of the Chapter XI petition. Section 302 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-14\"><em>\u201cThe provisions of chapters I to VII, inclusive, of this title shall, </em>insofar as they are not inconsistent with or in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, <em>apply in proceedings under this chapter [Chapter XI]. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqe\">For the purposes of such application * * * the date of adjudication shall be taken to be the date of the filing of the petition under section 321 or 322 of this title except where an adjudication had previously been entered\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">The difficulty with appellant\u2019s contention is that, after a petition for an arrangement has been dismissed, we are no longer dealing with a proceeding under Chapter XI. Section 302 merelj purports to indicate that certain provi sions of the straight bankruptcy chap ters are applicable to a Chapter XI pro ceeding, not <em>vice versa. </em>If this distinct tion is not apparent from the language of Section 302 itself, Section 301, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, makes it quite clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-17\">\u201cThe provisions of this chapter [Chapter XI] shall apply exclusively to proceedings under this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Appellant cites several cases in alleged support of its position. In re Setzler, 73 F.Supp. 314, 316 (S.D.Cal.1947); United States v. Sampsell, 193 F.2d 154, 155 (9th Cir. 1951); and Henkin v. Rockower, Inc., 259 F.Supp. 202, 204 (S.D.N.Y.1966). Appellant places great reliance upon Henkin v. Roekower. <em>Henkin </em>involved a Chapter XI arrangement initiated by the filing of a Section 322 petition. The petition for arrangement was dismissed and there was an adjudication of bankruptcy. Subsequently, the Trustee, as here, sued to avoid a preferential transfer, and the defense of the statute of limitations was raised. Although the court held that the statute of limitations had not run regardless of the date chosen to start its running, it did say that Section 302 was applicable and that the period began to run from the date of the filing of th\u00e9 Chapter XI petition. A significant difference between <em>Henkin </em>and the present case is that in <em>Henkin </em>the Chapter XI arrangement proceeding was initiated by a Section 322 petition whereas here it was initiated by a Section 321 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Under Chapter XI, two types of petitions for arrangement may be filed. If no proceeding is then pending under Chapters I-VII, the petition is filed under Section 322, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 722 of the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But if a bankruptcy proceeding is pending, as in the present case, the petition for an arrangement is properly filed pursuant to Section 321, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 721.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Section 378 provides for the procedure to be followed after a petition for a Chapter XI arrangement has been dismissed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201cUpon the entry of an order directing that bankruptcy be proceeded with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">(1) in the case of a petition filed under section 321 of this title, the bankruptcy proceeding shall be deemed reinstated and thereafter shall be conducted, so far as possible, as if such petition under this chapter had not been filed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">(2) in the case of a petition filed under section 322 of this title, the proceeding shall be conducted, so far as possible, in the same manner and with like effect as if a voluntary petition for adjudication in bankruptcy had been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the day when the petition under this chapter [Chapter XI] was filed; * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">An analysis of Section 378 indicates that it, rather than Section 302, is the controlling provision <em>after </em>the Chapter XI proceeding has been dismissed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the decision in <em>Henkin </em>that the two-year period began to run on the date of the filing of the Chapter XI petition under Section 322 was not critical, since the court held the trustee\u2019s action to have been timely even on that basis, we disapprove of so much of the reasoning as relied on Section 302. We need not determine whether choice of the date of the filing of the Chapter XI petition rather than of actual adjudication was nevertheless correct on the basis of Section 378(2). Whatever may be the situation as to original Chapter XI petitions under Section 322, Section 378(2) by its terms does not apply to a Chapter XI petition under Section 321 in a pending bankruptcy. Where a Chapter XI pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>eeeding has been initiated by a Section 321 petition, as in the present case, Section 378(1) is applicable and there is nothing in Section 378(1) to suggest that the date of adjudication should be any date other than the actual date that the person was adjudged a bankrupt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">\u201cIt is clear that in a case where bankruptcy proceedings were pending at the time the petition for arrangement was filed, that is to say a \u00a7 321 case, the Referee, where the plan for arrangement is not confirmed, must restore the status quo ante and proceed as though the petition for arrangement had not been filed.\u201d In re Johnson Construction, Inc., 182 F. Supp. 576, 577 (D.C.Cal.1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The other cases upon which appellant relies are also not persuasive. In United States v. Sampsell, supra, the court was concerned with the status of an indebtedness validly incurred by a debtor in possession <em>during </em>the administration of a proceeding under Chapter XI and, hence, quite properly referred to Section 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The statement from In re Setzler, supra, upon which appellant relies was mere dictum in that case. Furthermore, since there was no reference to any particular section of the Act, it is impossible to determine whether the court was referring to Section 302 or to Section 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Appellant has made a rather exhaustive survey of the bankruptcy law in an effort to show that \u201cthere is no relevant difference between a Section 321 and Section 322 Chapter XI petition because of the wording of Section 378.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief, p. 27.) Appellant\u2019s argument is that the differences in the wording of Sections 378(1) and 378(2) result from certain practical differences between the Section 321 petition and the Section 322 petition, but that both were intended to reach the same basic result, i.e., retroactive dates of adjudication. However, the difference in statutory language reflects the difference in the procedural posture of the two situations, and whatever might be the correct result if this case arose from a Section 322 petition, there is no basis for treating it as if it were.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">For the reasons stated above, the decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\">.
