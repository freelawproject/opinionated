They challenge these portions of the charge which followed proper explanation of the measure and elements of the plaintiff\u2019s damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-19\">\u201c * * * (The jury may) allow such damages as * * * will be a fair and just compensation for the injury which the plaintiff has sustained, not to exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, the amount claimed in plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-20\">\u201cThe allegation of damages is not evidence, of course, but merely the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and must not be considered by you as evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-21\">\u201cThe allegations of the complaint as to the amount of damages * * * are not to be considered by you * * * except in this one respect, that the amount * * * claimed * * * does fix a maximum limit, and you are not permitted to award the plaintiff more than that amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-22\"> The instructions are not a correct statement of law. The amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim bears no relation to the verdict. The propriety of the verdict is tested by the evidence, not the <em>ad damnum </em>clause. Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(e); Riggs, Ferris &amp; Geer v. Lillibridge, 316 F.2d 60 (2d Cir. 1963); Barron and Holtzoff, 3 Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 1194, p. 38 (Wright ed. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-23\">Additionally, the instructions are misleading. They may leave the erroneous impression the court has ruled that any verdict not exceeding the plaintiff\u2019s claim is proper. See Williams v. Nichols, 266 F.2d 389, 390, 393 (4th Cir. 1959). It is sufficient for the court to explain to the jury the correct measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damages and the elements they should consider in reaching their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-24\">In this case we find the evidence supports the amount of the verdict. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>der the circumstances the court\u2019s reference to the <em>ad damnum </em>clause was not prejudicial. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AvE\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
