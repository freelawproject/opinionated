The district court held an evidentiary hearing at which the agents and counsel as well as appellant, testified, made exhaustive findings of fact and conclusions of law and denied relief. The Court has reviewed both this record and transcript of the original proceedings at which appellant pleaded guilty and holds that the district court had ample basis for its conclusions and the denial of relief.
