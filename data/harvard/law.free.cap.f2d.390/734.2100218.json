Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b806-24\">RICH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b806-25\">This appeal is from the decision of the Patent Office Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, 148 USPQ 236 (1965), dismissing an opposition by Dan River Mills, Incorporated, to the registration of \u201cDante\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the Principal Register for men\u2019s outer shirts, application serial No. 165,554, filed March 27, 1963, by The Yorke Shirt Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-26\">Opposer is admittedly the prior user of the registered' marks upon which it relies which are, principally, DANTWILL, DANTWEED, DANTUFF, DANTONE, AND DANDEEN.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The goods for which it holds the registrations are fabrics and the testimony is that some of the fabrics made by Dan River Mills have long been sold to shirtmakers to make shirts. Op-poser, in connection with the sale of its fabrics, supplies users with hang-tags and sew-in labels on which its fabric marks may be displayed in finished garments as indicative of the source of the fabrics.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-27\">Recognizing all of these facts and the obvious similarities between \u201cDante\u201d and opposer\u2019s marks, the board unanimously <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>found that \u201cOpposer has always used its principal trademark \u2018Dan River\u2019 on all of its goods,\u201d in addition to the individual markes compounded of DAN and some other word or symbol such as those above exemplified. The board\u2019s conclusion was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\">\u201cDante\u201d, with or without the diacritical mark, is the name of the famous Italian poet and would be so recognized by the average purchaser of applicant\u2019s goods. Accordingly, it is our opinion that \u201cDante\u201d is of such nature and character that it creates a commercial impression distinctly different from \u201cDan\u201d, per se, or any of opposer\u2019s pleaded marks. It is therefore concluded that purchasers familiar with opposer\u2019s fabrics or with shirts made therefrom bearing opposer\u2019 house mark \u201cDan River\u201d and/or its product marks are not likely to be confused as to the origin of applicant\u2019s \u201cDante\u201d shirts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aty-dedup-0\">We are of the same view after careful consideration of appellant\u2019s brief. Ap-pellee considers our decision in In re General Electric Co., 304 F.2d 688, 49 CCPA 1186, (1962), pertinent here and so do we. In that case we reversed the refusal to register VULKENE based on the prior registration of VULCAN for similar goods, one of the persuasive considerations being that VULCAN is a well-known name and therefore not likely to be confused with the arbitrary mark VULKENE. We think \u201cDante\u201d is in the same category. See also Warner-Hudnut, Inc. v. Wander Co., 280 F.2d 435, 47 CCPA 1172 (1960), where, based on an opinion by Judge Kirkpatrick, we affirmed a holding that confusion was not likely between \u201cWander\u201d and \u201cWarner.\u201d The opinion says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">It did not require evidence to enable the Assistant Commissioner to conclude that Wander is a common word and unlikely to create a surname impression and that Warner, although having a common meaning, albeit one seldom met with [one who warns], creates the impression of being a surname.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">\u201cWarner,\u201d \u201cVulcan,\u201d and \u201cDante\u201d have in common the name connotation and the marks relied on by opposer-appellant do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-17\">. The application drawing shows the mark as \u201cDante\u201d in ordinary type, the specimen shows the mark as \u201cDant\u00e9\u201d in script with the accent over the \u201ce\u201d. The board decision was rendered as to the trademark \u201cwith or without the diacritical mark.\u201d We will treat it in the same way and write the word herein without said diacritical mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-29\">. The registration numbers will be found in the published board opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-30\">. We state that the board decision and opinion were unanimous by way of answer to the repeated reference in appellant\u2019s brief to the view of the board \u201cmajority.\u201d It was not in this case that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>there was a dissent. Cf. Dan River Mills, Inc. v. Preben Mikael Aerendal Mikkelsen, 145 USPQ 295 (1965), involving DANSK FORM, in which there was a dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
