While the appellant is not shown to have been the master mind in the scheme, the record contains substantial evidence of his participation in essential parts of the undertaking and affords adequate basis for concluding that he did so with guilty knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
