BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"ACm\">Again in the trilogy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fallout we are confronted with enforcement of arbitration agreements in collective bargaining contracts. Here it is not a question of ordering arbitration, for that has taken place. Rather, the question is one of judicial enforcement of the arbiter\u2019s decision. The District Court enforced this award in the Union\u2019s <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> favor. The Employer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> urging basically that the arbiter exceeded his powers by making an erroneous ruling, appeals. We agree with the Trial Court and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">Considering that in dollars all that is at stake is an award of about $63.00 to each of 21 employees \u2014 an amount long ago exceeded by the costs of this litigation \u2014 we see afresh that \u201cproblems which to the outsider seem petty are thought by the adversaries to be matters of great principle, if not principal.\u201d United States Gypsum Co. v. United Steelworkers of America, 5 Cir., 1967, 384 F.2d 38, 46, cert. denied, 1968, 389 U.S. 1042, 88 S.Ct. 783, 19 L.Ed.2d 832. The setting and the dispute are here certainly simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-19\">The Employer\u2019s pre-January 1966 practice was for the weekly payroll period to end on Wednesday evening with pay day the next day, Thursday. In January, 1966, it posted a notice stating that the payroll closing date would be changed to Friday and that pay day would be changed to Tuesday. Subsequently, the Employer and the Union met to discuss the proposed changes because the Union thought they were too sudden and would embarrass the employees in the payment of their bills. Thereafter, on February 6,1966, the Employer, by posted notice,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> made the chang<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>es effective for the week ending Friday, February 18. As stated in the posted notice, on Tuesday, February 22, 1966, the employees were paid for services rendered the preceding Thursday and Friday (February 17 and 18, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Immediately twenty-one employees signed a grievance protesting the receipt of a check for only two days\u2019 pay. The grievance stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cRequest guaranteed 40 hours pay for week ending February 18, 1966.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">It is not disputed that the effect of the grievance was to request pay for 24 hours which were not worked. The arbiter sustained the grievance and ordered the Employer to pay each grievant the difference between his straight time rate for forty hours work and the amount received for the week ending February 18, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In attacking this award the Employer makes a persuasive, though beguiling argument. Lest we come under its spell we think it helpful to emphasize at the outset some basic things. First, there may be in these controversies two distinct problems. One is whether the grievance is arbitrable. The other is whether the award of the arbiter is to be enforced. To order arbitration is not to approve in advance all, or for that matter, any thing that the arbiter does. Especially where unusual difficulties are indicated courts expressly defer problems of enforcement to post-award proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But in both these situations we must be vigilant that we are not slipping off into that habit, easy for Judges, of \u201cdeciding the merits in the guise of adjudicating the court-reserved issue of the scope * * * of the agreement to arbitrate.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-16\">Nevertheless, there is a role, albeit a very restrictive one, for court review in post-award proceedings. We phrased it in <em>Hayes </em>(note 5 supra) this way: \u201cTo compel arbitration in the first instance is not to approve <em>carte blanche </em>in advance any decision which might be reached. The arbitrator is not a free agent dispensing his own brand of industrial justice. And if the award is arbitrary, capricious or not adequately grounded in the basic collective bargaining contract, it will not be enforced by the courts.\u201d 296 F.2d 238, 242-243.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This was a reflection of similar trilogy comments: \u201cNevertheless, an arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement ; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may of course look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. When the arbitrator\u2019s words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Here there can be no doubt that the grievance, whatever its merits, was within the agreement to arbitrate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The collective bargaining agreement, as to be expected, dealt in detail with pay, rates, scale, classification, and the like. It also expressly prescribed a minimum day<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and week.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As cast by the grievance the issue was squarely posed whether such provisions (e. g., \u00a7\u00a7 8.3 and 8.1) in the light of other undertakings justified the Employer\u2019s actions in this payroll period changeover.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The Employer\u2019s attack on the order of enforcement therefore has to be on the intrinsic merits (or lack of them) of the award. What is the standard of judicial review at that stage? Obviously, it cannot be the ordinary one of ascertaining the correctness on usual principles of law including contract construction. For if this were permissible, arbitration as the structure for industrial peace supplanting the usual processes for court adjudication would itself be supplanted by the judicial machine at the time it would count the most \u2014 that is, at the moment an arbiter\u2019s award was sought to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">On the other hand, merely because the specific controversy forming the subject of the formal grievance is within the scope of the agreement to arbitrate or the remedy fashioned is likewise within the contractual powers of the arbiter does not insulate the award from judicial scrutiny altogether. On its face the award should ordinarily reveal that it finds its source in the contract and those circumstances out of which comes the \u201ccommon law of the shop.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., supra, 363 U.S. at 580, 80 S.Ct. at 1351, 4 L.Ed.2d at 1416; Dallas Typographical Union, No. 173 v. A. H. Belo Corp., 5 Cir., 1967, 372 F.2d 577, 579. But when it reasonably satisfies these requirements we think it is not open to the court to assay the legal correctness of the reasoning pursued.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Arbiters, as do Judges, can err. And the policy of the law (see note 1 supra), committing awesome questions of great intricacy and difficulty to lay persons who need not be and frequently are not, even lawyers, has to reckon with the likelihood that the chance \u2014 and gravity \u2014of error will be greater, not less, than with traditional judicial processes. We may assume, without here deciding, that if the reasoning is so palpably faulty that no judge, or group of judges, could ever conceivably have made such a ruling then the Court can strike down the award<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But where it is not that gross the arbiter\u2019s error \u2014 even though on an issue on which the reviewing court would have arrived at a different decision does not ipso facto make the arbiter an outlaw or his erroneous action a matter outside the scope of the agreement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>arbitrate, in excess of the terms of the submission or beyond his powers as an arbiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">We emphasize again and again, as we have before, Dallas Typographical Union, No. 173 v. A. H. Belo Corp., supra, at 581; Boeing Co. v. International Ass\u2019n of Machinists etc., 5 Cir., 1967, 381 F.2d 119, that cases of the type pressed so heavily on us by the Employer<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> must not be read to justify the court resuming its traditional role of assaying the judicial acceptability of the award had it been a court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">As these admonitions are addressed primarily to ourselves as Judges on the trial and appellate fronts we should heed them by resisting the temptation to \u201creason out\u201d a la judges the arbiter\u2019s award to see if it passes muster. So it is here. But even under these self-imposed wraps this award shows on its face two things. First, the arbiter was drawing on the collective bargaining agreement as the source both of the dispute and its solution. Second, the award put forward a passably plausible \u2014even if perhaps erroneous \u2014 analysis of the interplay of the contractual wage-minimum-day-week provisions, especially in the light of the Employer\u2019s long practice of wage payment to the very eve of payment day with no withholding of earned wages.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">If such a result is unpalatable to an employer or his law-trained counsel who feels he had a hands-down certainty in a law court, it must be remembered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>that just such a likelihood is the byproduct of a consensually adopted contract arrangement \u2014 a mechanism that can hold for, as well as against, the employer<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> even to the point of outlawing labor\u2019s precious right to strike.

After referring to \u00a7\u00a7 8.1 and 8.3 (notes 10 and 11 supra) the award continued: \u201cUnder the old plan, the Company withheld little or no pay; that is, on the Thursday morning (or Wednesday evening) pay day, employees were paid for their work including Wednesday; they were paid \u2018up to the minute\u2019. Under the new plan, employees on each Tuesday pay day are not paid past the preceding Friday, \u2014 though they have worked the intervening Saturday, Sunday and Monday also. Their pay for those three days is withheld till the next Tuesday; and the employee won\u2019t be paid \u2018up to the minute\u2019 until final settlement when his employment ceases. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\u201cThe Section says that each employee \u2018is guaranteed pay\u2019 for at least 40 hours each week. The real issue is, do the three quoted words mean, a guaranty that the employee will <em>earn </em>that much pay, though part of it may be paid a little later \u2014 or do the words mean, a guaranty that he will <em>get a Chech </em>for that amount? Under the Company argument, he earns that much, but does not get paid all of it, for <em>the first weeh </em>of the new plan. (Here, employees got only' two days\u2019 pay on the change-over pay day, \u2014 though thereafter they always received the customary full pay). However, it seems almost certain that the parties negotiating the section, knowing how most of us have house payments, car payments, appliance payments, and current bills, must have intended to guarantee not only the earning of 40 hours\u2019 pay each week, but the <em>payment </em>of it each week. Guaranteeing pay for reporting through the week, according to posted schedule, would mean to the employees, \u2014 and management would understand and anticipate that meaning, \u2014that they would get a pay check for that week, for the guaranteed amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">\u201cThis interpretation is corroborated by the practice prior to the February change. The pay period ended on Wednesday, and payment for work through Wednesday was paid that same evening or the next morning; that is, as close as practicable to paying all that had been earned before the pay day. (In fact, such payment apparently came too soon after the end of the pay period to be fully practicable; hence the change).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">\u201cThus the section seems to mean that each week there are to be pay checks for at least the 40 hours\u2019 pay; hence the grievance must be sustained.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b156-13\">.
