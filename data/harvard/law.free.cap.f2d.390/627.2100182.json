On May 9, 1966, following a one-day trip to Mexico, he was refused admission to the .United States upon the ground that he was attempting to return to employment in the United States, with the intention of becoming a citizen, for which purposes an immigrant visa was required. Following an admissibility hearing he was ordered excluded and deported by the Special Inquiry Officer in charge. He was clearly advised of his right to appeal this decision to the Board of Appeals of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but orally waived that right. He was allowed to remain in the United States briefly to wind up his affairs and was ordered to report for deportation on October 21,1966. On that date he sought habeas corpus in the District Court. His petition was denied and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">Appellant\u2019s attack on the order in question would require us to review administrative findings, decide questions of burden of proof, and determine whether there was a \u201cmeaningful departure\u201d from the country under Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-16\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-17\">\u201cAn order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-18\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-19\">\u201cFrom a decision of a special inquiry officer excluding an alien, such alien may take a timely appeal to the Attorney General, and any such alien shall be advised of his right to take such appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-20\">This court may not entertain review where the alien has failed to take an administrative appeal. Siaba-Fernandez v. Rosenberg, 302 F.2d 139 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-21\">Although our past cases have dealt with our lack of jurisdiction to directly review orders of deportation when no such appeal has been taken, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) makes no distinction between those orders and orders of exclusion, which are reviewed initially, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(b), through habeas corpus in the district courts. Thus the court below could not review this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
