In the course of his direct examination, he volunteered the fact that he had been apprehended in the act of a later robbery of the same bank. Under those circumstances, there was certainly no impropriety in permitting the District Attorney on cross-examination to inquire about his conviction for the second robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
