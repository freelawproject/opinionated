The questions were based on Sections 303 (\u00cd), 308(b) and 309(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 303(0, 308(b), 309(a)). See also Section 1.961(b) of the Commission\u2019s Rules, 47 C.F.R. 1.961 (b). The Commission\u2019s questions were entirely proper. Borrow v. F. C. C., 109 U.S.App.D.C. 224, 285 F.2d 666 (1960), cert. den. 364 U.S. 892, 81 S.Ct. 223, 5 L.Ed.2d 188 (1960); Cronan v. F. C. C., 109 U.S.App.D.C. 208, 285 F.2d 288 (1960), cert. den. 366 U.S. 904, 81 S.Ct. 1046, 6 L.Ed.2d 203 (1961); Blumenthal v. F. C.

The dissent by Judge Washington in Borrow v. Federal Communications Commission, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 224, 285 F.2d 666 (1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 892, 81 S.Ct. 223, 5 L.Ed. 188, is a powerful one, but until the Supreme Court indicates that the majority opinion in that case which has since been followed consistently in the District of Columbia Circuit is erroneous, I believe that our Circuit should follow it.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b662-15\">SEITZ, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Amp\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">I would reverse for the reasons given in Judge Washington\u2019s dissenting opinion in Borrow v.
