In view thereof, it is concluded that the contemporaneous use of these marks is not reasonably calculated to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">Here appellant agrees that \u201cSCRABBLE\u201d and \u201cSCRIBBAGE\u201d obviously have certain dissimilarities, but urges that, when viewed in the market place, their similarities are entitled to greater weight than accorded them by the board, and that doubt should be resolved in favor of the first user, relying on The United States Time Corp. v. Tennenbaum (Tennenbaum &amp; Co., Telix Watch, as-signee, substituted), 267 F.2d 327, 46 CCPA 895 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-16\">There this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-17\">* * * We appreciate those differences, but are not convinced they are of such a sharp nature as to avoid a likelihood of confusion. True, the words do not look alike <em>except </em>that, as observed below, they begin and end with the same letters, \u201cT\u201d and \u201cx\u201d. When, as here, two marks contain only five letters, it seems to us that such an arrangement is just as likely to result in a similarity as in a pronounced dissimilarity. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-19\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-20\">We respect the reasoning and conclusions below and reverse only on the well-established principle of trademark law of resolving doubt in favor of the first user who, here, as shown by the record, has over a long period spent considerable time and money in establishing and promoting its mark. The newcomer is free to choose another mark, but not one which comes so close to appellant\u2019s mark as we think is the case here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-21\">The instant marks are both applied to word games sold at relatively inexpensive prices through the same channels of trade to common purchasers. It seems to us that the similarities between \u201cSCRABBLE\u201d and \u201cSCRIBBAGE\u201d are such as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-22\">With due regard to the specific differences in the marks and goods pointed out by appellee, we feel obliged to resolve the doubt raised by the record in favor of the first user. Accordingly, the decision is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-23\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1086-14\">. Reg. No. 524,505, issued Apr. 25, 1950; Reg.
