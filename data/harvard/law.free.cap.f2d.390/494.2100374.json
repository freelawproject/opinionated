The State Department wired in reply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj5\">Referring to your telegram of December 2, 1966, I would like to call your attention to Section 51-74 of the Regulation of the Department of State in Column 31 of the Federal Register Page 13544.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">The referenced regulations make travel to North Vietnam, a restricted area, grounds for the revocation of a passport. Gregory cancelled his trip for other reasons. He asserts a continuing intention to go to Hanoi at some indefinite time in the future, and seeks a declaratory judgment that the regulation is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">We affirm the dismissal of appellant\u2019s complaint, although not for the reasons stated by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-18\">We need not consider whether the clash between Gregory\u2019s unsettled intentions and the State Department\u2019s guarded reference sparks a case or controversy. The declaratory judgment is denied as a matter of discretion, since in other cases decided today we have set forth principles that can guide the parties as to future applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
