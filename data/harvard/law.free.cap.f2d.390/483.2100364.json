Appellant is licensee of Stations WMMB and WYRL-FM, Melbourne, Florida, adjacent to Eau Gallie, and is a competitor of Station WMEG. Were an original application for a construction permit, or the assignment of an original application involved, the competitive situation would plainly give appellant standing as a \u201cparty in interest.\u201d F.C.C. v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 60 S.Ct. 693, 84 L.Ed. 869; Camden Radio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>v. F.C.C., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 312, 220 F.2d 191. It is thought by the Commission, however, that since the license sought to be assigned is that of a station now in operation, new competition, said to be essential to standing, is not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">According to allegations in the sworn petition to deny, the proposed assignment would transfer the license from a financially failing station to a considerably more healthy enterprise, the principal stockholder of which has had ten years broadcast experience in the area. It is alleged further that the proposed assignee has quite marked opportunity in enumerated respects to compete with appellant substantially more effectively than has the assignor. Actual proof of this allegedly threatened effect of the assignment could not be made prior to actual operation under the assignment, so that a showing must be allowed by means less than that. We approach the problem with a rather generous attitude toward standing in such a case, to enable a competitor to bring to the Commission\u2019s attention matters bearing upon the public interest of which the Commission might otherwise be unaware. <em>Cf. </em>Philco Corp. v. F.C.C., 103 U.S.App.D.C. 278, 280, 257 F.2d 656, 658, renewal of existing license. This assistance to the Commission is permitted not to protect the competitor from competition, see Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities Co., 390 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 651, 19 L.Ed.2d 787, but because its position qualifies it in a special manner to advance matters bearing upon the public interest. We think appellant had standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We agree with the Commission, however, on the merits. Considering the data supplied by the applicant, the Commission was warranted in ruling that appellant\u2019s showing did not require an evidentiary hearing or preclude dismissal of its petition to deny, followed by grant of the application in the public interest. Contradictory allegations and affidavits which create some possibly unresolved factual issue do not invariably necessitate an evidentiary hearing before the Commission can judge whether an assignment would be in the public interest. The rather detailed analysis by the Commission of the appellant\u2019s objections, in the context of all the data before the Commission, supports its conclusions that \u201cthere are now no substantial and material questions of fact to bar a grant of the application,\u201d or which \u201cwarrant designating this application for hearing.\u201d Our deference to the Commission\u2019s rulings leaves us in no uneasy state of mind as to the validity of the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
