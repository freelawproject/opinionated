Nickerson holds Reissue Patent No. 24,518, a patent relating to a white sidewall attachment for vehicle tires. Nickerson instituted a previous infringement action against the Bearfoot Sole Co. <em>(Bearfoot </em>case). The unreported decision of the District Court in that case, holding the above patent valid and infringed, was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in a lengthy and exhaustive opinion holding the patent invalid for want of invention.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Approximately two years after the <em>Bearfoot </em>decision, Nickerson sued again for infringement of this same patent, bringing his action in the District Court for Delaware against Pep Boys\u2014 Manny, Moe &amp; Jack <em>(Pep Boys </em>case). The District Court entered summary judgment for the defendants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the grounds that the <em>Bearfoot </em>case was <em>res judicata </em>or collaterally estopped Nicker-son from relitigating the validity of his patent, albeit against different defendants. Nickerson appealed to this court, No. 15757. Before argument, however, <em>Pep Boys </em>was settled and by agreement dismissed without prejudice. Our strong policy of encouraging such amicable settlement of controversies requires us to disregard entirely the <em>Pep Boys </em>case except to the extent, noted below, that the present parties have agreed that the record in the <em>Pep Boys </em>case is part of the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">Nickerson then brought a third infringement suit in the District Court for Delaware against the present appel-lees. Appellee, Birkenruth, joined by the other appellees, moved to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The District Court granted the motion for the reasons stated in the earlier opinion in <em>Pep Boys </em>pursuant to an agreement among all parties that, \u201cfor reasons of appeal, the parties accept the * * * <em>{Pep </em>Boys] opinion.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">At the outset, the use we should make of the <em>Pep Boys </em>decision must be considered in some detail. An important controversy exists over whether Mr. Nickerson had more evidence to offer in the present case than was offered in the original <em>Bearfoot </em>litigation. The judge below in his <em>Pep Boys </em>opinion found that, \u201cPlaintiff has not suggested that he has additional evidence to present to this Court if he should go to trial.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On this basis, a motion for summary judgment was granted. The order appealed from in the case now before the court, which incorporates the <em>Pep Boys </em>opinion by reference, grants a motion to \u201cdismiss with prejudice\u201d on the grounds of collateral estoppel under the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>The appellees argue that such a motion includes a factual determination on the basis of the record (see F.R.Civ.P. 12(b) &amp; (c)) similar to that involved in summary judgment, and that, in agreeing to use of the <em>Pep Boys </em>opinion, Nickerson has agreed that, in this case too, he has no new evidence to present.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">Although the record is devoid of any specific suggestion that Nickerson in fact has more evidence, he maintained at oral argument that he does have new material on the \u201cstate of the prior art.\u201d In addition he insists that his agreement to ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>cept \u201cthe opinion\u201d for purposes of appeal was prefaced with a statement that he accepted the \u201cconclusions of law\u201d in the <em>Pep Boys </em>opinion. As the judge suggested in the discussion in open court of one aspect of the order entered in this case, the agreed upon Rule 54(b) order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-4\">\u201cwould simply give Mr. Nickerson an opportunity to get before the Court of Appeals a doctrine which I have sponsored, as to the soundness of which, from the standpoint of precedent at least, there is some question which I recognize and he recognizes.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ace-dedup-0\">In light of the above, and since we are faced with a dismissal without trial or hearing where the plaintiff should receive the benefit of any doubt, we assume for purposes of this appeal that Nickerson does have new evidence to offer in the present case, which evidence was not present in the <em>Bearfoot </em>litigation. With this exception, the decision in <em>Pep Boys </em>is regarded as the opinion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The District Court held that the <em>Bearfoot </em>litigation barred Nickerson by collateral estoppel under the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>from relitigating the validity of his patent in another circuit. In so ruling, the judge found encouragement in our decision in Bruszewski v. United States, 181 F.2d 419 (3d Cir.) cert. denied 340 U.S. 865, 71 S.Ct. 87, 95 L.Ed. 632 (1950), that the \u201cdoctrine of mutuality\u201d was not properly a requirement of <em>res </em>judicata.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under this approach,, once a patent holder has his full day in court and suffers an adverse decision on the merits, he is estopped in a subsequent attempt to prove the validity of his patent even though the defendant selected is not in \u201cprivity\u201d with the initial defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">In the field of patent litigation, however, regardless of the rule on mutuality in other fields, the insistence on mutuality has been consistently strong. For a defendant successfully to raise the defense of <em>res judicata </em>in a patent case, \u201cmutuality\u201d requires that he or his privy have been parties in the prior litigation. The broad language in Triplett v. Lowell, 297 U.S. 638, 642-644, 56 S.Ct. 645, 80 L.Ed. 949 (1936) would seem to require us to hold that a prior judgment of invalidity in another circuit is no bar to a suit against different defendants in this circuit for infringement, except on the grounds of comity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While it does appear that the court below may well be correct in concluding that Triplett v. Lowell was either wrongly decided or should no longer be given its customary broad reading, we do not feel that this is the proper case or the proper time for this circuit to make such a holding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">In so deciding we are not unmindful of, and do not wish to change, our previous position in Bruszewski v. United States, supra, characterized as \u201cthe leading federal decision\u201d in eroding the doctrine of mutuality, Zdanok v. Glidden Company, Durkee Famous Foods Division, 327 F.2d 944, 954 (2d Cir. 1964). We also find commendable the scholarly approach of a District Court which analyzes carefully and fairly the relevant policy considerations in applying a new and useful legal rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nonetheless, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>though we may agree that a strict requirement of mutuality should not be continued in the field of patent litigation, two considerations prompt us to reverse the lower court in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\"> The general rules of <em>res judicata </em>prevent relitigation not only of matters actually raised and decided in a prior patent validity suit, but the bar also applies to matters or arguments which might have been raised in support of the claimed validity and infringement but were omitted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An exception to this rule is that the bar will not prevent the second litigation when the new suit proceeds on a new cause of action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since we do not know the nature of Nickerson\u2019s \u201cadditional evidence,\u201d we are unable to judge whether it shows that an entirely different factual basis supports the patent\u2019s validity or there exists a new \u201ccause of action.\u201d It thus can not clearly be said on this record that Nickerson has fairly had his \u201cday in court\u201d in the <em>Bearfoot </em>litigation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In any event such a determination must first be made by the district court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In addition, we note that, as the result of a recommendation of a Presidential Commission, \u201cThe Patent Reform Act of 1967\u201d was introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate on February 21,1967.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> One new section, proposed 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 294, provides in subsection (a) that a final adjudication holding a patent invalid and from which no appeal has been taken, shall constitute an estoppel against the patentee in any subsequent action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Other bills have also been introduced opposing the bills of February 21, 1967,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the problem of judicial review remains to be argued.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since it is quite clear there is a substantial chance of Congressional action in the very near future, our affirmance of a new patent litigation estoppel rule in this case would be ill-timed. But in otherwise indicating our general approval of <em>the </em>opinion below we do more than endorse careful and enlightened decisions by the District Courts in our Circuit, we also affirm the general position of this court in Bruszewski v. United States, supra, that a strict rule of mutuality no longer has a proper place in the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">For the above reasons, the March 9, 1967 judgment of the District Court will be reversed, and the case remanded for disposition in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\">.
