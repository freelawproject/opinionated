App. \u00a7 454(a) and Section 315 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1426.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-24\">Kosberg contends that he was misled by the Selective Service Boards and because of this he was prevented from making a knowing and intelligent election to relieve himself of liability for training and service pursuant to Section 4(a) and Section 1622.18(c) of Regulations, 32 C.F.R., by filing Form SSS 130. Kosberg\u2019s charge that he was misled by the Draft Boards is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-25\">Kosberg asserts also that his military service as a member of the Royal Norwegian Air Force entitled him to a IV-A deferred classfication and that, therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>he should not have been compelled to make a choice between service in the military forces of the United States or executing Form SSS 130. But, assuming the relevancy of this issue, it is apparent from the record that Kosberg did not have the requisite service in the Royal Norwegian Air Force to support his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Consequently, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
