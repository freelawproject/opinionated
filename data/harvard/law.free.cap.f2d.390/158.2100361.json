Act of July 3, 1950, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 731b-e; Jt.Res. of July 3, 1952, 66 Stat. 327; P.R.Const. art. I, \u00a7 1. In 1966, \u25a0 because of active political discussion concerning modification of this status, the Legislature decided to conduct a poll or plebiscite of the voters of Puerto Rico to ascertain whether they would like a change in one direction or another, to wit, statehood or independence, or whether they preferred to maintain the Commonwealth arrangement. Act No. 1, Dec. 23, 1966, amended by Act No. 2, Feb. 24, 1967. In accordance with this statute the ballots were to provide for a selection of one of these three choices, and a vote for any of the alternatives was to authorize certain implementing steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">Certain persons \u2014 how many is not known \u2014 felt that there should be a fourth choice; not, however, some fourth specific arrangement, but simply an opportunity, to quote the complaint, \u201cto vote against the holding of the plebiscite,\u201d or \u201cto exercise the right of dissent by voting against said plebiscite.\u201d For convenience we will refer to this, as was done in oral argument, as a vote \u201cno,\u201d or a vote against the plebiscite. Plaintiffs, claiming to represent these persons, brought this class action in the district court. Jurisdiction was based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343. On motion, the complaint was dismissed, and plaintiffs appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As entitling them to relief, they rely on article I, section 9(3) of the Constitution, dealing with bills of attainder, the first, fifth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth amendments, and the Treaty of P\u00e1ris, 30 Stat. 1754 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">We note at the outset that in their prayers for relief plaintiffs did not request a judicial declaration that it was appropriate for voters who wished to do so to write in \u201cno,\u201d or an order directing respondent election officials to enlarge the ballot. The sole relief sought was that the plebiscite be enjoined altogether. While we do not base our decision on this ground, we cannot but observe that the plaintiffs, although professing various democratic principles, and freedom of speech in particular, wanted, because the ballot did not contain a place for them to vote as they wished, to prevent everyone else from voting at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>In spite of the total obliteration requested by the plaintiffs, we will assume in their favor that they would have been content with a ballot permitting others to express their own views so long as it had a space provided for themselves to vote in the negative. The immediate question, however, is what would have been meant by such a vote. To us a vote \u201cagainst said plebiscite,\u201d particularly when coupled with the alternative \u201cvote against the holding of the plebiscite,\u201d meant precisely that there should be no plebiscite. On that basis, we see no possible merit in plaintiffs\u2019 cause. The sole purpose of the plebiscite was to inform the Legislature, by a direct poll, of the will of the voters. If a vote \u201cno\u201d was to be interpreted as meaning that there was to be no plebiscite, then the substance of plaintiffs\u2019 position must be that there must be a plebiscite to determine whether there should be a plebiscite. That plaintiffs had a constitutional right, or other right, to require the Legislature to submit to the voters the question whether it should hold a plebiscite passes our understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Alternatively, during oral argument plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contended that to \u201csome\u201d persons a negative vote would mean not \u201cno plebiscite\u201d but \u201cpreserve the status quo,\u201d which, in the opinion of such persons, a vote for Commonwealth status did not. We cannot deduce this from the complaint. But if we could, this contention, rather than advancing his case, does the reverse. It leads directly to counsel\u2019s ultimate concession that a \u201cno\u201d vote \u201cwould mean different things to different people.\u201d The question whether the Legislature, seeking to learn public sentiment, should have been required to afford an opportunity to express a vote the meaning of which would have been ambiguous answers itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In the light of this we need not consider certain procedural weaknesses, such as plaintiffs\u2019 delay of six months in asserting their alleged rights, until almost the eve of the plebiscite, and their failure to appeal the dismissal of the action in time to make an injunction against the plebiscite effective, the ostensible primary purpose of the suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Because of the fundamental defects already explained, plaintiffs are not entitled to have the court reach the merits, if any, of their constitutional and other claims in the broader outlines that they wish us to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-18\">. By its dismissal the court refused plaintiffs\u2019 request for the appointment of a three-judge district court. Appeal to this court was appropriate. Benoit v. Gardner, 1 Cir., 1965, 345 F.2d 792, 351 F.2d 846.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">. In oral argument counsel asserted that he did not know he had time for such an appeal. Concededly, however, he was informed of this court\u2019s willingness to make special arrangements in another similar case, dismissed shortly before. Conced-edly, also, he made no attempt to inquire whether we had changed our minds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
