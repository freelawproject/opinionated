Atty., Media, Pa., on the brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b690-9\">Before HASTIE, FREEDMAN and VAN DUSEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"AWkD\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">This case is before the court on appeal from a district court order denying appellant\u2019s right to proceed in forma pauperis in prosecuting a Petition for A Declaratory Judgment seeking \u201can Order directed to the prosecuting authorities of * * *. (Delaware County, Pa. requiring them to) * * * institute the necessary proceedings to accord him his right to a speedy trial (on charges of armed robbery, burglary, receiving stolen goods and conspiracy)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> * * * \u201d or dismiss such charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-17\">While confined under a federal sentence, Appellant first forwarded a Motion to the state court asking for a speedy trial on March 17, 1967. After this Motion was denied, the above Petition was filed and denied by the district court in June, 1967. During this 100 day period Appellant was \u201cconfined in the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his treatment was presumably incomplete. It was not unreasonable for the law enforcement authorities to decline to bring petitioner one-half way across the country for his trial on the above charges within this four month period. Under these circumstances, this record does not show a denial by appellee of the right<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to a speedy trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Cf. Bistram v. People of the State of Minnesota, 330 F.2d 450, 452-453 (8th Cir. 1964) and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-18\">Also it is noted that petitioner may always move for the dismissal of criminal charges pending against him in the state court, if his right to a speedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>trial has been denied, and he may present any denial of this right to the Supreme Court of the United States by petition for certiorari after exhausting his appellate rights in the state courts. See <em>Bistram Case, </em>supra, at 453. The availability of declaratory judgment relief under 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2201 to a federal prisoner in such a situation is limited to cases involving a far more unusual record than that now before this court. Cf. Sepulveda v. State of Colorado, 335 F.2d 581, 582-583 (10th Cir. 1964) and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">The order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-12\">.

Northeastern Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, at some time in late July, 1967 so that he would be available for trial in the Quarter Sessions Court of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the above criminal charges were listed for trial at the January Term, 1968. When Appellant appeared for trial on January 15, 1968 with the Delaware County Public Defender present to represent him, he asked the court to appoint other counsel \u201cwho is not affliated nor a Public Defender,\u201d stating that he would like \u201ceoun-sel of my own ethnic group.\u201d The case was continued to January 22 at which time the Public Defender reported that Appellant had refused to cooperate with him and had refused to give him the names of any witnesses so that the case was continued \u201cfor the term.\u201d A letter of October 17, 1967 from the District Attorney attached to appellee\u2019s brief states that the charges could not be listed during the October, 1967 Criminal Term due to \u201cthe unavailability of either of the two material witnesses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-20\">.
