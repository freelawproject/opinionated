A recomputation of the time appellant should serve in custody under the rules recently promulgated entitles appellant to release and he has in fact been released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-22\">Under these circumstances and in accordance with the Government\u2019s suggestion and appellant\u2019s acquiescence, this appeal is dismissed as being moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
