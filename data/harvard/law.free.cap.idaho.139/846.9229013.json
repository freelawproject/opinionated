The appeal challenges the district court\u2019s order holding that the hen was not timely filed and dismissing Franklin\u2019s foreclosure proceedings, and the district court\u2019s use of the statutory rate of interest to be applied on the hen claim. Because the hen was filed within ninety days of the date that the last item was supplied by the materialman, we reverse the district court\u2019s ruling as to timeliness of the lien; and we affirm the application of the statutory rate of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-19\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b906-20\">In May 1998, Douglas and Pamela Sump-ter entered into an agreement with Clarence Pond and Pond Construction, Inc. (\u201cPond\u201d) to build their home. Pond began construction in July 1998. On November 25, 1998, the city building inspector orally advised the Sumpters that they could occupy the home, and he issued the certificate of occupancy for the home on November 27, 1998, subject to the completion of the porch columns. After the Sumpters moved in, they prepared several pynch lists of items that needed to be completed in the home. While the punch list items were being worked on, the Sumpters initially withheld final payment to Pond. The Sumpters signed the borrower\u2019s acceptance statement on December 17, 1998, but only sent it to Pond on December 29. The Sump-ters made their final payment to Pond on January 11, 1999, although some punch list items still remained to be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-21\">From July 2 to December 16,1998, Franklin Building Supply (\u201cFranklin\u201d) supplied the materials used to construct the Sumpters\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>home through Pond\u2019s open account. On December 16, 1998, Pond purchased a sheet of cedar and a locking door handle for the Sumpters\u2019 home, as well as some electrical cords and a hammer that were not used in the Sumpters\u2019 home. Franklin maintained separate open accounts for each of Pond\u2019s construction projects, and it submitted separate monthly bills to Pond for materials supplied for the Sumpters\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Pond failed to pay Franklin for the materials used in the Sumpters\u2019 home and eventually filed for bankruptcy. So as not to compound Pond\u2019s financial problems, Franklin waited as long as possible to file a lien on the Sumpters\u2019 home. On the ninetieth day following the December 16, 1998, order by Pond, Franklin filed its claim of lien on the Sumpters\u2019 property, in accordance with the I.C. \u00a7 45-507. The lien amount was the cost of the materials supplied to Pond, as well as eighteen percent interest for the period of July 1998 to December 16,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Franklin filed its complaint in September 1999 seeking to foreclose its lien. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, which were denied by the district court because there were genuine issues of material fact, which required that the case proceed to trial. During the pendency of the trial to the court, Franklin sought to admit Pond\u2019s application for credit, for the purpose of establishing an 18 percent interest rate that was a term of the parties\u2019 credit agreement. The district court ruled the application inadmissible and held that statutory interest applied, because the Sumpters were not party to the credit agreement between Franklin and Pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">On October 1, 2001, the district court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order granting dismissal of the claims against the Sumpters. The district court found that although Franklin\u2019s lien was filed within ninety days of the last items supplied by Franklin on the Sumpters\u2019 home, the statute required it to be filed within ninety days from the date of substantial completion of the home. The district court, therefore, concluded that Franklin\u2019s lien was untimely and entered judgment against Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Franklin appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s interpretation of the lien statute, I.C. \u00a7 45-507, and its evidentiary ruling barring admission of Pond\u2019s credit application. On Franklin\u2019s appeal in this Court, we assigned the case to the Court of Appeals; the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the ease to the district court to determine the amount due to Franklin under its claim of lien, including interest and other costs or fees provided by law. This Court granted the Sump-ters\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">\u201cWhen considering a case on review from the Court of Appeals, this Court gives serious consideration to the Court of Appeals; however, this Court reviews the trial court decision directly. This Court is not merely reviewing the correctness of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision; rather, this Court is healing the matter as if the ease were on direct appeal from the district judge\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Northland Ins. Co. v. Boise\u2019s Best Autos &amp; Repairs, </em>131 Idaho 432, 433, 958 P.2d 589, 590 (1998). Where there is no dispute as to the factual circumstances, our review consists of ascertaining the effect of applicable law on the undisputed facts. <em>Simplot v. William C. Owens, M.D., P.A., </em>119 Idaho 243, 244, 805 P.2d 449, 450 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">A district court\u2019s findings of fact in a court-tried case will be liberally construed on appeal in favor of the judgment entered, in view of the district court\u2019s role as trier of fact. <em>Western Heritage Ins. Co. v. Green, </em>137 Idaho 832, 835, 54 P.3d 948, 951 (2002) (citing <em>Conley v. Whittlesey, </em>133 Idaho 265, 269, 985 P.2d 1127 (1999); <em>Lindgren v. Martin, </em>130 Idaho 854, 857, 949 P.2d 1061, 1064 (1997)). Review of the decision is limited to ascertaining whether the evidence supports the findings of fact and whether the findings of fact support the conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>If the findings of fact are based on substantial evidence, even if the evidence is conflicting, they will not be overturned on appeal. <em>Id. </em>However, this Court exercises free review over questions of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Idaho\u2019s materialman\u2019s lien statute provides that every person who performs labor, furnishes materials or renders professional services in the construction of a building or other structure \u201chas a lien upon the same for the work or labor done or professional services or materials furnished.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 45-501 (Supp.1998). \u201cThe purpose of these statutes is to compensate persons who perform labor upon or furnish material to be used in construction, alteration or repair of a structure.\u201d <em>Barber v. Honorof, </em>116 Idaho 767, 768-69, 780 P.2d 89, 90-91 (1989). The laws regarding materialman\u2019s liens are liberally construed in favor of the person who performs labor upon or furnishes materials to be used in the construction of a building. <em>L &amp; W Supply Corp. v. Chartrand Family Trust, </em>136 Idaho 738, 742-43, 40 P.3d 96, 100-01 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">\u201cLien foreclosures under I.C. \u00a7 45-501 <em>et seq. </em>are strictly actions <em>in rem </em>and are not <em>in personam </em>proceedings: \u2018The lien statute operates in rem, and not in personam. It creates no personal charge against the owner of the property, but rather a charge against the property to the extent of its value.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pierson v. Sewell, </em>97 Idaho 38, 44, 539 P.2d 590, 596 (1975) (citation omitted). The materialman\u2019s lien statute is remedial in nature. <em>Electrical Wholesale Supply Co., Inc. v. Nielson, </em>136 Idaho 814, 824, 41 P.3d 242, 252 (2001). A lien itself is not a penalty, but rather is designed to provide a contractor with security. <em>Guyman v. Anderson, </em>75 Idaho 294, 296, 271 P.2d 1020, 1021 (1954). To create a valid lien, there must be substantial compliance with the requirements of the statutes. <em>L &amp; W Supply, </em>136 Idaho at 743, 40 P.3d at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">At the time of the filing of Franklin\u2019s lien in 1998, Idaho Code \u00a7 45-507 provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-8\">Any person claiming a lien pursuant to the provisions of this chapter must, within ninety (90) days after the completion of the labor or services or furnishings of materials, or the cessation of the labor, services or furnishings of materials for any cause, file for the record ... a claim containing a statement of his demand....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">The district court in this ease found that \u201cIdaho courts have consistently held that the time for filing a lien claim begins to run from the substantial completion of the contract.\u201d The district court also found that \u201citems of a trivial character will not extend the time for claiming a lien.\u201d In support of its findings, the district court cited to <em>Pierson v. Sewell, </em>97 Idaho 38, 539 P.2d 590 (1975) and <em>Gem State Lumber Co. v. Witty, </em>37 Idaho 489, 217 P. 1027 (1923). Both of these cases affirm the principle that the sixty-day period for the filing of liens cannot be extended or revived by the furnishing of trivial labor or materials once the contract has been completed. The Court in <em>Pierson </em>held that the time for filing the lien claim began to run from the cessation of the subcontractor\u2019s furnishing of materials. <em>Pierson, </em>97 Idaho at 41, 539 P.2d at 591. Pierson, a subcontractor, supplied materials and labor through his employees and, thus, had a right to a lien on the dwelling, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-501 then in existence. The Court determined that Pierson had furnished labor and materials on January 14, 1972, in order to complete his subcontract in connection with the construction of Sewell\u2019s dwelling. Although urged by Sewell to begin counting the sixty-day period within which a notice of lien is to be filed from the date Pierson\u2019s employees finished their work in December 1971, the Court held that the lien filed within sixty days of the date the last materials were supplied on March 9, 1972, was timely. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">In <em>Gem State, </em>two liens against Witty\u2019s property were at issue: a materialman\u2019s lien filed by Gem State on July 3, 1918, and a second lien for labor and materials filed on July 6, 1918, by Vogt for the construction of the heating plant. The Court in <em>Gem State </em>determined that the lumber company was a subcontractor in furnishing materials for Witty\u2019s property, and therefore, was required to file its hen within sixty days from the completion of the building or the date of furnishing the last item of material. The Court found a failure of proof of delivery or use in the building of any items of material from Gem State between January 23 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>May 4, 1918. The Court thus had to resolve whether the lien limitation ended sixty days from January 23, or whether the item purchased on May 4, 1918, served to extend the time for filing the lien. In voiding the lien, the Court invoked the rule that furnishing an article that was trivial in nature is not sufficient to extend the time for claiming a lien or to revive an expired lien, where the article is furnished after a substantial completion of the contract, and the article is not expressly required by the terms thereof. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 217 P. at 1030. The Vogt lien was a clearer case for the Court to decide, as the facts revealed that the heating plant was completed in December 1917, at which time tenants moved into the premises. The Court concluded then that the small amount of work done on July 3, 1918, was for purpose of reviving a lien whose time for filing had expired months <em>prior </em>upon the \u201csubstantial completion of the contract.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 499-500, 217 P. at 1029. Vogt\u2019s lien was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">Strict materialmen, such as Franklin, differ from builders and lien claimants who furnish only labor or labor and materials when analyzing \u201csubstantial completion of the contract,\u201d and the distinction is reflected in their respective contracts. A builder or sub-contractor is generally on the job site pursuant to a contract to complete the project or a specified portion of a project. A determination of when that contract has been substantially completed can be made from the facts and knowledge of the project\u2019s status is inherent in its performance. In contrast, an open account materialman\u2019s contract is to furnish materials when requested. An open account is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-5\">Simply an account with a balance which has not been ascertained. The account is kept open in anticipation of future transactions. Where an open account exists the parties are deemed to intend that individual items on the account will not be viewed separately but that the account will be considered as a connected series of transactions. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-6\"><em>Kugler v. Northwest Aviation, Inc., </em>108 Idaho 884, 887, 702 P.2d 922, 925 (Ct.App.1985). Thus, the contract (continuous open account) is not substantially completed until the last item is delivered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-10\">In <em>Valley Lumber &amp; Man. Co. v. Driessel, </em>13 Idaho 662, 93 P. 765 (1907) the Supreme Court determined that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-11\">Where materials are furnished for the same building or improvement in installments and at intervals and the parties intend them to be included in one account in settlement, the entire account will be treated as a continuous and connected transaction, and the lien limitation begins to run from the last item of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">We reject the suggestion that a strict materialman should be required to make a determination of the status of the project when he delivers items, to report back to the company, and to have this knowledge imputed to the company. To require a materialman to monitor the status of a project to determine the date of substantial completion is inconsistent with commercial realities and in derogation of the remedial nature of the lien statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">We are compelled to determine that the contract has been completed \u201cby the weight of authority, this is to be ascertained by the conditions of the contract, the conduct of the parties with reference thereto, and the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d 37 Idaho 489, 499, 217 P. at 1030 (citations omitted). Franklin stated that the items that were purchased by Pond on December 16, 1998, were not supplied \u201cfor the purpose of reviving the lien and extending the time in which the same might be filed.\u201d <em>Gem State Lumber, </em>37 Idaho at 500, 217 P. at 1030. Franklin acknowledged that although the dollar value of these items was minimal, they were actually used in constructing and repairing the Sumpters\u2019 home; they were reasonably necessary to complete construction according to the terms of the contract; and they should not be found to be trivial. Although some time had passed since Pond\u2019s November 20, and 24, 1998, purchases on his account \u2014 for the porch posts and materials \u2014 the December 16, 1998, purchase was not for reviving the lien time and was needed to complete the punch list and, therefore, the items pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>chased were the last items needed to complete the contract. <em>See Valley Lumber &amp; Man. Co. v. Driessel, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The issuance of the certificate of occupancy dated November 25, 1998, should not be the \u201ctrigger\u201d for the filing period to begin to run. We reiterate that the lien limitation begins to run from the last item of the contract, which in this ease was purchased on December 16, 1998. We reverse the district court\u2019s decision and hold Franklin\u2019s hen to be timely, thereby restoring Franklin\u2019s rights to proceed against the Sumpters\u2019 property to the extent of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Franklin sought to admit into evidence the credit application completed by Pond, contending that the application was relevant to support its entitlement to 18 percent interest on the past due amounts from Pond\u2019s open account. Franklin and Pond had entered into a credit agreement, which expressly stated, \u201c[i]nterest is charged on all past due balances at the rate of 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month, which is an annual percentage rate of 18%.\u201d At the time Franklin filed its hen, Pond owed $49,702.26, with finance charges of $4,610.42, for a total of $54,312.68. The district court found \u201cwhile interest is recoverable, the proper amount in a case like this would be the statutory rate because there isn\u2019t any contract rate. There\u2019s no contract between these parties.\u201d Therefore, based on lack of privity between Franklin and the Sumpters, the district court excluded Pond\u2019s credit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision regarding the relevancy of evidence. <em>Howell v. Eastern Idaho R.R., Inc., </em>135 Idaho 733, 738, 24 P.3d 50, 55 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Case law holds that \u201cthe extent of the hen ... must be measured by the amount found due him on <em>his </em>contract at the time of the filing of his hen.\u201d <em>Steltz v. Armory Co., </em>15 Idaho 551, 558, 99 P. 98, 101 (1908) (emphasis added). A claim of hen under I.C. \u00a7 45-501<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> includes interest. <em>Acoustic Specialties, Inc. v. Wright, </em>103 Idaho 595, 599, 651 P.2d 529, 533 (1982); <em>Guyman v. Anderson, </em>75 Idaho 294, 296, 271 P.2d 1020, 1021-22 (1954); <em>Hendrix v. Gold Ridge Mines, Inc., </em>56 Idaho 326, 335-37, 54 P.2d 254, 257-58 (1936). In <em>Guy-man, supra, </em>where the dispute between the parties involved the rate of pay itself, this Court held that the statutory rate of interest provides the interest rate in the absence of an express contract. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 271 P.2d at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Franklin was permitted to file a hen for the amount it was owed under its contract wifh Pond, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-507. We sustain the district court\u2019s ruling that a lack of privity between Franklin and the Sump-ters precludes application of contract interest. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision not to admit Pond\u2019s credit application, in' favor of allowing the rate of interest specified in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">Idaho Code \u00a7 45-513 provides for the award of costs and reasonable attorney fees in the foreclosure of materialman\u2019s hens. This Court has held that the statute does not allow the award of attorney fees on appeal by materialman\u2019s lien claimants. <em>Hendrix v. Gold Ridge Mines, </em>56 Idaho 326, 330, 54 P.2d 254, 258 (1936) (holding \u201cthat our.statute only authorizes the collection of such fees for foreclosure of hens in the district court.\u201d). \u201cAlthough attorney fees on appeal are not available pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-513, an award may be made under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 if the appeal was brought frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.\u201d <em>Fairfax v. Ramirez, </em>133 Idaho 72, 79, 982 P.2d 375, 382 (Ct.App.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">Significant issues were raised on appeal concerning the interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 45-507 and the relevant case law, therefore the appeal does not appear to have been brought frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. Attorney fees are not awarded pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">We reverse the district court\u2019s conclusion that Franklin\u2019 materialman\u2019s lien was untimely filed. We uphold the district court\u2019s exclusion of Pond\u2019s application for credit with Franklin and affirm the application of the statutory rate to compute interest on Franklin\u2019s recovery.
