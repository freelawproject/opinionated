The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-24\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b381-25\">Robert and Judy Lovitt (Lovitts) own Lot 111 of the Hayden Lake Cottage Tracts on Hayden Lake, Kootenai County, Idaho. Robert and Karen Robideaux (Robideaux) own Lots 112, 113, and 114 of the Hayden Lake Cottage Tracts. Lots 111 and 112 are adjacent. The lots are located on a \u201cV\u201d shaped bay called Lee\u2019s Bay. At its mouth, Lee\u2019s Bay is approximately 400 feet wide. Except where a sandbar extends across the mouth of the bay creating shallower water, Lee\u2019s Bay is approximately fifteen feet deep. The depth of the water above the sandbar is unknown, but changes with the water level of the lake. The mouth of Lee\u2019s Bay opens to the north and the bottom of the ,CV\u201d shaped bay points south. Lot 111 is located on the northwestern shore of Lee\u2019s Bay. As a result, part of the Lovitts\u2019 shoreline property faces the bay and part faces the open lake. Lots 112, 113, and 114 are to the southeast of Lot 111, along the western shore of the \u201cV\u201d shaped Lee\u2019s Bay. Thus, all of the Robideaux shoreline property faces the bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Idaho law requires a permit to build a dock (referred to as \u201cnavigational encroachments\u201d under the law). The Idaho Department of Lands (Department) issues and regulates permits. The Lovitts and the Robideauxs each possess a permit for a dock, issued by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The Lovitts\u2019 dock sits at a right angle to the shoreline located on the portion of Lot 111 facing Lee\u2019s Bay. The dock was built pursuant to encroachment permit ERL-95S-1403A, which the Department transferred to the Lovitts from the Lovitts\u2019 predecessors. The Lovitts claim their predecessors placed the dock at this location in the 1940\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The history of the Robideauxs\u2019 dock permit is less straightforward. The record and the briefs do little to clarify.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">When the Robideauxs purchased Lot 112 on January 3, 1977, their predecessors already had a dock off of Lot 112. The Robi-deauxs\u2019 predecessors possessed a permit for the dock, described as a single slip floating dock (permit ERL-95-S-1530). After the Robideauxs purchased Lot 112, they relocated the dock from Lot 112 to the water off the point of the Lovitts\u2019 property (point dock), with the Lovitts\u2019 permission. The point dock was located to the north of the Lovitts\u2019 dock, so it extended near the mouth of Lee\u2019s Bay, floating above the sandbar. There was conflicting testimony at trial as to when the point dock was moved to the point, but it occurred sometime between 1977 and 1981. Around the same time the point dock was moved to the point, the Robideauxs had another dock built and placed off of Lot 112. As a result, the Robideauxs had two docks, but only one permit, which was still in then-predecessor\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Both families used the point dock until the Lovitts revoked permission for the Robi-deauxs to maintain it off of the point of Lot 111. The Lovitts and Robideauxs had a falling out sometime in 1993 when the Robi-deauxs placed pilings into the lakebed off the point of the Lovitts\u2019 property. Pilings, like docks, are considered navigational encroachments and require permits. The Robideauxs did not have a permit to install pilings. The pilings were placed north (lake side) of the sandbar, slightly north and west of the-point dock. The Robideauxs installed the pilings under the belief they owned a \u201clittoral right\u201d (a right to access navigable waters) in the area where the pilings were placed. On January 15, 1993, prior to installing the pilings, the Robideauxs received a transfer of their predecessor\u2019s encroachment permit ERL-95-S-1530, which was the renumbered L-95S-1530A. This permit was used by the Robi-deauxs\u2019 predecessors for the dock that became the point dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">On July 23, 1997, after several years of discussion with the Department regarding their dock situation, the Robideauxs obtained another encroachment permit from the Department. This permit had the same number, L-95-S-1530A, as the permit transferred to the Robideauxs from their predecessors on January 15, 1993. According to the July 23, 1997, permit, it was issued for an anchored dock and shore ramp to be located on Lot 112. The shore ramp to this dock was planned to go directly over the Lovitts\u2019 dock. It also appears from the record that the Robideauxs never moved the point dock after the dispute with the Lovitts began and this permit was sought to cover the point dock. It is unclear why the Robi-deauxs sought a second permit after they had their predecessor\u2019s permit transferred to them. It is also unexplained why the Department issued a second dock permit to the Robideauxs with the same identification number as the permit transferred to them in 1993. While the permits have the same number, they identify two completely different docks. There is no indication the second permit supersedes or nullifies the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">The Department enclosed a letter with the July 23, 1997, dock permit notifying the Ro-bideauxs the permit was not valid until the pilings were removed from Hayden Lake. The letter further stated if the pilings were not removed within 30 days, the permit would be suspended or revoked. Carl Wash-burn (Washburn), a navigable waters specialist with the Department, testified at trial that the Department stayed any decision regarding removal of the pilings until this litigation was finalized. Aerial photos from August 2000 indicate the three pilings remained in place at that time. However, at oral argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ment counsel for both parties stated the pilings have since been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Along with the dock issue, the parties raise an issue involving a prescriptive easement across the Robideauxs\u2019 property. There is a recorded easement crossing the Robideauxs\u2019 property. The recorded easement crosses Lots 112 and 113, providing a main roadway and access to Lot 111 and all lots west. The Lovitts do not use the main roadway for access to them lot. Rather, the Lovitts use a separate driveway that branches from the main roadway at Lot 113 and crosses Lots 113 and 112 in order to access their Lot 111. The separate driveway is not part of the recorded easement and an easement has never been expressly granted for the separate driveway. The district court found the Lov-itts and their predecessors in interest have used the separate driveway since at least 1944 as a means to access Lot 111. After the Lovitts revoked permission for maintenance of the point dock, the Robideauxs informed the Lovitts they could no longer use the separate driveway unless the Lovitts abided by the Robideauxs\u2019 condition of keeping a locked gate across the separate driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On January 22, 1997, the Lovitts filed suit against the Robideauxs seeking: (1) a declaratory judgment establishing the littoral rights of both parties; (2) a mandatory injunction requiring the Robideauxs to remove the pilings; (3) a permanent injunction preventing the Robideauxs from future infringement on the Lovitts\u2019 littoral rights or interference with the Lovitts\u2019 access to the driveway; and (4) to quiet title in the separate driveway by means of a prescriptive easement. On March 14, 1997, the Robi-deauxs answered and filed a counterclaim alleging the Lovitts\u2019 dock encroached on the Robideauxs\u2019 littoral rights. The Robideauxs sought: (1) to quiet title to the location of their dock; (2) to require the Lovitts to relocate their dock so it does not interfere with the Robideauxs\u2019 shore ramp; and (3) to allow the Robideauxs to limit the nature and use of the easement, if any, by means of a locked gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On March 13, 2001, the district court conducted a bench trial. On June 15, 2001, the district court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The district court concluded neither party provided enough evidence regarding the ordinary high water mark to establish littoral rights. Additionally, the district court concluded since the parties failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before the Department or make the Department a party to the case, the district court was without authority to adjudicate their rights under the permits. The district court also concluded the Lovitts established an easement by prescription for the driveway they used to access Lot 111 and the Robi-deauxs could not limit the nature and use of the easement by means of a locked gate. On January 16, 2002, the district court issued a final judgment consistent with its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The parties timely filed this appeal and cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">This Court will set aside a trial court\u2019s findings only if they are clearly erroneous. I.R.C.P. 52(a) (2002); <em>McCray v. Rosenkrance, </em>135 Idaho 509, 513, 20 P.3d 693, 697 (2001); <em>In re Williamson v. City of McCall, </em>135 Idaho 452, 454, 19 P.3d 766, 768 (2001). To decide whether findings of fact are clearly erroneous., this Court must determine whether the findings are supported by substantial, competent evidence. <em>In re Williamson </em>at 454, 19 P.3d at 768. Evidence is substantial and .competent if a reasonable trier of fact would accept it and rely on it. <em>Id. </em>Findings based on substantial, competent evidence, even if conflicting, will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Bolger v. Lance, </em>137 Idaho 792, 794, 53 P.3d 1211, 1213 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">This Court exercises free review over conclusions of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">A. The District Court Did Not Err In Concluding It Could Not Review Or Adjudicate Any Rights Of The Parties Under Any Navigational Encroachment Permits Issued By The Department Because The Parties Failed To Exhaust Their Administrative Remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">The Lovitts argue this Court should determine the littoral rights of each party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>and decide the point dock infringes upon their littoral right. The Lovitts contend the decision should not be left to the Department because the losing party will inevitably appeal, which will only bring the parties back to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The Robideauxs claim the real dispute, the granting of a dock permit, has been over for some time and has not been appealed. The Robideauxs also claim the Department can issue encroachment permits without considering littoral rights. According to the Robi-deauxs, the only limitation on the Department\u2019s power to issue dock permits affected by littoral rights is in the giving of notice. The Robideauxs, however, assert there is no opportunity to contest the granting of permits in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The Idaho Legislature enacted Chapter 13 of Title 58 in 1974 as part of the Lake Protection Act (Act). Chapter 13 concerns \u201cNavigational Encroachments.\u201d After enactment of Chapter 13, any encroachment placed on navigable waters requires approval in a manner consistent with the Act. I.C. \u00a7 58-1301. \u201cEncroachments in aid of navigation\u201d or \u201cnavigational encroachments\u201d refer to docks, piers, pilings, boat ramps, and such aids to navigating a lake. I.C. \u00a7 58-1302(i). Any party wishing to build or use a navigational encroachment must submit an application for a permit to the board of land commissioners (board), the body within the Department, that issues or denies permits. I.C. \u00a7 58-1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Generally, the board should approve a permit application.unless the proposed encroachment infringes, or may infringe, upon the littoral rights of an adjacent property owner. I.C. \u00a7 58-1305(a). The initial determination of possible infringement is made based on the plans the applicant provides. I.C. \u00a7 58-1305(b). Littoral rights, for purposes of issuing dock permits, refer to the right of owners of land next to the navigable waters of a lake to maintain their adjacency to the lake and make use of their right-by building or using navigational encroachments. I.C. \u00a7 58-1302(f). If it appears infringement may occur, the applicant shall either obtain written consent from the adjacent property owner or provide notice of the application by means of personal service or certified mail. I.C. \u00a7 58-1305(b). A non-consenting adjacent property owner has ten days from the date of notice to file an objection. <em>Id, </em>If an objection is filed, the board shall set a time and place for a hearing so the applicant and objecting party may present evidence in support of their position. I.C. \u00a7 58-1305(c). The board shall render a decision after the hearing. <em>Id. </em>Either party may seek judicial review of the board\u2019s decision from the district court by appealing within 30 days. I.C. \u00a7 58-1306(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">In addition to the requirement for a permit for any new navigational encroachment, a permit holder is required to obtain approval to replace, enlarge, or extend an existing encroachment. IDAPA 20.03.03.020.03 (1997).'</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The Act clearly governs the issuance of navigational encroachment permits in the state of Idaho and is the starting point for any analysis regarding infringement on littoral rights based on the placement of a dock pursuant to a permit. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 58-1301. Under the Act, owners of property next to a navigable lake, such as the Robideauxs, can apply for a permit in order to construct a dock so they can reach navigable waters. Contrary to the Robideauxs\u2019 contention, issuance of a dock permit under the Act necessarily contemplates determination of littoral rights as defined by the Act. A permit and littoral rights are not necessarily separate and distinct. A holder of a valid permit cannot locate a dock in a manner that infringes upon an adjacent landowner\u2019s littoral right. In the context of obtaining a permit and locating a dock, the Act clearly contemplates the Department\u2019s role in determining littoral rights by requiring written consent from, or notice to, adjacent landowners if a proposed permit even appears to infringe on the adjacent landowner\u2019s littoral rights. The Department\u2019s regulations require consent or notice whether for approval of a new encroachment or replacement, enlargement, or extension of an existing encroachment. Thus, when called upon, the Act allows the Department to- determine the littoral rights of adjoining riparian landowners when there is a dispute regarding placement of a dock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>pursuant to a permit and possible infringement of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The undisputed facts in the record show the Department issued a permit to the Robi-deauxs on July 23, 1997, for a ramp and floating dock with an anchor system. The plans submitted by the Robideauxs indicated they intended to anchor this dock in the area next to the pilings installed off the point of the Lovitts\u2019 property. The question then becomes whether placement of this dock would, or appears to, infringe on the Lovitts\u2019 littoral rights. If so, the Act required the Robideauxs either to obtain written consent for the dock\u2019s placement from, or provide notice of their application to, the Lovitts. Based on the exhibits provided at trial, it is evident the Robideauxs\u2019 proposed placement of the dock would, at very least, appear to infringe on the Lovitts\u2019 statutory littoral rights. The proposed ramp would go directly over the Lovitts\u2019 existing dock, a fact that led the Robideauxs to ask the district court to require the Lovitts to move their dock. As a result, the Robideauxs had an obligation to obtain written consent or provide notice to the Lovitts so they could choose to request a hearing before the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">It is undisputed the Robideauxs never obtained the Lovitts\u2019 consent for the dock. The Lovitts also claim they never received notice. There is nothing in the record to indicate the Lovitts received notice of the Robideauxs\u2019 permit application. Washburn testified the Department had no record of notice to the Lovitts regarding the Robi-deauxs\u2019 permit application. The Robideauxs claim the Lovitts knew about the dock. While the Lovitts undoubtedly knew about the dock, awareness of a dock does not satisfy the requirements set forth by the Idaho Legislature. The Robideauxs were obligated by I.C. \u00a7 58\u20141305(b) to either obtain written consent or provide notice of their permit application before the Department could issue a permit for a dock to be placed at the point of the Lovitts\u2019 property. Otherwise, the Lovitts would not be afforded the right granted by the Act to object and seek a hearing in front of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">There is no Idaho authority suggesting a party waives its right to an administrative hearing to which it is entitled if not apprised of the facts giving rise to the right at issue. Without written consent from, or notice to, the Lovitts as required by the Act, the Department could not have validly issued the Robideauxs a permit on July 23, 1997. The Robideauxs urge this Court to affirm the validity of their permit while completely denying the Lovitts their due process right to object. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">In contrast, the Lovitts argue they should not be required to return to the Department because no matter the outcome, the unsuccessful party will appeal. Rather, the Lovitts ask this Court to establish the parties\u2019 respective littoral rights, which includes invalidating the Robideauxs\u2019 current navigational encroachment permit. However, the Robideauxs, as riparian landowners, have a littoral right on Hayden Lake. <em>See West v. Smith, </em>95 Idaho 550, 511 P.2d 1326 (1973) (recognizing riparian landowners, as an incident to their ownership, have unobstructed access to the navigable waters along all points of their riparian land). The Act dictates the process by which the Robideauxs may seek a permit for a dock. The Department, based on its experience and expertise, is in the best position to determine the proper placement of docks based on the requirements of the Act and the parties\u2019 respective littoral rights. Under the Act, the Department may determine whether a proposed dock inflinges upon a neighbor\u2019s littoral right.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">It is important to note that the Lovitts, in their appellant\u2019s brief, frame the issue on appeal as whether the district court erred in concluding neither party satisfied the requirements to establish littoral rights because they failed to provide enough evidence. The district court\u2019s one and only conclusion on that issue was that: \u201c[t]he ordinary high water line, mark, or level has not been proven and for that reason the court cannot determine the respective littoral rights of the parties.\u201d It would be simple for this Court to settle this appeal on that issue. The record is devoid of any evidence of the ordinary high water mark, which is necessary to establish a littoral line. <em>See Idaho For. Indus., Inc. v. Hayden Lk. Watershed Imp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>Dist., </em>733 P.2d 733, 737, 112 Idaho 512, 516 (1987). However, the district court also concluded it lacked authority to adjudicate the rights of either party under the permits issued by the Department. A reading of the complaints, cross-complaints, and briefs in this case make it clear that the real remedy sought is where the parties may place then-docks pursuant to a permit issued by the Department. Identification of the littoral line between Lot 111 and Lot 112 is only the first step in the solution the Lovitts and Robideauxs seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">This Court would be delinquent in its duties if it failed'to address the actual issues on appeal, even if they are not clearly articulated. These parties have been at odds with one another over the placement of their docks for ten or more years. Part of the reason for this drawn out litigation is the Department\u2019s willingness to stay its decision regarding infringement until the outcome of this case. There is nothing in the Act that authorizes the Department to \u201cstay\u201d its actions. The legislature clearly contemplated the Department\u2019s ability to determine littoral rights when infringement issues arise due to the planned placement of a dock. As a result, these parties failed to exhaust then-administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The district court, in Conclusions of Law, also stated that \u201cthe ordinary high water line, mark, or level has not been proven and for that reason the court cannot determine the respective littoral rights of the parties.\u201d (citations omitted). It should be noted that the parties may, if they desire, submit evidence of the ordinary high water mark at an appropriate administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">While the Department may determine littoral rights under these limited circumstances, nothing in this opinion should be read to divest, the district court of its jurisdiction to determine littoral rights, a common law right. Riparian landowners, for various reasons, may wish to seek a judicial determination of their littoral rights independent of, or prior to, any infringement issues that may come up in the course of obtaining a dock permit from the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">B. The District Court Did Not Err In Concluding The Robideauxs May Not Limit The Nature And Scope Of The Prescriptive Easement By Means Of A Locked Gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The Robideauxs argue the Lovitts failed to make a showing that the gate was unreasonable or unduly restrictive. As a result, the Robideauxs claim the district court\u2019s conclusion that they could not limit the nature and scope of the easement was in error and they should be allowed to install a gate that is easy to open and wide enough to accommodate the Lovitts\u2019 use.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u201c[A]n easement is the right to use the land of another for a specific purpose that is not inconsistent with the general use of the property by the owner.\u201d <em>Viebrock v. Gill, </em>125 Idaho 948, 952, 877 P.2d 919, 923 (1994) (citing <em>Abbott v. Nampa Sch. Dist. No. 131, </em>119 Idaho 544, 548, 808 P.2d 1289, 1293 (1991)). According to this Court\u2019s decisions, the owner of a servient estate may construct a gate across an easement to limit use of the easement to only those who have a right to use it. <em>Marshall v. Blair, </em>130 Idaho at 682, 946 P.2d at 982 (citing <em>Gibbens v. Weisshaupt, </em>98 Idaho 633, 570 P.2d 870 (1977); <em>Wood v. Brown, </em>108 Idaho 739, 702 P.2d 777 (1985)). Use of a gate, or any other method of regulating an easement, by the owner of the servient estate must, however, be reasonable. <em>See Wood v. Brown, </em>108 Idaho at 742, 702 P.2d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The district court, in Conclusions of Law, also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">[T]he maintenance of a gate across the disputed driveway or roadway as contended for by the Robideaux\u2019s is unreasonable and unduly restrictive of the Lovitts\u2019 right of access under the circumstances.... Maintenance of the gate by Robideaux\u2019s is in the nature of a spite structure and as a result of the dock dispute between the parties, rather than for security purposes as alleged by Mr. Robideaux.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">The evidence presented at trial showed that the Robideauxes use of a gate across the easement was unreasonable and unduly restrictive under the circumstances because the Robideauxs chose to begin using the gate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>an effort to spite the Lovitts. Neither the Robideauxs, nor their predecessors, since 1944, saw any security need to gate the driveway at issue until the dock dispute arose. The record indicates the driveway leads to Lot 111 and Lot 110 only. There is no evidence in the record, or claim, to suggest any party other than the Lovitts regularly use the driveway. Therefore, substantial, competent evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that the Robideauxes use of a locked gate was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision that it could not determine the parties\u2019 littoral rights and that the parties failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. There is substantial, competent evidence to affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the Robideauxs may not limit the nature and scope of the Lovitts\u2019 prescriptive easement across Lots 113 and 112 by means of a locked gate. Neither party requested attorney fees on appeal. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-8\">Chief Justice TROUT, and Justices SCHROEDER, WALTERS and EISMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
