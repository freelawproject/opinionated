Fred Meyer Stores (Fred Meyer) owned a partially vacated strip mall in Poca-tello, Idaho. Fred Meyer contracted with general contractor, Bateman-Hall, Inc. (Bateman-Hall), to build a second building on the site. Bateman-Hall, in turn, contracted with Plaintiff Marty Robison\u2019s direct employer, Thomas D. Robison Roofing, Inc. (Robison Roofing), to perform the roofing work on the project. On September 1, 1999, Robison, while attempting to access the roof on the Fred Meyer construction site, hit his head on a sprinkler pipe and fell 15 to 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>feet, landing on a concrete floor. As a result of the fall, Robison was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Robison filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim against Robison Roofing, which paid all of Robison\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation benefits. Subsequently, Robison filed this third-party negligence action against Fred Meyer, Bate-man-Hall, and Shilo Automatic Sprinklers. Fred Meyer and Bateman-Hall responded with a motion for summary judgment, stating the claims against Fred Meyer and Bate-man-Hall should be dismissed since both parties were immune from third-party tort liability pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 72-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The district judge allowed the parties to conduct some limited discovery regarding whether Fred Meyer and Bateman-Hall were \u201cstatutory employers\u201d and, following a hearing on the summary judgment motion, the district judge issued his decision in favor of Fred Meyer and Bateman-Hall. The district judge determined that (1) the 1996 amendments to I.C. \u00a7 72-223 eliminated this Court\u2019s statutory employer analysis, (2) Fred Meyer was immune from third-party liability, because it owned the property, and (3) Bate-man-Hall was immune from liability as a general contractor. Robison appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Anx\">This Court\u2019s review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment is the same standard used by the trial court in originally ruling on the motion. <em>Sun Valley v. Rosholt, Robertson &amp; Tucker, </em>133 Idaho 1, 3, 981 P.2d 236, 238 (1999) (citing <em>Friel v. Boise City Hous. Auth., </em>126 Idaho 484, 887 P.2d 29 (1994)). Pursuant to I.R.C.P. 56(c), summary judgment must be entered when \u201cthe pleadings depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d This Court liberally construes the record in favor of the party opposing the motion for summary judgment and draws any reasonable inferences and conclusions in that party\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 981 P.2d at 239 (citing <em>Farm Credit Bank of Spokane v. Stevenson, </em>125 Idaho 270, 869 P.2d 1365 (1994)). If the evidence reveals no disputed issues of material fact, what remains is a question of law, over which this Court exercises free review. <em>Farm Credit Bank of Spokane, </em>125 Idaho at 272, 869 P.2d at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">This case requires this Court to consider the third-party tort immunity provided under I.C. \u00a7 72-223 of the Idaho Workers Compensation Act (Act). In general, the Act provides employees a definite remedy for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment. I.C. \u00a7 72-201.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, while providing \u201csure and certain relief\u201d to workers, the Act also limits the liability of employers. I.C. \u00a7 72-209(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; I.C. \u00a7 72-211.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The exclusive nature of the worker\u2019s compensation remedy is referred to as the exclusive remedy rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">I.C. \u00a7 72-223 provides a limited exception to the exclusive remedy rule. Under I.C. \u00a7 72-223, an individual\u2019s right to receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits does not preclude that individual from bringing a civil action for damages against a \u201cthird party.\u201d The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">[t]he right to compensation under this law shall not be affected by the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>injury, occupational disease or death is caused under circumstances creating in some person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages therefor, such person so liable being referred to as the third party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1). However, the Act clearly excludes certain parties from third-party liability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Such third party liability shall not include [1] those employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code; nor include [2] the owner or lessee of premises, or other person who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on, but who, by reason of there being an independent contractor or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of the workmen there employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1). With regard to injuries arising from the tortious acts of these immune third parties, worker\u2019s compensation benefits are the exclusive remedy. The central issue in this case is whether the district judge correctly, determined Fred Meyer and Bateman-Hall are immune from third-party tort liability pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The first question on appeal is whether the district judge should have applied this Court\u2019s \u201cstatutory employer\u201d analysis to this particular provision of the Act. Second, Robi-son asks this Court to consider whether the district judge erred in holding I.C. \u00a7 72-223 rendered Fred Meyer and Bateman-Hall immune from third-party liability. Third, Robi-son asks this Court to consider whether granting immunity based on contingent liability violates the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. For reasons set forth below, this Court holds: (1) the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d analysis applies to I.C. \u00a7 72-223; (2) in applying the correct legal analysis, immunity is lawfully granted to Bateman-Hall but not to Fred Meyer; and (3) the district judge did not err in dismissing Robison\u2019s alleged equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">A. <em>Statutory Employer Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOj\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which this Court exercises <em>de novo </em>review. <em>V-1 Oil Co. v. Idaho State Tax Com\u2019n, </em>134 Idaho 716, 718, 9 P.3d 619, 521 (2000). The objective of statutory interpretation is to derive legislative intent. <em>Albee v. Judy, </em>136 Idaho 226, 230, 31 P.3d 248, 252 (2001). Legislative intent begins with the literal language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 31 P.3d at 253. To determine the meaning of a statute, the Court applies the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms and, where possible, every word, clause and sentence should be given effect. <em>Rife v. Long, </em>127 Idaho 841, 848, 908 P.2d 143, 153 (1995); <em>In re Permit No. 36-7200, </em>121 Idaho 819, 822, 828 P.2d 848, 851 (1992). Where the language of a statute is unambiguous, there is no need to consult extrinsic evidence. <em>City of Sun Valley v. Sun Valley Co., </em>123 Idaho 665, 667, 851 P.2d 961, 963 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Robison argues the district judge erred in holding, \u201c[t]he 1996 amendment to Idaho Code \u00a7 72-223 eliminates any need for making a determination of whether a third party is a statutory employer.\u201d The district judge concluded it is unnecessary to consider this Court\u2019s statutory employer analysis, because I.C. \u00a7 72-223 clearly and unambiguously \u201cexcludes employers described in Idaho Code \u00a7 72-216 and owners and lessees of premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">This Court holds the district judge\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 72-223 is in error. The plain language of I.C. \u00a7 72-223 refers to the term \u201cemployer,\u201d which has a specific definition under the Act. For at least the last 60 years, this Court has interpreted this statutory definition and has developed significant case law to help give the term meaning. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Packer John Mines Corp., </em>60 Idaho 653, 95 P.2d 572, 573 (1939) (examining whether owner was employer for purposes of worker\u2019s compensation coverage). As this Court has explained, this statutory definition of employer is \u201can expanded definition designed to prevent an employer from avoiding liability under the workmen\u2019s compensation statutes by subcontracting the work to others who may be irresponsible and not insure their employees.\u201d <em>Harpole v. State, </em>131 Idaho 437, 440, 958 P.2d 594, 597 (1998). Thus, a statutory employer is anyone who, by contracting or subcontracting out services, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>liable to pay worker\u2019s compensation benefits if the direct employer does not pay those benefits. I.C. \u00a7 72-216(1), (2). <em>See also, Struhs v. Protection Technologies, Inc., </em>133 Idaho 715, 719, 992 P.2d 164, 168 (1999). The case law surrounding the definition of the term \u201cemployer\u201d is what the Court refers to as the statutory employer analysis. Because the legislature used the identical language from the statutory definition when crafting third-party tort immunity under I.C. \u00a7 72-223, this Court determines the statutory employer analysis is a necessary tool in determining the meaning and scope of I.C. \u00a7 72-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Prior to 1996, I.C. \u00a7 72-223 provided for third-party tort liability and specifically <em>included </em>certain statutory employers. \u201cSuch third party shall include those employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code.\u201d However, following the 1996 amendments, the statute <em>exempts </em>from liability (1) \u201cthose employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) \u201cthe owner or lessee of premises, or other person who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on, but who, by reason of there being an independent contractor or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of the workmen there employed.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">This new language is substantially similar to the statutory definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d which includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">Any person who has expressly or impliedly hired or contracted the services of another. It includes contractors and subcontractors. It includes the owner or lessee of premises, or other person who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on, but who, by reason of there being an independent contractor or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of the workers there employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">I.C. \u00a7 72-102(12)(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">Thus, the main difference resulting from the 1996 amendment is the legislature has excluded from third-party tort liability two classes of employers, using substantially the same language used in the statutory definition of \u201cemployer.\u201d This Court determines, as a matter of law, that in so doing, the legislature intended to import the statutory employer analysis. The result of such a definition is a logical symmetry: those parties deemed employers for the purpose of being hable for worker\u2019s compensation benefits under I.C. \u00a7 72-102 are the same parties deemed immune from third-party tort liability under I.C. \u00a7 72-223. To hold otherwise would result in two different interpretations of the same terms in two different provisions of the Act. Such a result is incongruous and nonsensical. Fundamentally, if the legislature had intended I.C. \u00a7 72-223 to provide broader immunity, then it could have used language different from that used in I.C. \u00a7 72-102 and the definition of \u201cemployer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">It is important to note the district judge believed he was applying the plain meaning of I.C. \u00a7 72-223. Further, an isolated reading of I.C. \u00a7 72-223 supports the district judge\u2019s conclusion. However, I.C. \u00a7 72-223 does not exist in isolation. Rather, it is part of the Act and should be interpreted <em>in pan mate\u00f1a </em>with other provisions of that Act. <em>See, e.g. State v. Barnes, </em>133 Idaho 378, 382, 987 P.2d 290, 294 (1999) (holding <em>in pari materia </em>means each legislative act is to be interpreted with other acts relating to the same matter or subject all of which should be considered together as one system governed by one spirit and policy). There is an applicable statutory definition and well-established case law surrounding the terms used, which should be employed in determining the statute\u2019s \u201cplain meaning.\u201d However, this does not necessarily mean the statute is ambiguous. To the contrary, this Court finds the meaning of I.C. \u00a7 72-223 is clear and unam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>biguous considering the Act as a whole, including all definitions and relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Relevant rules of statutory construction indicate, first, the Court must examine the Act in its entirety, making certain to read the provision in context and applying any statutory definitions provided. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-102 (\"Words and terms used in the worker\u2019s compensation law, unless the context otherwise requires, are defined in the subsections which follow.\u201d) Second, some terms and phrases have developed a specific meaning or subtext resulting from years of consistent judicial interpretation and \u201c[t]his Court assumes the Legislature has full knowledge of this existing judicial interpretation when it amends a statute.\u201d <em>State v. Martinez, </em>126 Idaho 801, 803, 891 P.2d 1061, 1063 (Ct.App.1995). Third, this Court has held \u201c[t]he legislature is presumed not to intend to overturn long established principles of law unless an intention to do so plainly appears by express declaration or the language employed admits no other construction.\u201d <em>George W. Watkins Family v. Messenger, </em>118 Idaho 537, 540, 797 P.2d 1385, 1388 (1990). Thus, given the statutory definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d the fact this term and its applicable definition were imported almost word-for-word into I.C. \u00a7 72-223, and there is no indication within the Act that the legislature intended to overturn years of relevant case law, the statutory employer analysis should be used when determining the plain meaning of I.C. \u00a7 72-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">B. <em>Fred Meyer Liability as a Property Owner</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In his decision, the district judge determined, \u201cFred Meyer is the owner or lessee of these premises. There is no evidence to the contrary. Fred Meyer is. therefore excluded from suit by Robison, because Robison received benefits from Worker\u2019s Compensation Insurance.\u201d Robison argues this determination was in error, because property ownership alone does not provide immunity under the statutory employer analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">As a result of the 1996 amendments, I.C. \u00a7 72-223 specifically exempts from tort liability \u201c[T]he owner or lessee of premises, or other person who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on, but who, by reason of there being an independent contractor or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of the workmen there employed.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-223. This language mirrors that used in the statutory definition of the term \u201cemployer,\u201d which specifically \u201cincludes the owner or lessee of premises, or other person who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on, but who, by reason of there being an independent contractor or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of the workers there employed.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-102(12)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">In interpreting the definitional use of these terms, this Court has explained, \u201cA statutory employer does not include the mere owner of the premises, unless the owner is also the virtual proprietor or operator of the business there carried on.\u201d <em>Harpole v. State, </em>131 Idaho at 440, 958 P.2d at 597. To determine who is a virtual proprietor or operator, the Court must consider whether the work being done pertains to the business, trade, or occupation of the owner or proprietor and whether such business, trade, or occupation is being carried on by it for pecuniary gain. <em>Id. </em>\u201cGenerally, to find a business or person to be a statutory employer, the work being carried out by the independent contractor on the owner or proprietor\u2019s premises must have been the type that could have been carried out by employees of the owner or proprietor in the course of its usual trade or business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In short, \u201cif a person is normally equipped with manpower and tools to do a job and nevertheless contracts it to another employer, he is the statutory employer of the second employer\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Applying this analysis to Fred Meyer, it is clear* Fred Meyer is not a statutory employer; therefore, it is not exempt from liability under I.C. \u00a7 72-223. The undisputed facts demonstrate Fred Meyer is in the business of the retail sale of merchandise. As admitted in discovery, Fred Meyer is not in the business of construction or roof installation. Further, Fred Meyer did not employ individuals who were trained in building construction or roof installation, nor did it own materials or equipment necessary to engage in building construction or roof installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>In light of these facts, and applying the analysis set forth in <em>Harpole, </em>Fred Meyer is not \u201cthe owner or lessee of premises, or other person who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Therefore, the district judge erred in holding Fred Meyer immune from third-party tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">C. <em>Bateman-Hall Liability as a General Contractor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The district judge determined Bate-man-Hall was immune from third-party tort liability as an employer \u201cdescribed in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-223. The district judge looked to the plain language of I.C. \u00a7 72-216 and determined, \u201cThere is no question that Bateman-Hall is a third party described in Idaho Code \u00a7 72-216.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Robison argues the contractual relationship alone does not provide immunity under the statutory employer analysis. Robison argues, under applicable case law, not all those who contract or subcontract work will be considered employers for the purposes of the Act. Instead, the test is similar to that used to determine whether the owner or lessee of premises is a statutory employer. The Court must determine whether the work being carried out by the independent contractor was of the type that could have been carried out by the alleged statutory employer in the course of its usual trade or business. <em>Adam v. Titan Equipment Supply Corp., </em>93 Idaho 644, 646, 470 P.2d 409, 411 (1970). Thus, \u201cif a person is normally equipped with manpower and tools to do a job and nevertheless contracts it to another employer, he is the statutory employer of the second employer\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying this test to the undisputed facts, Robison argues Bateman-Hall does not enjoy third-party tort immunity, because Bateman-Hall is not involved in roofing as a regular and predictable part of the work done by its own employees and is not normally equipped with the manpower, equipment, and tools necessary to do roofing work.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">This Court finds Robison\u2019s argument unpersuasive. I.C. \u00a7 72-216 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\u201cAn employer subject to the provisions of this law shall be hable for compensation to an employee of a contractor or subcontractor under him who has not complied with the provisions of section 72-301 in any case where such an employer would have been hable for compensation if such employee had been working directly for such employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">I.C. \u00a7 72-216(1). Further, the statutory definition of \u201cemployer\u201d includes \u201c[a]ny person who has expressly or impliedly hired or contracted the services of another. It includes contractors and subcontractors.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-102(12)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">While Robison\u2019s statutory analysis of Fred Meyer, as the owner of the property where the accident occurred, appears consistent with apphcable case law, Robison\u2019s suggested analysis regarding Bateman-Hall as the general contractor does not appear consistent with apphcable ease law. There are a number of recent cases addressing the scope of statutory employer liability without considering the nature of the business being contracted in relation to the nature of the contracting party\u2019s business. <em>See, e.g., Struhs v. Protection Technologies, Inc., </em>133 Idaho at 719, 992 P.2d at 168 (holding the federal agency responsible for the contract the statutory employer); <em>Spencer v. Allpress Logging, Inc., </em>134 Idaho 856, 860, 11 P.3d 475, 479 (2000) (holding lumber mill purchasing lumber a statutory employer of an employee of a logging contractor); and <em>Dewey v. Merrill, </em>124 Idaho 201, 203, 858 P.2d 740, 742 (1993) (holding a pharmacist acting as his own general contractor for the purpose of building his own house an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of the Act). In these eases, the contract itself, including identifying the specific contracting parties, is of primary import.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">Further, in all of the cases supporting Robison\u2019s analytical framework, this Court considered the liability of \u201cthe owner or lessee of premises, or other person, who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-102(12)(a). <em>See, e.g., Harpole v. State, </em>131 Idaho at 440, 958 P.2d at 597 (applying statutory employer analysis to determine status of State, where worker sustained injury during logging operations performed under contract where State sold timber rights on state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>owned property to logging company that employed worker); <em>Jones v. Packer John Mines Corp., </em>60 Idaho 653, 95 P.2d 572 (1939) (applying statutory employer analysis to determine status of salvage company with \u201ccomplete control over access to [the] site\u201d and \u201cin exclusive possession of the premises\u201d); <em>Adam v. Titan Equip. Supply Corp., </em>93 Idaho at 646, 470 P.2d at 411 (applying statutory employer analysis to, determine status of corporation owning land being mined for silver ore). Because these cases address the scope of an owner\u2019s liability, they support Robison\u2019s statutory employer analysis as applied to Fred Meyer; however, they lend little support for Robison\u2019s argument regarding Bate-man-Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Applying the more limited test to owners as opposed to subcontractors is supported by the express language and general purpose of the Act. Under the express terms of the statute, an owner (or lessee) is not liable as an employer unless deemed \u201cvirtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on.\u201d I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-102(12)(a) and 72-223. In contrast, a contractor or subcontractor is liable based on this contractual status alone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the purpose of the Act and the expanded definition of employer, was \u201cdesigned to prevent an employer from avoiding liability under the worker\u2019s compensation statutes by subcontracting work to others who may be irresponsible and not insure their employees.\u201d <em>Runcorn v. Shearer Lumber Products, Inc., </em>107 Idaho at 393, 690 P.2d at 328 (quotations omitted). From a common sense view, a property owner often hires parties who have employees to perform work on the property.' Hiring such contractors or subcontractors does not necessarily demonstrate an effort to avoid worker\u2019s compensation liability. However, where that owner is engaged in the same type of business as the contractor or subcontractor, it makes more sense to consider the owner\u2019s attempt to circumvent worker\u2019s compensation liability. For these reasons, it makes sense to have a rule that limits a property owner\u2019s liability under the statutory concept of \u201cemployer,\u201d while interpreting the contractor or subcontractor\u2019s liability more broadly. Thus, the district judge correctly determined Bateman-Hall is immune from third-party tort liability pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223, as a general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">D. <em>Equal Protection Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Robison argues the district judge\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 72-223 violates the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. According to Robison, statutory employer status alone, without actually paying premiums for Robison\u2019s benefit, is insufficient to establish immunity. Further, to the-extent I.C. \u00a7 72-223 grants immunity to a statutory employer based only on contingent, secondary liability, I.C. \u00a7 72-223 violates the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">Legislative acts are generally presumed constitutional and any doubt concerning interpretation of a- statute is to be resolved in favor of that which renders the statute constitutional. <em>Meisner v. Potlatch Corp., </em>131 Idaho 258, 261, 954 P.2d 676, 679 (1998). Thus the burden of overcoming the presumption of the statute\u2019s validity rests with Robison. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">In addressing an alleged equal protection violation, the Court must first, identify the classification being challenged and second, determine the constitutional standard of review. <em>Id. </em>Constitutional challenges to worker\u2019s compensation statutes are subject to a rational basis analysis. <em>Phinney v. Shoshone Medical Ctr., </em>131 Idaho 529, 533, 960 P.2d 1258, 1262 (1998). \u201cUnder either the United States Constitution or the Idaho Constitution, a classification will survive rational basis analysis if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">The central problem with Robison\u2019s analysis of this equal protection issue is there is no attempt to clearly identify to the Court the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>classification challenged. In addition, the four cases cited in support of Robison\u2019s position do not mention the equal protection clause. <em>See Fonseca v. Pacific Constr. Co., Ltd., </em>54 Haw. 578, 513 P.2d 156 (1973); <em>Meiggs v. Associated Builders, Inc., </em>545 A.2d 631, 637 (D.C.Ct.App.1988); <em>Ryan v. New Bedford Cordage Co., </em>421 F.Supp. 794, 797 (D.Vt.1976); <em>Andrews v. Robinson Steel Constr. Co., </em>355 S.W.2d 890, 892 (Mo.1962). Rather than challenging the rationality of the classification, Robison appears to challenge the rationality of the entire statutory scheme. Such a challenge is not appropriately considered an equal protection challenge. For these reasons, the Court will not consider Robison\u2019s argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">This Court affirms in part and reverses in part the district judge\u2019s decision, holding (1) the Court\u2019s statutory employer analysis applies to an interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 72-223; (2) Fred Meyer is not immune from third-party tort liability; (3) Bateman-Hall is a statutory employer immune from third-party tort liability; and (4) there is no basis for an equal protection challenge here. Given the result, we do not award costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-7\">Justices WALTERS and EISMANN, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\">. \"[S]ure and certain relief for injured workmen and their families and dependents is hereby provided regardless of questions of fault and to the exclusion of every other remedy, proceeding, or compensation, except as is otherwise provided in this act.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\">. \"Subject to the provisions of section 72-223, the liability of the employer under this law shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of the employer to the employee, spouse, dependents, heirs, legal representatives, or assigns.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-209(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-17\">.\"Subject to the provisions of section 72-223, the rights and remedies herein granted to an employee on account of an injury or occupation disease for which he is entitled to compensation under this law shall exclude all other rights and remedies of the employee, his personal representatives, dependents or next of kin, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury or disease.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-211.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">.

Reading \u00a7 72-223 in such a manner is contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Prior to 1996, I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">The right to compensation under this law shall not be affected by the fact that the injury, occupational disease or death is caused under circumstances creating in some person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages therefor, such person so liable being referred to as the third party. Such third party shall include those employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">In 1996 the Legislature amended section 72-223(1) to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-14\">The right to compensation under this law shall not be affected by the fact that the injury, occupational disease or death is caused under circumstances creating in some person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages therefor, such person so liable being referred to as the third party. Such third party shall <em>not </em>include those employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code; <em>nor include the owner or lessee of premises, or other person who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there earned on, but who, by reason of there being an independent contractor or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of the workmen there employed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">(Emphasis added.) This Court has not previously had the opportunity to consider third party liability under the 1996 amendments to section 72-223(1). In this instance, whether Fred Meyer or Bateman-Hall may be liable to the Robisons on a theory of third-party liability turns on statutory application and/or construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">Where the language of a statute is clear, this Court need only apply the statutory language to the facts at hand. <em>Jen-Rath Co., Inc., v. Kit Mfg. Co., </em>137 Idaho 330, 335, 48 P.3d 659, 664 (2002) (citing <em>Hamilton v. Reeder Flying Serv., </em>135 Idaho 568, 571, 21 P.3d 890, 893 (2001)). If statutory language is reasonably susceptible to more than one construction, it is ambiguous. When a statute is ambiguous, this Court may seek guidance from the legislative history in order to ascertain and implement the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Thomas v. Worthington, </em>132 Idaho 825, 829, 979 P.2d 1183, 1187 (1999) (citing <em>Corp. of Presiding Bishop v. Ada County, </em>123 Idaho 410, 416, 849 P.2d 83, 89 (1993)). Whenever this Court must apply or construe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>a statute, however, it should begin with the literal words of the statute, and its \u201cplain, obvious, and rational meaning.\u201d <em>Jen-Rath Co., Inc., </em>137 Idaho at 335, 48 P.3d at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Applying the aforementioned principles of statute application, the district court correctly found that the undisputed facts show Fred Meyer is the owner or lessee of these premises. Thus, Fred Meyer is excluded from suit by Robison pursuant to the plain language of I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1) which excludes third party liability for \u201cowners or lessee[s] of premises _\u201d Furthermore, the undisputed facts show that Bateman-Hall is an employer that \u201cwould have been liable for [Robison\u2019s] compensation if [Robison] had been working directly for [Bateman-Hall].\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-216. Because Bateman-Hall is an employer described in 72-216 and Robison\u2019s direct employer, Robison Roofing, complied with worker\u2019s compensation law and compensated Robison, Bateman-Hall is excluded from third-party liability under the plain language of I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1) when the language is given its \u201cplain, obvious, and rational meaning.\u201d <em>Jen-Rath Co., Inc., </em>137 Idaho at 335, 48 P.3d at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Even if the plain language of I.C. \u00a7 72-223 were found ambiguous, the legislative history clearly shows that the Legislature intended the 1996 amendments to exclude parties such as Fred Meyer and Bateman-Hall from third-party liability. As noted by the district court, the Statement of Purpose accompanying introduction of the amendments states that \u201can employer who has contractors or subcontractors under him who have worker\u2019s compensation insurance will not be subject to suit by an employee of the contractor or subcontractor. Also, exempt from suit will be the owner or lessee of premises .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The plain language of the 1996 amendments to I.C. \u00a7 72-223 and Statement of Purpose show, quite clearly, the purpose of the amendment was limiting liability of property owners such as Fred Meyer and contractors like Bateman-Hall. This Court should not obscure the Legislature\u2019s intent of I.C. \u00a7 72-223 by overlooking the section\u2019s plain language. Instead, this Court should seek to implement the Legislature\u2019s purpose. The plain language of I.C. \u00a7 72-223, and its legislative history, applied to the undisputed facts in the record show that Fred Meyer and Bateman-Hall are exempt from liability to Robison and entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-9\">Justice SCHROEDER, concurs in dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
