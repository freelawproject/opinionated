In February 2000, the denial of the variance by the Planning and Zoning Commission became final, after the County Commissioners dismissed the appeal for failure to state lawful grounds upon which the appeal could be based. Bonner County Revised Code (BCRC) \u00a7 12-451(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-19\">Harris filed a second application for a variance regarding the boathouse in August of 2000. The Planning and Zoning Commission again denied the application and issued its findings and conclusions. Harris filed a notice setting forth grounds for appeal under BCRC \u00a7 12-451(c). Upon presentation of the appeal by the planning director, the Board of County Commissioners (the Board) accepted the appeal, determined to hear the appeal <em>de novo, </em>and set the hearing date for January 4, 2001, before a change in the Board was scheduled to take place. At the January 4, 2001, hearing, the Board granted the variance by a vote of two to one and thereafter issued its findings and conclusions. The Board reached exactly the opposite conclusion as the Planning and Zoning Commission on each of the five standards applicable for a variance under BCRC \u00a7 12 \u2014 2010(d)(1) through (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-20\">David and Barbara Eacret, (\u201cthe Ea-crets\u201d), adjoining landowners to the Harris property and \u201caffected persons\u201d under I.C. \u00a7 67-6521, appealed the award by filing a petition for judicial review to the district court. In their petition, they described the actions of the County in the granting of the variance, which they claimed denied them their due process rights. They contended that the Commissioners encouraged Harris to reapply for a zoning variance that had been previously denied. Allegedly, the Commissioners improperly discussed the Harris variance application at their regular business meeting, without notice to interested parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>or an opportunity to be heard; they decided in another business meeting to rehear the Harris variance application; they visited the site of the boathouse without notice; and they engaged in <em>ex parte </em>communications with Harris. The Eacrets also asserted that the Commissioners had expedited the rehearing date in order that the Hands variance application could be ruled on before the terms of Commissioners Mueller and Van-Stone expired and there were new members on the Board. The Eacrets claimed that the notice of hearing for the January 4, 2001, hearing contained an enoneous description of the parcel(s) in question and finally, that the granting of the variance by the Board was not supported by specific findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">By order dated November 20, 2001, the district court vacated the issuance of the variance and remanded the matter to the Board, which no longer included Commissioners Mueller and Van Stone. The district court found that a procedural error existed in the identification of the parcel(s) to which the variance would apply. Further, drawing inferences from a statement made by Commissioner Mueller at the Board\u2019s August 31, 2000, business meeting, the district court found that Commissioner Mueller had reached his decision on the variance prior to the hearing on the appeal and based upon evidence outside of the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Harris filed an appeal from the district court\u2019s memorandum decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Although the Eacrets had requested costs and attorney fees in their petition for judicial review, the district court reserved its decision on the same until after the remand. The Eacrets renewed their request for fees as against the County and Harris on April 8, 2002, and they filed a motion for entry of judgment subsequent to the Board\u2019s denial of the variance on remand. The district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments at a hearing and on June 14, 2002, issued an order finding the Eacrets to be the prevailing party and entitled to an award of fees and costs as against the County. The district court determined that the County had acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law in granting the variance to Harris, thus satisfying the criteria under I.C. \u00a7 12-117. Relying on the language of the statute, the district court authorized the award of attorney fees to include both the district court proceedings and the administrative proceedings that occurred after the offending statements of Commissioner Mueller at the August 31, 2000, Board meeting, if they were regarding the Harris variance. The Eacrets submitted their memorandum of costs and attorney fees to the district court on June 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">On October 24, 2002, the district court entered judgment in favor of the Eacrets. The Court entered a separate order awarding fees and costs exclusively against the County, as provided by I.C. \u00a7 12-117. The County timely appealed from the order and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Harris\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s decision on review of the Board\u2019s decision granting the variance has been consolidated with the County\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order awarding fees and costs against it, for argument before the Idaho Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Harris argues that the district court erred in finding that Commissioner Mueller\u2019s statements at the January 4, 2001, hearing evidenced a predetermination of issues surrounding the variance request as well as information beyond the record that was exclusively in Commissioner Mueller\u2019s possession. Harris requests attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117. The issues raised by the County relate to the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other costs to the Eacrets. The County contests the timeliness of the Ea-crets\u2019 memorandum of costs, the district court\u2019s prevailing party determination and the extent of the award. The Eacrets request attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">\n<em>A Standard of Review.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">The provision of the Local Land Use Planning Act (LLUPA) governing variances pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>vides in part that a variance \u201cmay be granted to an applicant only upon a showing of undue hardship because of characteristics of the site and that the variance is not in conflict with the public interest.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6516. \u201cAn affected person aggrieved by a decision may within twenty-eight days after- all remedies have been exhausted ... seek judicial review as provided by chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(l)(d). Judicial review shall be conducted by the court without a jury, with the review of disputed issues of fact to be confined to the agency record. I.C. \u00a7 67-5277.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">In a subsequent appeal from a district court\u2019s decision in which the district court was acting in its appellate capacity under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Supreme Court reviews the agency record independently of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Payette River Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n, v. Board of Comm\u2019rs of Valley County, </em>132 Idaho 551, 554, 976 P.2d 477, 480 (1999); <em>Ferguson v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs for Ada County, </em>110 Idaho 785, 718 P.2d 1223 (1986). As to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the zoning agency. I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(1); <em>Lamar Corp. v. City of Twin Falls, </em>133 Idaho 36, 39, 981 P.2d 1146, 1149 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The Court shall affirm the zoning agency\u2019s action unless the Court finds that the agency\u2019s findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are: \u201c(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; and (e) arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3). The party attacking a zoning board\u2019s action must first illustrate that the board erred in a manner specified therein and must then show that a substantial right of the party has been prejudiced. <em>Payette River Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\n<em>B. Bias of Decision maker.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The Due Process Clause entitles a person to an impartial and disinterested tribunal. <em>Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., </em>446 U.S. 238, 100 S.Ct. 1610, 64 L.Ed.2d 182 (1980). This requirement applies not only to courts, but also to state administrative agencies charged with applying eligibility criteria for licenses. <em>Stivers v. Pierce, </em>71 F.3d 732 (9th Cir.1995). Decisions by a zoning board applying general rules or specific policies to specific individuals, interests or situations, are quasi-judicial in nature and subject to due process constraints. <em>Cooper v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Ada County, </em>101 Idaho 407, 411, 614 P.2d 947, 951 (1980). <em>See also Comer v. County of Twin Falls, </em>130 Idaho 433, 942 P.2d 557 (1997) (due process requirements apply to proceedings of local land use boards, including decisions on applications for conditional land use permits). Bias of a board member renders his participation in the due process hearing constitutionally unacceptable, <em>Johnson v. Bonner County School Dist. No. 82, </em>126 Idaho 490, 887 P.2d 35 (1994), and the reviewing court must determine the effect of the conflicted vote in order to assure impartial decision-making and to avoid the appearance of impropriety. <em>Floyd v. Board of Comm\u2019rs of Bonneville County, </em>137 Idaho 718, 726, 52 P.3d 863, 871 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">We begin with a review of the district court\u2019s findings regarding the conduct of Commissioner Mueller that precipitated the remand of the matter of the Harris variance to the Board of Commissioners. In this appeal, Harris disputes the district court\u2019s determination that Commissioner Mueller had made up his mind on the variance application prior to the <em>de novo </em>hearing before the Board and that Mueller\u2019s decision was based in part on evidence that was outside of the record. Harris argues that the statements from which the district court inferred that Mueller had prejudged the controversy were but \u201ca fatalistic acknowledgement that the process will result in the granting of a variance.\u201d Harris also asserts that there was no direct evidence of bias on the part of Commissioner Mueller to sustain a conflict of interest claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">The Board held a regular business meeting on August 31, 2000, where the matter of set back requirements for boathouses on Bottle Bay was discussed as a \u201cnew business\u201d agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>da item. The transcript from the meeting reflects that Commissioner Mueller had a personal interest in promoting a blanket variance to allow the people on Bottle Bay to build their boathouses, \u201cas everybody else in Bottle Bay has been doing for fifty years.\u201d Without specifically referring to the Harris variance, Commissioner Mueller alluded to a pending variance application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-4\">I can\u2019t tell you how much it is costing him through the County. He\u2019s went (sic) through one variance, now he\u2019s going through the second variance, O.K. We turned the first one down, you guys did. Uh, the helper he has, the engineer, he\u2019s about $5,000 into it right now. In the end, it is going to get approved, and all he is doing is spending tons of dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The comments elicited an admonishment from the attorney for the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">At the duly noticed public hearing of January 4, 2001, the Board took testimony anew on the Harris\u2019s variance application. The hearing began with a disclosure by Commissioner Mueller that he had talked to the Harrises a couple of times and that he had driven by the site of the boathouse for which the variance was being sought. He disclaimed any conflict of interest. Commissioner Van Stone indicated that he \u201cdid see the boathouse by accident\u201d while he was looking at another boathouse nearby. Commissioner Mueller commented in his opening remarks that he believed that if the Planning and Zoning Commission had known all the facts, \u201cthey would have given us a recommendation to pass this.\u201d Although this initial statement was made in the context of justifying the Board\u2019s decision to review the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission denying the variance, Commissioner Mueller reiterated the conclusion that the Planning and Zoning Commission \u201cwould have approved it, if [they] would have had all the facts,\u201d as his rationale for voting in favor of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The district court inferred from these comments that Commissioner Mueller had knowledge of facts surrounding the Harris variance before the January 4, 2001, hearing and at best, that he possessed information that the other commissioners did not share in. Significantly, the district court also concluded from Commissioner Mueller\u2019s following comments that he appeared to have predetermined the question as to whether the variance should be granted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-9\">I guess my only comment is that I think Bottle Bay is about the only unique bay on the whole lake. It\u2019s small; it\u2019s steep on both sides. It costs a lot of money if the people are going to be allowed to use this property. I think this forty-foot setback was wrong for that particular bay. Now, very possibly the rest of the lake, it would fit on some of it, but not all of it again because a lot of it is steep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-10\">I wish we were giving the Planning Department instructions right now to let\u2019s allow boathouses.... We need to grant these variances, or maybe not variances, but we need to change things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-11\">I think this variance needs to be granted to these people even though they built without the proper variance to begin with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">A decision maker is not disqualified simply because he has taken a position, even in public, on a policy issue related to the dispute, in the absence of a showing that the decision maker is \u201cnot capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances.\u201d <em>Hortonville Joint School Distr. No. 1 v. Hortonville Education Ass\u2019n, 426 </em>U.S. 482, 493, 96 S.Ct. 2308, 2314, 49 L.Ed.2d 1, 9 (1941). Prehearing statements by a decision maker are not fatal to the validity of the zoning determination as long as the statement does not preclude the finding that the decision maker maintained an open mind and continued to listen to all the evidence presented before making the final decision. <em>See generally McPherson Landfill, Inc. v. Board of Comm\u2019rs of Shawnee County, </em>274 Kan. 303, 49 P.3d 522, 531 (2002). By way of explanation then, prehearing statements by a decision maker are fatal to the validity of the zoning determination if the statements show that the decision maker: (a) has made up his or her mind regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the facts and will not listen to the evidence with an open mind, or (b) will not apply the existing law, or (c) has already made np his or her mind regarding the outcome of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Here, Commissioner Mueller publicly expressed his position regarding the building of Bottle Bay boathouses in general. What customarily could be viewed as political or philosophical musings, became predetermination of a pending controversy when he \u201cwished we\u2019re giving the Planning Department instructions right now to let\u2019s allow boathouses_we need to grant these variances, or maybe not variances but we need to change things.\u201d Mueller\u2019s comments regarding a pending variance request \u2014 the Harris variance request \u2014 foretold the result of the proceedings before the Board that were yet to take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">There are similarities between this case and <em>Barbara Realty Co. v. Zoning Board of Cranston, 85 </em>R.I. 152, 128 A.2d 342 (1957), where one of the decision makers, learning that the variance application would be opposed, responded, \u201cWhat difference does it make, we are going to shove it down your throat anyway.\u201d The evidence in <em>Barbara </em>showed that the decision maker \u201chad prejudged the matter before it and, therefore, could not render a fair and impartial decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 128 A.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Recently, this Court reviewed an order of the Board of Commissioners validating a road and held unconstitutional the participation of a commissioner who had spoken publicly about the road in question and its public status prior to the hearing. <em>Floyd v. Board of Comm\u2019rs of Bonneville County, et al., </em>137 Idaho 718, 52 P.3d 863 (2002). Finding actual bias sufficient to disqualify the commissioner, the Court nevertheless determined that due process would be satisfied by simply disregarding that commissioner\u2019s vote, which was not the \u201cswing vote\u201d among the three commissioners. <em>Id. </em>at 727, 52 P.3d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Mueller\u2019s statements may have created an appearance of unfairness. Although the comments were not as blatant as in <em>Barbar\u00e1 Realty, supra, </em>they are cause for concern especially when viewed in conjunction with the ex parte communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">\n<em>C. Ex parte communications and impermissible view.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">The second question raised by Harris\u2019s argument on appeal is whether Commissioner Mueller\u2019s decision was based, as the district court found, on evidence that was beyond the record. At issue are the <em>ex parte </em>communications between Mueller and Harris and the- impermissible view of the subject boathouse site.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">\u201cWhen <em>ex parte </em>contacts are present in the context of quasi-judicial zoning decisions, such as variances and special use permits, courts will be more receptive to challenges to decisions on grounds of zoning bias.\u201d <em>McPherson Landfill, Inc., supra, </em>49 P.3d at 533, <em>quoting </em>32 Proof of Facts 531, \u00a7 16. Idaho Code, Section 67-5253 addresses <em>ex parte </em>communications in contested administrative cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-13\">Unless required for the disposition of <em>ex parte </em>matters specifically authorized by statute, a presiding officer serving in a contested case shall not communicate, directly or indirectly, regarding any substantive issue in the proceeding, with any party, except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate in the communication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">A quasi-judicial officer must confine his or her decision to the record produced at the public hearing. <em>Idaho Historic Preservation Council v. City Council of City of Boise, </em>134 Idaho 651, 8 P.3d 646 (2000). Any <em>ex parte </em>communication must be disclosed at the public hearing, including a \u201cgeneral description of the communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656, 8 P.3d at 651. The purpose of the disclosure requirement is to afford opposing parties with an opportunity to rebut the substance of any <em>ex parte </em>communications. In a similar vein, the opportunity to be present at a view provides opposing parties the opportunity to rebut facts derived from the visit that may come to bear on the ultimate decision and create an appearance of bias. A view of the subject property without notice to the interested parties by a board considering an appeal from the commission has been held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>violation of due process. <em>Comer v. County of Twin Falls, </em>130 Idaho 433, 438, 942 P.2d 557, 562 (1997); <em>Chambers v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>125 Idaho 115, 118, 867 P.2d 989, 992 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Commissioner Mueller admitted on the record that he had spoken to Harris a couple of times; however, he did not reveal the substance of the conversations or when exactly they had taken place. He admitted driving by the Harris property but denied that he had any conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">At the regular Commission meeting of August 31, 2000, Commissioner Mueller stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">I can\u2019t tell you how much it is costing him through the County. He\u2019s went (sic) through one variance, now he\u2019s going through the second variance, O.K. We turned the first one down, you guys did. Uh, the helper he has, an engineer, he\u2019s about $5,000 into it right now. In the end, it is going to get approved and all he is doing is spending tons of dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">This statement shows prior conversations with the applicant and a predetermination \u201cit is going to get approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Additionally, in his opening remarks at the noticed public hearing on January 4, 2001, when the Board took new evidence on the Harris variance, Commissioner Mueller\u2019s opening comments at the hearing indicated that if the Planning and Zoning Commission had known all the facts \u201cthey would have given us a recommendation to pass this.\u201d Again, this is an example of predetermination and existing knowledge of the facts outside of the proper hearing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">In our view, Commissioner Mueller\u2019s pre-hearing, <em>ex parte </em>contacts with the applicant himself concerning the variance at issue reveal a lack of impartiality and denial of an opportunity for opponents of the variance to challenge or answer the <em>ex parte </em>evidence. Mueller effectively had evidence derived from the <em>ex parte </em>contacts and the unauthorized view that was not available to the entire Board or equally to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"AecQ\">In addition, although the district court determined that \u201cthere is no indication any commissioners conducted a \u201cview\u201d in a judicial sense,\u201d <em>Comer </em>demands that any view of a parcel of property in question must be preceded by notice and the opportunity to be present to the parties in order to satisfy procedural due process concerns. <em>Comer, supra </em>at 439, 942 P.2d at 563. If Commissioner Mueller had previously viewed the property for reasons unrelated to the pending matter <em>{i.e. </em>located in his neighborhood or on his daily commute to work) he should have disclosed the fact of the view prior to the hearing, in order to allow the parties to object or move for a viewing by all of the commissioners. The commissioners could then have dealt with those motions within their discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"AaQ\">Based upon Mueller\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>contacts and his prehearing statements concerning the boathouse in Bottle Bay, we uphold the district court\u2019s findings of bias, which are supported by the evidence. We conclude that the district court properly held that Commissioner Mueller\u2019s comments and <em>ex parte </em>contacts regarding the subject variance violated the due process rights of the Ea-crets. Under these the circumstances, Mueller\u2019s comments not only created an appearance of impropriety but also underscored the likelihood that he could not fairly decide the issue in the case. The totality of these factors supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Mueller\u2019s mind was irrevocably closed on the subject of the setback variance sought by Harris. Moreover, since the variance was granted with a vote of two to one, Mueller\u2019s participation mandates a reversal of the decision of the Board. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision remanding the matter to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"A2E-\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"ApYb\">On appeal from the district court\u2019s decision awarding fees and costs to the Ea-crets, the County argues that the Eacrets\u2019 memorandum of costs and fees was not presented to the district court in a timely fashion and that the filing of the appeal by Harris from the district court\u2019s decision divested the district court of jurisdiction to thereafter make an award of fees and costs. The County also contests the district court\u2019s application of I.R.C.P. 54 in determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>attorney fee and cost award as well as the scope of the attorney fee award, which the County asserts improperly encompassed fees incurred during the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\">The Eaerets\u2019 request for attorney fees was made in their petition for judicial review to the district court. The Eaerets\u2019 memorandum of costs, however, was not submitted to the district court until April 8, 2002, approximately four months after the district court\u2019s November 20, 2001, opinion on the appeal and following the decision of the Board of Commissioners on remand. The filing of the memorandum appears to correlate with that portion of the district court\u2019s opinion ruling that \u201call requests for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 will be reserved for determination based upon the results of the remand.\u201d In other words, the Eaerets delayed filing their memorandum of costs pending the resolution of the remand to the Board of Commissioners. The County objected, contending that the memorandum was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The district judge erred when he did not follow I.A.R. 41(c), which provides that the court \u201cin its decision on appeal shall include its determination of a claimed right to attorney fees.\u201d Even though the district judge\u2019s decision postponed the determination of the prevailing party on appeal and of the attorney fees to be awarded under I.C. \u00a7 12-117, the parties seeking fees and costs were nevertheless bound by I.A.R. 40. Section (c) of the rule expressly provides that any party who claims costs shall file with the court a memorandum of costs within fourteen days of the filing and announcement of the opinion on appeal, whether or not a petition for rehearing or petition for review is filed. 1.A.R. 40(c). \u201cFailure to file a memorandum of costs within the period prescribed by the rule shall be a waiver of the right to costs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Upon the district judge\u2019s retirement, the Eaerets\u2019 pending motion for attorney fees and costs was reassigned to another district judge, who heard the parties\u2019 arguments on June 12, 2002. The district court entered an order declaring the Eaerets the prevailing parties and holding that they were entitled to fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117 because the County had acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law going back to the August 31, 2000, business meeting where the commissioners improperly discussed the Harris variance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">Where the appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision regarding attorney fees requested by a person in an administrative or civil judicial proceeding against a state agency, city, county, or other taxing district, a free review or <em>de novo </em>standard is applicable. <em>Rincover v. Dep\u2019t of Fin., Sec. Bureau, </em>132 Idaho 547, 976 P.2d 473 (1999). Idaho Code, Section 12-117 is not discretionary, but provides that the court must award attorney fees where a state agency did not act with a reasonable basis in fact or law in a proceeding involving a person who prevails in the action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-15\">If the court decides that (1) an attorney fee statute, (2) rule, or (3) contract provision is applicable, it must then determine if all of the requirements for the award of attorney fees have been met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">Jesse R. Walters, Jr., <em>A Primer for Awarding Attorney Fees in Idaho, </em>Idaho Law Review 17, 1-88 (2001). In the case before the Court, the filing of the Eacret\u2019s memorandum of costs was not in compliance with I.A.R. 40(c) as it was not filed \u201cwithin fourteen days from the filing and announcement of the opinion on appeal.\u201d As a matter of law, the untimely memorandum barred consideration of the Eaerets\u2019 request for attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-17\">Finally, we address the County\u2019s argument that the district court was divested of jurisdiction to make an award of fees and costs upon the fifing of Harris\u2019s appeal to this Court. A timely notice of appeal automatically stays all proceedings in a civil action in the district court. I.A.R. 13(a). Pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>I.A.R. 13(b), the district court \u201cshall have the power and authority to rule upon\u201d the motions enumerated therein. I.A.R. 13(b)(9) does not apply because it is only concerned with an award of attorney fees for the \u201ctrial\u201d in the matter. Here, the district court was sitting in its appellate capacity, and the rules governing the court\u2019s authority to decide a motion for an award of attorney fees are I.A.R. 40 and 41, which we have previously held were not followed in this case. Therefore the County\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees, costs and witness fees and the corresponding judgment in favor of the Eacrets for failure to comply with I.A.R. 40 and 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We conclude that the decision of the Board granting the Harris variance was properly vacated and remanded by the district court on the basis of bias of one of the Commissioners. We vacate the district court\u2019s award of fees and costs against the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The Eacrets have prevailed in the appeal brought by Harris challenging the finding of bias made by the district court to support its decision to vacate and remand the variance approval. The County prevailed in the appeal from the award of fees and costs to the Eacrets. Because of the mixed result, we decline to award fees in this appeal and each party is to bear its own costs and fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b847-8\">Chief Justice TROUT and Justices SCHROEDER and EISMANN, concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b847-9\">KIDWELL, J., dissents without opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\">. The district court took judicial notice of the Board\u2019s decision on remand. The Board denied the variance application, consistent with the earlier decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Harris sought review of the Board\u2019s decision by the district court, which matter remains pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">. Idaho Code, Section 12-117 states that attorney fees, witness fees and expenses may be awarded against a county only when it is an \u201cadverse party.\u201d We note that the Board of Commissioners was sitting in its appellate capacity reviewing the administrative proceeding of the Planning and Zoning Commission and was not an \"adverse party\u201d until the case was taken to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
