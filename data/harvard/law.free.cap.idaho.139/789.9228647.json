We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b848-19\">CBC was a licensed and bonded bean warehouse pursuant to the provisions of Title 69, Chapter 2 of the Idaho Code. On April 11, 2002, the Director of the Idaho Department of Agriculture declared CBC failed for its inability to financially compensate parties who had stored commodities in its warehouse. The Department then notified parties unpaid by CBC that they should file claims with the Department for the amount they were owed. These claims were subsequently paid to claimants in the total amount of $419,116.33 by the Department according to the claims process outlined in Title 69, Chapter 2 of the Idaho Code. The Department then maintains it submitted notice of these claims and payments made to CBC as required by I.C. \u00a7 69-262(2) for comment and/or objection. As part of this notice, the Department asserts the communication included a notification to CBC that it had twenty (20) days to request a hearing contesting these claims and their valuations. CBC did not respond to the notice within the 20-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">When CBC subsequently failed to reimburse the Department for the claims paid, the Department brought this action in district court for recovery, to which CBC responded, arguing it was not responsible for the amounts paid because the Department improperly paid claims based upon a jury verdict that was then on appeal. Specifically, CBC argued that the Department determined the claim paid by the Department to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Griff, Inc. (\u201cGriff\u2019), should be in the same amount awarded to Griff by a jury, whose verdict was then on appeal at the time the Department made its valuation. CBC asserts the Department did not abide by I.C. \u00a7 69-262(2), which requires that the Department make its valuation of each claim against CBC at the time CBC was declared failed, not three months prior when the jury rendered its verdict for Griff.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The Department subsequently moved for summary judgment, which was granted on the basis that CBC was precluded from asserting its defense because it had failed to exhaust administrative remedies and had waived any right to contest the amount paid by the Department. CBC now appeals that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-8\">Summary judgment must be entered when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c). This Court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summaiy judgment is the same as that required of the district court when ruling on the motion. On review, as when the judgment is initially considered by the trial court, this Court liberally construes the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, drawing all reasonable inferences and conclusions in that party\u2019s favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-9\"><em>Friel v. Boise City Housing Authotity, </em>126 Idaho 484, 485, 887 P.2d 29, 30 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">PROOF OF NOTICE ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">An underlying issue in this case to be addressed prior to any consideration of whether the Griff claim was properly valued, is whether the Department established for purposes of summary judgment that it sent a valid and proper notice to CBC of the claims made against CBC pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 69-262(2). The Department argued on sum-maiy judgment \u2014 and the district court agreed- \u2014 that because CBC did not respond to the notice of claims paid sent by the Department to CBC, CBC is precluded from arguing about the Griff claim, because it never requested a hearing as provided by the statute. CBC argued at the summaiy judgment hearing and now on appeal, that it never received proper notice from the Department of the claims made against it, asserting that the form the Department sent regarding claims did not contain the names of any claimants or the amounts of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">Idaho Code \u00a7 69-262(2) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-17\">The department shall investigate each claim and shall notify each claimant, the warehouseman or dealer, and the advisory committee of the department\u2019s determination as to the validity and amount of each claimant\u2019s claim. A claimant or warehouseman or dealer may request a hearing on the department\u2019s determination within twenty (20) days of receipt of written notification and a hearing shall be held by the department pursuant to chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">As proof that it sent the required notice of claimants and amounts to CBC, the Department submitted the affidavit of Dennis Do-shier, Manager of the Bonded Warehouse Program of the Department, who stated that the claims that were submitted by claimants were reviewed by the Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and that, after these claims were approved, they were \u201ccommunicated to Curry Bean Co., Inc. by letter on August 4, 2000.... Pursuant to law, the claims were submitted to Curry Bean Co., Inc. for comment and/or objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-19\">CBC argues on appeal, however, that the letter it received from the Department had blanks in the portions of the letter where the claimants and claim amounts were supposed to be listed. As such, it maintains it never received proper notice from the Department pursuant to the statute and accordingly, was not required to respond to the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>On review of a grant of summary judgment, this Court \u201cliberally construes the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, drawing all inferences and conclusions in that party\u2019s favor, and if reasonable people could reach different conclusions or draw conflicting inferences then an order granting summary judgment must be reversed.\u201d <em>Zimmerman v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., </em>128 Idaho 851, 854, 920 P.2d 67, 70 (1996). However, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that upon a motion for summary judgment the non-moving party may not rely upon its pleadings, but must come forward with evidence by way of affidavit or otherwise which contradicts the evidence submitted by the moving party, and which establishes the existence of a material issue of disputed fact.\u201d <em>Zehm v. Associated Logging Contractors, Inc., </em>116 Idaho 349, 350, 775 P.2d 1191, 1192 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Although the assertions of compliance in the Doshier affidavit are conclusory, the record reveals that CBC did not present any evidence to contradict this affidavit, nor was there any objection made to the conclusory nature of the affidavit. In fact, the only time CBC made any reference to the issue of notice during the summary judgment proceedings was a few short sentences by CBC\u2019s attorney in response to a question asked by the district judge during oral argument. Accordingly, CBC has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact on summary judgment and this Court must assume from the record that CBC received the notice required by statute from the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">FAILURE TO EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Because CBC failed to respond to the Department\u2019s notice of claimants and amounts of claims, we agree with the district judge that CBC is precluded from asserting its argument on appeal that the Department incorrectly valued the amount of the Griff claim. As cited above, I.C. \u00a7 69-262(2) provides a twenty-day period in which a warehouse may request a hearing from the Department in which it may object to or comment upon the claimants and amounts of their claims. Because CBC did not respond to the Department\u2019s notice during this twenty-day period \u2014 and indeed took no action until the Department filed the present suit for indemnification \u2014 CBC failed to exhaust the administrative remedy available to it under the statute. \u201cWhere an administrative remedy is provided by statute, relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act. Absent a statutory exception, the exhaustion of an administrative remedy is a prerequisite for resort to the courts.\u201d <em>Pounds v. Denison, </em>115 Idaho 381, 384, 766 P.2d 1262, 1264 (Ct.App.1988). Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">ATTORNEY FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">The Department seeks attorney fees on appeal based on I.C. \u00a7 69-266, which states in part: \u201cThe director may bring suit on behalf of the commodity indemnity fund in the district court of Ada county to recover from the warehouseman, dealer, or surety the amount of the payment made from the commodity indemnity fund, together with costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in maintaining the suit.\u201d Because the Department has prevailed on appeal, we award it costs and attorney fees pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">CBC presented no evidence on summary judgment to counter evidence presented by the Department that proper notice was provided to CBC according to the relevant statute. Thus, CBC\u2019s failure to request a hearing before the Department is fatal to its attempts now to contest the claims paid. We, therefore, uphold the district judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Department, and award costs and attorney fees on appeal to the Department.</p>\n<judges id=\"b850-15\">Justices SCHROEDER, KIDWELL, EISMANN, and BURDICK concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
