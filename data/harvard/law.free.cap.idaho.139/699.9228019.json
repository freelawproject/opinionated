At trial, the district court determined the public owned the \u201clake access\u201d in the PHS. Plaintiff Stalsberg et al., the Appellant, seeks review of the district court\u2019s decision by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">On September 22,1960, Anna and Kenneth J. McWilliams platted an area of land titled Ponderosa Home Sites in Bonner County. The plat was recorded on January 20, 1961. The plat shows an area marked as \u201clake access.\u201d The \u201clake access\u201d is a small piece of lakeshore property located between lots 3 and 4 within PHS. The \u201clake access\u201d is \u201cL\u201d shaped with a small piece of land between lots 3 and 4 connecting with the public road and the larger portion abutting to Garfield Bay on Lake Pend Oreille south of lot 4. The legal description of the exterior boundaries of the plat includes the area marked as \u201clake access.\u201d The \u201clake access\u201d was identified on the map without block or lot designation and without mention in the dedication. The plat included the following dedication: \u201c[t]hey do hereby dedicate to the public, for the use of the public as highways the roads shown upon this plat.\u201d Neither the plat nor any contemporaneous deeds, declarations or papers indicate who is to be the owner of the \u201clake access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-18\">Ponderosa and Stalsberg et al., filed suit on June 26, 1995, citing multiple causes of action. The parties filed joint Motions for Summary Judgment. The Summary Judgments were denied in part and granted in part. The district court held a trial on October 25, 26, and 27, 1999, and addressed the single issue of ownership of the \u201clake access\u201d in the PHS. If the court determined that one of the parties owned the \u201clake access\u201d then a later trial would be required to determine the issue of damages. Neither party called any witness who was in direct privity with the McWilliams. No evidence was introduced to demonstrate how or if the McWil-liams had made any representations concerning the ownership of the \u201clake access.\u201d The district court held that neither Ponderosa and Stalsberg et al., nor Garfield et al., established their ownership of the \u201clake access.\u201d Rather, the \u201clake access\u201d was the subject of a common law dedication to the public. Stalsberg appeals the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-20\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b758-21\">Conclusions of law by a district court are subject to de novo review by this Court. <em>Doolittle v. Meridian Joint Sch. Dist., </em>128 Idaho 805, 811, 919 P.2d 334, 340 (1996); <em>see Iron Eagle Dev., L.L.C. v. Quality Design </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>Sys., Inc., </em>138 Idaho 487, 491, 65 P.3d 509, 513 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The Trial Court Erred In Holding As A Matter Of Law That The Public Owned The \u201cLake Access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The district court held \u201c[t]he \u2018lake access\u2019 was the subject of a common law dedication to the public.\u201d A \u201c[dedication is essentially the setting aside of real property for the use or ownership of others. Idaho recognizes common law dedication of land both for public, as well as for private use.\u201d <em>Sun Valley Land And Minerals, Inc. v. Hawkes, </em>138 Idaho 543, 548, 66 P.3d 798, 803 (2003). Public dedications are accomplished either statutorily or by the common law. <em>Worley Highway Dist. v. Yacht Club of Coeur d\u2019 Alene, </em>116 Idaho 219, 222, 775 P.2d 111, 114 (1989). Common law dedications to the public must satisfy a two-part test. <em>See Sun Valley Land And Minerals, Inc., </em>66 P.3d at 803. \u201cThe elements of a common law dedication are (1) an offer by the owner clearly and unequivocally indicating an intent to dedicate the land and (2) an acceptance of the offer.\u201d <em>Id; Pullin v. Victor, </em>103 Idaho 879, 881, 655 P.2d 86, 88 (Ct.App.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">\u201cThe offer to dedicate may be made in a number of ways, including the act of recording or filing a subdivision plat depicting the specific areas subject to dedication, so long as there is a clear and unequivocal indication the owner intends to dedicate.\u201d <em>See Sun Valley Land And Minerals, Inc., </em>66 P.3d at 803. In determining the intent to dedicate, \u201cthe court must examine the plat, as well as \u2018the surrounding circumstances and conditions of the development and sale of lots.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Dunham v. Hackney Airpark, Inc., </em>133 Idaho 613, 616, 990 P.2d 1224, 1226 (Ct.App.1999)). It is clear that the McWilliams, the original owners of the platted property, intended to \u201cdedicate to the public, for the use of the public as highways the roads shown upon this plat.\u201d However, there is no explicit dedication for the \u201clake access.\u201d As the district court found, \u201c[n]either the plat nor any contemporaneous deeds, declarations or papers indicate who is to be the owner of the \u2018Lake Access.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The area is depicted on the plat as \u201clake access\u201d with no other clues as to intent or ownership. As another jurisdiction observed, \u201c[t]he mere leaving of a blank upon the plat without any designation of its purpose cannot be held sufficient proof of an intention of the owner to dedicate the premises represented by such blank or undesignated space to public use.\u201d <em>Poole v. City of Lake Forest, </em>238 Ill. 305, 87 N.E. 320, 322 (1909). However, the subject area in this case was not left blank; rather, it was denoted as \u201clake access,\u201d providing additional evidence of the lack of intent to dedicate to the public. Upon examination of the district court\u2019s findings of fact, the district court seems to conclude that a common law public dedication occurred because of insufficient evidence of private ownership; therefore, the court concluded \u201c[i]t is more probable than not that the McWilliams intended the \u2018Lake Access\u2019 to be a common law dedication to the public.\u201d In other words, the district court decision suggests that a public common law dedication was the default conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The case at bar parallels the facts of <em>Deffenbaugh v. Washington Water Power Co., </em>24 Idaho 514, 135 P. 247 (1913). In <em>Deffen-baugh, </em>one of the issues this Court decided was whether beach lands were dedicated to the public. <em>Id. </em>at 518, 135 P. at 248. The Respondent in <em>Dejfenbaugh </em>platted her property and dedicated to the public the streets and avenues that were shown on the plat. <em>Id. </em>However, the land between the lots and the water line were designated as \u201cbeach,\u201d and at another location as \u201csand beach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court held \u201c[t]he dedication did not include the water front or beach, and the plat does not in any way indicate that it is dedicated to the public, or that it was intended as a dedication in the same sense in which streets, alleys, and avenues are dedicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court went on to state there was no evidence of intent by the owner of the property to dedicate the land to the public, but instead, the owner intended \u201cto grant a perpetual easement in this beach to the purchas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ers of lots...as a special inducement to prospective purchasers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">This case parallels <em>Deffenbaugh </em>because the plat created by the McWilliams included a dedication \u201cto the public, for the -use of the public as highways the roads shown upon this plat.\u201d Furthermore, the disputed area was listed as \u201clake access,\u201d which is similar to the listing of \u201cbeach\u201d and \u201csand beach\u201d in <em>Deffenbaugh. </em>As the district court concluded, no other evidence suggests ownership of the \u201cbeaeh access.\u201d The \u201cbeach access\u201d is not a road or highway; therefore, the PHS plat dedication to the public seems inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Without analysis, the district court cites to <em>Smylie v. Pearsall, </em>93 Idaho 188, 457 P.2d 427 (1969), which held that an open space on a plat was dedicated to the public. However, <em>Smylie </em>has factual dissimilarities to the case at bar. In <em>Smylie, </em>there is a platted road which connects to a driveway; \u201c[t]he northwest corner of \u2018driveway\u2019 is not closed off but rather opens toward the lake and small apron of land which is here in dispute. It appears that this parcel was intended as continuation of the driveway providing natural access to the lake...[therefore,] the overall tenor of the plat shows an intention on the part of the Palmers to dedicate the disputed area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 457 P.2d at 431. However, the \u201clake access\u201d of this case is not a continuation of the road which was dedicated by the McWilliams to the public. The district court, in its findings of fact, found the \u201clake access\u201d was \u201cconnected to and not distinguished from the area marked as a public road.\u201d However, the PHS map shows otherwise; the \u201clake access\u201d is an L-shaped piece of land which perpendicularly intersects the road at the property\u2019s narrowest point. In other words, the \u201clake access\u201d intersects the public road in the same manner as all the other lots of the PHS. Because the \u201clake access\u201d is not a continuation of the dedicated public road, the <em>Smylie </em>holding does not control.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Some courts have failed to distinguish between public and homeowner association ownership. This Court, in <em>Smylie, </em>relied upon <em>Cassell v. Reeves, </em>265 S.W.2d 801 (Ky.1954). In Cassell, it was \u201cheld that all the streets, alleys, parks or other open spaces delineated on such map or plan have been dedicated to the use of the purchasers of the lots and those claiming under them as well as of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802. In other words, dedicating the use of the open land to the lot owners includes dedication to the public. Giving access and ownership of the \u201clake access\u201d to Ponderosa and Stalsberg is not the same as giving those rights to the public. If the \u201clake access\u201d was dedicated to the public, Ponderosa and Stalsberg would also have access, but this fact defeats Ponderosa\u2019s and Stalsberg\u2019s purpose. Presumably, Pondero-sa and Stalsberg purchased lots with the understanding that they could use the \u201clake access.\u201d If the district court finds the McWilliams intended to give Ponderosa and Stalsberg the \u201clake access\u201d as an incentive to purchase PHS lots, then Ponderosa and Stalsberg, and not the public, should be the owner. Stated another way, upon remand, the district court can decide that Ponderosa and Stalsberg privately own the \u201clake access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Additionally, the Court in <em>Cassell </em>said that leaving a blank space on a plat does not necessarily mean that \u00e1 public dedication has occurred; nevertheless, special conditions could show otherwise. <em>Id. </em>at 803. In dicta, the Court continued, \u201c[s]uch special condition is leaving an unmarked space or strip between a street shown on the plat and a navigable river.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201clake access\u201d of this case is between a public street and a navigable waterway, being Garfield Bay on Pend Oreille Lake; but, the \u201clake access\u201d is a marked space on the plat. Therefore, the dicta of <em>Cassell </em>does not apply to this ease because the \u201clake access\u201d is marked on the plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">Because of the lack of evidence of ownership, as found by the district court, and the lack of intent to dedicate to the public, this Court vacates the district court and follows this Court\u2019s previous decision in <em>Deffenbaugh </em>insofar as holding that the \u201clake access\u201d was not dedicated to the public, and remands the case to the district court to determine ownership of the \u201clake access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">This Court holds the two-part test for common law dedications- to the public has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>been satisfied, and the case is remanded to the district court. The first element of the test, which requires an offer by the owner clearly and unequivocally indicating an intent to dedicate the land, is not satisfied. There is a lack of evidence of ownership, as found by the district comb, and a lack of intent to dedicate to the public. Therefore, we vacate the district comb and follow our previous decision in <em>Deffenbaugh </em>insofar as holding that the \u201cbeach access\u201d was not dedicated to the public, and we remand the case to the district court to determine ownership of the \u201cbeach access.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-4\">Chief Justice TROUT and Justices SCHROEDER and EISMANN, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b761-5\">Justice BURDICK,</author>\n<p id=\"Aav\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion and would affirm Judge Judd\u2019s original finding after a court trial in this case. The reason for the dissent can be found in the plat dedication signed by Mr. And Mrs. McWilliams wherein it says in applicable part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that we, K.J. McWilliams and Anna M. McWilliams, his wife, have caused to be laid off and platted into lots, block, and roads the land shown upon this plat to [sic] known as \u201cPONDEROSA HOME SITES.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4g\">This shows a specific intent to divide the entire land known as Ponderosa Homesites into three basic legal definitions of lots, blocks, and roads. The McWilliams additionally \u201cdedicate to the public, for the use of the public as highways the roads shown upon this plat. The lakeshore lots include shore-land and riparian rights.\u201d I have included as Exhibit A to this dissent the final plat of Ponderosa Homesites. In that plat it is plain to see that a service road is at the top of the plat. It is noted that all other lots are totally inscribed by lot lines except for a \u201clake access.\u201d Lot 4 is an enclosed lot that does not go all the way to the shoreline as lots 1, 2 and 3 do; however, it abuts the lake inlet in its southeastern portion. This shows a specific intent that the lake access is a part of the service road because it shows no intersecting lines at the beginning of the \u201clake access\u201d and, in addition, Lot 4 is stopped short of lots 1, 2 and 3 so that there can be a large lake access area. I believe that this shows an intent that \u201clake access\u201d as noted on the final plat of the Ponderosa Homesites means that it is part of the \u201croads\u201d dedicated to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">The majority tries to distinguish the case of <em>Smylie v. Pearsall, </em>93 Idaho 188, 457 P.2d 427 (1969) from the facts of this case and I respectfully disagree. I have enclosed as Exhibit B to this dissent the Exhibit No. 1 from the <em>Smylie </em>case found at 93 Idaho at 189, 457 P.2d at 428. As can be seen in that case the open roadway above lots 12 and 11 is entitled \u201cdriveway.\u201d That denotes an even more private or personal use than \u201clake access\u201d in the case before the Court at this time. However, the Idaho State Supreme Court found in a unanimous decision that it was clear\u2019 that the intent of the landowner was to make the \u201cdriveway\u201d a public access. Again, <em>Smylie </em>depends upon <em>Cassell v. Reeves, </em>265 S.W.2d 801 (Ky.1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">The Idaho Supreme Court quotes <em>Cassell </em>at 93 Idaho at 191, 457 P.2d at 430 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV2\">And, nothing else appearing, it is held that all the streets, alleys, parks or other open spaces delineated on such map or plat have been dedicated to the use of the purchasers of the lots and those claiming under them as well as of the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">In fact, the Comb in <em>Smylie </em>found the purpose for the \u201cdriveway\u201d was land access to lots 8-12. 93 Idaho at 192, 457 P.2d at 431 (See Exhibit B.) The Court in <em>Smylie </em>distinguishes <em>Deffenbaugh v. Washington Water Power Co., </em>24 Idaho 514, 135 P. 247 (1913) as this Court should do also.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-14\">In the Deffenbaugh case, the plat showed certain streets and avenues as well as an area designated as \u201cbeach\u201d or \u201csandy beach\u201d along La Deleardo Bay, an arm of Lake Coeur d\u2019Alene. There the owner filed for record not only the plat but a written dedication of the streets and avenues which the plat indicated. This dedication did not include the beach area. Thus, apparently on the theory of expression unius est exclusion alterius, the court found no intention to dedicate the beach area. A written dedication of some portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>of the plat is not an element in the case at bar. The original owner\u2019s intention can be inferred only from the plat itself. In one respect, the reasoning in the Deffenbaugh ease may support the result we reach here, for the court there went on to declare that it was the owner\u2019s intention \u201cto grant a perpetual easement in this beach to the purchasers of lots (in that development).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aab\">93 Idaho at 193, 457 P.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In <em>Deffenbaugh </em>the Idaho Supreme Court was looking at a difference in language on the plat and on the attached dedication. The plat had the land between the lot line and water line as \u201cbeach\u201d or \u201csandy beach\u201d while the dedication attached to the plat said nothing about this area. \u201cThus, apparently on the theory of <em>expression unius est exclusion alterius </em>the court found no intention to dedicate the beach area.\u201d 93 Idaho at 193, 457 P.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">This Court should distinguish <em>Deffen-baugh, </em>rely on <em>Smylie, </em>and hold there was an intent shown from the plat to make the \u201clake access\u201d open to the public and thus affirm the trial court who made this original finding of fact as to the McWilliams\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>EXHIBIT A</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>EXHIBIT B</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
