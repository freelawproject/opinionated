The motion sought to allow expert witness testimony concerning the results of his polygraph test. The district court found that the testimony would be admissible so long as Perry took the stand. This Court reverses the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-17\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b579-18\">Craig Perry was charged with second-degree murder of his uncle. Perry retained Dr. Charles Honts to administer a polygraph test. During the polygraph examination, Perry denied shooting the victim or arranging for his death, and testified that, as far as Perry knew, the victim shot himself. Dr. Honts rendered an opinion that Perry was truthful when making these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-19\">Perry filed a motion in limine seeking to allow the testimony of Dr. Honts. Perry claims that the expert\u2019s testimony is not being presented to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but to prove the truth of the involuntary physical responses. The State asserts that the expert\u2019s testimony will improperly vouch for the credibility of the witness and the testimony is inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-20\">Following an extensive <em>Daubert </em>hearing, the district court found that the testimony of the expert witness would be admissible. However, the district court conditioned the admission of the results of the examination on Peny testifying in his own defense. A copy of the video of the test and the data supporting Dr. Honts\u2019 opinion was given to the State. The State moved for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, which the district court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-21\">The issue presented in this appeal is whether the district court erred in concluding that the testimony regarding the results of defendant\u2019s polygraph examination is admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-22\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b579-23\">The district coui\u2019t has broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence, and its decision to admit such evidence will be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of that discretion. <em>State v. Howard, </em>135 Idaho 727, 731, 24 P.3d 44, 48 (2001). \u201cThe district court\u2019s determination that a witness is qualified as an expert is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>discretionary.\u201d <em>West v. Sonke, </em>132 Idaho 133, 138, 968 P.2d 228, 233 (1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">When an exercise of discretion is reviewed on appeal, the Court inquires: (1) whether the lower court rightly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the court acted within the boundaries of such discretion and consistently with any legal standards applicable to specific choices; and (3) whether the court reached its decision by exercise of reason. <em>Swallow v. Emergency Medicine of Idaho, P.A. </em>138 Idaho 589, 592, 67 P.3d 68, 71 (2003) (citing <em>State v. Merwin, </em>131 Idaho 642, 962 P.2d 1026 (1998); <em>Sun Valley Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. Idaho Power Co., </em>119 Idaho 87, 94, 803 P.2d 993, 1000 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The State contends that Dr. Honts\u2019 testimony should not be admitted because it would improperly vouch for the credibility of Perry. The State argues that this vouching usurps the jury\u2019s fact finding and its role in assessing the credibility of the witnesses. The State further asserts that Perry did not establish the scientific reliability of Dr. Honts\u2019 testimony under I.R.E. 702 and that Dr. Honts\u2019 testimony is inadmissible hearsay and should not be allowed under I.R.E. 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Perry contends that Dr. Honts\u2019 testimony meets the test prescribed by <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Perry argues that the record shows that the scientific community generally accepts polygraph testing and the reliability of polygraph testing. Perry contends that Dr. Honts\u2019 testimony does not usurp the fact-finding role of the jury. Further, Perry argues that there are numerous circumstances where experts opine on issues to be decided by the trier of fact and that judges are empowered to sort out spurious attempts to mislead juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">In addition, Perry argues that the polygraph test results are not hearsay because the results are not being offered to prove that he did not shoot his uncle because he said he did not, but rather are being offered to prove that his body\u2019s physiological response indicates that he is telling the truth when making that statement (i.e., to prove the truth by involuntary physical response). By requiring Perry to take the stand prior to the results being allowed, Perry asserts that the State will have a full opportunity to cross-examine him concerning the reactions recorded at the time of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">The district court has broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence and its decision to admit such evidence will be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of that discretion. <em>State v. Howard, </em>135 Idaho 727, 731, 24 P.3d 44, 48 (2001). It is clear that the district court perceived the issue as one of discretion. The second prong of the abuse of discretion test requires this Court to determine whether the court acted within the boundaries of such discretion and consistently with any legal standards applicable to specific choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">Idaho Rule of Evidence 702 provides in regard to expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">If'scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">The parties do not object that Dr. Honts is a qualified 'expert in the field of polygraph testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">The inquiry under I.R.E. 702 is whether the expert will testify to scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, \u201cnot whether the information upon which the expert\u2019s opinion is based is commonly agreed upon.\u201d <em>State v. Merwin, </em>131 Idaho 642, 646, 962 P.2d 1026, 1030 (1998). \u201cThis entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. at 2796, 125 L.Ed.2d at 482. This Court in <em>State v. Trevino, </em>132 Idaho 888, 893-94, 980 P.2d 552, 557-58 (1999), held with regard to scientific evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>In <em>Daubert, </em>the Supreme Court held that the \u201cgeneral acceptance in the scientific community\u201d standard for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence had been replaced by the Federal Rules of Evidence, in particular F.R.E. 702. The <em>Daubert </em>court held that pursuant to Rule 702, the trial judge is assigned the task of ensuring that an expert\u2019s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand. <em>Daubert, </em>at 598-99, 113 S.Ct. at 2799, 125 L.Ed.2d at 485-86. In other words, for scientific evidence to be admitted, <em>it must be supported by appropriate validation, establishing a standard of evidentiary reliability, and must assist the trier of fact to understand, the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. Id. </em>at 590-91, 113 S.Ct. at 2795, 125 L.Ed.2d at 480-81. The decision to admit or deny the evidence, therefore, is within the discretion of the trial judge in individual jurisdictions which may reasonably reach differing conclusions as to whether polygraph evidence should be admitted. <em>See United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 310, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 1265, 140 L.Ed.2d 413, 419 (1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">This Court has previously held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">As a general rule, results of polygraph examinations are inadmissible absent a stipulation by both parties. Where stipulated polygraph results may be admitted, the defendant\u2019s participation in the examination must be free and voluntary. The trial court has discretion to exclude evidence if it finds that an examiner was not qualified or that the conditions under which the test was administered were unfair. The opposing party must be permitted to cross-examine the examiner as to his or her expertise, the reliability of polygraph examinations, the accuracy of the apparatus used, and all other points reflecting on the accuracy of the polygraph both in general, and in the particular case. Also, the jury must be instructed that the examiner\u2019s testimony as to the results of the test is not conclusive, but is to be taken only as an expert opinion....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">Moreover, the courts of many other states have held that results of polygraph examinations are not admissible in a criminal trial, regardless of whether the polygraph testimony is exculpatory....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">The foregoing authorities reflect the prevailing judicial view that the physiological and psychological bases for the polygraph examination have not been sufficiently established to assure the validity or reliability of test results. While scientific developments may one day refine the polygraph examination so that the results of the test may more frequently merit admission into evidence, we will not now overturn the trial court\u2019s exclusion of such results absent a stipulation by both parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\"><em>State v. Fain, </em>116 Idaho 82, 86-87, 774 P.2d 252, 256-57 (1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">A defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present evidence is fundamental; however, this right is subject to reasonable limitations. <em>U.S. v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413, 418 (1998); <em>see also Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 294, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1045, 35 L.Ed.2d 297, 308 (1973). The exclusion of evidence does not impair the defendant\u2019s right \u201cto present a defense so long as they are not \u2018arbitrary\u2019 or \u2018disproportionate to the purposes they serve.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 308, 118 S.Ct. at 1264, 140 L.Ed.2d at 418 (quoting <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 55, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 2711, 97 L.Ed.2d 37, 48 (1987)). The exclusion is \u201cunconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only where it has infringed upon a weighty interest of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With the exercise of the defendant\u2019s right to present evidence, the rules of procedure and evidence must be complied with to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt or innocence. <em>Chambers, 410 U.S. </em>at 302, 93 S.Ct. at 1049, 35 L.Ed.2d at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">The United States Supreme Court upheld the <em>per se </em>exclusion of polygraph results in military trials in <em>U.S. v. Scheffer. </em>523 U.S. at 316-17, 118 S.Ct. at 1268-69, 140 L.Ed.2d at 423. The Court held that exclusion of the expert testimony regarding the polygraph results did not abridge the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense because it did not impli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>cate any significant interest of the accused. <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that the fact-finders were able to hear all of the relevant details of the charges from the perspective of the accused and did not preclude the accused from introducing any factual evidence; the exclusion merely barred the introduction of expert opinion testimony that bolstered the accused\u2019s credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 316-17, 118 S.Ct. at 1268-69, 140 L.Ed.2d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">In this case, the district court initially stated the first issue to be considered \u201cis the fundamental right of an accused to present a defense. And I think that if there is \u2014 if it\u2019s a fairly close question I think the Constitution requires that he \u2014 that an accused to be entitled to use it. The question is, is it close.\u201d Later the district court stated \u201cwhat I have to look at is, I think, based on <em>Daubert </em>and \u2014 and <em>Konechny </em>[134 Idaho 410, 419, 3 P.3d 535, 544 (Ct.App.2000)] is, you know, what is the state of the science.\u201d Finally, the district court stated \u201cthe ultimate question that I have to decide is will it assist the jury in deciding what weight to give the evidence and \u2014 and that\u2019s permissible if it meets the scientific standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In its opinion, the district court discussed the list of factors in <em>Daubert, </em>which include \u201cwhether the theory or technique in question can be tested, whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication, its known or potential error rate, the existence and maintenance of standards governing its use, and whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within its relevant community.\u201d <em>State v. Parkinson, </em>128 Idaho 29, 34, 909 P.2d 647, 654 (Ct.App.1996) (citing <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-95, 113 S.Ct. at 2795-97, 125 L.Ed.2d at 482-84).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The district court found' that whether Perry\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense was violated was a \u201cclose call\u201d but that it would be infringed upon if the polygraph results were not admitted. In discussing the reliability of the polygraph test, the district court noted that it had relied upon a National Academy of Sciences\u2019 article that essentially reported \u201cwhen we\u2019re dealing about a specific instance as to whether or not the lie detector test is reliable, that it is significantly greater than chance and significantly less than conclusive.\u201d The district court found that it would give diminished weight to the conclusions of Dr. Iacono, another expert in the area of polygraph testing, because much of his scientific data had not been subjected to peer review. The district court then stated that another significant factor in finding reliability is \u201cthere are validity tests that have been done both by lab and on the field. Those have been peer reviewed with statistical analysis with peer review and publication in high quality journals with 80 percent....\u201d The district court also noted with regard to the validity testing of polygraphs that \u201cthe rate of error is based upon- \u2014 based on Dr. Honts\u2019 testimony is 5 percent.\u201d Further, the district court found that \u201c[t]he surveys indicate to me a general scientific acceptance.\u201d The district court determined it would allow Dr. Honts\u2019 testimony on the polygraph results. However, the district court conditioned the admission on Perry taking the stand and required a copy of the video of the test and data results be provided to the' State by the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The National Academy of Sciences\u2019 article relied upon by the district court only shows the reliability of polygraph tests as significantly greater than chance but significantly less than conclusive. This does not appear to support a conclusion of reliability; rather, it shows that the test <em>might be </em>reliable. As to the surveys showing a general scientific acceptance, the record reflects that other scientific surveys demonstrate reliability rates anywhere from 47 to 95 percent. With such a great variance, it is hard to discern whether the scientific community accepts the polygraph test or not. While these articles and surveys were used to support the district court\u2019s decision, they also tend to cast doubt on whether the reliability of the polygraph tests has been refined to the point \u201cthat the results of the test may more frequently merit admission into evidence.\u201d <em>Fain, </em>116 Idaho at 87, 774 P.2d at 257. Even if there is sufficient evidence to find that the polygraph- testing is supported by appropriate validation in this case, there was no showing by the district court of how this polygraph opinion would assist the trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>fact to understand evidence or determine a fact in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Perry asserts that the polygraph results will be offei\u2019ed at trial to prove only the truth of his statements by his body\u2019s involuntary physiological responses. Although jurors will need to determine whether they believe Perry\u2019s testimony as to the details of the death of his uncle, Perry\u2019s physiological responses to a polygraph test are not facts at issue. Further, the responses will not assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence; rather, the evidence of the responses merely would re-present testimony presumably already testified to by Perry and attempt to bolster his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">\u201cIn general, expert testimony which does nothing but vouch for the credibility of another witness encroaches upon the jury\u2019s vital and exclusive function to make credibility determinations, and therefore does not \u2018assist the trier of fact\u2019 as required by Rule 702.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Charley, </em>189 F.3d 1251, 1267 (10th Cir.1999); <em>see also Washington v. Schriver, </em>240 F.3d 101, 113 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Goodwin v. MTD Products Inc., </em>232 F.3d 600, 609 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Idaho courts have routinely held that \u201can expert\u2019s opinion, in a proper ease, is admissible up to the point where an expression of opinion would require the expert to pass upon the credibility of witnesses or the weight of disputed evidence. To venture beyond that point, however, is to usurp the jury\u2019s function.\u201d <em>State v. Hester, </em>114 Idaho 688, 696, 760 P.2d 27, 35 (1988); <em>see also State v. Konechny, </em>134 Idaho 410, 419, 3 P.3d 535, 544 (Ct.App.2000). \u201cIt is the jury\u2019s function to assess the demeanor of the witnesses and make a determination of credibility. _ This Court will not second-guess the jury\u2019s determination on credibility or the weight to be given to witnesses\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>129 Idaho 556, 558, 929 P.2d 118, 120 (1996). \u201c[Statements by a witness as to whether another witness is telling the truth are prohibited.\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>123 Idaho 880, 885, 853 P.2d 625, 630 (Ct.App.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">In this case, the results of the polygraph are useful to bolster Perry\u2019s credibility but do not provide the trier of fact with any additional information that pertains to Perry\u2019s case. The fact of whether the alleged act occurred is for the jury to decide. <em>Charley, </em>189 F.3d at 1270. Additionally, credibility questions are left to the trier of fact, in this case a jury. <em>See Goodwin, 232 </em>F.3d at 609. The polygraph results in this case do not help the trier of fact to find facts or to understand the evidence as required by I.R.E. 702. To admit these results is an attempt to substitute the credibility determination appropriate for the jury, with Dr. Honts\u2019 interpretation of the alleged involuntary physiological results from the polygraph examination. Dr. Honts usurps the role of the jury as the ultimate finder of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Therefore, this Court holds Dr. Honts\u2019 testimony as well as the polygraph results, inadmissible and reverses the decision of the district court. Perry\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense will not be infringed upon by this Court\u2019s holding. Perry will be able to present all of the relevant details of the charge from his perspective and will not be precluded from introducing factual evidence; the exclusion merely bars the introduction of expert opinion testimony that would bolster Perry\u2019s credibility. <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 316-17, 118 S.Ct. at 1268-69, 140 L.Ed.2d at 413; <em>State v. Hester, </em>114 Idaho 688, 696, 760 P.2d 27, 35 (1988); <em>State v. Allen, </em>129 Idaho 556, 558, 929 P.2d 118, 120 (1996); <em>State v. Konechny, </em>134 Idaho 410, 419, 3 P.3d 535, 544 (Ct.App.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">In ruling that polygraph evidence is inadmissible to vouch for the credibility of a witness at trial, this Court notes that polygraph evidence may be admissible in instances where the parties stipulate to the admission of the evidence, <em>State v. Fain, </em>116 Idaho 82, 774 P.2d 252 (1989), in probation revocation hearings, <em>State v. Travis, </em>125 Idaho 1, 867 P.2d 234 (1994), and in other informal hearings where the rules of evidence do not apply, <em>In re X, </em>110 Idaho 44, 47-48, 714 P.2d 13, 16-17 (1986), at the discretion of the trial court or presiding official. This opinion does not touch on the efficacy of the polygraph tests in other contexts or uses, except as to jury and court trials conducted in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Given the above holding, the remaining issue regarding I.R.E. 801 raised by the State need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">This Court holds that Dr. Honts\u2019 testimony regarding Perry\u2019s polygraph results is inadmissible because it does not assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. It is also inadmissible as it violates the province of the fact-finder to assess the credibility of the witnesses in a state court proceeding. The ruling on the motion in limine by the district court is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b584-6\">Justices SCHROEDER, KIDWELL, EISMANN and Justice Pro Tem WALTERS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
