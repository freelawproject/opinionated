In Count I of the complaint, plaintiff alleges that the government\u2019s termination of plaintiffs contract to supply diabetic supplies to Medicare recipients effected a breach of contract. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-23, ECF No. 1. In Count II of the complaint, plaintiff makes a further claim for breach of contract that arises out of a denial of payment after a routine audit in which defendant disallowed certain sales plaintiff made to Medicare recipients. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 24-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The case was transferred to the undersigned on October 29, 2013. ECF No. 18. On October 17, 2013, defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC). Def.\u2019s Mot., ECF No. 16. Plaintiff filed its opposition on February 19, 2014. Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n, ECF No. 24. Defendant filed a reply on March 4, 2014. Def.\u2019s Reply, ECF No. 25. Oral argument was neither requested by the parties nor deemed necessary by the court. ECF No. 26. Defendant\u2019s motion is ripe for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">For the reasons explained below, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED as to Count I, and GRANTED as to Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">I. Count I\u2014Breach of Contract Under Competitive Bidding</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">The facts pertaining to the contract termination alleged in Count I are identical to those in the matter of <em>Cardiosom, L.L.C. v. United States, </em>115 Fed.Cl. 761 (2014). In <em>Cardiosom, </em>the government presented the same argument for dismissal that it now offers here. Defendant acknowledges as much in its motion. Def.\u2019s Mot. 7 (stating that \u201cthe facts and issues in <em>Cardiosom [v. United States, </em>No. 08-533], are very similar to those in this case, and because the [Federal Circuit decision, <em>Cardiosom, L.L.C. v. United States, </em>656 F.3d 1322 (Fed.Cir.2011) ] is binding precedent on this Court, we address the decision in some depth here.\u201d). Based on the factual congruity between the <em>Cardiosom </em>case and this one, the court draws heavily from its April 30, 2014 <em>Cardiosom </em>opinion in its analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">The facts of this ease are not in dispute. A detailed recitation of the facts relating to both contract formation and termination was set forth in the previous decisions of both the Federal Circuit and this court. <em>See Cardiosom, </em>656 F.3d at 1324-25, <em>rev\u2019g </em>91 Fed.Cl. 659 (2010); <em>Cardiosom, L.L.C. v. United States, </em>91 Fed.Cl. 659, 660-62 (2010), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>656 F.3d 1322 (Fed.Cir.2011). Here the court provides an abbreviated summary of the facts particular to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b687-16\">B &amp; H Medical, LLC (plaintiff or B &amp; H) contracted with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) of the Department of Health &amp; Human Services (defendant or HHS) to provide diabetic supplies in nine different metropolitan areas. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6. The contract became effective on July 1, 2008. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-17\">On July 15, 2008, Congress passed legislation terminating all contracts, including plaintiffs, that had been issued under what was known as Round 1 of HHS\u2019s plan to redefine the way in which it purchased durable medical equipment through the Medicare program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-3. Section 1395w-3, which is alternately known as Section 154 of the 2008 Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) or the 2008 Amendment, included a provision withdrawing the right to administrative or judicial review \u201cwith regard to the termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>nation.\u201d \u00a7 1395w-3(a)(l)(D)(i) (judicial review withholding provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">HHS then promulgated a regulation in which it established an administrative process through which it would pay specified damages to terminated suppliers. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.425. The regulation provided that CMS would make the determination regarding which of the claimed damages were compensable, and provided that CMS\u2019s \u201cdetermination [would be] final and not subject to administrative or judicial review.\u201d \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi). The requisite notice and a public comment period preceded the promulgation of the regulation. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 4 (citing 74 Fed.Reg. 61,738-01 (Nov. 25, 2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">B &amp; H submitted a damages claim through the CMS administrative process in February 2010, and at the request of CMS, provided supplemental information in June 2010. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. CMS offered B &amp; H partial payment on its claim in April 2012, <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 20, which B &amp; H declined to accept on the basis of its inadequacy, PL\u2019s Opp\u2019n 2, ECF No. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In August 2011, the Federal Circuit issued a ruling in the <em>Cardiosom </em>matter, holding that \u00a7 1395w-3 \u201cdid not withdraw traditional contract jurisdiction under the Tucker Act [and determining that] plaintiff states a claim over which the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Cardiosom, </em>656 F.3d at 1324. The Federal Circuit elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">[a]s we read it, the 2008 Amendment left open the question of the consequences of Congress\u2019s chosen route, and any private remedies arising therefrom. <em>More specifically, the amendment left untrammeled the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims to hear and decide breach of contract claims resulting from these terminations. </em>Whatever may be the rule regarding nonreviewability of the act of termination, or the absence of challenge to the administrative remedy authorized, <em>the legal consequences of the terminations can still be determined under existing federal law governing contract disputes with the Government.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\"><em>Cardiosom, </em>656 F.3d at 1330 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">The Federal Circuit also observed that the meaning of the judicial review withholding provision in \u00a7 1395w-3 was susceptible to at least three meanings, any of which was consistent with Congress\u2019s apparent purpose. <em>See id. </em>at 1327-29. First,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">Congress could have intended that the statute not be read to provide an \u2018independent cause of action or right to administrative or judicial review with regard to the termination,\u2019 with respect to the structure of the administrative compensation mechanism established by the Secretary, or perhaps even to the rewards from the special fund created by the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1328. Second, a \u201csomewhat different but equally plausible, interpretation of the judicial review withholding provision is that there is to be no independent judicial review of Congress\u2019s <em>decision to terminate </em>the existing contracts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. And third, a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\">possible reading of the statutory language is that it is intended to prevent judicial or administrative review by third parties. That is, [the term] \u2018independent\u2019 [ as it appears] in the statute could be interpreted to mean \u2018independent of the contracting parties,\u2019 precluding litigation over collateral damages arising out of the terminations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">Finally, the Federal Circuit observed that \u201cthere are questions with regard to the interaction of this administrative process with the established judicial process for resolving Government contract disputes under the Tucker Act,\u201d and that it was not clear \u201cwhether an aggrieved supplier who obtains only a partial recovery of damages through the administrative process ... could thereafter maintain a court suit for other damage elements,\u201d leaving the resolution of this question to the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-15\">The statutory language at issue is set forth in its entirety below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-16\">(D) Changes in competitive acquisition programs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-17\">(i) Round 1 of competitive acquisition program</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>(I) the contracts awarded under this section before July 15, 2008, are terminated, no payment shall be made under this sub-chapter on or after July 15, 2008, based on such a contract, and, <em>to the extent that any damages may be applicable as a result of the termination of such contracts, </em>such damages shall be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 1395t of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">(IV) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">\n<em>Nothing in subclause (I) shall be construed to provide an independent cause of action or right to administrative or judicial review with regard to the termination provided under such subclause.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\u00a7 1395w-3(a)(l)(D)(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">HHS established an administrative process through which aggrieved suppliers could submit damages claims, and the agency interpreted the judicial review withholding provision to mean that the \u201cDetermining Authority\u2019s determination is final and not subject to administrative or judicial review.\u201d \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi). The Determining Authority in that administrative process is CMS. \u00a7 414.425(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Defendant now moves for dismissal of Count I of B &amp; H\u2019s complaint for both lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">B. Defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Defendant acknowledges that the Federal Circuit has held that this court has jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim asserted here. But defendant argues that such jurisdiction does not extend to the claim of a supplier to whom CMS offered partial payment through its administrative process, such as CMS offered to B &amp; H.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">[Although the <em>Cardiosom </em>court held that the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to review a breach of contract claim, the limits of that jurisdiction remain undefined. Specifically left unanswered\u2014and very relevant to B &amp; H\u2019s claim in this case\u2014was whether a ... supplier whose contract was terminated may seek damages beyond those awarded as a result of the CMS administrative process established in 42 C.F.R.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-13\">\u00a7 414.425. <em>[Cardiosom, </em>656 F.3d] at 1329. In fact, the Court of Appeals suggested that such a suit cannot be maintained. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cLess clear is whether an aggrieved supplier who obtains only a partial recovery of damages through the administrative process ... could thereafter maintain a court suit for other damage elements, such as loss of profits____\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">Def.\u2019s Mot. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">Defendant argues that given the ambiguity identified by the Federal Circuit in the judicial review withholding provision, as evidenced by the three possible meanings described by the circuit court, this court must review the implementing regulation, \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi), with <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>See id. </em>at 10-13 (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). Defendant contends that because the regulation \u201cis clear on its face in barring any judicial review, this Court must find that it lacks jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. Defendant urges that a correct application of <em>Chevron </em>deference compels the court to find that the agency\u2019s determination is final and that the court \u201chas no authority to review the damages award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Defendant asserts that the court \u201cshould, therefore, dismiss Count I of B &amp; H\u2019s complaint.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">For the reasons explained below, the court finds that the judicial review withholding provision upon which defendant relies, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi), is not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference. As previously held by the Federal Circuit, this court has jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs claim. <em>See Cardiosom, </em>656 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">Pursuant to the Tucker Act, this court has limited jurisdiction to hear \u201cany claim against the United States founded ... upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a) (2012). The Tucker Act serves as a waiver of sovereign immunity and a juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>(fictional grant, but it does not create a substantive cause of action. <em>Jan\u2019s Helicopter Serv., Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>525 F.3d 1299, 1306 (Fed.Cir.2008). A plaintiff, therefore, must satisfy the court that \u201ca separate source of substantive law ... creates the right to money damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">\u201c[I]n the area of government contracts ... there is a presumption in the civil context that a damages remedy will be available upon the breach of an agreement.\u201d <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed.Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 885, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996) (plurality opinion) (noting that \u201cdamages are always the default remedy for breach of contract\u201d). This presumption provides a money-mandating source.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">If subject matter jurisdiction is challenged, plaintiff must establish the court\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Reynolds v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. </em>Serv., 846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed.Cir.1988). When a jurisdictional challenge is raised in a motion to dismiss, \u201cthe allegations stated in the complaint are taken as true and jurisdiction is decided on the face of the pleadings.\u201d <em>Folden v. United States, </em>379 F.3d 1344, 1354 (Fed.Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court may look, however, beyond the pleadings and \u201cinquire into jurisdictional facts\u201d to determine whether jurisdiction exists. <em>Rocovich v. United States, </em>933 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed.Cir.1991). If the Court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it must dismiss the complaint. RCFC 12(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">2. <em>Chevron </em>Deference is Not Appropriate Here</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">a. The Applicable Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">A recent Court of Federal Claims decision set forth a useful discussion of <em>Chevron </em>deference.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">Under <em>Chevron, </em>this court first must determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778 [81 L.Ed.2d 694] (1984). To determine the intent of Congress, the court looks to the language of the statute itself. <em>Delverde, SrL v. United States, </em>202 F.3d 1360, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2000). Beyond the statute\u2019s text, tools of statutory construction may be used, including the statute\u2019s structure, canons of statutory construction, and legislative history. <em>Id.; see also Heino v. Shinseki, </em>683 F.3d 1372, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2012). \u201cIf a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">However, \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,\u201d a court must proceed to the second step of <em>Chevron, </em>which is to ask whether the implementing agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 843,104 S.Ct. 2778; <em>see also Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Comm. v. United States, </em>596 F.3d 1365, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2010). The court must not \u201cimpose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (footnote omitted). Rather, <em>\u201cChevron </em>requires a federal court to accept the agency\u2019s construction of the statute, even if the agency\u2019s reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomm\u2019ns Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Servs., </em>545 U.S. 967, 980, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-12\">In determining whether an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reasonable, an agency\u2019s construction is entitled to deference if it is not in conflict with the plain language of the statute or the congressional intent or purpose of the statute. <em>See Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Boston &amp; Me. Corp., </em>503 U.S. 407, 417, 112 S.Ct. 1394, 118 L.Ed.2d 52 (1992) (\u201cIf the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>interpretation is not in conflict with the plain language of the statute, deference is due.\u201d); <em>Japan Whaling Ass\u2019n v. Am. Cetacean Soc\u2019y, </em>478 U.S. 221, 233, 106 S.Ct. 2860, 92 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986); <em>Chem. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. NRDC, Inc., </em>470 U.S. 116, 126, 105 S.Ct. 1102, 84 L.Ed.2d 90 (1985) (\u201cWe should defer to [the agency\u2019s] view unless the legislative history or the purpose and structure of the statute clearly reveal a contrary intent on the part of Congress.\u201d). In addition, an agency\u2019s interpretation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for <em>Chevron </em>deference when that interpretation is reached through formal proceedings, such as by an agency\u2019s power to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking. <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 229, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001); <em>Wheatland Tube Co. v. United States, </em>495 F.3d 1355, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2007).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyM1\"><em>Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v. United States, </em>107 Fed.Cl. 226, 237-38 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><em>\u201cChevron </em>deference ... is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved. To begin with, the rule must be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the official.\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 258, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (citing <em>Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. at 226-27, 121 S.Ct. 2164). Under <em>Chevron </em>step two, a court need not defer to an agency rule that is \u201c \u2018arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayo Found. for Med. Educ. &amp; Research v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 704, 711-12, 178 L.Ed.2d 588 (2011) (quoting <em>Household Credit Servs., Inc. v. Pfennig, </em>541 U.S. 232, 242, 124 S.Ct. 1741, 158 L.Ed.2d 450 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">b. The Positions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">The parties disagree regarding whether defendant is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference for its regulation interpreting \u00a7 1395w-3(a)(l)(D)(i). Defendant asserts deference to the regulation is due because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACJ\">the holding in <em>Cardiosom </em>[656 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir.2011) ] that the judicial review provision in Section 154 is ambiguous means that in order to determine the effect of Section 154, the Court first must consider HHS\u2019s regulatory construction of that section. In doing so, the Court must evaluate, under the ordinary <em>Chevron </em>analysis, the validity of the HHS regulation implementing the statute.

The circuit court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-16\">It is true that the statute before us contemplates a regulatory role for the agency. However, the implicit delegation of duties concerning the regulations for administrative appeals is limited to precisely that subject and does not extend by its terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>or placement to any implication of authority to the agency to \u201cregulate the scope of the judicial power vested by the statute.\u201d <em>[Adams Fruit Co., </em>494 U.S. at 650, 110 S.Ct. 1384.]. As Justice Marshall wrote in <em>Adams Fruit, </em>the fact that \u201cCongress envisioned ... a role for [an administrative agency] in administering [a] statute,\u201d by itself \u201cdoes not empower the Secretary to regulate the scope of the judicial power vested by the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Just so here.

Of course, \u201cpractical agency expertise is one of the principal justifications behind <em>Chevron </em>deference.\u201d <em>Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v.

Absent congressional delegation, if an agency has promulgated a regulation outside the scope of its specialized knowledge, courts will not defer to it. <em>See, e.g., Professional Reactor Operator Soc\u2019y v.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>729 F.3d 917, 920 n. 1 (9th Cir.2013). The statute provided a 30 day time period but failed to specify from what event the 30 days was to be counted. <em>Id. </em>The agency supplied the operative event by promulgating a regulation that deemed a filing to be timely if made within 30 days of service of the Final Agency Order. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">The [U.S. Department of Transportation] has promulgated a regulation that may conflict with our holding. The regulation, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 386.67(a), parrots the text of [49 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(b)(9) ], except that it addresses the ambiguity by explaining that a party may petition a court of appeal for review \u201cwithin 30 days <em>of service of the Final Agency Order.\u201d </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 386.67(a) (emphasis added). We do not defer to the DOT\u2019S regulation. It is well-established that \u201c[t]he Agency\u2019s position on [our] jurisdiction is not entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

Grumman Aerospace Corp., </em>927 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>F.2d 575, 582 (Fed.Cir.1991). The Federal Circuit has advised further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">Courts appropriately accord considerable weight to interpretations of an agency with expertise when a statute is ambiguous. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778. As we said in <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>917 F.2d 529, 535-36 (Fed.Cir.1990) (citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778), \u201cwhen a statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation, if reasonable, is to be followed by the court.\u201d Courts thus acknowledge the proper role for experts in policymaking. At the same time, we should refuse to enforce agency interpretations when the statute is not ambiguous and when the interpretation neither demands expertise of any agency nor accords with the thrust of the statute. <em>Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. Dimension Fin. Corp., </em>474 U.S. 361, 368, 106 S.Ct. 681, 88 L.Ed.2d 691 (1986). As was said in <em>Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v. Federal Communications Commission, </em>707 F.2d 1413, 1422-23 (D.C.Cir.1983), \u201c[t]o do otherwise would risk diluting the judiciary\u2019s power to stand guard against bureaucratic excesses by ensuring that administrative agencies remain within the bounds of their delegated authority. Indeed, it is the quintessential function of the reviewing court to interpret legislative delegations of power and to strike down those agency actions that traverse the limits of statutory authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>Id.; see also Hartman v. United States, </em>694 F.3d 96, 98 n.1 (Fed.Cir.2012) (\u201cWe see no reason why our review of tax regulations should not be guided by agency expertise pursuant to <em>Chevron </em>to the same extent as our review of other regulations.\u201d) (quoting <em>Mayo Found. for Med. Educ. &amp; Research, </em>131 S.Ct. at 713).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The case law reflects a consistent view regarding the limits of <em>Chevron </em>deference.

And, as defendant asserts, the language of \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi), which provides that \u201cthe HHS \u2018determination is final and not subject to administrative or judicial review,\u201d \u2019 is intended to bar this court\u2019s jurisdiction over plaintiffs complaint. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">Although HHS possesses the expertise to administer the Medicare program generally, it is without the expertise to determine a federal court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.

Consistent with the Federal Circuit\u2019s guidance, and that of numerous other circuits, the court does not defer to an agency\u2019s regulatory interpretation that purports to define the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, defendant is entitled to no <em>Chevron </em>deference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>for its interpretation of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Moreover, it is unnecessary for the court to consider whether \u00a7 1395w-3(a)(l)(D)(i) precludes this court\u2019s jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim, because the Federal Circuit has said it does not. <em>See Cardiosom, </em>656 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The court has jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs claim.

Deference is undoubtedly inappropriate, for example, when the agency\u2019s interpretation is \u2018\u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 461, 117 S.Ct. 905 (quoting <em>Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, </em>490 U.S. 332, 359, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989)). And deference is likewise unwarranted when there is reason to suspect that the agency\u2019s interpretation \u201cdoes not reflect the agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\u201d <em>Auer, supra, </em>at 462, 117 S.Ct. 905; <em>see also, e.g., Chase Bank, supra, </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 881.

Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 515, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994), or when it appears that the interpretation is nothing more than a \u201cconvenient litigating position,\u201d <em>Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, </em>488 U.S. 204, 213, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-9\"><em>Christopher v.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">HHS promulgated the regulation, \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi), through its \u201crulemaking authority which is explicitly contained within its broad statutory authority to administer the Medicare program Part B.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply 6 (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302); <em>see also Sebelius v. Auburn Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 817, 826, 184 L.Ed.2d 627 (2013) (\u201cCongress vested in the [ HHS] Secretary large rulemaking authority to administer the Medicare program.\u201d). In <em>Cardiosom, </em>the Federal Circuit said that the judicial withholding provision, \u00a7 1395w-3(a)(l)(D)(i), in the governing statute was subject to three possible interpretations. <em>Cardiosom, </em>656 F.3d at 1327-29. The Circuit Court\u2019s view that several potential interpretations exist for this statutory provision would appear to support a finding that HHS\u2019s interpretation of the ambiguous provision is entitled to deference\u2014provided the agency\u2019s implementing regulation is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-16\">The text of the pertinent regulation states: \u201cThe Determining Authority\u2019s determination is final and not subject to administrative or judicial review.\u201d \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi). The \u201cDetermining Authority\u201d is identified as CMS. \u00a7 414.425(f)(2). The regulatory language comports with one of the possible interpretations offered by the Federal Circuit. <em>See Cardiosom, </em>656 F.3d at 1328 (specifically that \u201cCongress could have intended that the statute not be read to provide ... judicial review with regard to ... the rewards from the special fund created by statute.\u201d). Accordingly, the court does not disagree that 414.425(f)(2)(vi) is based on a permissible construction of 1395w-3(a)(l)(D)(i).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>HHS\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi), however, is another matter. HHS construes the regulation to prevent an aggrieved supplier\u2014who has been offered payment on a damages claim through the CMS administrative process\u2014from maintaining a separate Tucker Act claim for additional damages. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 13-14 (\u201c[T]he agency determination is final and this Court has no authority to review the damages award.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Review of the plain language of \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi) shows that HHS did not promulgate a regulation that would bar a supplier from bringing a Tucker Act claim for additional damages. HHS\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u2019s judicial review withholding provision, \u00a7 1395w-3(a)(l)(D)(i), is made clear in the regulation it promulgated through the process of notice and comment rulemaking, \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi). Thus, the agency\u2019s position in this litigation reflects its regulatory interpretation and not its statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is analyzed under <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>and subsequent cases. <em>See, e.g., </em>3 Charles H. Koch, Jr. et al., <em>Administrative Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 10:26[1] <em>(\u201cAuer v.

Ctr., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1326, 1337, 185 L.Ed.2d 447 (2013) (providing <em>\u201cAuer </em>deference\u201d to the agency\u2019s interpretation where there was \u201cno indication that its current view [was] a change from prior practice or a <em>post hoc </em>justification adopted in response to litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">\u201cThe construction of a regulation is a question of law.\u201d <em>Gose v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>451 F.3d 831, 836 (Fed.Cir.2006) (citing <em>Kent v.

In this case, HHS seeks dismissal of plaintiffs Count I claim based on an alleged unavailability of \u201cjudicial review\u201d of CMS\u2019s administrative decision. \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi). Thus, to merit <em>Auer </em>deference, the phrase \u201cjudicial review\u201d must be ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">In determining whether <em>Auer </em>deference is merited, the court considers first whether the subject phrase is an ambiguous one, and second, whether HHS\u2019s interpretation reflects a fair and considered judgment on the matter at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">a. The Phrase \u201cJudicial Review\u201d is Not Ambiguous</p>\n<p id=\"b697-16\">The court considers below a number of relevant sources\u2014including legal dictionary, statutes, and case law\u2014that show the phrase \u201cjudicial review\u201d has a judicially settled meaning, which is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-17\">The Supreme Court has determined that the phrase \u201cjudicial review\u201d is a term of art. <em>See I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 313 n. 35, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (considering the meaning of \u201cjudicial review\u201d and \u201chabeas\u201d in the immigration context and referring to both as \u201cterms of art\u201d), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief (\u201cReal ID Act\u201d), Pub.L.

Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">[Wjhere Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-6\"><em>Sekhar v.

The constitutional doctrine providing for this power. 3.

Specifically, \u201c[jjudieial review of claims arising under the Medicare Act is available only after the Secretary renders a \u2018final decision\u2019 on the claim, in the same manner as is provided in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) for old age and disability claims arising under Title II of the Social Security Act.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 605, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984) (footnote omitted) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b)(l)(C)). Section 405(g), which pertains to Social Security claims, permits an individual to file a civil action in \u201cthe district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the plaintiff resides,\u201d to seek review of a decision which \u201cshall be subject to review in the same manner as a judgment in other civil actions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">Judicial review of an agency action has been governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) since 1946. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. Section 706 of the APA, which governs the scope of judicial review, provides that \u201cthe reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action,\u201d and shall do so by \u201creviewing] the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party.\u201d \u00a7 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">From the foregoing references, the meaning of the phrase \u201cjudicial review\u201d is clear. \u201cJudicial review\u201d contemplates that a court will review a decision issued by another tribunal. The language of the relevant regulatory provision is as follows: \u201cThe Determining Authority\u2019s determination is final and not subject to administrative or judicial review.\u201d Defendant has pointed to nothing that suggests the phrase \u201cjudicial review,\u201d as used in \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi), is ambiguous, or that the use of the term in the Medicare Act is inconsistent with its commonly understood definition. Because the court does not find the phrase \u201cjudicial review\u201d in \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi) to be ambiguous, HHS is entitled to no <em>Auer </em>deference for its interpretation of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">b. HHS\u2019s Proposed Regulatory Interpretation Does Not Reflect Its Fair and Considered Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">Had the court found the phrase \u201cjudicial review\u201d to be ambiguous, which it does not, defendant still would not merit <em>Auer </em>deference for its interpretation of the regulation. \u201c[D]eference is ... unwarranted when there is reason to suspect that the agency\u2019s interpretation \u2018does not reflect the agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Christopher, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2166 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>(quoting <em>Auer, </em>519 U.S. at 462, 117 S.Ct. 905).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Defendant points to no document\u2014other than the current motion\u2014in which it has interpreted the subject regulation as it does here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Review of both the proposed and final rule, as published in the Federal Register, shows that defendant gave no indication that it would interpret the regulation as it now does. <em>See </em>Medicare Program; Payment Policies Under the Physician Fee Schedule and Other Revisions to Part B for CY 2010, 74 Fed.Reg. 33,520, 33,644 &amp; 33,653 (proposed July 13, 2009); Medicare Program; Payment Policies Under the Physician Fee Schedule and Other Revisions to Part B for CY 2010, 74 Fed.Reg. 61,738, 61,934 &amp; 61,999 (Nov. 25, 2009) (to be codified at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414,425).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">An agency communicates its intended interpretation of a proposed regulation in its Federal Register notice. <em>See, e.g., Hillyard v. Shinseki, </em>695 F.3d 1257, 1260 (Fed.Cir.2012). In the <em>Hillyard </em>ease, for example, the Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) interpreted a regulation to mean that a veteran to whom it denied benefits could file only one request for revision of that decision, in which the veteran alleged \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d (known as a CUE). <em>Id. </em>at 1258. Mr. Hillyard disagreed, arguing that the regulation permitted multiple CUE challenges\u2014as long as each presented a new theory. <em>Id. </em>The parties\u2019 dispute centered on the use of the word \u201cissue\u201d in the regulation, <em>id. </em>which provided that: \u201cOnce there is a final decision on a motion ... relating to a prior Board decision <em>on an issue, </em>that prior Board decision <em>on that issue </em>is no longer subject to revision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1409(c) (emphasis added). Mr. Hillyard understood the word \u201cissue\u201d to mean a particular CUE theory, while the VA construed it to refer to the veteran\u2019s disability claim. <em>Hillyard, </em>695 F.3d at 1258. The Federal Circuit looked back to the VA\u2019s promulgation of the rule 14 years earlier, at which time the VA had discussed its proposed rule with an illustrative example; the offered example made clear that after issuing a decision, the VA would hear <em>only one CUE challenge. Id. </em>at 1259 (quoting 63 Fed.Reg. 27,538 (proposed May 19, 1998) (codified at 38 C.F.R. pt. 20)). The Federal Circuit upheld the agency\u2019s regulatory construction, observing that \u201c[t] he interpretation proffered by the VA in this case is no different from the one set forth in its notice of rulemaking and is consistent with the language of the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">In this ease, HHS has provided no such clear support for its proposed interpretation in its Federal Register notices. HHS said in the notices that it was <em>\u201cestablishing] a one-time process\u201d </em>that \u201cwould ensure a thorough review of a supplier\u2019s claim for damages\u201d and would \u201cnot [be] overly burdensome to those suppliers choosing to participate in this review process.\u201d 74 Fed.Reg. at 61,999 (emphasis added). HHS estimated that the cost to prepare a claim for submission to CMS would be $102, a calculation based on three hours of work by an accountant (at $34 per hour) and by a company official responsible for reviewing and gathering the necessary documents. <em>Id. </em>HHS committed to making \u201cevery effort\u201d to return a decision within four months of receipt of the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 61,936.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">At no point did HHS mention either the right of a supplier\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014to bring a claim for breach of contract in this court. Nor did HHS state that it would oppose any such claim brought by a supplier who received partial damages through the administrative process. Rather, HHS presented the proposed claims process as a simple, straight-forward process in which a supplier gathers and submits information for specified expenses, and can look forward to receipt of compensation fairly quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">HHS\u2019s effort to advance its litigating position through its chosen regulatory interpretation, and the lack of clear notice regarding the agency\u2019s position prior to the filing of its current motion, also suggests that the offered interpretation may be more reflective of a favorable litigating position than a fair and considered judgment. <em>See Christopher, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>132 S.Ct. at 2166 (stating that no deference is due to a \u201cconvenient litigating position\u201d) (quoting <em>Bowen, </em>488 U.S. at 213, 109 S.Ct. 468); <em>see also Am. Signature, Inc. v. United States, </em>598 F.3d 816, 827 (Fed.Cir.2010) (\u201cWhere the agency\u2019s interpretation seeks to advance its litigating position, deference is typically not afforded to the agency\u2019s position announced in a brief.\u201d) (citing <em>Bowen, </em>488 U.S. at 213, 109 S.Ct. 468).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Evidence that HHS\u2019s interpretation of the subject regulation reflects its own fair and considered judgment is wanting, and without such support the agency does not show any entitlement to <em>Auer </em>deference for its interpretation of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"AuX\">c. Title 42 C.F.R. Section 414.425(f)(2)(vi) Does Not Preclude B &amp; H\u2019s Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Because no deference is accorded to HHS\u2019s interpretation of its regulation, the court now considers whether the regulation itself could be read to bar the claim B &amp; H has brought here. As previously discussed, the term \u201cjudicial review\u201d\u2014as it appears in \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi)\u2014is a term of art. In the court\u2019s view, the regulation cannot be read to preclude plaintiffs Tucker Act claim. <em>See Lockheed Corp., </em>113 F.3d at 1227 (\u201cTo interpret a regulation we must look at its plain language and consider the terms in accordance with their common meaning.\u201d) (citing <em>Perrin, </em>444 U.S. at 42, 100 S.Ct. 311). The regulatory prohibition against this court\u2019s judicial review of the agency\u2019s final decision on plaintiffs administrative claim does not\u2014and cannot\u2014interfere with this court's Tucker Act jurisdiction which allows a plaintiff to bring a claim, for which it will bear the burden of proof, as any such claimant would.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">It merits mention that not only must the plaintiff prove liability in the instant action, it also bears the burden of showing that any damages it seeks from this court do not include any of the amounts already recouped through the CMS administrative process. <em>See Cardiosom, </em>656 F.3d at 1328-29 (cautioning that an aggrieved supplier may not obtain a double recovery for the same injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The court holds that 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.425(f)(2)(vi) does not preclude plaintiff from bringing a Tucker Act claim for breach of contract damages. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I on the basis that plaintiff has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">d. MIPPA\u2019s Legislative History Does Not Restrict a Supplier\u2019s Contract Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Of note, the legislative history for MIPPA section 154 provides no indication that Congress intended to limit a supplier\u2019s contract remedies. Rather, the relevant history shows that Congress focused its attention on the concerning manner in which CMS had conducted the Round 1 contracting process. <em>See Medicare\u2019s </em>DMEPOS<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Competitive Bidding Program: Hearing Before the Sub-comm. on Health of the H.

Hrg. Rpt. 1. On June 12, 2008, Representative Stark introduced a bill to \u201cdelay and reform\u201d the Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Acquisition Program (CAP). Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Acquisition Reform Act of 2008, H.R. 6252, 110th Cong. (2008), 2007 CONG U.S. HR 6252 (Westlaw).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">Eight days later, on June 20, 2008, Representative Charles Rangel introduced the bill that was later enacted as MIPPA Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, H.R. 6331, 110th Cong. (2008) (enacted), 2007 CONG U.S. HR 6331 (West-law). The bill introduced by Representative Stark, H.R. 6252, was included in its entirety in the bill introduced by Representative Ran-gel, H.R. 6331, as Section 154. <em>Compare </em>H.R. 6252 \u00a7 2 (Delay in and Reform of Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Acquisition Program), <em>with </em>H.R. 6331 \u00a7 154 (same). Review of the judicial review withholding provision in both bills, and review of the resulting statute, reveal no difference in the wording. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>pare </em>H.R. 6252 \u00a7 2(a)(l)(A)(iv), <em>and </em>H.R. 6331 \u00a7 154(a)(l)(A)(iv), <em>with </em>\u00a7 1395w-3(a)(l)(D)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Because the bill Representative Stark introduced, H.R. 6252, subsequently became part of H.R. 6331 (as \u00a7 154), the DMEPOS hearing convened by Representative Stark was effectively a hearing on H.R. 6331 \u00a7 154\u2014which in turn became MIPPA \u00a7 154 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-3). The DMEPOS hearing thus furnishes legislative history for MIPPA \u00a7 154, the legislation at issue in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">In announcing the hearing, Representative Stark, said \u201c[w]e have heard from both suppliers and beneficiary advocates that the D M EPOS competitive bidding program is not working as well as it is supposed to. I look forward to hearing their concerns, as well as from CMS, as we consider whether changes need to be made before the program is further expanded.\u201d Hrg. Rpt. 2. The acting administrator of CMS, Mr. Kerry Weems, testified and was questioned by eight<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> committee members, all of whom were critical of the CAP as it was then implemented. See Hrg. Rpt. 6-32. The concerns expressed by each Committee member were limited exclusively to the problematic manner in which CMS had managed the Round 1 contracting process, and the resulting impact on unsuccessful suppliers and Medicare recipients. There was no mention during the DMEPOS hearing of the impact of any changes in the CAP on the expected contract awardees,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and no mention of the available remedies if any changes were made after CMS executed contracts with awardees.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">II. Count II\u2014Breach of Contract as to Medicare Audits</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Plaintiff alleges, in Count II of the Complaint, that a contractor employed by CMS conducted a routine audit of its sales to Medicare recipients, which resulted in the contractor disallowing the sale of ten power wheelchairs as not \u201cmedically necessary.\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27. As a result of this determination, CMS\u2019s contractor withheld $31,363.90 from B &amp; H. Compl. \u00b6 40. Plaintiff disagreed with the determination and argued it through the Medicare appeals process. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">Defendant moves to dismiss Count II for lack of jurisdiction. Def.\u2019s Mot. 14-15. Defendant characterizes Count II as a reimbursement dispute between HHS and a Medicare provider, over which this court has no jurisdiction. Def.\u2019s Mot. 14 (citing <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. United States, </em>32 F.3d 548, 549-50 (Fed.Cir.1994) (\u201cBecause the Medicare Act contains its own comprehensive administrative and judicial review scheme, there is no Tucker Act jurisdiction over Medicare reimbursement claims.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">The court considers whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s Count II claim, and whether transfer is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">A Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">The Federal Circuit case law is clear that this court has no Tucker Act jurisdiction to review a reimbursement dispute under the Medicare Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-18\">\u201cCourts have consistently found preemption of Tucker Act jurisdiction where Congress has enacted a precisely drawn, comprehensive and detailed scheme of review in another forum____\u201d <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. United States, </em>32 F.3d 548, 550 (Fed.Cir.1994). In <em>St. Vincent\u2019s, </em>we held that the Medicare Act\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive administrative and district court review procedures\u201d give rise to such preemption. <em>Id. </em>at 549____ We concluded that \u201c[b]e-cause the Medicare Act contains its own comprehensive administrative and judicial review scheme, <em>there is no Tucker Act jurisdiction over Medicare reimbursement claims.\u201d Id. </em>at 549-50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-23\">We also held in <em>St. Vincent\u2019s </em>that \u201c[t]he Medicare Act specifically precludes review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>of reimbursement claims by, inter alia, the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550. We observed that \u201c[s]ection 405(h) of title 42 of the United States Code, read in conjunction with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00dc, unequivocally provides that \u2018no action\u2019 arising under the Medicare Act shall be brought in any forum or before any tribunal that is not specifically provided for in the Medicare Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550. Therefore, because \u201c[t]he <em>Medicare Act does not provide for jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims; ... [the court] is precluded from reviewing reimbursement disputes arising under the Act.\u201d Id. </em>at 550.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><em>Pines Residential Treatment Ctr., Inc. v. United States, </em>444 F.3d 1379, 1380-81 (Fed.Cir.2006) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The Federal Circuit also said in <em>Pines Residential Treatment Center, </em>that plaintiffs attempt to style its claim as one for breach of contract was not controlling, as the claim was in effect a Medicare reimbursement claim over which the Court of Federal Claims had no jurisdiction. <em>Pines Residential Treatment Ctr., </em>444 F.3d at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Plaintiff does not dispute this court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction. In its opposition to defendant\u2019s motion, plaintiff says only that it added Count II to the complaint due to \u201cmandatory joinder of claims in federal courts.\u201d PL\u2019s Opp\u2019n 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Although not cited, plaintiff appears to refer to Rule 18, which states a \u201cparty asserting a claim or counterclaim may join, as independent or alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an opposing party.\u201d RCFC 18(a). Nothing in RCFC 18(a) could provide this court with jurisdiction over plaintiffs Medicare reimbursement claim, where Congress has statutorily provided the federal district courts with jurisdiction to conduct judicial review of administrative decisions. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b)(2)(C)(iii) (\u201cSuch [civil] action shall be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the appellant is located----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Taking plaintiffs allegations stated in the complaint to be true, plaintiff is a \u201cdurable medical equipment Medicare provider,\u201d which \u201cregularly and routinely bills Medicare for the sales and/or leases of durable medical equipment to patients.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 26. Plaintiffs dispute arises from its sale of durable medical equipment to ten patients, for which it billed Medicare. Compl. \u00b6 27. That B &amp; H, like Pines Residential Treatment Center, styled its claim as a breach of contract claim does not furnish this court with jurisdiction over what is clearly a Medicare reimbursement dispute. <em>See Pines Residential Treatment Ctr., </em>444 F.3d at 1381. And plaintiff has failed to put forth any evidence rebutting defendant\u2019s challenge to this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over Count II. <em>See Reynolds v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed.Cir.1988) (stating that plaintiff \u201cbears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction by a prepondei\u2019ance of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">B. Transfer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">The court is obliged to consider whether plaintiffs claim should be transferred to a court in which the action could have been brought at the time it was filed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-13\">Whenever a civil action is filed in a court ... of this title or an appeal, including a petition for review of administrative action, is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, <em>the court shall, </em>if it is in the interest of justice, <em>transfer such action </em>or appeal <em>to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed </em>or noticed ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">According to defendant, the relevant statute and regulations provide for five levels of appeal for a Medicare reimbursement claim, \u201cculminating in review in Federal District Court.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 14-15 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff; 42 C.F.R. pt. 405). As described by defendant, the appellate process provides for four levels of administrative appeal prior to reaching judicial review by a federal district court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-16\">1. Redetermination by a CMS contractor (42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.940-.958);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>2. Reconsideration by a Qualified Independent Contractor (QIC) (42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.960-.978);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">3. Hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) within the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.1000-.1054);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">4. Review by the Medicare Appeals Council (42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.1100-.1130); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">5. Judicial review in Federal District Court (if the amount of the claim is greater than $1,000) (42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.1132-.1136).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Def.\u2019s Mot. 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">In order to obtain federal court review of its claim, a contractor must first either have received a Medicare Appeals Council (MAC) decision, or have filed for MAC review of an ALJ decision, but received no MAC decision within the applicable adjudication period. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1136(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">Plaintiff filed exhibits with its complaint that document its completion of the first and second levels of administrative review. Compl. Exs. 8-9 (Contractor redetermination); Compl. Ex. 7 (QIC reconsideration). Similarly, plaintiff alleged that its appeal was denied in the \u201cfirst step of the Medicare appeals process,\u201d Compl. \u00b6 28, and that its second appeal was also unsuccessful, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32. B &amp; H was aware of its further administrative appeal rights, having made reference to its right to further appeal \u201cbefore an Administrative Law Judge.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Nonetheless, there is no indication in either plaintiff\u2019s allegations or the exhibits accompanying plaintiffs complaint that plaintiff exercised its right to request a hearing before an ALJ, after it received a denial from the QIC reconsideration, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1002, or that if it received an ALJ decision, that it sought MAC review of such a decision, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1102. Absent evidence that plaintiff has exhausted its administrative appeals and is eligible to request federal court review of its claim, the court cannot find that plaintiff could have brought its claim for Medicare reimbursement in a federal district court at the time it filed its complaint in this court. For this reason, the court declines to transfer plaintiffs Count II claim to a federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-17\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II for lack of jurisdiction is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-18\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b703-19\">For the reasons addressed more fully above, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I is DENIED, and defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II is GRANTED. Pursuant to Rule 54(b), there being no just reason for delay, the Clerk is directed to enter judgment for the dismissal of Count II accordingly. RCFC 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-20\">The court will contact the parties regarding further proceedings in this matter. The court directs the parties to refrain from filing any motions for summary judgment before obtaining the consent of the court. RCFC 56(b) (\u201cUnless the court orders otherwise, a party may file a motion for summary judgment at any time until 30 days after the close of discovery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-21\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-13\">. The Supreme Court has concluded that <em>Chevron </em>deference applies to an agency's interpretation of its <em>own </em>jurisdiction, making clear, however, that agency jurisdiction and federal court jurisdiction are distinct concepts. <em>See City of Arlington, Tex. v.
