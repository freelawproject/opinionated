An ADR conference was held on April 1, 2014, during which the parties concluded that settlement was not possible at that time. Accordingly, the stay of proceedings was lifted. In the meantime, on March 24, 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) sent a \u201cGeneral Notice/Information Request Letter\u201d to plaintiff pertaining to the property at issue in this case\u2014 the Gulf States Steel Superfund Site. In that letter, the EPA notified plaintiff of its potential liability for costs incurred at the site pursuant to section 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and requested that plaintiff respond to the enclosed request for information pursuant to section 104(e) of CERCLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-24\">Plaintiff now moves to strike the EPA\u2019s information request letter or, in the alternative, stay action on the EPA\u2019s request for information. Plaintiff argues that by issuing the letter, the EPA is attempting to \u201cusurp[ ] the jurisdiction of this Court to manage matters that are in controversy in this case\u201d and \u201cpreempt the orderly conduct of discovery.\u201d Mot. 3. Plaintiff further contends that there is no basis under section 104(e) of CERCLA for the EPA to issue the letter because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>EPA has had, for the past twelve years, ready access to the information it seeks. Defendant opposes plaintiff\u2019s motion, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to an administrative request made pursuant to section 104(e) of CERCLA, and that the existence of civil litigation does not remove a federal government agency\u2019s \u201cstatutory authority to request and obtain information.\u201d Resp. 1. Defendant is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Without question, the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cCourt of Federal Claims\u201d), like all other federal courts, has broad discretion to manage and control the litigation before it. <em>See, e.g., Link, v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 630-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (remarking on \u201cthe control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of eases\u201d); <em>Amado v. Microsoft Corp., </em>517 F.3d 1353, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2008) (noting that federal district courts \u201care afforded broad discretion to control and manage their dockets\u201d); <em>Univ. of W. Va. Bd. of Trs. v. VanVoorhies, </em>278 F.3d 1288, 1295 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201cThis court defers to the judgment of the trial court on matters closely associated with the standard functions of the adjudicative process, as long as that judgment is not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d); <em>Beatrice Foods Co. v. New Eng. Printing &amp; Lithographing Co., </em>899 F.2d 1171, 1177 (Fed.Cir.1990) (\u201cA trial court has broad discretionary authority in managing the litigation before it____\u201d). This discretion, however, does not extend to issues beyond its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Section 113 of CERCLA provides that federal district courts, except in limited circumstances not pertinent here, \u201chave exclusive original jurisdiction over all controversies arising under\u201d CERCLA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(b) (2006); <em>see also Tarrant v. United States, </em>71 Fed.Cl. 554, 556 (2006) (\u201cThe exceptions ... pertain to review of EPA\u2019s actions in promulgating rules, respecting which review is assigned to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and to specifically enumerated actions under Sections 9606, 9607, and 9659 of CERCLA, as to which jurisdiction is variously assigned to district courts.\u201d (citation omitted)). The EPA sent its information request letter to plaintiff pursuant to section 104(e) of CERCLA, meaning that any dispute concerning the letter is a dispute that arises under CERCLA Thus, under the plain language of CERCLA, plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the EPA\u2019s information request letter must be brought in a federal district court. <em>See Tarrant, </em>71 Fed.Cl. at 556-57; <em>Bassett, N.M. LLC v. United States, </em>55 Fed.Cl. 63, 68 (2002); <em>Am. Lifestyle Homes, Inc. v. United States, </em>17 Cl.Ct. 711, 715 (1989); <em>see also Ledford v. United States, </em>297 F.3d 1378, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2002) (per curiam) (noting that the Court of Federal Claims is not a federal district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">The court is also precluded from entertaining plaintiffs challenge to the EPA\u2019s information request letter because plaintiffs challenge falls within the confines of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). The APA provides for judicial review of agency actions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (2012). However, the Court of Federal Claims \u201clacks the general federal question jurisdiction of the district courts, which would allow it to review the agency\u2019s actions and grant relief pursuant to the [APA].\u201d <em>Crocker v. United States, </em>125 F.3d 1475, 1476 (Fed.Cir.1997); <em>accord Century Exploration New Orleans, LLC v. United States, </em>745 F.3d 1168, 1179-80 (Fed.Cir.2014); <em>Lion Raisins, Inc. v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 1356, 1370 n. 11 (Fed.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">Finally, plaintiff has cited no legal authority for the proposition that a civil suit brought in the Court of Federal Claims precludes the EPA from requesting information, outside of the civil suit, pursuant to CERCLA</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">In sum, because the court lacks the authority to entertain plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the EPA\u2019s information request letter, plaintiff\u2019s motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
