Proehazka (\u201cCaptain Prochazka\u201d), to obtain competent legal counsel to pursue monetary claims against the United States, in complex cases, such as this one. Of course, the statutorily defined fee structure does not come close to compensating counsel, such as Thomas A Coulter or his firm LeClair Ryan, P.C., for the market value of their professional services. Therefore, the court would be remiss if it did not express appreciation to Plaintiffs counsel and the law firm of Le-Clair Ryan, P.C. for their professional services in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">I. RELEVANT FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">On June 30, 2002, Captain Prochazka, a member of the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps (\u201cJAGC\u201d), with a flawless record of service, was \u201cinvoluntarily retired\u201d by the United States Navy (\u201cNavy\u201d), based on an internal determination that his \u201cservice creditable\u201d and consequential \u201cmandatory retirement date\u201d prior to the enactment of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (\u201cDOPMA\u201d) required that he be denied five years of active duty pay and subject to a substantial reduction of pension benefits. This decision was based on the Navy\u2019s erroneous determination that no method existed, prior to DOPMA, to determine Plaintiffs \u201ctotal commissioned service,\u201d because the statute delineating how \u201ctotal commissioned service\u201d was calculated for Naval Officers like Plaintiff had been insignificantly amended in 1968.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">After exhausting all avenues of administrative relief, including the Naval Personnel Command (\u201cNPC\u201d), the Office of the Navy\u2019s Judge Advocate General (\u201cOJAG\u201d), and the Board for Correction of Naval Records (\u201cBCNR\u201d), on December 6, 2006, Captain Prochazka filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking correction of his military records, \u201cincluding a determination that the date of his mandatory retirement is July 1, 2008, and for adjustments to pay and allowances for the intervening period and for related relief.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 1. On February 5, 2007, an Amended Complaint was filed also seeking corrective and monetary relief under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1); the Military Pay Act, 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204; 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552 (authorizing the correction of military records); and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-12 (computation of military retired pay). Am. Compl. \u00b64. On March 25, 2008, the court stayed this case to afford Plaintiff time to obtain counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">On January 26, 2009, Thomas A Coulter, a partner in the firm of LeClair Ryan, P.C., filed a motion to appear as counsel for Cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>tain Prochazka before the BCNR and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">On December 10, 2009, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion And Order determining that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims alleged in the February 5, 2007 Amended Complaint, pursuant to the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), and the Military Pay Act, 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204. <em>See Prochazka v. United States, </em>90 Fed.Cl. 481, 488-89 (2009) <em>(\u201cProchazka I </em>\u201d). The court also determined that the BCNR violated 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1556, and its own internal procedures, by failing to allow Captain Prochazka the opportunity to comment on a May 2004 NPC Advisory Opinion before issuing a May 11, 2004 decision. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94. Since this error was prejudicial and the May 2004 NPC Advisory Opinion failed to provide a rational basis for how the Navy\u2019s determination of Plaintiffs \u201cservice date\u201d was computed, the court denied the Government\u2019s August 3, 2007 Motion To Dismiss, stayed pending Cross Motions For Judgment On The Administrative Record, and remanded the case, pursuant to RCFC 52.2, instructing the BCNR to answer four specific questions. <em>Id. </em>at 497-98.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Thereafter, the BCNR requested and received advisory opinions from the NPC and the OJAG. <em>See </em>3/16/11 <em>BCNR Dec., </em>Doc. 84 at 1. A March 29, 2010 Advisory Opinion from the NPC reaffirmed the Navy\u2019s prior interpretation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6388(b), as amended in 1968.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A March 26, 2010 Advisory Opinion from the OJAG, however, adopted the reasoning of an October 26, 2001 OJAG Advisory Opinion (\u201c2001 OJAG Op.\u201d), prepared in response to a June 6, 2001 letter from Captain Prochazka to the Navy, but not previously disclosed to him, despite repeated requests. <em>See </em>2010 OJAG Op. at 1 (citing \u201creference (c)\u201d). Both the 2001 and 2010 OJAG Advisory Opinions concluded that Captain Prochazka\u2019s September 20, 1977 appointment into the Regular Navy was as a lieutenant and not as a lieutenant (junior grade). <em>See </em>2010 OJAG Op. at 2 (citing 2001 OJAG Op. at 7-12). In other words, <em>if </em>Captain Prochazka had been appointed into the Regular Navy as a lieutenant (junior grade) it was possible to compute his \u201ctotal commissioned service,\u201d pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6388(b), as amended in 1968, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">This section [\u00a7 6388(b)] as enacted used the word \u201coriginally\u201d [instead of] \u201cinitially.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6388(b) as amended by U.S. Code, 1976, substitutes the word \u201cinitially\u201d for \u201coriginally.\u201d The legislative history is silent on the reason behind this change. An officer\u2019s first appointment in a staff corps is an original appointment; <em>thus, substituting \u201cinitially\u201d for \u201coriginally\u201d would not alter the meaning of the statute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">2001 OJAG Op. at 7 n. 23 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">On September 24, 2010, the BCNR requested a \u201csupplemental advisory opinion\u201d from the OJAG, to ascertain whether the March 26, 2010 OJAG Advisory Opinion could be \u201charmonized\u201d with the March 29, 2010 NPC Advisory Opinion. <em>See </em>3/16/11 <em>BCNR Dec., </em>Doe. 84, Enel. 13 at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">On October 25, 2010, without performing any additional analysis, the OJAG issued a \u201csupplemental advisory opinion\u201d adopting the March 29, 2010 NPC advisory opinion\u2019s interpretation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6388, as amended in 1968, and disavowing the reasoning of the 2001 OJAG Opinion regarding the substitution of \u201cinitially\u201d for \u201coriginally\u201d in the statute. 10/25/10 OJAG Supp. Op. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">On January 17, 2011, Captain Prochazka submitted a new record to the BCNR that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>had only recently obtained from the Navy with the assistance of Senator Jim Webb, demonstrating that Captain Prochazka\u2019s first appointment into the Regular Navy was as a lieutenant (junior grade), and not as a lieutenant. <em>See </em>3/16/11 <em>BCNR Dec., </em>Doc. 84, Enel. 22 at 9 (copy of an \u201cALNAV\u201d electronic message that was transmitted at the time of Captain Prochazka\u2019s appointment into the Regular Navy in 1977 confirming his permanent appointment was to the rank \u201cLTJG,\u201d with a temporary appointment as \u201cLT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On March 16, 2011, the BCNR issued a decision concurring with the March 29, 2010 NPC Opinion and the October 25,2010 OJAG \u201csupplemental\u201d advisory opinion, concluding that no method existed, prior to DOPMA, to determine Captain Proehazka\u2019s \u201ctotal commissioned service.\u201d <em>See </em>3/16/11 <em>BCNR Dec. </em>at 6-7. Therefore, the BCNR again found that the Navy correctly computed Captain Proehazka\u2019s \u201ctotal commissioned service\u201d under the M method set forth in SECNA-VINST 1821.1. <em>See </em>3/16/11 <em>BCNR Dec. </em>at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">On April 30, 2012, after additional briefing on the parties\u2019 respective Motions For Judgment On The Administrative Record, the court determined that the Navy and the BCNR\u2019s interpretation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6388(b), as amended in 1968, was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. <em>See Prochazka v. United States, </em>104 Fed.Cl. 774, 796-97 (2012) <em>(\u201cProchazka II </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">On November 16, 2012, the court entered a Final Judgment that Captain Prochazka was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">[D]ue $413,940.54 in back pay, comprised of active-duty back pay of $612,961.98 for the period between July 1, 2002 and June 30, 2007; a credit to the government of $295,244.19 for retirement pay received between July 1, 2002 and June 30, 2007; and retirement back pay of $96,222.75 for the period of July 1, 2007 through September 30,2012---- Furthermore, ... [P]laintiff is entitled to receive monthly military retirement pay of $8,459.00, beginning on October 1,2012 and going forward[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Judgment, <em>Prochazka v. United States, </em>No. 06-cv-827 (Fed.Cl. Nov. 16, 2012), ECF No. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">On January 14, 2013, the Government filed a Notice Of Appeal, but withdrew it on June 14, 2013, pursuant to a Joint Stipulation Of Dismissal. <em>See </em>Order, <em>Prochazka v. United States, </em>No. 2013-5052 (Fed. Cir. filed June 20, 2013), ECF No. 17 (formal mandate dismissing appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">On July 19, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Motion For Attorney Fees And Related Expenses/Costs with the United States Court of Federal Claims, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (\u201cEAJA Mot.\u201d), together with: (1) the July 19, 2013 Declaration of Thomas A. Coulter (\u201cCoulter Deel.\u201d); (2) a copy of the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI\u201d); (3) an itemized spreadsheet listing Plaintiffs counsel\u2019s time entries, adjusted for cost of living (\u201cEx.

Reply\u201d), requesting: (1) $110,561.56 for attorney fees incurred from November 10, 2008 to December 20, 2013, (2) $763.37 in expenses and costs incurred by Captain Prochazka for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>period during which he proceeded <em>pro se, </em>and (3) $1,950.00 in expenses and costs incurred by LeClair Ryan, P.C. EAJA Mot. 21; PL Reply 22. Plaintiffs January 22, 2014 Reply also includes an updated itemized spreadsheet listing Plaintiffs counsel\u2019s time entries spent preparing the EAJA Motion and January 22, 2014 Reply (\u201cPL Reply Ex. A\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">III. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">A. Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Plaintiffs July 19, 2013 Motion For Attorney Fees And Related Expenses/Costs properly invokes the court\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to the EAJA, under which \u201ca [federal trial] court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses ... in any civil action ... brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action,\u201d if certain requirements are met. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). And, since the United States Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims alleged in the December 6, 2006 Complaint, as amended, the court also has jurisdiction to adjudicate Plaintiffs July 19, 2013 Motion. <em>See Burkhardt v. Gober, </em>232 F.3d 1363, 1367 (Fed.Cir.2000) (holding that a court has jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim filed under the EAJA for attorney fees, expenses, and costs where the court \u201cha[d] the power to hear and decide the underlying civil action in which the EAJA applicant incurred those fees and other expenses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">B. The Requirements Of The Equal Access To Justice Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Congress enacted the EAJA to authorize a prevailing party in a lawsuit against the United States to recover reasonable attorney fees, expenses, and costs. <em>See Scarborough v. Principi, </em>541 U.S. 401, 406, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004) (\u201cCongress enacted EAJA, Pub.L. 96-481, Tit. II, 94 Stat. 2325, in 1980 \u2018to eliminate the barriers that prohibit small businesses and individuals from securing vindication of their lights in ... administrative proceedings brought by or against the Federal Government.\u2019 \u201d (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 96-1005, at 9 (1980))). Section (d)(1)(A) of the EAJA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-12\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">Section (d)(l)(13) requires a \u201cparty\u201d seeking reasonable attorney fees, expenses, and costs under the EAJA to submit an application \u201cwithin thirty days of final judgment in the action,\u201d together with a statement asserting that the position of the United States was not substantially justified and showing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atf8\">[T]he party<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award ..., the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(l)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">The United States Supreme Court has held that the EAJA requires: \u201c(1) that the claimant be a \u2018prevailing party1; (2) that the Government\u2019s position was not \u2018substantially justified\u2019; (3) that no \u2018special circumstances make an award unjust\u2019; and, (4) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B), that any fee application be submitted to the court within 30 days of final judgment in the action and be supported by an itemized statement.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r, INS v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 158, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-17\">The court\u2019s determination of whether the position of the United States was \u201csubstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>tially justified\u201d is based on \u201cthe record (including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based) which is made in the civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In this ease, the Government does not dispute that Captain Prochazka: (1) is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d; (2) is a \u201cparty ... whose net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed\u201d; and (3) timely filed a motion for attorney fees, expenses and costs. Gov\u2019t Resp. 5. The court is also satisfied that Plaintiff meets these threshold requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor does the Government suggest that there are any \u201cspecial circumstances that would make an award, on the whole, unjust.\u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The Government, however, contends that its position was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">C. Whether The Government\u2019s Position Was \u201cSubstantially Justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">1. The Government\u2019s Argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The Government argues that the court must take into account that \u201cthe EAJA is a partial waiver of sovereign immunity that \u2018must be strictly construed in favor of the United States.\u2019 \u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. 4 (quoting <em>Ardestani v. INS, </em>502 U.S. 129, 137, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991)). Congress did not intend the EAJA to serve as a \u201cmandatory fee shifting device.\u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. 4 (quoting <em>KMS Fusion, Inc. v. United States, </em>39 Fed.Cl. 593, 598 (1997) (citing <em>Gavette v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>808 F.2d 1456, 1465 (Fed.Cir.1986) <em>(en </em>banc))).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The Government also contends that the legal issues in this ease were of first impression and that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has cautioned that \u201c[wjhen the issue is a novel one on which there is little precedent, courts have been reluctant to find the [Gjovernment\u2019s position was not substantially justified.\u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. 7 (quoting <em>Norris v. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n., </em>695 F.3d 1261, 1265 (Fed.Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Schock v.

Winter, </em>No. 06-cv-1256 (S.D. Cal. June 30, 2006), ECF No. 12, is the only case addressing the general issue raised in this ease. Therein, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California dismissed the plaintiffs challenge as non justiciable, reasoning that the Secretary\u2019s \u201cuniform and consistent interpretation of the regulations at issue is not plainly erroneous and represents a reasoned management policy decision.\u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. 7 (quoting Order, <em>Russo, </em>No. 06-cv-1256 (S.D. Cal. June 30, 2006), at 7, ECF No. 12); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cThe only other court to consider this issue, the Southern District of California, elected to refrain from interfering with the Navy\u2019s considered and rational personnel-management policy.\u201d). A though that case arose under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cAPA\u201d), and is \u201cnot strictly applicable to Tucker Act military pay claims,\u201d the District Court\u2019s observations demonstrate that the Government\u2019s position in this case was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. 7. Moreover, since this case involves \u201cmatters affecting the military,\u201d the court should decline to determine that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Government\u2019s position was not substantially justified.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Gov\u2019t Resp. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">In addition, the complex substantive nature of this case evidences that the Government\u2019s litigation position was substantially justified. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t Resp. 9 (\u201c[T]o the extent that there is any question about the need for litigation due to the difficulty of the question, the procedural history of this case should put such concerns to rest.\u201d). Specifically, the court required the parties to submit multiple rounds of briefing on the merits, and the court remanded the case on December 10, 2009 to the BCNR.

Plaintiff\u2019s Response.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Prior to 1968, administrative and court decisions made clear that a staff corps officer\u2019s \u201ctotal commissioned service\u201d under Section 6388 \u201cbegan with his first commission in a staff corps of the Regular Navy, with a permanent commission---- [and that] [o]ther prior commissioned service, as a Reserve officer or a line officer, simply did not count toward his total commissioned service.\u201d EAJA. Mot. 6 (citing, <em>e.g., To the Secretary of the Navy, </em>37 <em>Comp. Gen. 747, 748 </em>(1958) (explaining that \u201cyears of commissioned service beginning on June 30 of the year in which the officer was <em>originally commissioned in a staff corps of the Regular Navy, with a permanent commission, </em>[are to be counted] for the purpose of determining a staff corps officer\u2019s eligibility for ... separation from the active list\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also Payson v.

Moreover, the Navy never disputed Plaintiffs contention, first made in June 2001, that his \u201ctotal commissioned service\u201d under pre-1968 law would be determined from the date of his permanent appointment as a lieutenant (junior grade) in the Regular\u2019 Navy on September 20, 1977. EAJA Mot. 6. As such, the Navy departed from established law. For this reason, among others, the Government\u2019s litigation position in this case was not substantially justified. The Government\u2019s position, both at the agency level and in the United States Court of Federal Claims, rested on a \u201cone-word change in the statutory language\u201d (EAJA Mot. 6) that was contrary to the plain language of Section 6388, as amended in 1968. EAJA Mot. 15. As the court detailed in the April 30, 2012 Memorandum Opinion And Final Order, the Navy\u2019s interpretation was \u201ccontrary to the statute\u2019s structure and there was no evidence that Congress intended to change the meaning of the statute with its one-word substitution in Section 6388(b)[.]\u201d EAJA Mot. 15 (citing <em>Prochazka II, </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 791-93). Moreover, the Navy\u2019s interpretation of Section 6388(b) was inconsistent with the legislative history, because there is no evidence that Congress intended to change \u201cthe relevant appointment for purposes of computing the years of service creditable toward retirement.\u201d EAJA Mot. 15 (citing <em>Prochazka II, </em>104 Fed.

For example, the Administrative Record contains no evidence that, after Captain Proehazka petitioned the NPC to recalculate his assigned retirement date on June 6, 2001, the Navy ever responded to his inquiry. Even after the NPC forwarded Captain Prochazka\u2019s unanswered petition to OJAG for an opinion, he was not even provided with a copy of the OJAG opinion. Around July 2002, Captain Proehazka received a \u201cresponse\u201d to his unanswered June 6, 2001 petition that consisted largely of an admission that records pertaining to Captain Prochazka\u2019s petition were somehow lost. This conduct was exacerbated by the Navy\u2019s failure to allow Captain Prochazka to comment on the May 2004 NPC Advisory Opinion in contravention of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1556, despite Captain Prochazka\u2019s explicit written request to do so. These errors and delays engendered more errors and delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">After the court issued its December 10, 2009 Memorandum Opinion And Order, the NPC and OJAG issued contradictory advisory opinions on March 29 and March 26, 2010, respectively, requiring the BCNR to request a \u201csupplemental\u201d OJAG Advisory Opinion to address how the two opinions could be \u201charmonized.\u201d This \u201charmonization\u201d took the form of the OJAG summarily adopting, without performing any additional analysis, the incongruous March 29, 2010 NPC Advisory Opinion. During this process, the Navy also revealed for the first time, despite repeated prior requests by Captain Proehazka, that the 2001 OJAG Opinion explicitly adopted Captain Prochazka\u2019s statutory interpretation argument and contravened the Navy\u2019s statutory argument. Eight years passed before the Navy finally disclosed this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Subsequently, the Government adopted the Navy\u2019s view that substituting \u201cinitially\u201d for \u201coriginally\u201d\u2014two words that are undeniably synonyms\u2014heralded a substantive change, without any indication from Congress, in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6388(b). This decision now adversely affects an entire class of Navy officers, like Captain Proehazka, who began their career in the JAGC or JAGC Student <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Program. The Government\u2019s position also departed from the settled pre-1968 understanding that a staff corps officer\u2019s \u201ctotal commissioned service\u201d was calculated from their first commission in the Regular Navy, with a permanent commission; time spent as a Reserve officer or a line officer was not counted. <em>See To the Secretary of the Navy, </em>37 Comp. Gen. at 748 (explaining that \u201cyears of commissioned service beginning on June 30 of the year in which the officer was <em>originally commissioned in a staff corps of the Regular Navy, with a permanent commission, </em>[are to be counted] for the purpose of determining a staff corps officer\u2019s eligibility for ... separation from the active list\u201d). In sum, the Government\u2019s argument not only was unfounded in law, but facially implausible. <em>See Whitman v. Am.

The United States Court of Federal Claims has discretion to reduce a fee award sought under the EAJA, where an amount claimed could be considered \u201crecovery out of proportion to [a party\u2019s] actual success.\u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. 11 (quoting <em>CEMS, Inc. v. United States, </em>65 Fed.Cl. 473, 484 (2005) (quoting <em>Baldi Bros. Constructors v. United States, </em>52 Fed.Cl. 78, 83 (2002))). Specifically, the court may reduce an award to reflect the prevailing party\u2019s lack of success on a particular issue raised. Gov\u2019t Resp. 11 (citing <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (\u201cThe [trial] court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Several of the billing records submitted indicate that, at the court\u2019s request, Plaintiffs counsel spent time \u201caddressing the issue of converting this case to a class action,\u201d but concluded that was not a viable option. Gov\u2019t Resp. 12. Because Plaintiff did not succeed on this issue, Plaintiffs counsel should not be compensated for this work. Gov\u2019t Resp. 11-12 (citing Supplemental Brief, <em>Prochazka v. United States, </em>No. 06-cv-827, Dkt. No. 63, at 46 (\u201c[T]his case is not appropriate for certification as a class action.\u201d)). The Government asserts that the court should exclude all entries associated with certifying this case as a class action since Plaintiffs billing records are recorded in \u201cblock billing\u201d entries. Gov\u2019t Resp. 14 (citing <em>Cobell v.

Since the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff, and \u201cblock-billing frustrates the [c]ourt\u2019s inquiry,\u201d all such entries should be denied.

Thus, in a lawsuit consisting of related claims, \u201ca plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney\u2019s fee reduced simply because the [trial court] did not adopt each contention raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 103 S.Ct. 1933; <em>see also Metro.

This is not a ease in which Plaintiff obtained partial or limited success by achieving \u201csignificantly less damages than the amount it originally sought.\u201d <em>United Partition Sys., Inc., </em>95 Fed.Cl. at 57. In fact, Plaintiffs counsel obtained complete relief for his client, since the court granted Plaintiffs Motion For Judgment On The Administrative Record, awarded Plaintiff back pay, enhanced retirement pay, and ordered a correction of Plaintiffs military records.

The court finds that all \u201centries in question provide sufficient detail to inform the court as to the content of the work done during the hours claimed,\u201d <em>Miles Construction, LLC, </em>113 Fed.Cl. at 180, and the 625.20 hours claimed is reasonable given the length and complexity of this ease.

United States, </em>827 F.2d 735, 742 (Fed.Cir. 1987) (holding that the United States Court of Federal Claims did not abuse its discretion in denying a cost of living adjustment). To prevail on the cost of living adjustment, a plaintiff must \u201callege[ ] that the cost of living has increased\u201d from the effective date of the statutory cap on fees to the date legal services were rendered, as measured by the CPI. <em>See Cal. Marine Cleaning, Inc. v. United States, </em>43 Fed.Cl. 724, 733 (1999). And, the United States Court of Federal Claims \u201cordinarily grants a cost of living adjustment in an EAJA action when the Department of Labor\u2019s Consumer Price Index ... indicates that such an adjustment is warranted.\u201d <em>Miles Constr., LLC, </em>113 Fed.Cl. at 181 (citing <em>Dalles Irrigation Dist., </em>91 Fed.Cl. at 705 (explaining that a cost of living adjustment \u201cshould be freely granted\u201d absent unusual circumstances)).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In this ease, Plaintiff adequately alleges that the cost of living increased and has provided an itemized spreadsheet applying an accepted methodology that compares the March 1996 CPI to the CPI for each month during which Plaintiffs counsel billed hours, to calculate the cost of living adjustment.

In this ease, the Government does not dispute that a cost of living adjustment is warranted, nor contests Plaintiffs method for calculating the adjustment. Gov\u2019t Resp. at 14 (explaining that, should the court award Plaintiff attorney fees, the Government \u201csees no other reasons to reduce a fee award from the amount [Plaintiff has] requested\u201d).

Reply Ex. A <em>See Dalles Irrigation Dist., </em>91 Fed.Cl. at 705 (holding, where the Government does not object to a plaintiffs method for calculating a cost of living adjustment, that the court may adopt the plaintiffs reasonable methodology).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">For these reasons, the court has determined that Plaintiff is entitled to $110,561.56 in attorney fees, reflecting compensation for the 625.20 attorney hours billed, adjusted for a cost of living increase.
