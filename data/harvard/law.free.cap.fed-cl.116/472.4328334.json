Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 05-626V, 2013 WL 6698382 (Fed.Cl.Spec.Mstr. Nov. 19, 2013) <em>(Contreras III),</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which denied Jessie Contreras\u2019s petition for compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-l to -34 (2012) (the Vaccine Act).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Athough petitioner attacks the special master\u2019s decision on many fronts, a threshold issue regarding the credibility of one of respondent\u2019s experts and the reliability of that expert\u2019s opinions prevents this court from reaching the remainder of petitioner\u2019s arguments. Pet\u2019s Mot. at 2, 4-5; Resp.\u2019s Resp. at 27-29. Because the credibility and reliability determinations of the special master regarding this particular expert are unclear, and because the extent of the special master\u2019s reliance on the opinions of this expert for the entitlement decision is similarly unclear, the court must remand this case to the special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AE3\">I. Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b485-20\">Prior decisions in this case provide ample factual background for Jessie\u2019s alleged vaccine injury of transverse myelitis (TM) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). <em>See, e.g., Contreras v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>107 Fed.Cl. 280 (2012) <em>(Contreras II); Contreras v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 05-626V, 2012 WL 1441315 (Fed. Cl.Spec.Mstr. Apr. 5, 2012) <em>(Contreras I), vacated, </em>107 Fed.Cl. 280. The alleged injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>occurred in 2003, approximately twenty-four hours after Jessie received inoculations containing the Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) and tetanus-diptheria vaccine (Td). Jessie is now twenty-four years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On June 15, 2005, Jessie\u2019s father, acting for Jessie, filed a petition under the Vaccine Act. Petitioner initially engaged Dr. Charles M. Poser, M.D. as an expert. Respondent then engaged Dr. John T. Sladky, M.D. to opine on causation. Dr. Sladky\u2019s initial report in 2005 was filed in response to Dr. Poser\u2019s report. <em>See </em>Ex. I; <em>see also </em>Resp.\u2019s Resp. at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Petitioner then engaged another expert, Dr. Lawrence Steinman, M.D. Dr. Stein-man\u2019s initial report was filed in 2006. A few years later, Dr. Sladky filed a second report to respond to Dr. Steinman\u2019s report. <em>See </em>Resp.\u2019s Resp. at 27. Dr. Sladky\u2019s second report was filed on March 8, 2010 and refiled on March 22, 2010. <em>See </em>Ex. P. Respondent had also engaged a second expert, Dr. J. Lindsay Whitton, M.D., Ph.D., who also responded to Dr. Steinman\u2019s contentions. Drs. Steinman, Sladky and Whitton testified at the first evidentiary hearing in this case, held April 19-20, 2010.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">In <em>Contreras I, </em>the special master denied petitioner entitlement to compensation under the Vaccine Act. In <em>Contreras II, </em>this court vacated that opinion and remanded the case to the special master for a revised causation analysis. In <em>Contreras III, </em>the special master issued a revised causation analysis which again denied petitioner entitlement to compensation. Before the special master issued his decision, however, on May 1, 2013 the Secretary filed a status report revealing previously undisclosed information regarding Dr. Sladky. It is the special master\u2019s ambiguous response to that disclosure of information that is the primary focus of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AnFU\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">This court has jurisdiction to review the decision of a special master in a Vaccine Act case. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2). \u201cUnder the Vaccine Act, the Court of Federal Claims reviews the decision of the special master to determine if it is \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>de Bazan v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>539 F.3d 1347, 1350 (Fed.Cir.2008) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B) and citing <em>Althen v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>418 F.3d 1274, 1277 (Fed.Cir.2005)) (alteration in original). This court uses three distinct standards of review in Vaccine Act cases, depending upon which aspect of a special master\u2019s judgment is under scrutiny:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">These standards vary in application as well as degree of deference. Each standard applies to a different aspect of the judgment. Fact findings are reviewed ... under the arbitrary and capricious standard; legal questions under the \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d standard; and discretionary rulings under the abuse of discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-13\"><em>Munn v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863, 870 n. 10 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">The third standard of review, abuse of discretion, is applicable when the special master excludes evidence or otherwise limits the record upon which he relies. <em>See id. As </em>this court has stated, the third standard applies to evidentiary rulings, including those regarding the qualifications of an expert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlA\">Notably, such [discretionary] rulings include determinations regarding the qualification of expert witnesses and the reliability of expert testimony. <em>Piscopo v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>66 Fed.Cl. 49, 53 (2005); <em>see [Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 142-43, 118 S.Ct. 512 [139 L.Ed.2d 508] (1997) ] (holding that \u201cabuse of discretion is the proper standard of review of a [trial] court\u2019s evidentiary rulings,\u201d including determinations regarding the reliability of expert testimony under <em>[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 [113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469] (1993)) ]; <em>[Terran ex rel. Terran v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>195 F.3d 1302, 1316 (Fed.Cir.1999) ] (reviewing for abuse of discretion the Special Master\u2019s decision to reject as unreliable the testimony of the petitioner\u2019s expert). Determinations subject to review for abuse of discretion must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>be sustained unless \u201cmanifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Piscopo, </em>66 Fed.Cl. at 53; <em>see Mil-mark Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>731 F.2d 855, 860 (Fed.Cir.1984) (holding that decisions that lie within the trial court\u2019s discretion are to be sustained unless \u201cmanifestly erroneous\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><em>Jarvis v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>99 Fed.Cl. 47, 59 (2011). Thus, a special master\u2019s determination as to the reliability of expert witness testimony is reviewed under the abuse of discretion, or manifestly erroneous, standard. <em>Terran, </em>195 F.3d at 1316 (citing <em>Burns v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>3 F.3d 415, 416-17 (1993)); <em>Milmark, </em>731 F.2d at 860 (citing <em>Salem v. U.S. Lines Co., </em>370 U.S. 31, 35, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 8 L.Ed.2d 313 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">On the particular topic of a fact-finder\u2019s determination as to the credibility of a testifying witness, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has often stated that such determinations are \u201c \u2018virtually unreviewable.\u2019 \u201d <em>E.g., Bradley v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>991 F.2d 1570, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1993) (citing <em>Hambsch v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed. Cir.1986)). The court has found no authority, however, which states that a credibility determination is immune from review, particularly where, as here, extrinsic evidence has subsequently been disclosed which shows a lack of candor on the part of an expert witness. For this reason, the court reviews the special master\u2019s determinations regarding Dr. Sladky\u2019s credibility and the reliability of Dr. Sladky\u2019s expert opinions for manifest error. Unfortunately, the special master\u2019s determinations in this regard are ambiguous and resist review absent further clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">A. Dr. Sladky\u2019s Opinions and Testimony Have Been Undermined By a Consistent Pattern of Misrepresentations to the Court and to Respondent\u2019s Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"A8go\">1. An Undisclosed History of Substance Abuse</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">On May 1, 2013, the Secretary was obliged to disclose that Dr. Sladky, one of the two experts employed by respondent in this ease, had a substance abuse problem which led to the suspension and probationary restoration of his license to practice medicine at or around the time he was drafting an expert report and testifying at the 2010 hearing in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Some excerpts of this disclosure reveal that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">the Secretary and respondent\u2019s counsel have only recently learned ... that Dr. Sladky agreed not to practice medicine in the state of Georgia from August 19, 2008 to March 18, 2009, and agreed to the indefinite suspension of his license to practice medicine on June 17, 2009, and that on March 4, 2010, the suspension of his license was lifted and his license to practice restored on a probationary basis. The probation was terminated on July 5, 2011---- Neither the Secretary nor respondent\u2019s counsel was aware of the suspension or probationary status of Dr. Sladky\u2019s license prior to or at the time he provided the expert witness services in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Status Report of May 1,2013, at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">Attached to the Secretary\u2019s status report were a number of documents issued by the State of Georgia\u2019s Composite State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), the earliest of which, dated June 17, 2009, provides an initial insight into Dr. Sladky\u2019s alcohol dependence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-15\">On or about June 5, 2009, the Board received reliable information from Talbott Recovery Campus (\u201cTRC\u201d) that Respondent [Dr. Sladky] tested positive for alcohol in a urine drug/aleohol screen and, as a result, TRC recommends that Respondent enter inpatient treatment at TRC immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 14. This report of a failed urine test was just one manifestation of Dr. Sladky\u2019s substance abuse problem and was the trigger for the Board\u2019s disciplinary action which included: (1) the indefinite suspension of Dr. Sladky\u2019s license to practice medicine on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>17, 2009, (2) the requirement that he receive inpatient treatment for his condition, and, (3) that he attend continuing care after treatment as required by the rehabilitation center\u2019s staff. There were, however, earlier incidents that led to this and other disciplinary action by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">As recounted in a later Board decision dated March 4, 2010,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">[o]n or about August 19, 2008, Respondent [Dr. Sladky] was evaluated and treatfed] for alcohol dependence at Ridgeview Institute (\u201cRidgeview\u201d). Respondent notified the Board that he was in treatment and agreed not to return to the practice of medicine without the written express permission of the Board. Respondent completed treatment and was discharged on or about November 19, 2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Status Report of May 1, 2013, at 4. Dr. Sladky was permitted to return to the practice of medicine on March 18, 2009. That return to practice was short-lived, however, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">[s]oon after his return to practice, Respondent [Dr. Sladky] had several positive urine tests for ethyl glucuronide, in violation of both his monitoring agreement with Ridgeview and the terms of his Board Order [of March 18,2009].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Accepting the Board\u2019s disciplinary actions in June 2009,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">Respondent [Dr. Sladky] entered the Talbott Recovery Campus (\u201cTRC\u201d) program on June 9, 2009____ After completing inpatient treatment on July 31, 2009, Respondent then entered and completed intensive outpatient treatment, followed by aftercare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-12\"><em>Id. </em>As of March 4, 2010, Dr. Sladky\u2019s petition to lift the suspension of his medical license was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">Dr. Sladky, however, was only granted a probationary license to practice medicine, under the supervision of a physician at his place of employment to monitor Dr. Sladky\u2019s work, and under the supervision of a different physician to monitor Dr. Sladky\u2019s treatment for alchoholism and his use of prescription medications, if any. This probation also included a number of conditions, such as: substance abuse treatment, including weekly group therapy sessions; participation in a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous, including the requirement that he obtain a sponsor so that he could \u201cwork a daily recovery program\u201d; unscheduled drug and alcohol screening tests; and, initial and quarterly reports from both his workplace supervising physician and his substance abuse treatment physician. <em>Id. </em>at 6-8. According to the Board\u2019s order of March 4, 2010, Dr. Sladky would not \u201cbe eligible to petition for termination of probation until five (5) years of continuous sobriety from the effective date of this Consent Order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">More than three and a half years before Dr. Sladky was due, at the earliest, to become eligible to petition for the termination of his probation pursuant to the Board\u2019s order of March 4, 2010, the Board terminated the probation conditions on Dr. Sladky\u2019s license to practice medicine in the State of Georgia, with no substantive commentary. Status Report of May 1, 2013, at 3. The record before the court does not show how the Secretary learned of: (1) Dr. Sladky\u2019s undisclosed substance abuse problem; (2) the first agreement that he not practice medicine; (3) the second and indefinite suspension of his license to practice medicine; and, (4) the probation conditions imposed upon his license by the State of Georgia\u2019s Composite State Board of Medical Examiners. What is clear from the record is that Dr. Sladky was not candid about the events chronicled here with either respondent\u2019s counsel or the court. What is also clear is that petitioner was deprived of any opportunity to elicit testimony from Dr. Sladky as to the actual conditions of his medical practice because Dr. Sladky\u2019s <em>curriculum vitae </em>misrepresented the state of his medical licensure <em>at all times </em>relevant to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">2. A Pattern of Misrepresentation in the <em>Curriculum Vitae </em>Dr. Sladky Submitted in This and Other Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">a. Dr. Sladky\u2019s <em>Curriculum Vitae </em>in This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b488-18\">Dr. Sladky\u2019s <em>curriculum vitae </em>(CV) was submitted by respondent along with his first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>expert report on October 27, 2005, and, pursuant to the special master\u2019s instructions, was refiled as Exhibit J on December 2, 2005 to clarify the docket. The CV was dated \u201cMay 1, 1999,\u201d even though it was submitted to the court six years after that date, and contained information that referenced responsibilities of Dr. Sladky extending to the year 2002. Ex. J at 5. Under the rubric \u201cLicensure,\u201d Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV identified a license to practice medicine in Pennsylvania (No. MD-022838-E).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 3. Respondent does not dispute that Dr. Sladky\u2019s Pennsylvania license expired in 1996, well before the \u201cMay 1, 1999\u201d date on the CV, and almost ten years before Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV was filed in this case. In the court\u2019s view, Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV, bearing no notation that his license in Pennsylvania had expired, misrepresented Dr. Sladky\u2019s credentials. Thus, the expert report filed by Dr. Sladky in 2005 was supported by an inaccurate and misleading CV.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">As the special master and the parties prepared for the 2010 hearing in this case, almost five year\u2019s after respondent had first filed Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV, respondent\u2019s counsel informed the special master and petitioner that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">respondent intends to call John Sladky, M.D., to testify at hearing. As of the filing of this status report, Dr. Sladky has indicated that he is making efforts to appear in person if possible, but will be available by phone, if necessary. Dr. Sladky <em>is preparing </em>a supplemental expert report to address the issues raised by petitioner\u2019s expert, Dr. Steinman. Respondent will file Dr. Sladky\u2019s report, an updated <em>curriculum vitae, </em>and referenced medical articles, no later than March 8,2010.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Status Report of January 27, 2010, at 1 (emphasis added). No updated CV was filed by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The court notes that as of January 27, 2010, Dr. Sladky\u2019s license to practice medicine in Georgia was suspended and his license in Pennsylvania had expired many years before. The following evidence shows that Dr. Sladky was working on his second expert report while his sole \u201cactive\u201d license to practice medicine (in Georgia) was suspended and before his suspended license (in Georgia) was reinstated (with probationary conditions) on March 4, 2010:(1) respondent\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement on January 27, 2010 that Dr. Sladky \u201cis preparing\u201d his second expert report; (2) the detailed analysis of Dr. Stein-man\u2019s opinions in Dr. Sladky\u2019s second expert report; and, (3) the date marked on Dr. Sladky\u2019s expert report, March 4, 2010, which was filed by respondent on March 8, 2010 (lacking a signature) and refiled (with a signature) on March 22, 2010. <em>See </em>Ex. P. Thus, Dr. Sladky\u2019s first expert report was supported by an inaccurate and misleading CV as to licensure in Pennsylvania, and Dr. Sladky\u2019s second expert report was again supported by an inaccurate and misleading CV as to licensure in Pennsylvania. Furthermore, his inaccurate and misleading CV failed to disclose that the second expert report had been composed, at least in part, while Dr. Sladky\u2019s license to practice medicine in Georgia was suspended, and failed to disclose that the report was signed when his license to practice medicine was subject to probationary conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">There is no information in the record which explains why respondent never filed an updated CV for Dr. Sladky to accompany his second expert report, as promised in the January 27, 2010 status report. The court believes that a party in a vaccine injury case has a duty to update or supplement inaccurate information in the record before the special master. <em>See Erve by Erve v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>39 Fed.Cl. 607, 616 (1997) (discussing the obligations of litigants in vaccine cases to disclose relevant evidence, in light of the informal and cooperative discovery procedures used in these cases). Here, Dr. Sladky\u2019s inaccurate CV prevented the special master and petitioner from ascertaining the true nature of Dr. Sladky\u2019s medical practice and credentials at the times he opined as an expert in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>b. Dr. Sladky\u2019s <em>Curriculum Vitae </em>in Other Vaccine Cases before This Court</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Dr. Sladky, to the court\u2019s knowledge, has never submitted an accurate CV in the numerous vaccine eases for which he was engaged by the Secretary as an expert. To cite perhaps the most egregious example of a misleading CV provided by Dr. Sladky, the court turns to <em>Crosby v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 08-799V (Fed. Cl. filed Nov. 10, 2008). The petition in that case was filed on November 10, 2008, during a time when Dr. Sladky was not permitted to practice medicine due to his substance abuse problem. As of September 29, 2009, respondent\u2019s counsel in that case noted that Dr. Sladky \u201chas indicated that he requires additional time to complete his review and prepare a report in this case.\u201d <em>Crosby </em>Status Report of Sept. 29, 2009, at 1. Dr. Sladky\u2019s license to practice medicine, as of September 29, 2009 when he was producing the expert report in <em>Crosby, </em>was suspended due to his substance abuse problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Dr. Sladky\u2019s expert report in <em>Crosby </em>was signed on October 26, 2009, when his license to practice medicine was still suspended due to his alcohol dependence. The CV that supported that expert report, dated \u201cMay 1, 2005\u201d but filed November 2, 2009, asserts under \u201cLicensure\u201d that Dr. Sladky is licensed in both Pennsylvania and Georgia, although in truth he could not practice medicine in either state at the time his report and CV were filed. <em>Crosby </em>Notice of Filing of November 2, 2009, Ex. A Tab 1 at 3. Respondent won that ease, at least in part, because \u201c[b]oth parties presented <em>well credentialed experts </em>\u201d and respondent\u2019s experts, including Dr. Sladky, were found to be more persuasive by the special master. <em>Crosby v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 08-799V, slip op. at 2 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. June 20, 2012) (emphasis added). Respondent did not file a status report in that ease disclosing the Sec-retards discovery of Dr. Sladky\u2019s undisclosed substance abuse problem, licensure difficulties and lack of candor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">To cite only a few more examples, Dr. Sladky\u2019s pattern of submitting inaccurate CVs in vaccine cases cannot be described as anything other than consistent. In Case No. 09-293V, on April 22, 2011 respondent filed a \u201cJanuary 5, 2009\u201d version of Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV, asserting \u201cLicensure\u201d in Pennsylvania (although that license had expired approximately twelve years before the date of the CV) and \u201cLicensure\u201d in Georgia (although that license was suspended as of the date of the CV). In Case No. 08-763V, on May 24, 2010 respondent filed a \u201cMay 1, 2005\u201d version of Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV, asserting \u201cLicensure\u201d in Pennsylvania (although that license had expired more than eight years before the date of the CV). In Case No. 10-717V, on September 30, 2011 respondent filed a \u201cMay, 2011\u201d version of Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV, which continued to assert \u201cLicensure\u201d in Pennsylvania (although that license had expired over fourteen years before the date of the CV).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The court believes that it is wrong to assume that the submission of consistently inaccurate CVs was inadvertent or the product of laziness on Dr. Sladky\u2019s part. He obviously was updating his CV throughout this period by changing the date on the first page of the document (although that date never appears to have matched the date of the expert report it supported). He also was, in some instances, adding recent publications to his CV. Furthermore, it is clear from the <em>Crosby </em>ease, in particular, that Dr. Sladky had an updated, if inaccurate, CV dated \u201cMay 1, 2005\u201d that was available to be filed by respondent on November 2, 2009 in that case, but which was <em>not </em>filed in early 2010 in this case, as promised by respondent\u2019s counsel. The court cannot minimize the misrepresentations in the CVs Dr. Sladky has submitted in vaccine eases,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>that Dr. Sladky was removed as an expert from at least one vaccine case (which later settled). <em>See </em>Resp.\u2019s May 17, 2013 Status Report, <em>Covin by Strand v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 08-763V (Fed. Cl. closed Mar. 31, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">3. Three Examples of Misleading or Incomplete Testimony Regarding Dr. Sladky\u2019s Medical Practice'</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">a. Dr. Sladky\u2019s Testimony in This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">There is no indication that Dr. Sladky perjured himself on April 20, 2010 in the evidentiary hearing before the special master in this case. He did not state, and was not asked to state, whether he was licensed to practice medicine in Pennsylvania and Georgia. He was not asked whether his license to practice medicine was on probation (which it was at the time he testified), and he was not asked whether he had been subject to disciplinary proceedings which led to the suspension of his license. There is also no indication that his employment status as \u201csenior faculty\u201d in the Department of Pediatric Neurology at Emory University School of Medicine was misrepresented. Tr. at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The court notes, however, that the testimony of Dr. Sladky was founded on the CV respondent submitted on December 2, 2005. <em>See </em>Tr. at 278; Ex. J. As noted <em>supra, </em>that CV, for which an updated version was never proffered, asserted licensure in Pennsylvania. That \u201cMay 1, 1999\u201d CV also stated that Dr. Sladky was Chief of the Division of Pediatric Neurology at Emory, under the rubric \u201cHospital Appointments.\u201d Ex. J at 3. Whether that hospital appointment was still in place when Dr. Sladky testified is unclear. In the court\u2019s view, Dr. Sladky\u2019s testimony, like his CV, failed to fully represent the existing state of his credentials and the existing conditions of his medical practice, as is further evidenced below.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In general terms, Dr. Sladky testified that \u201cI see patients,\u201d that \u201cI see patients every week,\u201d and that \u201c[I] attend on the inpatient neurology service roughly three months a year, a little less.\u201d Tr. at 275. He described his work as a \u201c[pjretty standard, busy clinical and academic lifestyle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>More specifically, Dr. Sladky testified that \u201cprobably half\u2019 of his working hours are devoted to clinical time, and that \u201cI see patients every week, usually five half days a week, probably average 40-50 patients a week.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">This testimony by Dr. Sladky was provided on April 20, 2010, forty-seven days after he was permitted to return to the practice of medicine in Georgia. If the court were to consider the two-year period of time leading up to this testimony, Dr. Sladky was only licensed to practice medicine for eight and a half of those twenty-four months, and more than one month of the time that he <em>was </em>licensed to practice medicine during that period was under supervised probation. When this factual context is considered, Dr. Sladky\u2019s testimony that he sees patients every week; that probably half of his working hours are clinical time; that he attends on inpatient service a little less than three months a year; and that he probably averages 40-50 patients a week, is misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">Whether Dr. Sladky was attempting to describe his recently restored medical practice that resumed on March 4, 2010, aptly using the present tense, or whether Dr. Sladky was attempting to paint an impressionistic picture of his longterm tenure- at Emory, imprecisely using the present tense, the description of his medical practice that he provided the special master' and opposing counsel in his testimony cannot be reconciled with the interruptions in his medical practice caused by his substance abuse and licensure problems. Like his inaccurate CV, Dr. Sladky\u2019s testimony was misleading as to his experience and qualifications to- testify as an expert. Unfortunately, the hearing in this vaccine ease is not the only time that Dr. Sladky\u2019s testimony glossed over and hid the fact that he was prevented from practicing medicine for fifteen and a half months between 2008 and 2010, and that his license to practice medicine was on probation for over a year in 2010 and 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>b. Dr. Sladky\u2019s Testimony in Other Vaccine Cases before This Court</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Only two special masters, besides the special master presiding over this case, have commented on the hearing testimony of Dr. Sladky once his lack of candor was disclosed by the Secretary. In <em>Roberts v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 09-427V, 2013 WL 5314698, at *9 (Fed.Cl.Spec.Mstr. Aug. 29, 2013), the special master noted that Dr. Sladky had been on a probationary license to practice medicine when he submitted his expert reports in that case. Although Dr. Sladky\u2019s hearing testimony in <em>Roberts </em>was provided after that probationary period had terminated, the special master was troubled by Dr. Sladky\u2019s lack of candor, noting that \u201cin discussing his qualifications at the hearing, no mention was made of [licensure suspension problems] and such information was glossed over.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In <em>Raymo v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 11-654V, 2014 WL 1092274, at *14 (Fed. Cl.Spec.Mstr. Feb. 24, 2014), the special master noted, first, that Dr. Sladky \u201cwas properly licensed throughout his involvement with th[at] case.\u201d Nonetheless, the special master observed that the CV provided by Dr. Sladky in <em>Raymo, </em>dated \u201cJanuary 5, 2009,\u201d was inaccurate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">I looked carefully at the testimony of Dr. Sladky and his CV, filed as Res. Ex. B. Although filed with his expert report in February 2012, his CV is dated January 5, 2009. His CV therefore was written or updated near the end of the period during which Dr. Sladky had agreed not to practice medicine. However, Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV does not reflect that he had taken leave from his hospital appointments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>Id. </em>at *15 (citation omitted). The special master then turned to the testimony provided by Dr. Sladky as to his qualifications as an expert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">Doctor Sladky was ... careful ... to avoid perjuring himself. He testified that he began working at Emory University in 1995 and had recently retired and moved to a private practice in Atlanta. He did not mention that between 1995 and 2012 there were periods when he had a suspended medical license or practiced only on a probationary basis. When asked to describe his day-to-day activities while at Emory and in his current position, he carefully prefaced his answer with \u201cwhen I was on service.\u201d This preface could reflect the difference in his roles when performing medical duties versus his administrative or teaching duties. Alternatively, it could be considered a carefully crafted answer to avoid giving perjured testimony. By specifying that his answer pertained to the time periods when he was practicing medicine, he avoided the necessity of indicating that there were periods when he was not able to practice medicine due to the suspension of his medical license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-10\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">This special master, too, was troubled by Dr. Sladky\u2019s avoidance of the topic of his licensure problems. The following passage reflects the special master\u2019s conclusions as to the misleading nature of the testimony provided by Dr. Sladky:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">I administer an oath to witnesses that requires that they tell the whole truth. Neither ... nor Dr. Sladky told the whole truth. Both demonstrated a lack of candor that, although not related directly to the substance of their causation opinions, re-fleet[s] their willingness to, at the very least, shade the truth____ In the case of Dr. Sladky, it appears that he so feared the loss of his position and income as a case reviewer for respondent that he withheld facts concerning his medical license suspension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-15\"><em>Id. </em>at *16. Thus, in both <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Ray-mo, </em>Dr. Sladky\u2019s testimony was viewed in a negative light because of his misleading statements regarding his medical practice and qualifications to opine as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">4. Credibility and Reliability Determinations in Other Vaccine Cases Based on Dr. Sladky\u2019s Lack of Candor</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">The credibility and reliability determinations regarding the overall value of Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions in <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Raymo </em>are not exactly the same. In <em>Roberts, </em>the special master merely noted that Dr. Sladky\u2019s repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>sentations regarding his qualifications were \u201cquestionable,\u201d and that the recently revealed information about his licensure problems gave her \u201cpause.\u201d 2013 WL 5314698, at *9. Her conclusion regarding his opinions, based on the candor issue as well as the substantive content of his opinions, was that she \u201cd[id] not find Dr. Sladky\u2019s testimony as reliable and persuasive as the testimony of [two of the petitioners\u2019 experts].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">In <em>Raymo, </em>on the other hand, Dr. Sladky\u2019s credibility was destroyed by his lack of candor regarding his licensure problems. The special master considered not only Dr. Sladky\u2019s lack of candor in the case before her, but also his lack of candor in other vaccine cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVcG\">Standing alone, the basis for Dr. Sladky\u2019s disciplinary action might not affect the reliability of his expert opinions. However, his failure to disclose the disciplinary action to respondent, his authoring of expert opinions while he did not have an active medical license, and the failure to reflect his voluntary leave from medical practice due to a substance abuse problem on the CV filed in this case all east doubt about his credibility as a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><em>Raymo, </em>2014 WL 1092274, at *15. She therefore did not rely at all on the opinion of Dr. Sladky for her entitlement decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">It is perhaps noteworthy that petitioners in both <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Raymo </em>prevailed on entitlement, at least in part because the expert opinion of Dr. Sladky was of lessened or no value to respondent\u2019s arguments in those cases. <em>Raymo, </em>2014 WL 1092274, at *17 (\u201cBecause I attach no weight to the opinions of Drs. Sladky and ..., [petitioners\u2019 expert\u2019s] opinion is largely unrebutted.\u201d); <em>Roberts, </em>2013 WL 5314698, at *11 (basing her decision regarding entitlement on the special master\u2019s \u201creview of the evidence and an assessment of the reliability of the opinions of the various expert witnesses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">B. The Special Master\u2019s Assessment of Dr. Sladky\u2019s Credibility and Reliability in This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The special master\u2019s ruling on the credibility and reliability of Dr. Sladky, rendered after the parties hotly contested the importance of the Secretary\u2019s disclosures, is ambiguous. In the section of the opinion devoted to Dr. Sladky\u2019s credibility and reliability as an expert, the special master states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">The Secretary does not dispute that Dr. Sladky should have disclosed the information concerning his health issues and the effect they had on his ability to practice medicine. The failure to disclose this important information bears on his credibility and reliability as an expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">However, the lack of disclosure and (implicit) misrepresentation about qualifications does not entirely negate Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinion. Dr. Sladky established his opinion almost three years before his license was suspended and it has not changed throughout the course of these proceedings. As the Secretary asserted, it does not appear that Dr. Sladky\u2019s personal health issues or his licensure problems affected his opinions in any way. In addition, Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions are consistent with the opinions of other witnesses. This corroboration shows that Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions retain some value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Opin. at 7 (citations and footnote omitted). A later comment on the credibility and reliability of Dr. Sladky is presented in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">The [causation] analysis in the text does not rely upon Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinion extensively. Thus, under the circumstances in which the Secretary presented the opinion of a different doctor, the problems in Dr. Sladky\u2019s licensing and the non-disclosure of these problems ha[ve] minimal effect on this ease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 71 n. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">1. Minimizing the Importance of Dr. Sladky\u2019s Misrepresentations and Misleading Testimony for Credibility and Reliability Determinations</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">The court observes, first, that the special master appears to dismiss Dr. Sladky\u2019s substance abuse problem and lack of candor as relatively unimportant. <em>See </em>Opin. at 71 n. 51; <em>see also supra </em>note 8. The special master notes, for example, that Dr. Sladky never saw Jessie as a patient, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>comments that petitioner did not establish \u201cthat a suspension of a license to practice medicine means that the person may not provide opinions based upon the person\u2019s training and experience.\u201d Opin. at 6. The more salient issue, in the court\u2019s view, is whether a physician engaged as an expert by the Secretary should have revealed to respondent\u2019s counsel that his expert report was created, at least in part, during a time period when the physician\u2019s license to practice medicine was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">At this late date, it may not be helpful to inquire whether the special master\u2019s assumptions regarding the severity and duration of Dr. Sladky\u2019s substance abuse problem are correct. <em>See </em>Opin. at 7 (\u201cDr. Sladky established his opinion almost three years before his license was suspended and it has not changed throughout the course of these proceedings. As the Secretary asserted, it does not appear that Dr. Sladky\u2019s personal health issues or his licensure problems affected his opinions in any way.\u201d). The court cannot ignore, however, the fact that the special master improperly conflated Dr. Sladky\u2019s 2005 expert report with his 2010 expert report and hearing testimony, in a manner that minimizes Dr. Sladky\u2019s credibility problems:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHx\">[T]he lack of disclosure and (implicit) misrepresentation about qualifications does not entirely negate Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinion. Dr. Sladky established <em>his opinion </em>almost three years before his license was suspended and it has not changed throughout the course of these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Opin. at 7 (emphasis added). Dr. Sladky provided more than one <em>opinion </em>in this ease, as the record clearly shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">At the time of the filing of Dr. Sladky\u2019s first report, petitioner\u2019s expert Dr. Steinman had not yet opined on causation and the subsidiary issues relevant to causation. Dr. Sladky\u2019s second expert report is not a carbon copy of his first report\u2014it was filed \u201cto address the issues raised by petitioner\u2019s expert, Dr. Steinman.\u201d Resp.\u2019s Status Report of January 27, 2010, at 1; <em>see </em>Tr. at 279 (direct examination confirming that Dr. Sladky\u2019s second report, Ex. P, \u201cwas in response to Dr. Steinman\u2019s report\u201d); Ex. P at 1 (\u201cI have been asked to comment on supplementary opinions which have been provided to this court regarding the above referenced matter. I have not previously reviewed these documents as they were submitted after I prepared my initial report in 2005.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Dr. Sladky\u2019s <em>opinions </em>on many issues considered by the special master were presented in his second expert report or later at the hearing; it cannot be said that Dr. Sladky\u2019s sole opinion was presented first in 2005 and never changed thereafter. To the extent that a specific Dr. Sladky opinion disagrees with a specific proposition advanced by Dr. Steinman in this case, Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinion is necessarily of a 2010 vintage, not a 2005 vintage. <em>See </em>Tr. at 321-22 (noting that he had only worked on this case, after 2005, not long \u201cbefore we came here [for the 2010 hearing]\u201d). To obtain some of these 2010 vintage opinions, Dr. Sladky was cross-examined about his second report, which was signed and filed in 2010. <em>Id. </em>at 353. He was also examined as to his (2010 vintage) view of certain opinions of Dr. Steinman. <em>Id. </em>at 371-72, 381-82, 389-90, 396, 402-03.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, it cannot be said that Dr. Sladky\u2019s <em>opinion </em>did not change or was consistent after 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">In the court\u2019s view, the proposition that Dr. Sladky\u2019s supposedly \u201creliable\u201d 2005 opinions somehow validate later opinions tainted by a documented substance abuse problem, disciplinary actions preventing him from practicing medicine, and a lack of candor, is flawed. Dr. Sladky\u2019s hearing testimony, it should be noted, contains <em>some </em>consistent opinions but also contains <em>some </em>newly-proffered opinions, and these 2010 vintage opinions were considered by the special master in his decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The body of Dr. Sladky\u2019s oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>testimony, which was highly-detailed and went far beyond the analysis presented in his five-page 2005 expert report, must largely stand or fall based on Dr. Sladky\u2019s credibility <em>when he was testifying </em>in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The only other flaw in the special master\u2019s analysis of the \u201ccredibility and reliability\u201d of Dr. Sladky worth noting is that of an illogical reliance on \u201ccorroboration.\u201d Opin. at 7. Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions retain some value, according to the special master, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIX\">Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions are consistent with the opinions of other witnesses. This corroboration shows that Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions retain some value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). One could interpret this statement as suggesting that the fact-finder may abdicate his role as the assessor of credibility of expert witnesses whenever the witness in question offers statements that are in harmony with statements from other expert witnesses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Such a practice would avoid making credibility determinations in the first instance and would proceed directly to the weighing of available evidence without first determining whether that evidence is reliable. This approach violates binding precedent which requires special masters to assess the credibility, in appropriate instances, of expert witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">Finders of fact are entitled\u2014indeed, <em>ex</em>pected\u2014to make determinations as to the reliability of the evidence presented to them and, if appropriate, as to the credibility of the persons presenting that evidence ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">In this ease, the special master applied the correct legal standard and found, based in part on the unconvincing nature of the expert evidence and the <em>lack of</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">many other Dr. Sladky opinions were disclosed or refined in 2010. <em>credibility of the petitioners\u2019 expert, </em>that the petitioners failed to prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-12\"><em>Moberly ex rel. Moberly v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>592 F.3d 1315, 1326 (Fed.Cir.2010) (emphasis added). If there has ever been an appropriate instance in a Vaccine Act case where a special master must first assess the credibility of an expert witness, Dr. Sladky\u2019s testimony and opinions provide that circumstance. In the court\u2019s view, before the special master can assess whether Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions are convincing or persuasive, he must first determine whether or not Dr. Sladky is a credible witness providing reliable opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">2. Lack of Clarity as to the Assessment of Dr. Sladky\u2019s Credibility and Reliability</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">The court has attempted to reconcile the special master\u2019s statements regarding Dr. Sladky\u2019s credibility and reliability. These statements include: (1) \u201cDr. Sladky\u2019s opinions retain some value\u201d; (2) \u201cThe analysis in the text does not rely upon Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinion extensively\u201d; and, (3) \u201c[U]nder the circumstances in which the Secretary presented the opinion of a different doctor, the problems in Dr. Sladky\u2019s licensing and the non-disclosure of these problems ha[ve] minimal effect on this case.\u201d Opin. at 7, 71 n. 51. These statements, in the court\u2019s view, lack precision and frustrate review. Furthermore, not only are these statements vague, but the text of the decision contradicts the assertion that Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions have not been relied upon extensively.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">The special master\u2019s decision includes extensive citations to Dr. Sladky\u2019s specific opinions on a number of issues relevant to the special master\u2019s decision on entitlement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Reference is made to Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions on almost <em>every </em>decisive issue in this case\u2014 these references are found on pages 11 n. 6, 17, 27-29, 36-37, 46 &amp; n. 35, 48-52, 54, 59-60, 65-68, 70-71, and 74 of the special master\u2019s decision. Dr. Sladky\u2019s substance abuse, licensure problems and lack of candor may indeed have had \u201cminimal effect\u201d on the special master\u2019s ruling on entitlement, but the effect of the disclosure of these issues remains ambiguous. The special master\u2019s decision reviewed here does not clearly state the special master\u2019s determinations regarding the credibility of Dr. Sladky and the reliability of Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions. The court therefore remands this case to the special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">III. Instructions for Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Three clarifications are needed before the court can determine whether the special master has abused his discretion in relying on the expert opinions of Dr. Sladky. First, the special master must address Dr. Sladky\u2019s credibility and reliability in light of the consistent pattern of misrepresentations by Dr. Sladky in his work as an expert for respondent, and provide an unambiguous estimation of Dr. Sladky\u2019s credibility and reliability as an expert.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Second, the special master must compare Dr. Sladky\u2019s credibility to the credibility of the experts for petitioner and the witnesses testifying for petitioner. These clarified credibility determinations should then be integrated into the special master\u2019s decision in a manner that presents a clear ruling on entitlement for this court\u2019s review.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Third, for the sake of judicial economy, the special master must present an alternative ruling on causation which completely disregards all of Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions and testimony. This alternative ruling should be adequately detailed to provide this court with holdings that may either be sustained or vacated should this court (or a higher court) determine that Dr. Sladky\u2019s testimony should not have been considered at all in this ease once the disclosures regarding Dr. Sladky had been provided by the Secretary to the special master. In the unique circumstances of this ease, it would be inefficient to further delay proceedings with another remand to the special master should this court find manifest error in the special master\u2019s level of reliance on the opinions of Dr. Sladky.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">For all of the above-stated reasons, the court remands this case to the special master so that his credibility and reliability determinations, as well as his holdings regarding causation, are clearly presented for review. Specifically, for this court to determine whether or not the special master\u2019s evidentiary rulings regarding Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions were manifestly erroneous, the special master must follow the instructions for remand provided in this opinion. <em>See, e.g., Piscopo, </em>66 Fed.Cl. at 53 (\u201cDeterminations as to the qualification of experts and the admissibility of their testimony, including an evaluation of whether the opinion is reliable and relevant, are generally within the discretion of a trial judge, and are reviewed for an abuse of discretion, [and] only overturned if manifestly erroneous.\u201d) (citations omitted). The court cannot undertake a review of the special master\u2019s ultimate ruling on entitlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>without the clarifications specified in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">(1) Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Review, filed December 19, 2013, is GRANTED;</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">(2) The decision of the special master, filed November 19, 2013, is SET ASIDE and VACATED;</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">(3) This case is REMANDED to the special master, pursuant to Vaccine Rule 27(c), for proceedings in accordance with the principles of law and the instructions set forth in this opinion; and</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">(4) The parties shall separately FILE any proposed redactions to this opinion, with the text to be redacted clearly marked out or otherwise indicated in brackets, on or before June 6, 2014.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b485-13\">. The court cites not to the Westlaw version of the special master\u2019s opinion on remand, but follows the practice of the parties and cites to the opinion version (Opin.) available on this court\u2019s website.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-21\">. Hereinafter the court will refer to Mr. Contreras as \"petitioner\u201d or \"Jessie,\u201d because he was thirteen years old at the time of his alleged vaccine injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\">. All citations to the transcript (Tr.) in this opinion are to the transcript of the 2010 hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\">. Dr. Sladky signed his second expert report on March 4, 2010, provided the report to respondent\u2019s counsel by March 8, 2010, and testified in this case on April 20, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">. Dr. Sladky\u2019s license number in Pennsylvania, MD-022838-E, should not be read to include a designation \"E\u201d for \"expired.\u201d Active and expired medical licenses in that state may bear the \"E\u201d designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\">. The court assumes this failure to disclose relevant information was inadvertent, because the Secretary was diligent in filing status reports in other vaccine cases for which Dr. Sladky was retained as an expert, whether or not those cases were open or closed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b490-10\">. The special master commented that \u201cit is difficult to say\u201d whether the representations as to licensure in Pennsylvania on Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV were \"due to forgetfulness or due to intent.\u201d Opin. at 7. That may be true when this case is viewed in isolation. It is harder to attribute the inaccuracies in Dr. Sladky\u2019s CV to forgetfulness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>when one considers that Dr. Sladky exhibited a lack of candor regarding his licensure problems in multiple vaccine cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\">. These transcript citations are limited to instances where Dr. Steinman was mentioned by name. There are other examples in Dr. Sladky's testimony where propositions advanced by Dr. Steinman were referenced but his name was not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\">. To cite one example, Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinion regarding the significance of a certain reflex test was cited by the special master. Opin. at 11 n. 6, 28. That particular Dr. Sladky opinion was not presented in 2005. <em>See </em>Ex. I. Although certain opinions, such as Dr. Sladky's opinion regarding the timing of the onset of Jessie's disease, did not evolve in any substantive way,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\">. An additional weakness in the special master's reliance on the \"corroboration\u201d of Dr. Sladky's opinions is the special master's imprecise characterization of this corroboration as corroboration provided by \"other witnesses.\u201d Opin. at 7 &amp; n. 4. The corroboration for Dr. Sladky\u2019s diagnosis of Jessie\u2019s illness, for example, is provided not by any testifying witness, affidavit or declaration, but by the special master's interpretation of excerpts from Jessie\u2019s medical records. <em>See </em>Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 16 (\u201cNone of these four physicians [upon whose commentary in Jessie\u2019s medical records the special master relied] provided any written opinions to be considered or testimony at the hearing.\u201d); Opin. at 7 n. 4 (\"Dr. Sladky's opinion matches the diagnosis of Mr. Contreras\u2019s treating neurologist [who did not testify at the hearing or provide a declaration].\u201d), 25-26 (citing medical records found in Exs. 7, 82), 29-30 &amp; nn. 23-24 (citing medical records found in Ex. 7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. A distinction should be drawn between the <em>content </em>of Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions, which may match the special master\u2019s view of the case, and the <em>credibility </em>of Dr. Sladky as an expert who provided two expert reports and testimony in this case. In essence, the question of <em>credibility </em>focuses on whether Dr. Sladky was a reliable source of expert opinion in this case, not whether his opinions, as buttressed by other expert opinion and evidence, were persuasive on particular issues. <em>See </em>Opin. at 7 (\u201cThe failure to disclose this important information bears on [Dr. Sladky\u2019s] credibility and reliability as an expert witness.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b496-11\">. The special master may choose to revise his substantive rulings in this case based on his clarified credibility rulings, or may re-issue the substantive rulings of the opinion with only minor modifications which clarify the sections discussing the credibility of witnesses and the reliability of expert opinion in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b496-12\">. The court issues no holding here as to the appropriateness of any particular level of reliance on Dr. Sladky's opinions. It is the <em>potential </em>for a ruling requiring the exclusion of Dr. Sladky\u2019s opinions and testimony that militates for an alternative finding on causation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
