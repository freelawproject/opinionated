The second area includes 355,874 acres in the Kaibab National Forest. 1/2/13 Hefton Decl. \u00b6 10. Plaintiff asserted these claims, pursuant to the Mining Law of 1872, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 22-47, that \u201cauthorizes citizens to stake, or \u2018locate,\u2019 a valid mining claim upon \u2018discovery\u2019 of a valuable mineral deposit on public lands.\u201d <em>Copar Pumice Co., Inc. v.

At some unidentified time thereafter, Plaintiff submitted a plan of operations to the Forest Service. 8/8/13 Sehuppert Decl. \u00b6 9. On April 8, 2010, the Forest Service informed Plaintiff, in a letter addressed to Mr. Hefton, of the steps necessary to obtain a valid existing rights determination and scheduled a field examination for May 3, 2010. 8/8/13 Sehuppert Decl. Ex. A. On May 7, 2010, Mr. Hefton participated in a teleconference with various representatives from the Forest Service, during which Mr. Hefton inquired about the consequences if Plaintiff withdrew its pending plan of operations. 8/8/13 Sehuppert Deck Ex. C at 2. That same day, Mark Schwab, a Forest Service Mineral Examiner, informed Mr. Hefton via email that if \u201cthe [pjlan of [operations is withdrawn, there would be no need to conduct [a valid existing rights] determination of the subject mining claims, and the [valid existing rights] examination would not occur.\u201d 8/8/13 Sehuppert Decl.

Later that day, Mr. Hefton withdrew Plaintiffs proposed, submitted plan of operations and all other plans of operation \u201con all of [Plaintiffs] projects in the Kaibab National Forest[.]\u201d 8/8/13 Sehuppert Decl. Ex. C at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On June 21, 2011, close to the expiration of the two-year Withdrawal Notice, Interior issued an \u201cemergency six month withdrawal order of the subject Federal lands,\u201d pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cFLPMA\u201d).

Reg. 2,563-01 (Jan. 18, 2012) (the \u201cWithdrawal Order\u201d). The Withdrawal Order became effective on January 21, 2012. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">On September 27, 2012, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims, alleging that the Withdrawal Order violated: the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cNEPA\u201d); FLPMA; the Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-406, 98 Stat. 1485 (\u201cAWA\u201d), and regulations adopted to implement each of these statutes. Complaint, <em>Vane Minerals v. United States, </em>No. 12-cv-646 (Fed.Cl. Sept. 27, 2012), ECF No. 1. The September 27, 2012 Complaint sought damages under two theories: inverse condemnation and estoppel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">On November 26, 2012, the Government filed a Motion To Dismiss, pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1), arguing that the court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims alleged in the September 27, 2012 Complaint, because Plaintiff previously filed Complaints-In-Intervention on June 4, 2012 and June 27, 2012 in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona in eases that arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>from the same set of operative facts as the suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On December 26, 2012, Plaintiff filed a Notice in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona requesting that the June 4, 2012 and June 27, 2012 Complaints-In-Intervention be dismissed, without prejudice. <em>See Yount v. Salazar, </em>No. 3:ll-cv-8171 (D.Ariz. Dec. 26, 2012), ECF No. 86. On January 8, 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona dismissed Plaintiffs Complaints, without prejudice. <em>See Yount v. Salazar, </em>No. 3:11-cv-8171, 2013 WL 93372 (D.Ariz. Jan. 8, 2013), ECF No. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">On January 2, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Response to the Government\u2019s November 26, 2012 Motion To Dismiss. On January 22, 2013, the Government filed a Reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">On May 29, 2013, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued a Memorandum Opinion And Final Order, determining \u201cthat 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 divests the court of jurisdiction ..., because at the time of the filing of the September 27, 2012 Complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims, Plaintiff was a party to two prior related eases in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, arising from the same set of operative facts.\u201d <em>See Vane Minerals (US), LLC v. United States, </em>111 Fed.Cl. 253, 255-56 (2013) <em>(\u201cVane I </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">On June 21, 2013, Plaintiff filed a second Complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims that is almost identical to that dismissed on May 29, 2013 in <em>Vane I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The Complaint alleges that, within the Withdrawal Area, 3,350 mining claims are located, including 678 of Plaintiffs unpatented lode mining claims constituting 20.2% of that total and an \u201cestimated undiscovered uranium endowment of 12,250 tons of uranium oxide.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 57(a)-(e). Approximately 1,837 tons of uranium oxide underlying Plaintiffs claims is commercially feasible to mine, representing a projected net value to Plaintiff (after deducting projected development expenses) of \u201cbetween $68,550,000 and $123,615,000.\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57(d)-58. To date, the BLM and Forest Service have refused to allow Plaintiff to explore its mining claims or locate additional claims. Compl. \u00b660. In particular, the Complaint alleges that the Withdrawal Notice effectively prevented Plaintiff from engaging in mining operations until the BLM prepared a mineral examination report, confirming that Plaintiff had made a \u201cmineral discovery.\u201d 1/2/13 Hefton Decl. \u00b6 11 (citing 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3809.100<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>); <em>see also </em>PL Resp. 6 (\u201cHad the [Withdrawal Notice], and later the [Withdrawal [Order], not been in effect, the Forest Service would not have required mineral examinations or demonstrations of mineral discoveries as a condition of approving [Plaintiffs] plan of operations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">The June 21, 2013 Complaint alleges two causes of action: \u201cInverse Condemnation\u201d (Count I) and \u201cEstoppel\u201d (Count II). Insofar as Count I is concerned, the June 21, 2013 Complaint alleges that, as a result of the Withdrawal Order, Plaintiff has been \u201cdeprived all economic and other benefits of its property interests in the 678 lode mining claims located within [the Withdrawal Area].\u201d Compl. \u00b6 62. Count II is referred to, in the alternative, as a claim for \u201cestoppel\u201d (Compl. 18), \u201cpromissory estoppel\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 3), and/or \u201cequitabl[e] estoppe[l].\u201d Compl. \u00b6 69. In particular, Count II alleges that Plaintiff: (1) \u201csuffered as a result of [Plaintiffs] reliance upon longstanding congressional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>administrative representations that the [Withdrawal Area] would remain open for mining\u201d (Compl. 19); (2) is entitled to \u201cexploration costs under the concept of promissory estoppel\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 3); and/or (3) is entitled to damages, because the Government is \u201cequitably estopped from enforcing the [Withdrawal Order] such that, if the [Withdrawal Order] is not reversed, [Plaintiff] is entitled to damages equal to the amounts it spent on its mineral exploration program\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 70).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The June 21, 2013 Complaint seeks $68,550,000 in compensation for the Government\u2019s \u201ctaking\u201d of Plaintiffs 678 unpatented lode mining claims, and $8,500,000 to reimburse Plaintiff for expenditures made in reliance on the uranium exploration program. Compl. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On August 20, 2013, the Government filed a Motion To Dismiss (\u201cGov\u2019t Mot.\u201d), pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), together with: (1) the 8/5/13 Declaration of Rody Cox, a geologist in the BLM Arizona Strip Field Office; and (2) the 8/8/13 Declaration of Elizabeth Sehuppert, a Forest Service Forester, employed in the Kaibab National Forest.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On September 20, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Response (\u201cPL Resp.\u201d), together with: (1) the 1/2/13 Declaration of Kris Hefton, Plaintiffs Chief Operating Officer; (2) a copy of a United States District Court for the District of Arizona\u2019s Opinion And Order denying in part, and granting in part, the Government\u2019s Motion To Dismiss in <em>Yount v. Salazar (Yount v. Salazar, </em>No. 3:11-cv-8171, 2013 WL 93372 (D.Ariz. Jan. 8, 2013), ECF No. 87); and (3) an excerpt of the Northern Arizona Proposed Withdrawal Final Environmental Impact Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">On November 8, 2013, the Government filed a Reply (\u201cGov\u2019t Reply\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">III. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">A. Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">The United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, \u201cto render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in eases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). The Tucker Act, however, is \u201ca jurisdictional statute; it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages____ [T]he Act merely confers jurisdiction upon [the United States Court of Federal Claims] whenever the substantive right exists.\u201d <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Therefore, to pursue a substantive right under the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify and plead an independent contractual relationship, Constitutional provision, federal statute, and/or executive agency regulation that provides a substantive right to money damages. <em>See Todd v. United States, </em>386 F.3d 1091, 1094 (Fed.Cir.2004) (\u201c[Jurisdiction under the Tucker Act requires the litigant to identify a substantive right for money damages against the United States separate from the Tucker Act itself.\u201d); <em>see also Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.Cir.2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cThe Tucker Act ... does not create a substantive cause of action; ... a plaintiff must identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages---- [T]hat source must be \u2018money-mandating.\u2019 \u201d). Specifically, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the source of substantive law upon which he relies \u201ccan fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 216, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983) (quoting <em>Testan, </em>424 U.S. at 400, 96 S.Ct. 948). And, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Reynolds v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed.Cir.1988) (\u201c[0]nce the [trial] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction [is] put in question.... [the plaintiff] bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-17\">B. Standard Of Review For A Motion To Dismiss Pursuant To RCFC 12(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-18\">A challenge to the United States Court of Federal Claims\u2019 \u201cgeneral power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>adjudicate in specific areas of substantive law ... is properly raised by a [Rule] 12(b)(1) motion[.]\u201d <em>Palmer v. United States, </em>168 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed.Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>RCFC 12(b) (\u201cEvery defense to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading if one is required. But a party may assert the following defenses by motion: (1) lack of subject-matter jurisdiction[.]\u201d). When considering whether to dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the court generally is \u201cobligated to assume all factual allegations of the complaint to be true and to draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Henke v. United States, </em>60 F.3d 795, 797 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">C. Standard Of Review For A Motion To Dismiss Pursuant To RCFC 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">A challenge to the United States Court of Federal Claims\u2019 \u201c[ability] to exercise its general power with regard to the facts peculiar to the specific claim ... is raised by a [Rule] 12(b)(6) motionf.]\u201d <em>Palmer, </em>168 F.3d at 1313; <em>see also </em>RCFC 12(b)(6) (\u201cEvery defense to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading____[b]ut a party may assert the following defenses by motion: ... (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">When considering whether to dismiss an action for failure to state a claim, the court \u201cmust assess whether the complaint adequately states a claim and whether plaintiffs can allege facts plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with) a showing of entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Hutchens v. United States, </em>89 Fed.Cl. 553, 562 (2009) (internal citations omitted). A claim has facial plausibility when \u201cthe plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The plaintiffs factual allegations must be substantial enough to raise the right to relief \u201cabove the speculative level,\u201d accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and \u201cindulg[ing] all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant.\u201d <em>Hutchens, </em>89 Fed.Cl. at 562 (citing <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">D. Applicable Statutory And Regulatory Framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">Plaintiffs 678 unpatented mining claims, located on Forest Service and BLM lands, are governed by the Mining Law of 1872 that \u201cencourages citizens to locate valuable mineral deposits on public land owned by the federal [Government,\u201d <em>Grover v. United States, </em>73 Fed.Appx. 401, 402 (Fed.Cir.2003), and authorizes American citizens to \u201clocate\u201d valid mining claims after \u201cdiscovery\u201d of valuable mineral deposits and compliance with applicable legal requirements. <em>Chrisman v. Miller, </em>197 U.S. 313, 322-23, 25 S.Ct. 468, 49 L.Ed. 770 (1905); <em>see also United States v. Coleman, </em>390 U.S. 599, 602, 88 S.Ct. 1327, 20 L.Ed.2d 170 (1968) (recognizing that Congress enacted the Mining Law of 1872 so that the certain public lands would be \u201cavailable to people for the purpose of mining valuable mineral deposits\u201d). The discovery of a valid mining claim occurs when the claimant demonstrates that a reasonably prudent person would be justified in expending effort to further develop the claim. <em>See Best v. Humboldt Placer Min. Co., </em>371 U.S. 334, 335-36, 83 S.Ct. 379, 9 L.Ed.2d 350 (1963) (\u201c[The] discovery must be of such a character that \u2018a person of ordinary prudence would be justified in the further expenditure of his labor and means, with a reasonable prospect of success, in developing a valuable mine.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Castle v.

A mining claimant also must establish that \u201cthe mineral can be extracted, removed, and marketed at a profit.\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>390 U.S. at 600, 88 S.Ct. 1327 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Congress, however, subsequently enacted Section 204(c) of FLPMA, that authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw lands of five thousand acres or more from location and entry under the Mining Law, \u201cfor a period of not more than twenty years.\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1714(e)(1). That authority includes lands managed by the BLM as well as the Forest Service. <em>See </em>43 U.S.C. 1702(j) (providing that a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d applies to \u201cfederal Land\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1714(i) (authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw lands under the administration of another department or agency \u201cwith the consent of the head of the department or agency concerned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The Mining Law of 1872 recognizes two types of property rights in mining claims: unpatented and patented. <em>See Best, </em>371 U.S. at 335-36, 83 S.Ct. 379 (describing the difference between unpatented and patented mining claims). An unpatented mining claim vests in a claimant upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and compliance with applicable regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 336, 83 S.Ct. 379.

Issues Raised By The Government\u2019s August 20, 2013 Motion To Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">1. Whether Plaintiff\u2019s Takings Claims Are Ripe For Adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">a. The Government\u2019s Argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">First, the Government argues that Plaintiffs inverse condemnation claims are not ripe for adjudication, because Plaintiff failed to follow the administrative procedures required by the BLM and Forest Service. Gov\u2019t Mot. 13. In particular, Plaintiff neither submitted a plan of operations nor obtained a BLM mineral examination report. 8/5/13 Cox Deck \u00b6 4-8. Nor has Plaintiff submitted a plan of operations to the Forest Sex-vice and consequently has not x-eceived a VER determination. 8/8/13 Schuppert Deck \u00b6 5. In fact, on May 7, 2010, Plaintiff specifically withdrew a previously px-oposed plan of opex-ations submitted to the Forest Service, even though the Forest Sex-vice had scheduled a field visit to begin the VER detex-mination process. 8/8/13 Schuppex-t Deck \u00b6 9. Since Plaintiff has complied with neither the BLM nor Forest Sex-vice px-ocedures, neither agency has \u201cmade a preliminax-y or final decision that would bar [P]laintiff from using or that would take [Pjlaintiffs unpatented mining claims!.]\u201d 8/8/13 Schuppex-t Deck \u00b6 5; <em>see also </em>8/5/13 Cox. Deck \u00b6 4 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Therefore, Plaintiffs failure to comply with the mandated procedures of both the BLM and Forest Service prevents the court from \u201cdetex-mining if the [W]ithdx-awal [0]rder has taken or will ever take [Plaintiffs unpatented mining claims.\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 13 (\u201cThe [Withdrawal [0]x-der cannot take or prohibit [P]laintiff from using its unpatented mining claims unless BLM detex-mines first that [P]laintiff does not have valid existing x-ights.\u201d (intex-nal citation omitted)). In other words, because the plain language of the Withdrawal Order evidences that it does not prohibit mining on claims with valid existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>rights, the court cannot determine what impact, if any, the Withdrawal Order has on Plaintiffs mining claims, unless and until Plaintiff receives a VER determination. Gov\u2019t Reply 1; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cIf the [Government] decides that some or all of [Plaintiffs] claims are valid existing rights ..., then the [Withdrawal [0]rder would not prohibit [Plaintiff] from mining[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Moreover, because Plaintiffs takings claims must be analyzed under the three factors articulated by <em>Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York, </em>438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978), Plaintiffs decision to avoid the required administrative procedures deprives the court of the \u201cconcrete facts\u201d necessary to adjudicate Plaintiffs takings claims. Gov\u2019t Mot. 13 (citing <em>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, </em>533 U.S. 606, 618-19, 121 S.Ct. 2448, 150 L.Ed.2d 592 (2001) (explaining that a federal trial court may not adjudicate an unripe takings claim under <em>Penn Central, </em>as that analysis \u201ccannot be resolved in definitive terms until a court knows \u2018the extent of permitted development\u2019 on the land in question\u201d) (quoting <em>MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates v. Yolo County, 477 </em>U.S. 340, 351, 106 S.Ct. 2561, 91 L.Ed.2d 285 (1986))); <em>see also id. </em>15 (citing <em>Steams Co. v.

In short, it is impossible for the court to determine whether the Government \u201cactually took\u201d a property interest, unless and until Plaintiff avails itself of the administrative procedures at the BLM and Forest Service that Congress provided. Gov\u2019t Mot. 9 (citing <em>Air Pegasus of D.C., Inc. v. United States, </em>424 F.3d 1206, 1212-13 (Fed.Cir.2005) (explaining that, even where a property owner has a \u201cvalid property interest, the court [nevertheless also] must determine whether the governmental action at issue amounted to a compensable taking of that property interest\u201d) (quoting <em>Am. Pelagic Fishing Co., L.P. v. United States, </em>379 F.3d 1363, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2004))).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Second, the Government argues that Plaintiff cannot establish that the 678 unpatented mining claims at issue are protected property rights, since \u201c[P]laintiff lacks the [VER] determinations under the Mining Law [of 1872] that would be necessary to establish that these claims are compensable property interests.\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 15 (citing <em>Best, </em>371 U.S. at 336-37, 83 S.Ct. 379 (holding that unpatented mining claims are only \u201cvalid against the United States if there has been a discovery of mineral within the limits of the claim\u201d)); <em>see also id. </em>17 (citing <em>Hall v.

Salazar, </em>No. 3:11-cv-8171, 2013 WL 93372 (D.Ariz. Jan. 8, 2013), holding that challenges to the Withdrawal Order on various statutory and regulatory grounds are ripe for adjudication, does not have preclusive effect in this litigation. Gov\u2019t Reply 4 (citing <em>Laguna Hermosa Corp. v. United States, </em>671 F.3d 1284, 1288 (Fed.Cir.2012) (holding that collateral estoppel did not apply where an issue decided in an earlier case was not identical to the issue in the pending ease)).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">b. Plaintiffs Response.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Plaintiff responds to the Government\u2019s ripeness argument in four ways. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Plaintiff does not dispute that it has not received a VER determination from the Forest Service or BLM. Instead, Plaintiff responds that obtaining a VER determination is \u201cunnecessary,\u201d since the Government \u201calready acknowledged the existence of valuable mineral deposits under [Plaintiffs] claims.\u201d Pl. Resp. 10. On October 27, 2011, the BLM, in contemplation of the Withdrawal Order, issued a Final Environmental Impact Statement (\u201cFEIS\u201d), pursuant to NEPA, concluding that 60,638 tons of uranium oxide lies underneath the 3,350 mining claims located within the Withdrawal Area. Pl. Resp. 10 (citing FEIS, B-26). The methodology employed by the BLM in the FEIS demonstrates that 12,250 tons of uranium oxide lies under Plaintiffs unpatented mining claims, and as such, the Government has \u201calready made administrative findings that support the existence of valuable minerals and valid existing rights by [Plaintiff].\u201d Pl. Resp. II.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Second, Plaintiff argues that this dispute is ripe for adjudication, because \u201can administrative decision has been formalized and its effects are felt [by Plaintiff] in a concrete way[.]\u201d Pl. Resp. 7 (citing <em>Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967) (holding that to determine whether an action is ripe for adjudication the court must \u201cevaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration\u201d)). According to Plaintiff, the Withdrawal Order is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d that precludes Plaintiff from conducting exploratory drilling and from \u201cdemonstrating the existence of valuable minerals ... [and] from developing and profiting from its claims.\u201d Pl. Resp. 8; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c[T]he [Government] has taken [Plaintiffs] mining claims specifically because it has taken [Plaintiffs] ability to explore those claims.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Third, Plaintiff asserts that the Government\u2019s ripeness argument has been rejected by the United States District Court for the District of Arizona in <em>Yount, </em>2013 WL 93372, at *14, an action \u201cbased on the same facts as the present case\u201d that challenges the Withdrawal Order under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 <em>et seq. </em>Pl. Resp. 9. In addition, the June 21, 2013 Complaint properly pleads the elements of a <em>per se </em>taking claim. As such, the court must accept, as true, Plaintiffs assertion that \u201cit owns 678 valid mining claims\u201d at this stage of the litigation, recognizing that additional proof will be necessary at trial; and that the validity of Plaintiffs claims is an element of this cause of action. Pl. Resp. 11-14 (citing <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1019 , 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798(1992) (holding that when a regulation forces the owner of real property to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses their property, they \u201cha[ve] suffered a taking\u201d)); <em>see also id. </em>12 (construing the Government\u2019s ripeness arguments as an \u201cimproper[] demand[ ] that [Plaintiff] prove elements of its case as a prerequisite to bringing] this action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Fourth, Plaintiff argues that there are two distinct standards used to evaluate mining claims. \u201cThe first, and more lenient standard, applies to the initial location, or \u2018staking,\u2019 of mining claims.\u201d Pl. Resp. 13. The prerequisite for the initial location of a mining is a \u201cdiscovery ... of such a character that a person of ordinary prudence would be justified in the further expenditure of his labor and means, with a reasonable prospect of success, in developing a valuable mine.\u201d Pl. Resp. 13 (quoting <em>Best, </em>371 U.S. at 335-36, 83 S.Ct. 379 (quoting <em>Castle, </em>19 Pub. Lands Dec. at 457)). A claimant that made this initial \u201cdiscovery\u201d is entitled to stake the mining claim, and then explore and develop that claim. Pl. Resp. 13. The second and stricter standard, however, is necessary to obtain a \u201cpatent (or title)\u201d to the land encompassed by the mining claim, which requires a mining claimant to demonstrate that the claim is \u201cvaluable for minerals ... or that there is a showing of sufficient valuable min<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>erais to economically justify establishing a working mine.\u201d PI. Resp. 13 (quoting <em>Best, </em>371 U.S. at 336, 83 S.Ct. 379). Because Plaintiff\u2019s unpatented mining claims are centered on breccia pipes, they are \u201clikely to contain mineralization.\u201d PL Resp. 13-14. As such, Plaintiff does not need to comply with the BLM and Forest Service\u2019s regulatory scheme because the \u201cthe nature of such geologic formations is such that a prudent person would invest further labor and means to explore and confirm mineralization, thus satisfying the first standard[.]\u201d Pl. Resp. 13. The Withdrawal Order, by contrast, impermissibly requires Plaintiff to satisfy the second, more stringent standard, amounting to a \u201cregulatory change ... [that] is an inappropriate standard to [gauge] the validity of a mining claim for the purposes of permitting mineral exploration.\u201d Pl. Resp. 14-15; <em>see also id. </em>12 (explaining that the Withdrawal Order \u201ccreates a regulatory scheme for mining claims that previously did not exist, and which effectively destroys [Plaintiffs] ability to explore, develop and economically benefit from its mining claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">c. The Court\u2019s Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Foundational principles of ripeness and takings jurisprudence govern resolution of Plaintiffs takings claims. A \u201ctakings claim calls for a two-step analysis.\u201d <em>Karuk Tribe of Cal. v. Ammon, </em>209 F.3d 1366, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2000). First, the court must determine whether the claimant has established a compensable property interest. <em>See Hall, </em>84 Fed.Cl. at 470; <em>see also Am. Pelagic Fishing Co., </em>379 F.3d at 1372. If, however, \u201cthe claimant fails to demonstrate the existence of a legally cognizable property interest, the [court\u2019s] task is at an end.\u201d <em>Am. Pelagic Fishing Co., </em>379 F.3d at 1372. Second, the court must determine \u201cwhether the character of the governmental action affected the claimant\u2019s \u2018bundle of property rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Hall, </em>84 Fed.Cl. at 470 (quoting <em>Karuk Tribe, </em>209 F.3d at 1374); <em>see also Chancellor Manor v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 891, 902 (Fed.Cir.2003) (same re: whether governmental action constitutes a compensable taking \u201cfor a public purpose\u201d). The Fifth Amendment, however, does not create the property interests it protects. <em>See Phillips v. Wash. Legal Found., </em>524 U.S. 156, 164, 118 S.Ct. 1925, 141 L.Ed.2d 174 (1998) (\u201cBecause the Constitution protects rather than creates property interests, the existence of a property interest is determined by reference to \u2018existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972))).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">To determine Plaintiffs property interest, the court is cognizant that unpatented mining claims are a unique form of property constituting a \u201cpossessory interest in land,\u201d where \u201cthe title to the land in controversy still belongs to the United States.\u201d <em>Hafen, </em>30 Fed.Cl. at 473; <em>see also Best, </em>371 U.S. at 336, 83 S.Ct. 379 (\u201cRespondents\u2019 mining claims are unpatented, the title to the lands in controversy still being in the United States.\u201d). Nevertheless, unpatented mining claims are a protected property interest, <em>\u201cif there has been a discovery </em>of mineral within the limits of the claim.\u201d <em>Best, </em>371 at 336, 83 S.Ct. 379 (emphasis added); <em>see also Holden v.

In the realm of takings jurisprudence, ripeness is of paramount importance, because the court \u201ccannot determine whether a regulation has gone \u2018too far\u2019 unless it knows how far the regulation goes.\u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>477 U.S. at 348, 106 S.Ct. 2561; <em>see also Mehaffy v.

That document does not circumvent the BLM\u2019s responsibility to make a determination of the validity of unpatented mining claims. <em>See Holden, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 735; <em>see also Skaw, </em>13 Cl.Ct. at 29 (\u201cThe function of the Government mineral examiner is ... to verify ... whether the claimant has, in fact, found a valuable mineral deposit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The absence of a compensable property interest has been recognized as grounds for dismissal under RCFC 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). <em>Compare Hafen, </em>30 Fed.Cl. at 474 (dismissing takings claim premised on unpatented mining claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, because \u201cplaintiff ha[d] no valid existing right\u201d in the claims) <em>and Payne, </em>31 Fed.Cl. at 712 (concluding that the absence of \u201can examination of the validity of the mining claims at issue\u201d divested the court of jurisdiction and warranted a stay of proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ings), <em>with Holden, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 735-36 (concluding that the lack of a VER determination from the BLM did not divest the court of jurisdiction, but precluded plaintiffs from \u201cstaffing] a claim for relief under the Fifth Amendment\u201d) <em>and Ford v. United States, </em>101 Fed.Cl. 234, 238 (2011) (explaining that plaintiffs failure to establish a valid property interest would warrant dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted). As the United States Court of Federal Claims has determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">Because the plaintiffs have never requested that the BLM determine the validity of their mining claims, their taking action does not rely on any determination that they have a compensable interest in the unpatented mining claims. Without a determination as to the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 unpatented mining claims, those mining claims do not constitute a compensable property interest, and, therefore, the plaintiffs cannot recover in this [e]ourt under a taking theory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\"><em>Holden, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In this case, Plaintiff failed to obtain a VER determination and consequently has no property right. Plaintiff therefore cannot show an entitlement to relief. <em>See Am. Pelagic Fishing Co., </em>379 F.3d at 1372 (\u201cIf the claimant fails to demonstrate the existence of a legally cognizable property interest, the [court\u2019s] task is at an end.\u201d); <em>see also Holden, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 736 (holding that an owner of unpatented lode mining claims who asserted the Government\u2019s \u201cclosure of lands on which [his] unpatented mining claims were located constituted a taking\u201d did not state a claim for relief because the BLM had not made a determination as to the validity those claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Plaintiffs takings claims also must be dismissed, pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1), because those claims are not ripe for adjudication. The Withdrawal Order explicitly provides that it does not impact claimants with valid existing rights. <em>See </em>Withdrawal Order, 77 Fed. Reg. at 2,563 (\u201cThis order withdraws approximately 1,006,545 acres of public and National Forest System lands from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872, ... <em>subject to valid existing rights.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Unless and until Plaintiff receives a VER determination, neither the BLM, the Forest Service, nor this court can determine if and how the Withdrawal Order will impact Plaintiffs unpatented mining claims. <em>See Steams, </em>396 F.3d at 1358 (A takings claim \u201c \u2018is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Williamson Cnty. Reg\u2019l Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 186, 105 S.Ct. 3108)).

Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., </em>474 U.S. 121, 126, 106 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985) (\u201c[T]he mere assertion of regulatory jurisdiction by a governmental body does not constitute a regulatory taking.\u201d); Stea<em>rns, </em>396 F.3d at 1358 (holding that a takings claim was not ripe because the claimant had not pursued relief that was equivalent to a VER determination); <em>Benchmark Res. Corp. v. United States, </em>74 Fed.Cl. 458, 463 (2006) (\u201cA plaintiff is not entitled to seek judicial review before following the prescribed administrative procedures.\u201d). This is not a case where \u201cthe permissible uses of the property are known to a reasonable degree of certainty.\u201d <em>Palazzolo, </em>533 U.S. at 620, 121 S.Ct. 2448. Nor is this case one where the Government \u201chas not identified any further administrative step available\u201d to Plaintiff. <em>Washoe Cnty., </em>319 F.3d 1320. Instead, Plaintiff declined to follow a fundamentally reasonable and necessary procedure that will allow the BLM and Forest Service \u201c \u2018to exercise their full discretion\u2019 so that the extent of the restriction on property is known.\u201d <em>Washoe Cnty., </em>319 F.3d at 1324 (quoting <em>Palazzolo, </em>533 U.S. at 620-21, 121 S.Ct. 2448).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Plaintiffs remaining arguments against dismissal also lack merit. As an initial matter, the court is not obligated to accept the factual averments in the June 21, 2013 Complaint when ascertaining whether this dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>is ripe for adjudication. <em>See Reynolds, </em>846 F.2d at 747 (\u201cIf a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction ... challenges the truth of the jurisdictional facts alleged in the complaint, the [trial] court may consider relevant evidence in order to resolve the factual dispute.\u201d). Further, the fact that Plaintiffs unpatented mining claims are centered on breccia pipes that are \u201clikely to contain mineralization\u201d does not excuse Plaintiff from compliance with the VER determination process, since \u201cCongress has given the Department of Interior the power in the first instance to inquire into the validity of mining rights claimed against the Government.\u201d <em>Payne, </em>31 Fed. Cl. at 711. Although Plaintiff invokes <em>Abbott Laboratories, </em>that case held that ripeness must be discerned by evaluating \u201cthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d <em>Abbott Labs., </em>387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507. In this ease, analysis of Plaintiffs takings claim involves highly factual determinations where \u201cfurther administrative proceedings are contemplated,\u201d as opposed to the kind of \u201cpurely legal\u201d issues that <em>Abbott </em>held were sufficiently ripe for adjudication. <em>Id. </em>This case also invokes <em>Abbott\u2019s </em>warning that ripeness is designed \u201cto prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies ... [and from interfering with agency decision making] until an administrative decision has been formalized[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, 87 S.Ct. 1507.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Although Plaintiff cites to the court\u2019s determination in <em>Yount </em>that a challenge to the Withdrawal Order under the APA was ripe for adjudication, that decision has no preclusive effect here. For collateral estoppel to apply, the issue in this case must be \u201cidentical to [the issue] decided in the first action.\u201d <em>Laguna Hermosa Corp., </em>671 F.3d at 1288. The District Court found that challenges to the Withdrawal Order on statutory and regulatory grounds were ripe for adjudication. <em>See Yount, </em>2013 WL 93372, at *14. That determination, however, is wholly distinct from one that Plaintiffs takings claims under the Fifth Amendment are ripe for adjudication. <em>See Laguna Hermosa Corp., </em>671 F.3d at 1288 (holding that issues were not identical for purposes of issue preclusion because in one case, the court was required to interpret a particular statutory word, whereas in the other, that analysis was unnecessary); <em>see also In re Freeman, </em>30 F.3d 1459, 1465 (Fed.Cir.1994) (\u201c[Application of issue preclusion centers around whether an issue of law or fact has been previously litigated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Finally, while Plaintiff decries the January 18, 2012 Withdrawal Order as imposing a new and materially different regulatory scheme, the requirement to obtain a VER determination on lands that are withdrawn from appropriation under the Mining Law of 1872 is of relatively longstanding nature. As an initial matter, the BLM published a Final Rule formally imposing this requirement on November 21, 2000, over eleven years prior to the Withdrawal Order. <em>See </em>Mining Claims Under the General Mining Laws; Surface Management, 65 Fed. Reg. at 70,025 (promulgating the BLM Final Rule requiring mining operators to obtain a VER determination prior to receiving approval for a plan of operations on withdrawn or segregated lands). Furthermore, as comments accompanying the November 21, 2000 Final Rule demonstrate, both the Forest Service and BLM had imposed this same requirement, as a matter of policy, prior to November 21, 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 70,026 (explaining that, even though \u201c[b]oth the Forest Service and BLM already generally do, as a matter of policy, require VER examinations when operations are proposed on lands that have been withdrawn or segregated,\u201d the BLM \u201cbelieves that this policy should be embodied in regulations so that <em>all affected interests are fully aware of it, and to assure that mining operations don\u2019t proceed in segregated or withdrawn areas unless valid existing rights are present.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). As an experienced mining operator, Plaintiff was or should have been aware of this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">For these reasons, the court has determined that Plaintiffs takings claims must be dismissed, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">2. Whether The Court Has Jurisdiction To Adjudicate Plaintiffs Estoppel Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">a. The Government\u2019s Argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">The Government posits several reasons for why the court also does not have jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>to adjudicate Plaintiffs \u201cestoppel\u201d cause of action. First, to establish jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, Plaintiff must establish a \u201cfederal law, regulation, [constitutional provision], or contract that \u2018mandates] compensation\u2019 by the United States for \u2018money damages[.]\u2019\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 18 (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. at 216-17, 103 S.Ct. 2961; <em>see also Jan\u2019s Helicopter Serv., Inc. v. FAA, </em>525 F.3d 1299, 1306-07 (Fed.Cir.2008) (holding that jurisdiction under the Tucker Act requires a \u201cmoney-mandating\u201d source of federal law creating a right to \u201cmoney damages against the United States\u201d)). Since the June 21, 2013 Complaint does not incorporate or reference any federal law, regulation, or contract requiring the Government to pay money damages for refusing to allow Plaintiff to mine on federal lands subject to the Withdrawal Order, the court does not have jurisdiction over Plaintiffs estoppel cause of action. Gov\u2019t Mot. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Second, even if Plaintiff properly pled a money-mandating provision of federal law in the Complaint, estoppel may not be asserted against the Government \u201cwhere, as here, [Pjlaintiff requests monetary damages but (1) does not adduce a written contract prohibiting the alleged federal misconduct allegedly causing these damages, on which [P]laintiff allegedly relied and (2) alleges damages from federal actions that, if they occurred, would violate federal law.\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 18-19 (citing <em>Frazer v. United States, </em>288 F.3d 1347, 1352-53 (Fed.Cir.2002) (explaining that the doctrine of equitable estoppel is not available in suits seeking money damages from the Government \u201cwhere payment would contravene a statutory appropriation\u201d) (quoting <em>Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, </em>496 U.S. 414, 423-24, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990)); <em>see also Burnside-Ott Aviation Training Ctr., Inc. v. United States, </em>985 F.2d 1574, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1993) (observing that equitable estoppel may be available against the Government where a plaintiffs claim is based on a purported breach of contract)). Plaintiff has not shown, however, any written contract requiring the BLM or Forest Service to approve Plaintiffs uranium mining. Gov\u2019t Mot. 19. In addition, without an approved plan of operations and a VER determination, it would be illegal for Plaintiff to mine within the Withdrawal Area, and thus application of equitable estoppel would result in actions that are \u201cunauthorized under federal law.\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Third, Plaintiffs estoppel cause of action, like the takings claims, is not ripe for adjudication. Gov\u2019t Mot. 19 (citing <em>Texas v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 296, 300, 118 S.Ct. 1257, 140 L.Ed.2d 406 (1998) (\u201cA claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Fourth, to the extent that the Complaint alleges an implied-in-fact contract cause of action, the court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate that claim for similar reasons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiffs implied-in-fact contract theory does not rest on a federal law or contract that mandates compensation by the Government. Gov\u2019t Reply 15. Moreover, none of the sources Plaintiff cited in order to buttress the implied-in-fact contract theory authorize Plaintiff to conduct mining activities within the Withdrawal Area or \u201cinelude[ ] a promise to pay [Pjlaintiff money if the [Government] ever prohibits [Plaintiff] from doing so.\u201d Gov\u2019t Reply 15. Likewise, Plaintiff is required to \u201clink the \u2018course of conduct\u2019 on which it supposedly relied to an actual contract\u201d authorizing Plaintiff to mine within the Withdrawal Area. Gov\u2019t Reply 15; <em>see also id. </em>16 (stating that Plaintiffs theory requires it to link \u201cthe federal representations which it claims to have relied [on] to an actual contract allowing the particular mining activities that [P]laintiff desires\u201d). But, Plaintiff has failed to plead the requirements for an implied-in-fact contract, which must allege \u201cthe same elements as an express contract.\u201d Gov\u2019t Reply 15 (quoting <em>Peninsula Group Capital Corp. v. United States, </em>93 Fed.Cl. 720, 731 (2010); <em>see also Sinclair v. United States, </em>56 Fed.Cl. 270, 277-78 (2003) (listing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the requirements for an implied-in-fact contract as \u201cconsideration, lack of ambiguity in offer and acceptance, mutuality of intent to contract, and actual authority on the part of the agency representative to bind the Government\u201d)). Because Plaintiff\u2019s implied-in-fact contract theory relies on unidentified language in Section 304 of the AWA, mutuality of intent and consideration are lacking. Gov\u2019t Reply 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">b. Plaintiff's Response.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Plaintiff responds that the Complaint properly pled a \u201c[promissory [e]stoppel [c]laim,\u201d based on the congressional determination in Section 304 of the AWA that the lands within the Withdrawal Area are \u201celigible for mineral exploration\u201d and therefore ineligible for withdrawal. PI. Resp. 15. In addition, the Government collected and continues to collect mining claim maintenance fees from Plaintiff and other claimants with mining claims in the Withdrawal Area. PI. Resp. 15. This \u201cconduct is sufficient to form the basis for an implied-in-fact contractual obligation to leave the lands available for mineral exploration.\u201d PL Resp. 15-16 (citing <em>Toon v. United States, </em>96 Fed.Cl. 288, 299 (2010) (explaining that Tucker Act jurisdiction extends to implied-in-fact contracts, but that a \u201cplaintiff must allege all the requisite elements of a contract with the United States\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Plaintiff also contends that equitable estoppel may be asserted against the Government where the claim is based on a breach of contract, but that there is no requirement \u201cthat the contract be in writing.\u201d Pl.

Plaintiff also reasons that the estoppel claim is ripe for adjudication, because the Withdrawal Order is a final agency decision and \u201cmineral examinations ... will not change the existence or extent of [Plaintiffs] harm.\u201d PL Resp. 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">c. The Court\u2019s Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Plaintiffs estoppel claim is both ambiguous and inconsistently articulated. For example, it is referred to as: (1) estoppel (Compl. 18); (2) promissory estoppel (Compl. \u00b6 3); (3) equitable estoppel (Compl. \u00b6 69); and (4) and an implied-in-fact contract (PL Resp. 15-16).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Although the Complaint refers to the generalized concept of estoppel, that term, standing alone, is ill-defined and nebulous. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 90 (\u201cEstoppel prevents a person from showing the truth contrary to a representation of fact made by him after another has relied on the representation.\u201d). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines estoppel, generally, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">A bar that prevents one from asserting a claim or right that contradicts what one has said or done before or what has been legally established as true. 2.

In contrast, an implied-in-fact contract \u201crequires proof of (1) mutuality of intent, (2) consideration, (3) an unambiguous offer and acceptance, and (4) actual authority on the part of the government\u2019s representative to bind the government in contract.\u201d <em>Kam-Almaz v. United States, </em>682 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Hanlin v. United States, </em>316 F.3d 1325, 1328 (Fed.Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Plaintiffs citation to Section 304 of the AWA is not an explicit promise to maintain the Withdrawal Area for mineral extraction, nor constitutes an offer, as it does not reflect the \u201cmanifestation of willingness [on the part of the Government] to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 24. Nor does the Complaint sufficiently allege consideration \u201cin the form of a bargained-for exchange ... that the promisee\u2019s expectation of performance is reasonable, and not disingenuous reliance on the words of a non-serious and unwilling promisor.\u201d <em>Howell v. United States, </em>51 Fed.Cl. 516, 521 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that payment of fees to the Government may give rise to an implied-in-fact contract, the court also does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate that claim because Plaintiff has not asserted or otherwise demonstrated that this implied-in-faet contract \u201ccould fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages for [its] breach.\u201d <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1303, 1315 (Fed.Cir.2011) (holding that it \u201cwas proper for the [United States Court of Federal Claims] to require a demonstration that the agreements [allegedly breached by the Government] could fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages in the event of breach\u201d). Plaintiffs implied-in-fact contract claim rests solely on an assumption that the Government had an obligation to keep the lands within the Withdrawal Area open for mining exploration and location, and that the Withdrawal Order breached that implied contractual obligation. PI. Resp. 15-16. Even if an implied contractual obligation of that nature existed, Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to suggest that the breach of this obligation could reasonably be interpreted to contemplate monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">Moreover, any claim for breach of an implied-in-fact contract is insufficiently pled under RCFC 8. <em>See </em>RCFC 8(a)(2) (requiring a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim, showing that the pleader is entitled to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>lief\u2019); <em>see also Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 679-80, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (holding that facts suggesting the \u201cmere possibility of misconduct\u201d do not \u201cnudg[e] ... [a plaintiffs claim] across the line from conceivable to plausible,\u201d and are therefore insufficient to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss). The allegations at issue here demonstrate only that <em>if </em>the Government makes a future negative VER determination, it <em>may </em>prohibit Plaintiff from mining, and that the Government <em>might </em>be obligated to compensate Plaintiff monetarily. Such allegations do not allow the court to draw \u201cthe reasonable inference that the [Government] is liable\u201d for breach of an implied-in-fact contract. <em>Id. </em>at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">To the extent that the Complaint alleges equitable estoppel, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that \u201cequitable estoppel <em>is not necessarily unavailable as a matter of law </em>where the plaintiffs claim is based upon an alleged breach of contract.\u201d <em>Frazer, </em>288 F.3d at 1353 (emphasis added). As discussed above, however, Plaintiff inadequately pled the existence of a contract, and, even if an implied-in-fact contract existed, the court would not have jurisdiction over that claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Further, \u201cif equitable estoppel is available at all against the [Government, some form of affirmative misconduct must be shown in addition to the traditional requirements of estoppel.\u201d <em>Zacharin v. United States, </em>213 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2000) (collecting eases and explaining that every court of appeals, including the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has \u201cheld that affirmative misconduct is a prerequisite for invoking equitable estoppel against the [Gjovernment\u201d). Interior\u2019s promulgation of the Withdrawal Order was designed to protect the Grand Canyon Watershed from the adverse effects of loeatable mineral exploration and development, and does not reflect Government misconduct. <em>See Henry v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 634, 637 (Fed.Cir.1989) (holding that IRS procedures, although \u201ccumbersome and inefficient,\u201d coupled with representations that did not have the effect of misleading the plaintiff on the specific question at issue, did not constitute affirmative misconduct); <em>see also Hanson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>833 F.2d 1568,1569 (Fed.Cir.1987) (holding that Government officials\u2019 incorrect advice that \u201creceipt of the lump-sum [workers\u2019 compensation] benefit would not prevent [plaintiff] from receiving a civil service retirement annuity,\u201d when in fact it did, was not affirmative misconduct because Government officials acted in good faith).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">For these reasons, Plaintiffs estoppel cause of action also must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">IV. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">For these reasons, the Government\u2019s August 20, 2013 Motion To Dismiss is granted.
