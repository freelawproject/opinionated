The Court issued this opinion under seal on June 13, 2014 and gave the parties until June 20, 2014, to submit any proposed redactions of competition-sensitive, proprietary, confidential, or</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">\n<em>OPINION AND ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b657-9\">WHEELER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">In this post-award bid protest, Plaintiff Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (\u201cLabCorp\u201d) challenges the selection by the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) of Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (\u201cQuest\u201d) for award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (\u201cBPA\u201d). The BPA is for laboratory testing and analysis services at five VA Medical Centers in upstate New York. LabCorp is the incumbent contractor, and has provided these services to the VA for approximately the past twelve years. The BPA will be for one base year and an option year.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">The VA requested these laboratory testing services under the prospective contractors\u2019 existing Federal Supply Schedule (\u201cFSS\u201d) contracts. Thus, an offeror must have held an FSS contract as a prerequisite to competing for these services. The solicitation included a 36-page pricing schedule listing 1,567 test types that could be ordered under the BPA The VA provided estimated quantities for each test based upon its \u201cFY 2014 estimated utilization\u201d levels. For evaluating offeror proposals, the solicitation contained three technical evaluation factors (capability, interface compatibility, and customer support), a past performance factor, and a price factor. The solicitation stated that the non-price factors, when combined, were significantly more important than price.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">A complicating problem in this acquisition is that none of the prospective contractors offered all of the 1,567 different test types under an FSS contract. Any proposal to provide the 1,567 tests necessarily would be a combination of FSS testing services and non-FSS testing services, called \u201copen market\u201d tests. The number of FSS tests and open market tests would vary for each contractor, but all of the competing contractors could offer the tests under the FSS category or the open market category. The 36-page pricing schedule contemplated that offerors would provide a unit price for each of the 1,567 tests for the base year and the option year, which when multiplied by the estimated quantity for each test, would yield a total price for all of the tests for both years.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">In evaluating the three proposals received, the VA\u2019s Source Selection Evaluation Board (\u201cSSEB\u201d) focused upon the number of laboratory tests that were listed on each offeror\u2019s FSS contract. For the three technical evaluation factors, the SSEB rated LabCorp with two \u201cGood\u201d ratings and one \u201cExcellent\u201d rating, and it rated Quest with three \u201cGood\u201d ratings. For the price factor, the VA evaluated laboratory test prices only for the tests covered by the offerors\u2019 FSS contract, which consisted of different numbers of tests for each offeror. This method constituted a classic \u201capples and oranges\u201d comparison where the VA evaluated different numbers of tests, and different tests, for each offeror. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>VA\u2019s source selection decision, the decisional document initially stated that the source selection authoi\u2019ity (\u201cSSA\u201d) performed a best value analysis resulting in the selection of Quest, but this document does not state what the best value analysis was. In a supplemental source selection decision prepared after LabCorp indicated that it would file a protest, the SSA stated that no best value analysis was necessary because LabCorp and Quest were considered equivalent in the technical evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In considering the entire record, the Court has great difficulty accepting the VA\u2019s method of conducting this acquisition. Even allowing for the high level of deference afforded to the procuring agency, this award decision cannot stand. The agency should redo the acquisition using proper procedures. As explained in greater detail in this opinion, the Court finds the following VA actions to be arbitrary and capricious and lacking a rational basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">\u2022 In performing a technical evaluation based mainly on the number of laboratory tests included on each offeror\u2019s FSS contract, the VA employed an evaluation factor that was not contained in the solicitation. The Request for Quotations (\u201cRFQ\u201d) does not say anything about the importance of the number of test types contained in an offeror\u2019s FSS Contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">\u2022 The VA did not evaluate the offerors\u2019 total prices for the 1,567 tests as indicate ed in the solicitation. Instead, the VA requested information from each offeror to identify which tests were covered on the offeror\u2019s FSS contract, and evaluated only the prices for the FSS tests. For LabCorp, there were [...] FSS-covered tests, and for Quest there were [...] FSS-covered tests. The evaluation of a different number of test types for each offeror did not result in a meaningful or rational comparison of prices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u2022 Quest\u2019s price proposal contained [... ] computational errors that, when corrected, would have increased its total price by $[...]. With these errors eliminated, the price difference between Quest and LabCorp for the base year and the option year was only $[...]. There is no evidence in the record indicating that the VA was aware of these errors, or of the small price difference between Quest and LabCorp when the errors are corrected. Even if the VA\u2019s \u201capples and oranges\u201d price comparison could survive, the VA lacked knowledge of the actual price difference between Quest and LabCorp and did not evaluate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">\u2022 The VA\u2019s technical evaluation, in addition to employing an unstated evaluation criterion, failed to include review of many seemingly important performance factors addressed in the RFQ\u2019s Statement of Work (\u201cSOW\u201d). The comments from the agency\u2019s evaluators were cryptic at best, and emphasized only the FSS-based tests in each offeror\u2019s proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">\u2022 The SSA\u2019s original and supplemental source selection decisions are contradictory on whether the VA performed any best value trade-off analysis. The original SSA decision says that the VA did perform a trade-off analysis, but the supplemental decision says that the VA did not perform a trade-off analysis. On the record presented, the Court would have expected the agency to perform a best value trade-off analysis, but the VA did not possess any accurate technical or price information to perform a meaningful or rational trade-off analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-12\">\u2022 Upon awarding the B PA to Quest, the VA relaxed the specifications so that Quest would have time to interface with the VA\u2019s VistA computer software system. Quest estimated in its proposal that it would require [... ] following the start of performance to complete each facility\u2019s interface. After award, the VA granted Quest an indefinite extension, stating that it would not expect Quest to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>perform any services until it was able to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The VA\u2019s errors in conducting the acquisition prejudiced LabCorp. The record shows that the competitive proposals of LabCorp and Quest were extremely close from a technical and pricing standpoint, and that Lab-Corp might have been selected for award if the VA had conducted the acquisition rationally. The Court finds that the factors for granting injunctive relief weigh heavily in favor of LabCorp, and accordingly, the Court will permanently enjoin the VA from proceeding with the BPA awarded to Quest. If the VA wants to pursue this acquisition, the Court expects that the VA will issue an amended or new solicitation affording all interested parties an opportunity to compete. The VA should evaluate proposals in accordance with the criteria and procedures contained in the amended or reissued solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">I. <em>Factual </em>Background<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A89\">A. <em>The Solicitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The VA issued RFQ No. VA528-13-Q0540 on September 20, 2013, in contemplation of awarding a BPA against the successful offeror\u2019s current FSS Contract. Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) Tab 10 at 35, 50. The solicitation included a SOW and a BPA Price Schedule. AR Tab 10 at 117-61, 162-97. In general, the RFQ called for laboratory testing and analysis services at the VA Medical Centers located in Buffalo, Canandaigua, Bath, Syracuse, and Abany, New York. AR Tab 10 at 117. The RFQ sought quotations for the 2014 base year and the 2015 option year. AR Tab 10 at 62-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The RFQ provided that award would be made on a best value basis. AR Tab 8 at 19. Specifically, the RFQ stated that the BPA would be awarded to \u201cthe responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.\u201d AR Tab 10 at 115. The VA listed the evaluation factors and sub-factors in descending order of importance, with price as the least important factor. <em>Id. </em>First, the VA listed the technical sub-factors: (1) Capability; (2) Interface Compatibility; and (3) Customer Support. <em>Id. </em>The VA listed past performance as the second factor and price as the third. <em>Id. </em>The RFQ did not define the evaluation factors further. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The SOW listed different services required of an offeror, including \u201c[sjpecimen pick up services,\u201d \u201c[tjransportation of samples in such manner as to ensure the integrity of the specimen,\u201d \u201c[tjimely ... and appropriate analysis of patient specimens,\u201d and \u201c[cjonsult with ordering Laboratory on test requirements and results by telephone as needed.\u201d AR Tab 10 at 117. Neither the RFQ nor the SOW stated that the VA would evaluate an offeror\u2019s \u201cCapability\u201d based on the number of test types covered by the offeror\u2019s FSS Contract. AR Tab 10 at 35,117,121-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Regarding the second technical sub-factor, the SOW mandated that the successful offer- or supply an interface between its computer system and the VA\u2019s VistA software, which would allow the direct transfer of ordering information to the offeror\u2019s system and the direct download of testing results to the VistA system. AR Tab 10 at 118. Specifically, the VA required the offeror to provide: (1) a direct bi-directional data interface with the VistA systems; and (2) telecommunications equipment for entering and sending testing requests and for receiving test results. <em>Id. </em>In ease of a transition, the RFQ mandated that a new contractor begin performance on October 1, 2013 (later amended to February 1, 2014). AR Tab 10 at 63. Further, the RFQ required a contractor to make every effort to interface quickly with the VistA system so that the VA could place orders and receive results as soon as possible. <em>Id. </em>The VA\u2019s internal acquisition plan required that the contractor \u201cbe able to receive specimen samples immediately upon award and all equipment exchanges and interface adjustments will begin on award if awarded to a new contractor.\u201d AR Tab 1 at 2. Despite this requirement, the VA estimated that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>new contractor\u2019s system would need a minimum of twelve months to fully integrate with the end users. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The BPA Price Schedule listed 1,567 different test types that the VA sought to include and the \u201cFY 2014 estimated utilization\u201d levels for each test based on prior history of actual volumes. AR Tab 10 at 162-197. . Offerors were instructed to use the utilization levels to calculate the price per test and total price per year of each test for the base year, option year, and the base plus option years. <em>Id. </em>The RFQ stated that the VA would compare the offerors\u2019 prices \u201cby adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.\u201d AR Tab 10 at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">B. <em>Submittal of Proposals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">LabCorp and Quest timely submitted quotations on October 23, 2013, the deadline for proposals. AR Tab 15 at 292; AR Tab 18 at 482. [.. .], a third offeror not involved in this litigation, also submitted a quote. AR Tab 14 at 202. LabCorp is the incumbent offer- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Because the VA failed to state in the RFQ that an offeror should only include tests on its FSS in its bid, no offeror limited its proposal to FSS Contract tests. AR Tab 16 at 411-47; AR Tab 17; AR Tab 19 at 818-927. As a result, on November 8, 2013, the VA\u2019s contract specialist asked each offeror to identify the FSS and open market tests listed in its proposal. AR Tab 34 at 1720; AR Tab 35 at 2079-80. Accordingly, on November 14, 2013, LabCorp submitted an updated BPA Price Schedule marking [... ] of the 1,567 requested tests as included on its FSS Contract. AR Tab 17. On November 19, 2013, Quest also submitted an updated BPA Price Schedule demonstrating that its FSS Contract contained [...] of the requested tests. AR Tab 19. No offeror deleted its open market Contract tests from its updated BPA Price Schedule. AR Tab 16 at 411-47; AR Tab 17; AR Tab 19 at 818-927.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Additionally, the VA did not acknowledge Quest\u2019s computational errors in its proposal. Collis Deck \u00b69, 11. For [...] tests on its FSS, Quest failed to multiply the price per test in the base year by the FY 2014 estimated utilization level. <em>Id. </em>at 11. For example, the total base year price for \u201cOva + Parasite Exam\u201d should have been the unit price for the base year ([...]) multiplied by the expected utilization level (100), equaling $[...]. <em>Id. </em>Yet Quest mistakenly listed the total base year price as only $[...]. <em>Id.; </em>AR 889. Because Quest priced the total base year and total option year identically, the errors were multiplied by two when Quest calculated the total price for the entire two year contract. Collis Deck \u00b6 14, 15. As a result, Quest underpriced its proposal by $[...] and should have listed its total two year price as $[...] rather than $1,810,639. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">C. <em>Evaluation of Proposals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">To evaluate proposals, the VA generated a source selection plan that established an SSA to select the best value offer. AR Tab 8 at 19-20. The plan established a five-person SSEB to evaluate each proposal based on the RFQ\u2019s factors and sub-factors. AR 21. The plan provided the SSEB with an adjectival rating system to apply to the technical sub-factors: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory. AR 23. The SSEB individually rated the offerors on each technical sub-factor and then assigned consensus ratings. AR Tab 25 at 1102-03; AR Tab 26 at 1106-07. One evaluator appears to have been confused, as she assigned Lab-Corp a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d rating for \u201cCapability\u201d because she was \u201cno[t] sure how many tests would be on the open market,\u201d even though LabCorp previously indicated that its FSS Contract contained [... ] of the 1,567 requested tests. . AR Tab 22 at 1085; AR Tab 17. This evaluator also identified [...] under LabCorp\u2019s \u201cInterface Compatibility\u201d sub-factor, and \u201c[...], resulting in an overall LabCorp rating of \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d AR Tab 37 at 2369. The same evaluator identified nearly the same [...] plus the identical [...] for Quest\u2019s \u201cInterface Compatibility\u201d sub-factor, but then assigned Quest a higher rating of \u201cGood\u201d for this sub-factor. AR Tab 23 at 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">The agency also used an adjectival rating system for the past performance factor based upon perceived risk: Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, Very High, and Neutral/Unknown Risk. AR Tab 8 at 23-24. LabCorp and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Quest both received a \u201cVery Low\u201d risk rating. AR Tab 26 at 1107. After reviewing the SSEB\u2019s ratings, the SSA assigned the offerors an overall technical rating and an overall rating based on the strengths, weaknesses, and evaluated performance risks for each offeror. AR Tab 25 at 1103-05; AR Tab 26 at 1107-09. Although LabCorp received an \u201cExcellent\u201d for the second technical sub-factor, both LabCorp and Quest received \u201cGood\u201d overall technical and overall ratings. <em>Id. </em>The overall ratings were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Capability Interface Compatibility Customer Support Overall Technical Past Performance Overall</p>\n<p id=\"AfE\">LabCorp Good Excellent Good Good Very Low Good</p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">Quest Good Good Good Good Very Low Good</p>\n<p id=\"b661-29\">Regarding price, the VA only compared the aggregate price for tests offered under the FSS Contracts. AR Tab 28 at 1284. The aggregate price consisted of the price per test multiplied by the FY 2014 estimated utilization level totaled over the base and option years. <em>Id. </em>LabCorp offered on its FSS [...] of the 1,567 test types requested in the BPA Price Schedule at an aggregate price of $[...]. <em>Id. </em>Quest offered on its FSS [...] of the 1,567 test types requested at an aggregate price of $[...]. <em>Id. </em>As this computation included [...] errors, the true Quest price was $[...]. Collis Deck \u00b6 16. However, LabCorp and Quest only offered [...] of the same tests and thus each offered [...] distinct tests; LabCorp listed [... ] tests on its FSS Contract distinct from Quest, and Quest listed [...] tests on its FSS Contract distinct from LabCorp. Collis Deck \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 26. For the tests in common, LabCorp\u2019s total price was $[...] and Quest\u2019s total (corrected) price was $[...]. <em>Id. </em>at 27. Alternatively, LabCorp\u2019s aggregate price for the [...] of the 300 top utilized tests it offered was $[...], but Quest\u2019s aggregate price for the same [...] tests was $[...]. Collis Deck \u00b641. The VA evaluators individually considered the 300 top utilized tests, noting that Lab-Corp offered [...] of the tests and Quest offered [... ] of the tests. AR 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-30\">D. <em>Source Selection Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-31\">In its Source Selection Decision (\u201cSSD\u201d), the SSA\u2019s entire best value analysis stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax5\">[LabCorp] only offered [...] of the total tests on FSS and [... ] offered the most tests on FSS at [...]. [...]. Quest\u2019s quote offers the second highest number of tests on FSS and is the lowest quote of all offers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-33\">AR Tab 28 at 1284. Although the SSA stated that \u201ca best value trade-off award determination [was] made,\u201d the SSA did not provide an analysis of any cost-technical tradeoff between LabCorp\u2019s and Quest\u2019s proposals. AR 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-34\">The VA awarded the BPA to Quest, although Quest\u2019s proposal estimated that it would require [...] following the initial project initiation to complete each facility\u2019s software interface. AR Tab 18 at 595. After award, the VA granted Quest an indefinite extension, stating that \u201cwe will not be expecting [Quest] to perform any of those services until [Quest is] able to do so.\u201d AR Tab 35 at 2036-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-35\">E. <em>The Protest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-36\">On January 27, 2014, the VA informed LabCorp that the agency awarded the BPA to Quest. AR Tab 34 at 1789. On February 21, 2014, LabCorp filed a pre-filing notice, pursuant to Appendix C of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d). The notice informed Defendant and the Court of LabCorp\u2019s intent to file a complaint challenging the VA\u2019s award to Quest and to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. On February 25, 2014, Defendant\u2019s counsel contacted counsel for LabCorp, who agreed not to file a complaint until the VA had completed corrective action by issuing a new SSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>On March 27, 2014, the VA issued an \u201cAddendum\u201d to its SSD, which introduced two aspects to be considered under the \u201cCapability\u201d sub-factor: (1) the total number of tests offered on the offeror\u2019s current FSS; and (2) the overall capability and mechanisms used to ensure contract performance within the required period after the award. AR Tab 31 at 1384. The Addendum stated that the number of tests on Quest\u2019s FSS plus \u201cmore specific strengths and weaknesses\u201d demonstrated Quest\u2019s proposal as superior. <em>Id. </em>Further, the Addendum specified that the number of tests on Quest\u2019s proposal \u201cbalancee ] any perceived superiority that the proposal from Laboratory Corporation may have since its score for the Technical sub-factor 2 was a rating of Excellent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Addendum concluded that the VA need not conduct a best value trade-off between Lab-Corp and Quest\u2019s proposals as the two were \u201cessentially equal,\u201d though the SSD stated the VA had already conducted a best value analysis. AR Tab 28 at 1285; AR Tab 31 at 1388. Thus, the VA confirmed the award to Quest and notified LabCorp of its decision on March 31, 2014. AR Tab 32 at 1389.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">LabCorp filed its bid protest in this Court on April 4, 2014. LabCorp challenges the VA\u2019s contract award on multiple grounds, including that the technical and price evaluations were arbitrary and capricious, and lacked a rational basis. LabCorp also contends that the VA did not conduct a best value trade-off analysis as stated in the SSD. Under Modifications P00006 and P00007 to its current contract, LabCorp is continuing to perform the required services through June 30, 2014, pending the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">After the parties\u2019 full briefing, the Court heard oral argument on June 4, 2014. The case is now ready for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\n<em>A. Standards for Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">In bid protest eases, courts review agency actions under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4) (2012) (adopting the standard of review \u201cset forth in [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706]\u201d). This standard \u201cis highly deferential\u201d and \u201crequires a reviewing court to sustain an agency action evincing rational reasoning and consideration of relevant factors.\u201d <em>Advanced Data Concepts, Inc. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed.Cir.2000) (citing <em>Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S.Ct. 438, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974)). Thus, as long as there is \u201ca reasonable basis for the agency\u2019s action, the court should stay its hand even though it might, as an original proposition, have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Honeywell, Inc. v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed.Cir.1989). If, however, \u201cthe agency entirely fail[s] to consider an important aspect of the problem [or] offer[s] an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,\u201d then the resulting action lacks a rational basis and, therefore, is defined as \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Ala. Aircraft Indus., Inc.-Birmingham v. United States, </em>586 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">B. <em>Flaws in the Procurement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">1. <em>The VA Applied an Unstated Evaluation Criterion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">The VA applied an unstated evaluation factor when it used the number of test types on FSS Contracts as a \u201ccritical element\u201d in scoring proposals. It is black letter law that agencies must evaluate offerors\u2019 proposals based on the evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation. <em>See, e.g., AshBritt, Inc. v. United States, </em>87 Fed.Cl. 344, 374 (2009). An agency has broad discretion in the evaluation of bids. <em>Wackenhut Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>85 Fed.Cl. 273, 293 (2008). However, the agency\u2019s technical evaluations must be consistent with the factors and procedures outlined in the solicitation. <em>L-3 Commc\u2019ns EOTech, Inc. v. United States, </em>83 Fed.Cl. 643, 653 (2008). If an agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals differs significantly from the process disclosed in the solicitation, the agency\u2019s decision lacks a rational basis. <em>360Training.com, Inc. v. United States, </em>106 Fed.Cl. 177, 184 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Here, neither the RFQ nor SOW indicated that the VA would evaluate offerors\u2019 proposals based on the number of FSS test types listed. Nonetheless, the record demonstrates that the number of FSS test types became the predominant differentiator used in selecting Quest. The Court finds that the VA\u2019s reliance on this unidentified evaluation factor renders the VA\u2019s evaluation inconsistent with the RFQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The Government argues that LabCorp\u2019s challenge to the evaluation criterion is untimely under <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, </em>492 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir.2007). However, the Court finds that LabCorp had no obligation to seek clarification of the \u201cCapability\u201d sub-factor prior to contract award because no reasonable party would have known that the VA would determine \u201cCapability\u201d based on the number of available FSS test types. The Government maintains that the parties should have known that the VA would limit its evaluation to FSS test types because the solicitation was for a FAR Part 8 procurement. The Court rejects this explanation because the VA initially solicited information about all 1,567 tests and did not distinguish between FSS and open market tests. Indeed, all three offerors provided pricing information about FSS and open market tests. Accordingly, the Court finds that the VA\u2019s decision lacks a rational basis because the VA\u2019s evaluation of proposals differed significantly from the process disclosed in the solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">2. <em>The VA Used an Irrational Price Evaluation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The VA\u2019s price evaluation also violated the terms of the RFQ. It is well-settled that agencies must evaluate proposals based on the criteria in the solicitation. <em>Banknote Corp. of Am., Inc. v. United States, </em>56 Fed. Cl. 377, 386-87 (2003), <em>aff'd, </em>365 F.3d 1345 (Fed.Cir.2004). Here, the RFQ indicated that the VA would evaluate the offerors\u2019 prices by \u201cadding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.\u201d The solicitation requested that each offeror price 1,567 different types of laboratory tests using the BPA Price Schedule. The Price Schedule identified \u201ctotal price\u201d as the offeror\u2019s price for a particular test multiplied by the VA\u2019s estimated usage of that same test for the base and option years. Neither the RFQ, nor the SOW, nor the Price Schedule disclosed that the VA would limit its consideration to the prices that offerors proposed for tests available under their respective FSS Contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Many of this procurement\u2019s problems stem from the fact that the solicitation requested vendors to price all tests even though no vendor offered all tests on its FSS contract. As LabCorp\u2019s counsel aptly described at oral argument, the requirement to price all tests was a \u201chead-fake\u201d because it appeared that the VA would consider all tests when evaluating price. The protest thus turns on whether LabCorp was reasonable in believing that the price evaluation would encompass all tests. The Court finds that this was the only reasonable interpretation. Solicitation provisions must be interpreted in a manner that harmonizes and gives reasonable meaning to all provisions. <em>Coast Fed. Bank, FSB v. United States, </em>323 F.3d 1035, 1038 (Fed.Cir.2003). Here, the use of the term \u201ctotal price\u201d in the Price Schedule for all tests leads to the reasonable conclusion that the VA would evaluate all test prices listed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">According to the Government, \u201ctotal price\u201d in the context of a FAR Part 8 procurement means the total price for FSS tests. The Government argues that it would have been impermissible for the VA to evaluate price based on open market tests in a procurement pursuant to FAR \u00a7 8.405-3(a)(l). According to this logic, the VA could not procure any products or services that were not on an offeror\u2019s FSS Contract. The Court finds this argument unavailing because no reasonable offeror would conclude that the \u201ctotal price\u201d would include only the FSS tests subset. Indeed, all three offerors priced as many of the required 1,567 laboratory tests as possible. The VA clearly sought pricing information for all tests, and the VA\u2019s decision to evaluate only the price of the FSS Contract tests violated the solicitation\u2019s unambiguous pricing instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Even if the VA\u2019s price evaluation did not violate the RFQ, the VA\u2019s process was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>arbitrary and capricious because the VA conducted an unfair \u201capples and oranges\u201d comparison. \u201c[T]he agency at a minimum [is] required to evaluate offerors on an equal basis and in a manner such that the total cost to the government for the required services could be meaningfully assessed.\u201d <em>Simplicity Corp., </em>B-291902, 2003 WL 1989428, *5 (Comp.Gen. Apr. 29, 2003). The FAR requires the contracting officer to ensure that \u201call quotes are fairly considered.\u201d FAR 8.405-3(b)(2)(vi). Thus, an \u201capples and oranges\u201d assessment is improper when comparing dissimilar services or products.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Here, the VA created an \u201capples and oranges\u201d comparison when it limited price evaluations to the FSS tests subset. LabCorp and Quest offered a negligible number of distinct tests when considering both FSS and open market tests. Conversely, LabCorp and Quest offered a significant number of different tests when examining only the FSS subset; LabCorp listed [...] tests on its FSS Contract distinct from Quest, and Quest listed [...] tests on its FSS Contract distinct from LabCorp. Thus, the proposals contained [...] distinct tests with only [...] tests in common. Yet the VA treated the proposals as if they were equivalent, not accounting for these important differences. The VA also failed to acknowledge Quest\u2019s [... ] computational errors, which caused Quest to underprice its proposal by $[...]. Thus, the VA not only improperly conducted an \u201capples and oranges\u201d comparison, but it did so with incorrect figures. Therefore, the Court finds that the VA\u2019s price comparison method renders the evaluation irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The Government again argues that Lab-Corp\u2019s disagreement with the \u201capples and oranges\u201d comparison is an untimely challenge to the RFQ. <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, </em>492 F.3d at 1313. However, the Court finds that LabCorp has not waived its right to challenge the price term on this basis because the RFQ did not place LabCorp on notice. No reasonable party would have known that the VA planned to compare the prices of dissimilar test subsets. It was only after the VA limited its evaluation to FSS tests that the \u201capples and oranges\u201d problem arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">3. <em>The VA\u2019s Technical Evaluation Lacked a Rational Basis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">The VA gave Quest a higher score than LabCorp on the first technical sub-factor, \u201cCapability,\u201d because of the greater number of test types on Quest\u2019s FSS Contract. As described above, this was an unstated evaluation factor that failed to comply with the RFQ. If not for the use of the unstated evaluation factor, the VA would have determined that LabCorp was technically superior because LabCorp had a higher score on the second technical sub-factor. Thus, the use of an unstated evaluation criterion undermined the entire technical evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Moreover, the VA relaxed specifications so that Quest would have time to interface with the VA\u2019s VistA computer software system. Quest\u2019s proposal estimated that it would require [...] following the start of performance to complete each facility\u2019s interface. The VA granted Quest an indefinite extension after award and stated that it would not expect Quest to perform any services until it was able to do so. However, the RFQ required a contractor to make every effort to interface quickly with the VistA system so that the VA could place orders as soon as possible. This relaxation of the specifications was a failure to comply with the RFQ.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">Besides violating the RFQ, the VA insufficiently documented its technical evaluation. An agency must articulate a satisfactory explanation for an action to permit effective judicial review. <em>Timken U.S. Corp. v. United States, </em>421 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2005). Specifically, the agency must articulate the reasons for its procurement decision including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. <em>Distributed Solutions, Inc. v. United States, </em>104 Fed. Cl. 368, 377 (2012) (citation omitted). Here, the administrative record does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the VA\u2019s action. As noted, one evaluator identified [...] under LabCorp\u2019s \u201cInterface Compatibility\u201d sub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>factor, and [...]. This resulted in a total LabCorp rating of \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d The same evaluator identified nearly the same [...] plus the identical [...] for Quest\u2019s \u201cInterface Compatibility\u201d sub-factor, but then assigned Quest a higher rating of \u201cGood\u201d for this sub-factor. Such narratives lack a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made and are indicative of the VA\u2019s failure to explain its decision-making throughout the procurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">FAR Subpart 8.4 provides for streamlined documentation. However, this subpart\u2019s \u201cminimum documentation\u201d objective still requires an agency to document the \u201cevaluation methodology\u201d and \u201crationale for any tradeoffs\u201d used in making a selection. FAR 8.405-2(e). Subpart 8.4 may create a low bar for documentation, but the VA has fallen short of it here. Initially, the VA indicated that it had conducted a best value trade-off analysis and found Quest to be the winner. Recognizing that it had not documented any trade-off analysis, the VA submitted an addendum saying that a trade-off analysis was not needed because of technically equivalent proposals. The Addendum identified two factors as a basis for the technical equivalency: (1) the number of test types requested on the Price Schedule that each offeror had on its FSS contract; and (2) \u201cspecific strengths and weaknesses\u201d identified for each offeror. The SSD contained no documentation explaining why this first factor should provide any advantage to Quest, when this is the same factor that was used to evaluate the \u201cCapability\u201d sub-factor. Moreover, the SSD failed to identify which of the individual evaluators\u2019 \u201cstrengths and weaknesses\u201d supposedly make Quest\u2019s proposal superior to LabCorp\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The Addendum offers little support for the VA\u2019s decision and is undermined by the fact that the Addendum was authored after the contract was awarded and after LabCorp filed a pre-filing protest notice with the Court. It is well understood that the Court cannot review the agency\u2019s technical ratings through the lens of post-hoc rationalizations. <em>BayFirst Solutions, LLC v. United States, </em>102 Fed.Cl. 677, 685 (2012). According to the Government, the Addendum clarified the award decision, but the Addendum appears to be an attempt at salvaging the award from the VA\u2019s failure to perform a meaningful trade-off analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Furthermore, there is no basis in the record to conclude that the SSA evaluated Quest\u2019s and LabCorp\u2019s proposals \u201cagainst all source selection criteria in the solicitation,\u201d or exercised \u201cindependent judgment.\u201d FAR 15.308. Though the SOW listed different services required of an offeror, the VA did not document any corresponding evaluation. For example, \u201ctransportation of samples in such manner as to ensure the integrity of the specimen\u201d and \u201c[tjimely ... and appropriate analysis of patient specimens\u201d may fairly be interpreted as \u201cCapability\u201d components, but the VA neglected to analyze and rate these services. Rather, the VA evaluated the \u201cCapability\u201d sub-factor solely on the number of test types on each offeror\u2019s FSS Contract. Apparently the VA also overlooked the third technical sub-factor, \u201cCustomer Support,\u201d as nothing in the record indicates that the VA considered this sub-factor. Accordingly, the Court finds that the VA\u2019s technical evaluation lacked a rational basis and adequate documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">4. <em>The VA\u2019s Award Decision Was Arbitrary and Capricious.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Ultimately, the VA\u2019s award decision was arbitrary and capricious because of the errors the agency made in its technical and price evaluations. The VA improperly gave Quest an edge on the Capability sub-factor because of the number of test types on its FSS Contract. This edge neutralized Lab-Corp\u2019s \u201cExcellent\u201d designation on \u201cInterface Compatibility,\u201d which yielded a technical tie. Price was then used as the \u201cBest Value\u201d tiebreaker using only the prices of an offer- or\u2019s FSS tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">If not for these improper evaluations, the VA would have been required to conduct a best value trade-off analysis and make a valid determination as to which quotation was \u201cmost advantageous\u201d to the Government. Under such analysis, the VA would have weighed the trade-off between LabCorp\u2019s technical strengths and its higher price. <em>Wackenhut Servs., </em>85 Fed.Cl. at 307. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>VA had conducted such a cost-technical trade-off analysis, it may have determined that LabCorp\u2019s marginally higher-priced, technically superior proposal was more advantageous to the Government. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s failure to conduct a best value trade-off analysis renders the VA\u2019s award decision arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">C. <em>Prejudice to LabCorp</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Before the Court can grant injunctive relief, the plaintiff must show that the agency\u2019s irrational procurement process caused plaintiff to suffer prejudice. <em>Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2005). Prejudice is a question of fact and exists where \u201cthere was a substantial chance that [the plaintiff] would have received the contract award but for [the agency\u2019s] error.\u201d <em>Advanced Data Concepts, </em>216 F.3d at 1057; <em>Statistica, Inc. v. Christopher, </em>102 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1996). While trivial error in the procurement process does not justify relief, the agency\u2019s mistakes in this ease surpass insignificant error. <em>Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States, </em>575 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Here, LabCorp has shown that it suffered prejudice resulting from the VA\u2019s flawed evaluation methods. By failing to reveal the number of FSS test types as an evaluation factor, the VA circumvented Lab-Corp\u2019s efforts to compete under the undisclosed criterion. For example, if afforded the opportunity, LabCorp could have added more tests to its FSS Contract or adjusted its prices. In fact, the VA knew that Lab-Corp added new testing to its FSS Contract regularly. Instead, the VA used the unstated criterion as the determining factor simultaneously demoting LabCorp\u2019s and boosting Quest\u2019s overall technical scores. As a result, the VA assigned both offerors \u201cGood\u201d overall ratings, which removed the need for a best value trade-off analysis. Indeed, the VA contradicted the original SSD when it stated in the Addendum that it need not conduct a trade-off analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Furthermore, the VA improperly examined the total price of only the FSS tests without a common basis to allow a fair \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison. If LabCorp had known that the VA intended to evaluate dissimilar offers as if they were comparable, then Lab-Corp likely would have filed a protest prior to submitting its proposal. Remarkably, nothing in the record indicates that the VA accounted for the major computational errors in Quest\u2019s pricing. Without knowledge of Quest\u2019s actual price, the VA could not have evaluated the price factor fairly irrespective of the \u201capples to oranges\u201d comparison. In sum, the VA deviated from the RFQ terms, neutralized LabCorp\u2019s technical advantage, eliminated the need for a best value trade-off analysis, conducted an \u201capples to oranges\u201d price comparison, and failed to recognize Quest\u2019s significant miscalculations. The Court finds that LabCorp had a substantial chance of winning the contract without the VA\u2019s errors, and therefore LabCorp suffered prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">D. <em>Criteria for Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">The Tucker Act expressly empowers the Court to award \u201cany relief that the court considers proper, including declaratory and injunctive relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(2). The Court must consider four factors before granting permanent injunctive relief: (1) whether the plaintiff has succeeded on the merits of the case; (2) whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the court withholds injunctive relief; (3) whether the balance of hardships to the respective parties favors granting injunctive relief; and (4) whether granting injunctive relief serves the public interest. <em>PGBA, LLC v. United States, </em>389 F.3d 1219, 1228-29 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citing <em>Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village of Gambell, Alaska, </em>480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 94 L.Ed.2d 542 (1987)). Plaintiff has the burden of establishing the four factors by preponderant evidence. <em>MORI Assocs., Inc. v. United States, </em>102 Fed.Cl. 503, 551 n. 60 (2011) (citing cases). In this case, LabCorp has shown by preponderant evidence that all four factors are met. The Court thus grants permanent injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">1. <em>Success on the Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">First, a plaintiff must prevail on the merits, as this is an essential factor in deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>mining whether to issue a permanent injunction. <em>MORI Assocs., </em>102 Fed.Cl. at 551. To succeed on the merits a plaintiff must show that the agency\u2019s actions satisfy the APA\u2019s \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). Here, LabCorp has succeeded on the merits. The VA applied an unstated evaluation criterion, lacked a rational basis for its technical and price evaluations, and never conducted a best value trade-off analysis. As a result, the VA\u2019s actions were arbitrary, capricious, and not in compliance with applicable law. Therefore, LabCorp has succeeded on the merits of its ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">2. <em>Irreparable Harm</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Second, the Court must determine whether the agency\u2019s actions will irreparably harm the plaintiff without injunctive relief. This Court has found that irreparable harm exists where an offeror has lost the opportunity to compete fairly for a contract. <em>HP Enter. Servs., LLC v. United States, </em>104 Fed.Cl. 230, 245 (2012) (citing cases). Moreover, it is well-established that when arbitrary procurement actions deprive an offeror of the opportunity to compete for a contract, the resulting lost profits are sufficient to constitute irreparable injury. <em>MORI Assocs., </em>102 Fed. Cl. at 552 (finding irreparable injury where the plaintiff had performed many of the solicitation\u2019s required services under the incumbent contract). Here, LabCorp will lose the opportunity to compete fairly for the BPA without injunctive relief. The VA conducted an irrational evaluation that obviated open and honest competition. Furthermore, Lab-Corp will lose significant anticipated profits. Because expected profits exceed mere bid preparation and proposal costs, only reimbursing protest costs would grossly undereompensate LabCorp. Accordingly, the Court finds that LabCorp will suffer irreparable harm without permanent injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">3. <em>Balance of Hardships</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Third, the Court must consider whether an injunction will result in greater harm to defendant than the irreparable harm to plaintiff. <em>MORI Assocs., </em>102 Fed.Cl. at 551. Requiring the Government to continue purchasing the services from the incumbent offeror for the interim does not outweigh the irreparable harm to an offeror. <em>HP Enter. Servs., </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 245-46. Here, injunctive relief will simply maintain the status quo while the VA conducts a lawful procurement with lawful and rational proposal evaluations. The VA already extended LabCorp\u2019s contract through the end of June 2014 and can do so again to accommodate the use of a proper process. Further, the VA will suffer negligible harm in reconducting a fair procurement. The resources needed to conduct a proper procurement are only those that should have been employed originally by the agency. Having to employ these resources again is not an agency hardship, but an agency obligation. Therefore, the Court finds that the balance of hardships strongly favors the granting of permanent injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">4. <em>Public Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Fourth, the Court must determine whether granting an injunction serves the public interest by precluding \u201caward decisions [that] destroy the public trust in government contracting and deprive the government of the benefits of full and open competition.\u201d <em>HP Enter. Servs., </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 246. An overriding public interest exists in \u201cpreserving the integrity of the federal procurement process by requiring government officials to follow procurement statutes and regulations.\u201d <em>Alion Sci. and Tech. Corp. v. United States, </em>74 Fed.Cl. 372, 376 (2006) (citing <em>CW Gov\u2019t Travel, Inc. v. United States, </em>61 Fed.Cl. 559, 576 (2004)). Here, that integrity was compromised when the VA conducted an irrational evaluation of proposals, violating the standard set forth in the APA. Allowing the VA\u2019s decision to stand would frustrate the public interest in fair and open competitive procurements and erode public trust in government contracting. Thus, the Court finds that permanent injunctive relief plainly serves the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs motion for judgment on the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>record is GRANTED. Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the administrative record is DENIED, and Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s motion for judgment on the administrative record is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The Court permanently enjoins the VA from proceeding with the performance of the contract awarded to Quest Diagnostics Inc. for the laboratory testing and analysis services at the five VA Medical Centers located in Buffalo, Canandaigua, Bath, Syracuse, and Abany, New York. Pursuant to Rule 54(d), the Court awards reasonable costs to Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">. In a prior ruling, the Court allowed Plaintiff to supplement the record with the declaration of Ariel H. Collis, an expert economist. <em>Lab. Corp. of Am. Holdings v. United States, </em>No. 14-261C, 2014 WL 2446718, 116 Fed.Cl. 386 (Fed. Cl. June 2, 2014). The Court relies upon the Collis Declaration simply to cite other plausible methods to evaluate prices, some of which would have shown LabCorp to be the most advantageous price. The main point, however, is that the VA did not evaluate prices for all tests as it indicated it would in the solicitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b659-9\">.
