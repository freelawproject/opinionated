Compl., Aug. 11, 2010, ECF No. 1. CANVS alleges the government unlawfully used or manufactured an invention covered by plaintiffs U.S. Patent No. 6,911,652 filed June 28, 2005 (the \u2019652 patent or patent-in-suit), which is directed toward a device optimizing the user\u2019s ability to see in low-light conditions that is particularly useful in military applications. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 15-19; <em>see also </em>\u2019652 patent, ECF No. 59-1. The government moved for summary judgment based on, in relevant part, the alleged invalidity of all seven claims of the patent-in-suit as anticipated under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e) (2006) by U.S. Patent No. 5,035,472 filed Jul. 30, 1991 (Hansen or Hansen patent). Def.\u2019s Mot. Summ. J. (SJ Motion), March 12, 2013, ECF No. 59; Hansen patent, ECF No. 59-2; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n (SJ Opposition), May 17, 2013, ECF No. 66; Def.\u2019s Reply (SJ Reply), July 12, 2013, ECF No. 69; Pl.\u2019s Sur-Reply (SJ Sur-Reply), Sept. 5, 2013, ECF No. 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-17\">In granting in part, and denying in part, the Court invalidated claims 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the \u2019652 patent as anticipated by Hansen\u2019s prior art, but held a genuine issue of material fact remained whether Hansen anticipated \u2019652 patent claims 4, 5, and 7. <em>See CANVS Corp. v. United States, </em>114 Fed.Cl. 59, 75 (2013) (Partial Summary Judgment Opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-18\">Now before the Court are the parties\u2019 cross-motions for reconsideration regarding the validity of claims 6 and 7 of the \u2019652 patent. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. Reeons. (Def.\u2019s Mot. Reeons.), Dee. 18, 2013, ECF No. 83; Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n. &amp; Cross-Mot. Reeons. (Pl.\u2019s CrossMot.

The parties both argue that claims 6 and 7 are sufficiently similar to warrant a consistent validity determination; therefore, the Court purportedly erred in finding one invalid and not the other. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. Recons. 1 (claims 6 and 7 warrant a \u201cconsistent outcome\u201d); Pl.\u2019s Cross-Mot. Recons. 4 (the \u201csame reasoning\u201d applies to claims 6 and 7). The parties disagree, however, whether the Court should find both claims valid or invalid. Defendant asks the Court to invalidate claim 7 for the same reasons it invalidated claim 6, whereas plaintiff asks the Court to reinstate claim 6 for adjudication with claim 7 at trial. <em>Compare </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. Recons. 1, 5-6 (requesting revision of the Partial Summary Judgment Opinion to invalidate claim 7), <em>with </em>Pl.\u2019s Cross-Mot. Recons. 1 (requesting revision to hold claim 6 not invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The Court agrees that claims 6 and 7 warrant a consistent outcome. The Court also finds that, in the interests of justice, defendant is entitled to summary judgment on claims 1, 2, 3, and 6 pursuant to the Partial Summary Judgment Opinion, as well as claims 6 and 7 for the additional reasons as set forth herein. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s reconsideration motion is GRANTED, plaintiff\u2019s reconsideration motion is DENIED, and the Court\u2019s Partial Summary Judgment Opinion, 114 Fed.Cl. 59 (2013), is AMENDED to the extent inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">I. <em>Background on the \u2019652 Patent and the Hansen Patent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The \u2019652 patent and the Hansen patent both teach devices that enhance the user\u2019s ability to see in low-light and no-light conditions through the use of a photon image intensifier and a thermal imager. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u2019652 patent at [57]; Hansen at [57], Each device has: (i) an optical input defining a line of sight; (ii) the means to direct near infrared (photon) energy in the line of sight to a photon-amplifying assembly that creates an enhanced photon-based image; (iii) the means to direct far infrared (thermal) radiation in the line of sight to a thermal imaging assembly that generates a thermal image; and (iv) an optical output or eyepiece permitting the user to view the resulting processed image(s). <em>See, e.g., </em>\u2019652 patent at [57] &amp; fig. 1, 2; Hansen at [57] &amp; fig. 4, 5; <em>CANVS, </em>114 Fed.Cl. at 62-65 (discussing the patent processes).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The patent technologies, however, are not identical. Based on the information currently before the Court, at a minimum each patent offers a different range of output images, as well as varying capabilities to adjust the brightness or intensity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of those images.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">A. The Hansen Patent\u2019s Capabilities</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">A user of a Hansen-patented device turns a switch on the device\u2019s exterior housing to view, selectively, distinct spectrum channels\u2014(i) the visible spectrum, ideal for daylight viewing; (ii) the near infrared (photon) spectrum, ideal for twilight viewing; (iii) the far infrared (thermal) spectrum, ideal for total darkness; or (iv) simultaneously the near and far infrared speetrums (photon and thermal), ideal for mixed conditions. Hansen col.5 1.3-10 (claim 1), col.5 1.16-19 (claim 2), eol.6 1.18-19 (claim 7) &amp; col. 6 1.20-32 (claim 8). Once the user selects a spectrum channel, he or she may then use \u201ca plurality of manually operable thumb nail rotary switches for controlling reticle brightness and contrast and scene brightness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col.6 1.32-37 (claim 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">The preferred embodiment of Hansen\u2019s figure 2A is informative.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><em>Id. </em>at fig. 2A (noting locations of switch 30, spectrum channel settings 31A-31D, and thumb nail rotary switches 36 and 34). A single thumb nail rotary switch 36 is designed to control brightness or intensity of (a) the visible spectrum when switch 30 is set to visible spectrum channel 31A; (b) the enhanced photon-based image when switch 30 is set to near infrared channel 31B; (c) the thermal image when switch 30 is set to far infrared channel 31C; and (d) the enhanced composite photon-thermal image when switch 30 is' set to combined near and far infrared channel 31D. <em>Id. </em>at col.l 1.60-68 (explaining how a user controls brightness of discrete spectral views by turning switch 30 to elect spectrum channels 31A through 31D), eol.2 1.38-48 (same) &amp; col.4 1.26-28 (explaining, in relevant part, that thumb nail rotary switch 36 adjusts scene brightness); <em>see also CANVS, </em>114 Fed.Cl. at 69 (resolving dispute over the functionality of Hansen\u2019s preferred embodiment switches 34 and 36, finding that switch 34 controls scene contrast for both the photon and thermal images, whereas switch 36 controls scene brightness for both the photon and thermal images).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">B. The \u2019652 Patent\u2019s Capabilities</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In comparison, the \u2019652 patent does not permit selective viewing of discrete spectrum channels; rather, a user of the \u2019652 patent technology may view only a composite photon-thermal image. \u2019652 patent col.6 1.56-59 (claim l(j)), col.8 1.1-3 (claims 5(e)), col.8 1.17-19 (claim 6(e)) &amp; col.8 1.33-35 (claim 7(e)); <em>see also id. </em>at col.3 1.8-9, col.4 1.35-39, &amp; eol.5 1.23-27, 38-41, 44-47. However, the user can adjust the relative proportions of photon to thermal imagery in the composite view. <em>Id. </em>at col.7 1.19-23 (claim 4) (teaching separate \u201cadjustment assembl[ies]\u201d that are \u201cstructured to be independently and separately adjusted relative to one another.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at col.6 1.44- 55 (claim 1(f)\u2014(i)), col.7 1.32-37 (claim 5(d)), col.8 1.12-16 (claim 6(d)) &amp; col.8 1.28-32 (claim 7(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In the preferred embodiment of the \u2019652 patent\u2019s figure 1, a knob or button at 36 adjusts how much of the output image is defined by the thermal image, col.5 1.50-60, whereas a knob or button at 46 adjusts how much of the output image is defined by the enhanced photon image, col.5 1.60-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\"><em>Id. </em>at fig. 1 (noting location of knob 36 on the thermal imaging and adjustment assemblies and knob 46 on the photon intensification and adjustment assemblies). Having two distinct adjustment knobs allows the user, while viewing the composite image, to adjust the photon and thermal images separately, in real-time and relative to one another. <em>See id. </em>at col.3 1.9-19 &amp; col.5 1.55-60, 64-67. The claimed invention is intended to allow the user, in mixed environmental conditions, to take advantage of the benefits of photon enhancement and thermal imaging, while minimizing the deficiencies of each. <em>See id. </em>at col.l 1.11-19 &amp; col.2 1.32-36, 40-44. The Court has referred to this capability as the \u2019652 patent\u2019s \u201cindependent brightness adjustment feature.\u201d <em>E.g., CANVS, </em>114 Fed. Cl. at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">II. <em>The Court\u2019s Findings in its Partial Summary Judgment Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">In its Partial Summary Judgment Opinion, the Court held claims 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the \u2019652 patent were invalid based on Hansen\u2019s prior art, but a genuine issue of material fact remained whether Hansen anticipated claims 4, 5, and 7 of the \u2019652 patent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>CANVS, </em>114 Fed.Cl. at 73, 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Claim 1 subparts (a) through (e) and (j) are invalid because they disclosed the general technology of capturing and processing photon and thermal energy in a line of sight into a useful output image, earlier set forth in more detail by Hansen. <em>Compare </em>\u2019652 patent col.6 1.33-43, 56-59, <em>with </em>Hansen at [57] (abstract), col. 1 1.12-16 (background), col.3 1.15-39, 43-53 (preferred embodiment), col.4 1.10-20 (same), eol.4 1.47-col.5 1.2 (claim 1, general description), eol.5 1.29-37 (claim 5, photon processes), col.5, 1.38-51 (claim 6, thermal processes), &amp; col.5 1.52-eol.6 1.19 (claim 7, spectrum beam splitting and recombination processes); <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s SJ Opp\u2019n 8 (admitting that claim 1(a) through (e) \u201cwere known in the art\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Similarly, claim 1 subparts (f) through (h) teach the general ability to adjust the brightness or intensity of the photon and thermal images, which was also anticipated by Hansen. <em>Compare </em>\u2019652 patent col.6 1.44-52 (claim 1(f)\u2014(h), imaging adjustment), <em>with </em>Hansen col. 1 1.66-68 (summary), col.2 1.44-48 (preferred embodiment), col.4 1.26-28 (same) <em>&amp; </em>col.6 1.32-37 (claim 8); <em>see also </em>discussion <em>supra </em>Part I.A (Hansen\u2019s capabilities). Lastly, claim 1 subpart (i) of the \u2019652 patent discloses the independent operation of those adjustment capabilities, which likewise was taught by Hansen. <em>Compare </em>\u2019652 patent col.6 1.53-55 (claim l(i), adjustment operation), <em>with </em>Hansen col.2 1.38-44 (preferred embodiment), <em>and CANVS, </em>114 Fed.Cl. at 69 n. 11 (discussing independent operability versus, independent adjustability).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Hansen also teaches to the limitations in the patent-in-suit\u2019s claim 2, which depends from its claim 1. <em>See </em>\u2019652 patent, col.6 1.60-col.7 1.14. Claim 2 concerns the assembly that amplifies photon energy in the line of sight and produces an enhanced photon-based image. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff does not dispute that Hansen inherently anticipates this technology. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s SJ Opp\u2019n 24-25 (hinging the validity of claim 2 not on the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>limitations in that claim but on the validity of claim 1 on which claim 2 depends); <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s SJ Mot. 19 (arguing that Hansen\u2019s means of amplifying photon energy is \u201cpreferably a U.S. Army third generation intensifier tube,\u201d <em>see </em>col.4 1.13-14, that reflects \u201cthe functioning of a standard image intensifier tube\u201d also employed in the patent-in-suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The patent-in-suit\u2019s dependent claim 3 also is not novel. Hansen discloses an optical output or eyepiece capable of displaying a processed image regardless of the eyepiece\u2019s physical orientation relative to its image intensifier. <em>See, e.g., </em>Hansen figs. 4 &amp; 5. This meets plaintiffs construction of the limitations in claim 3 of the patent-in-suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Revised CL Constr. Stmt., ECF No. 59-4, at D28 (interpreting the phrase \u201cvisually aligned communication\u201d in the patent-in-suit\u2019s claim 3, <em>see </em>eol.7 1.15-18, as meaning \u201c[t]he eye piece displays the area of the tactical environment under surveillance regardless of the physical orientation of the eye piece in relation to the photon generation assembly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">However, with respect to claims 4 and 5 of the \u2019652 patent, the Court determined that summary judgment was inappropriate. <em>CANVS, </em>114 Fed.Cl. at 73. There is a genuine, material dispute regarding whether Hansen\u2019s adjustment capabilities anticipate the patent-in-suit\u2019s \u201cindependent brightness adjustment feature,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 69-70, 73 (express and inherent anticipation), which appears to be set forth in claims 4 and 5(d), <em>see id. </em>at 63, 68.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">For example, the \u2019652 patent teaches a device allowing its user\u2014while viewing the composite image in real-time\u2014to turn one knob to adjust the brightness or intensity of the enhanced photon-based image while turning a different knob to adjust separately the brightness or intensity of the thermal image. \u2019652 patent eol.3 1.9-19 &amp; col.5 1.55-60, 64-67; <em>see also </em>discussion <em>supra </em>Part I.B (\u2019652 patent\u2019s capabilities). As a result, the user can control the relative proportions of photon to thermal imagery in the composite scene in order to achieve an optimum output view based on mixed light and other environmental conditions. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at eol.7 1.19\u2014 23 (claim 4) &amp; col.l 1.11-19 (advantages of the invention).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">In contrast, based on the information currently before the Court, Hansen teaches only a single knob controlling the brightness or intensity of the scene depending on its spectrum channel setting. <em>See </em>Hansen eol.4 1.26-28; <em>CANVS, </em>114 Fed.Cl. at 69 (holding a single knob adjusts brightness or intensity regardless of spectrum channel setting). The single knob, therefore, would adjust the thermal image in the thermal mode or the photon image in the photon mode; however, it is unclear how that single knob would adjust the mixed thermal-photon image when the device is set to the composite view mode. The Hansen patent teaches that the single knob would adjust the overall \u201cscene brightness\u201d in this composite view. <em>See </em>Hansen eol.2 1.44-48 (specification), col.4 1.26-28 (specification) &amp; col.6 1.32-37 (claim 8). However, there is a genuine, material dispute concerning what that means in practice, as well as whether the single knob\u2019s functioning in the composite view\u2014whatever that may be\u2014anticipates the dual adjustment capability in the patent-in-suit\u2019s composite view. Neither party devoted sufficient attention to answering this question in their summary judgment or reconsideration briefing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>was likely because the answer hinges on extrinsic evidence otherwise inappropriate at the summary judgment stage. In any event, there is not enough evidence currently before the Court to conclude that Hansen\u2019s adjustment capabilities expressly or inherently anticipate the \u2019652 patent\u2019s \u201cindependent brightness adjustment feature\u201d seemingly set forth in its claims 4 and/or 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Lastly, concerning the patent-in-suit\u2019s remaining claim 6 and claim 7, which disclose the adjustment assemblies for the thermal image and photon image, respectively, the Court granted summary judgment on the former but denied it on the latter. <em>CANVS, </em>114 Fed.Cl. at 73. As explained in the balance of this opinion, the Court should have granted summary judgment with respect to both claim 6 and claim 7, and this error is corrected herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">III. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aaa\">A Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">A motion for reconsideration of an interlocutory order is governed by Rule 54(b) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC). <em>Barry v.

Barr Labs., Inc., </em>251 F.3d 955, 962 (Fed.Cir.2001). \u201cThus, a moving party seeking to invalidate a patent at summary judgment must submit such clear and convincing evidence of invalidity so that no reasonable [factfinder] could find otherwise.\u201d <em>Eli Lilly, </em>251 F.3d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">If, as here, the moving party seeks to establish invalidity based on anticipation (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e)(2) (2006)),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the moving party must show, by clear and convincing evidence, that \u201cevery element and limitation of the claimed invention must be found in a single prior art reference, arranged as in a claim.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Brown v. 3M, </em>265 F.3d 1349, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>accord Net MoneyIN, Inc. v. VeriSign, Inc., </em>545 F.3d 1359, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he proponent must show that the four corners of a single, prior art document describe every element of the claimed invention.\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted); <em>Eli Lilly, </em>251 F.3d at 970 (requiring \u201cdisclosure of] every limitation of the claimed invention either explicitly or inherently\u201d); <em>Celeritas Techs., Ltd,, v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>150 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed.Cir.1998) (\u201cIt is well settled that a claim is anticipated if each and every limitation is found either expressly or inherently in a single prior art reference\u201d). The anticipatory reference, however, must include sufficient \u201crequisite information\u201d about the invention to be \u201cenabling,\u201d meaning that it \u201cmust teach one of ordinary skill in the art to make or carry out the claimed invention without undue experimentation.\u201d <em>Minn. Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Chemque, Inc., </em>303 F.3d 1294, 1306 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">IV. <em>Reconsideration is Appropriate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Although neither party specifically articulates the legal basis for its reconsideration motion, the parties\u2019 arguments reflect a shared belief that the Court\u2019s inconsistent rulings on claims 6 and 7 represent a mistake of law or fact, which creates a \u201cclearly apparent or obvious\u201d \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d given the similarity in the claims\u2019 texts and word structures. Additionally, the parties\u2019 request for reconsideration is wholly consistent with the Court\u2019s authority to address an error in its Partial Summary Judgment Opinion. <em>Cf. Int\u2019l Indus. Park, </em>102 Fed.Cl. at 115 (addressing attorneys\u2019 fees on reconsideration after the court\u2019s ruling on liability overlooked the fully briefed fee issue); <em>Fru-Con, </em>44 Fed.Cl. at 301-302 (addressing issues on reconsideration not addressed in judgment previously entered, including a disputed unpaid contract balance that plaintiff had mentioned in its \u201cStatement of Issues\u201d albeit not in its original or amended complaint). In any event, the Court is within its own inherent authority to amend or correct its own interlocutory ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">The similarities in text and word structure in claims 6 and 7 of the patent-in-suit warrant a consistent result on validity. Both claims are divided into five subparts. Sub-parts (a) through (c) and (e) of claims 6 and 7 are identical. <em>Compare </em>\u2019652 patent col.8 1.4-11, 17-19 (claim 6(a)-(c) &amp; (e)), <em>with id. </em>at col.8 1.20-27, 33-35 (claim 7(a)-(c) &amp; (e)). The only differences in claims 6 and 7 appear in their respective subparts (d). These sub-parts (d) begin with the same recitation\u2014\u201ca thermal image adjustment assembly and a photon image adjustment assembly ...\u201d <em>{see </em>\u2019652 patent, eol.8 1.12-13 &amp; col.8 1.28-29)\u2014but claim 6(d) adds a limitation related solely to the adjustability of the thermal imager, eol.8 1.13-16, whereas claim 7(d) adds a limitation related solely to the adjust-ability of the photon image intensifier, col.8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>1.28-32.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For purposes of summary judgment, however, this difference is immaterial. On re-examination, the similar text and word structure render the claims sufficiently similar to merit the same result on validity. The parties agree. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. Recons. 2, 4; Def.\u2019s Cross-Mot. Recons. 1-2; Pi\u2019s SJ Opp\u2019n 6 n.2 (stating the difference between the claims \u201cexcept for claim 4, are not material to the issues of validity raised by [defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Claims 6 and 7 will stand or fall together as two sides of the same coin. <em>See Dayco Prods., Inc. v. Total Containment, Inc., </em>329 F.3d 1358, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2003) (\u201c[I]t is permissible to group claims together for disposition where resolution involves the same issues of validity ... [and] those issues are substantially materially identical\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">V. <em>Claim 6 and Claim 7 are Anticipated by Hansen\u2019s Prior Art and Therefore Invalid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">As the Court held in its Partial Summary Judgment Opinion, a genuine issue of material fact surviving summary judgment is whether Hansen\u2019s prior art expressly or inherently anticipates the \u2019652 patent\u2019s \u201cindependent brightness adjustment\u201d feature. <em>CANVS, </em>114 Fed.Cl. at 73. For the reasons set forth below, neither claim 6 nor claim 7 teach to this limitation. Rather, claims 6 and 7 teach to the same limitations as claim 1, which this Court has already held invalid. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Hansen anticipates the patent-in-suit\u2019s claims 6(a)-(c) and (e) and claim 7(a)-(c) and (e) in the same manner and for the same reasons that Hansen anticipates the patent-in-suit\u2019s claim l(a)-(e) and (j). <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>Part II (discussing claim l(a)-(e), (j)). These subparts disclose the general shared technology of (i) an optical input defining a line of suit; (ii) the means of generating a thermal image from a far infrared radiation signature; (iii) the means of generating an enhanced photon-based image from a near infrared radiation signature; and (iv) the ability to generate a single output image combining the thermal and enhanced-photon images. <em>Compare </em>\u2019652 patent col.6 1.33-43, 56-59 (claim l(a)-(e) &amp; (j)), <em>with id. </em>at col. 8 1.4-11, 17-19 (claim 6(a)-(e) &amp; (e)) &amp; col.8 1.20-27, 33-35 (claim 7(a)-(c) &amp; (e)). There is nothing novel about these limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">This leaves only the question of whether Hansen anticipates claim 6(d) and claim 7(d). Each subpart(d) discloses a \u201cbirds-eye view\u201d of the general process and purpose of each of the adjustment assemblies. Claim 6(d) teaches a \u201cthermal image adjustment assembly\u201d that adjusts the \u201cthermal imaging assembly\u201d in order to adjust the output thermal image. <em>Id. </em>at col.8 1.12-16. Claim 7(d) teaches a \u201cphoton image adjustment assembly\u201d that adjusts the photon \u201cimage intensification assembly\u201d to adjust the output photon-based image. <em>Id. </em>at col.8 1.28-32. These claims are virtually identical to claim 1(f) through (h), which the Court has already determined invalid based on Hansen\u2019s prior art. <em>See id. </em>at col.6 1.44-52 (claim 1(f)\u2014(h)); <em>see also </em>discussion <em>supra </em>Part II (discussing holdings in the Partial Summary Judgment Opinion). They all teach the general ability to adjust the brightness or intensity of the photon and thermal images.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Neither claim 6 nor claim 7 expressly teach the dual adjustment of the photon and thermal images relative to one another. <em>Cf. </em>\u2019652 patent col.7 1.19-23 (claim 4). The Court also lacks any basis to infer that each claim teaches the dual, relational adjustment. Each claim states only that its \u201cadjustment assembly\u201d is \u201cstructured to adjust\u201d its imaging assembly, without offering any detail regarding each structure, how each structure accomplishes its adjustment goal, or how each structure relates to the other. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>Part III.B (discussing \u201cenabling\u201d requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">VI. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">Summary judgment is appropriate with respect to the patent-in-suit\u2019s claims 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, as each of those claims is anticipated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>by the Hansen patent\u2019s prior art. However, a genuine dispute of material fact remains as to whether Hansen\u2019s adjustment capabilities anticipate the \u201cindependent brightness adjustment\u201d feature seemingly set forth in the patent-in-suit\u2019s claim 4 and claim 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration with respect to claim 7 is GRANTED, and plaintiffs cross-motion for reconsideration with respect to claim 6 is DENIED. Furthermore, the Court\u2019s Partial Summary Judgment Opinion, 114 Fed.Cl. 59 (2013), is AMENDED to the extent inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">.

Plaintiff appears to be arguing, at least in part, that Hansen\u2019s single \u201cscene brightness\u201d adjustment knob would be ineffective to adjust the brightness or intensity of the photon-thermal images when Hansen is set to the mode of composite view. This argument is implied from plaintiff\u2019s contention that the only means to improve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Hansen's photon-thermal composite view would be to adjust the photon and thermal images separately on their discrete spectrum channels before overlaying them in the composite view. <em>See CANVS, </em>114 Fed.Cl. at 71-72.
