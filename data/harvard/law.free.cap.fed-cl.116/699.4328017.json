Bair, who, at times, refers to himself as \u201cPro epio\u2014Airenost,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a number of documents, which the Clerk\u2019s Office should not have accepted as a \u201ccomplaint,\u201d but assigned a case number. Given that plaintiff only submitted a random assortment of documents, which in no way resembles a complaint, and in which he never mentions the jurisdiction of this court, the Clerk\u2019s Office should have returned Mr. Bair\u2019s submission, together with his filing fee, instead of opening a ease file and assigning a case number.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The documents in plaintiffs initial filing are comprised of a series of letters addressed to Attorney General Erie Holder, The President of the United States, Barack Obama, and to the \u201cHonorable Judge Presiding\u201d at the United States Court of Federal Claims, together with assorted United States District Court forms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The letters submitted include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">1.

Clinton et al., </em>No. 13-3498 (6th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>June 21, 2013) (dismissing the ease for failure to pay the docketing fee); <em>Bair v.

Hemelgarn et al., </em>No. 5:12-cv-02922-JRA (N.D.Ohio Feb. 7, 2013) (Holding that plaintiffs complaint \u201cdoes not contain allegations which are intelligible to this court. The complaint is therefore appropriately subject to summary dismissal.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Bair v.

In the letter, plaintiff claims that defendant \u201cput members of my family and others in a specific Mansion in <em>Sunnydale, </em>SC. Know to the Superior Justice Committee as \u2018The Executive Manor of Infernal Hell Hodge.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). Plaintiff further claims that in \u201cThe Executive Man- or\u201d is a \u201cfalse floor sudden trap door\u201d that \u201cdrops its victims thirty feet down into a infected maze of necrotic type high speed contagious disease and undead creatures including demon dogs.\u201d As a result, plaintiff claims, \u201c[m]y family and others like it have been rearranged, separated, demolished, and forced into despair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In the April 10, 2014 letter, plaintiff also claims that he had \u201cbeen desolately abused and forced into cardiac arrest many times by your colleges,\u201d and that he had been the target of \u201chundreds devised plots of \u2018hire to kill\u2019 by means of reference type literature .... \u201d Plaintiff further claims that \u201c[tjhere has been many assaults and many crimes made against me inside the banking system as well.\u201d These and other alleged assaults, including an invasion of plaintiffs privacy, were alleged to have been committed using \u201csatellites with radiance type sophisticated weaponry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Plaintiff also alleges that President Obama had \u201ceven used my name improperly. By referring to me, in times of dire importance by the name Chris Bliss, Chris Bliso, Chris Bease, or Beasty.\u201d Plaintiff claims that he had \u201calso been totally demised; barbarously, fiendishly, and deliberately completely neglected and lied to\u201d about \u201cThe Executive Manor.\u201d Plaintiff further alleges in his April 10, 2014 letter that the President and his administration had \u201calso made crimes against me by keeping the knowledge of these crimes a secret from the Public and I.\u201d In his April 10, 2014 letter, plaintiff requests the President pay him $2.5 billion \u201cin the respect of your total involvement in this ominous quandary,\u201d but in a subsequent paragraph, immediately offers a settlement of $60,000,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Also included as part of plaintiffs initial filing is an April 28, 2014 letter plaintiff addressed to the United States Office of the Attorney General, although plaintiff addressed the letter \u201cTo the Public Office of the Attorney General.\u201d In the April 28, 2014 letter, plaintiff revokes \u201cthe offer of settlement\u201d and informs the Attorney General that \u201cI shall continue to seek Lawful Justice for his own Presidential and criminal actions.\u201d Plaintiff also claims the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_yN\">President\u2019s own self-involvement in the death of a child that was frozen solid inside the false mansion. Where in which an impostor who poses as my Father has froze the child with an Arcille type nitrogestie-rayl freeze blaster. And then the President stood idle-by when someone shattered the unfortunate child to pieces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A97h\">Plaintiff then calls for the President\u2019s \u201cresignation from all duties.\u201d Plaintiff concludes the April 28, 2014 letter by invoking \u201cmy right to the Act of Dyslexia of 1984. Of that, the Opportunity Knowledge Acts: Four, Six, and Thirteen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Moreover, as part of plaintiffs initial filing, he submits four letters addressed to the United States Court of Federal Claims, two dated May 21, 2014 and two dated May 23, 2014, one of which requests \u201cyour Honor give matter of this atrocity the full brightness of your shining light.\u201d In one May 21, 2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>letter, plaintiff claims that \u201c[t]his travesty has grown to an unfathomable proportion. To the extent of almost complete annihilation of my whole blood-line.\u201d In addition to the cardiac arrests plaintiff references in his April 10, 2014 letter to President Obama, plaintiff claims that the President \u201cleft me barietea, barzaude, and even proeuplia.\u201d Plaintiff further claims that \u201cBarack Obama has committed a number of brutal acts against myself and even most possibly against a young boy____\u201d Plaintiff claims that the child\u2019s blood \u201cwas completely collected by members of the United States Secret Service and including White House agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In addition, included with plaintiffs letter filings are incomplete and unsigned \u201cUnited States District Court\u201d documents with the following headings: \u201cSUBPOENA TO APPEAR AND TESTIFY AT A HEARING OR TRIAL IN A CIVIL ACTION,\u201d \u201cSUMMONS IN A CIVIL ACTION,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATORY SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT,\u201d and \u201cSEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT ON ORAL TESTIMONY.\u201d (emphasis and capitalization in original). Also included in plaintiffs initial filing are two copies of a document titled: \u201cTo be added to submitted for with Claim to case,\u201d listing items of which it appears plaintiff would like the court to take note. Some of these items include: \u201cRequest of Federal Special Victims Legal Guarantee: Federalolice,\u201d \u201cA statement to for a Requim for Personance,\u201d and \u201cThe Official terms of Derituviea.\u201d Additionally, although plaintiff appears to have paid the court\u2019s filing fee, he submitted an unsworn affidavit stating his \u201cTotal annual yearly income: $17,-160.000.\u201d Plaintiff also asserted that he owns $83,385.00 worth of various stock and property, and \u201c25,056,089.000\u201d Mexican pesos worth of stock in an American-Mexican company.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">On June 9, 2014, the court received two additional letters from plaintiff. One letter, dated June 6, 2014, was addressed to the undersigned, while the other letter, dated June 7, 2014, was addressed to the Clerk of the Court. Neither document was signed, in violation of RCFC 11(a). Moreover, neither letter contained proof of service on the defendants, in violation of RCFC 5.3. The letters were filed, with the court\u2019s leave, only to complete the record. Both the letters contain many incomprehensible words, as well as spelling and grammatical errors, including the misspelling of the Clerk of the Court\u2019s name. Neither letter states a specific claim or provides any support for plaintiffs previous filings. For example, in the June 6, 2014 letter addressed to the undersigned, plaintiff writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">These squars I choose in Ebresquose. I do in retrospect of the rilesicls anoutenti by the Reiso-suitor known as \u2018Larken\u2019. To be in as the forthwith typesos: (D), (G), (I), (Z). This is so to be with a Declaration of Answaraklia. A rightouse and deliberate honor that is begiven to people in assistance to the transacelumation of adversary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">In the June 7, 2014 letter addressed to the Clerk of the Court, plaintiff writes: \u201cIt is by me at this time that I make malstueva adoviekiea to the Declaration of utriehi to that of the third type, without mastuvince allowed. With beareance to the light of the Court\u2019s berklintiea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">On June 11, 2014, the court received two more letters from the plaintiff, both dated June 9, 2014, and both, once again, replete with spelling and grammatical errors, including the misspelling of the undersigned\u2019s name and the Clerk of the Court\u2019s name. In one letter, addressed to the undersigned, plaintiff states: \u201cI have chosen the Court of Federal Claims in respect due to me where upon my stiroea to be in doubts of such accordance.\u201d In the other June 9, 2014 letter, this one addressed to the \u201cClerk of Courts,\u201d plaintiff appears to be seeking a correction to a letter he previously submitted to the court, asking the Clerk of the Court to amend the spelling of \u201cumritchi\u201d to \u201cumritichi.\u201d Neither letter was submitted in accordance with the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims. These letters were also filed, with the court\u2019s leave, only to complete the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">When determining whether a complaint filed by a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff is sufficient to invoke review by a court, <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs are entitled to liberal construction of their plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ings. <em>See Haines v.

United States, </em>100 Fed.Cl. 317, 328 (2011) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Scogin v. United States, </em>33 Fed.Cl. 285, 293 (1995) (quoting <em>Clark v. Nat\u2019l Travelers Life Ins.

United States, </em>75 Fed.Cl. 249, 253 (2007). \u201cWhile a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff is held to a less stringent standard than that of a plaintiff represented by an attorney, the <em>pro se </em>plaintiff, nevertheless, bears the burden of establishing the Court\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Riles v. United States, </em>93 Fed.Cl. 163, 165 (2010) (citing <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. at 9, 101 S.Ct. 173 and <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>303 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed.Cir.) (\u201cPlaintiff bears the burden of showing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g and reh\u2019g en banc denied </em>(Fed.Cir.2002)); <em>see also Harris v. United States, </em>113 Fed.Cl. 290, 292 (2013) (\u201cAlthough plaintiffs pleadings are held to a less stringent standard, such leniency \u2018with respect to mere formalities does not relieve the burden to meet jurisdictional requirements.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Minehan v. United States, </em>75 Fed.Cl. at 253)).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">None of the documents filed by plaintiff are in the form of a proper complaint or are even vaguely in compliance with the court\u2019s rules, and should not have been filed as a complaint by the Clerk\u2019s Office in the first place. Nevertheless, because these filings were accepted by the Clerk\u2019s Office as a complaint, the court addresses the allegations. The court also recognizes that <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs should be afforded liberal construction of their pleadings. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. at 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594. Even given this more liberal approach, plaintiffs letters and other submissions are totally deficient as filings in this court. Moreover, plaintiffs filings fail to establish any cause of action in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">It is well established that \u201c \u2018subject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves a court\u2019s power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arbauqh v.

Plaintiff does not cite to any identifiable United States statute for the $2.5 billion in damages he seeks. Likewise, plaintiff does not allege any express or implied contract with the United States, nor does he seek a refund from prior payment made to the government. <em>See United States v.

Although the court has reviewed the <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs submission liberally, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]here is no duty on the part of the trial court to create a claim which [the plaintiff] has not spelled out in his [or her] pleading.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Lengen v.
