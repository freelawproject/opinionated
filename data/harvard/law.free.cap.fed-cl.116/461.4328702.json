As initially filed, the caption of the complaint stated: \u201cIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,\u201d and bore two different case numbers, neither of which is of the case number type assigned by this court: \u201c13-1509\u201d and 1:13-CV-00170-TWP-DKL\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-17\">Moreover, the initial complaint named \u201cJ. EVERETT LIGHT CAREER CENTER\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Along with his complaint, plaintiff filed an Application to Proceed <em>In Forma Pauperis. </em>In his Application to Proceed <em>In Forma Pauperis, </em>Mr. Coleman states that he is currently unemployed, has had no source of income for the past twelve months, and has not received any gifts, inheritances, pensions, annuities, life insurance, rents, interest or dividends in the past twelve months. He also claims he does not own real estate, stock, or bonds, has no cash, and has no money in checking, savings, or any other accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-18\">Subsequently, the Clerk\u2019s Office received a submission from plaintiff, titled \u201cNotification.\u201d The Clerk\u2019s Office did not file plaintiffs submission because it was proeedurally defective, and was not submitted in accordance with RCFC 5.3, 5.5(c)(5), and 5.5(d)(2). After it was returned to the plaintiff, plaintiff submitted another filing to the Clerk\u2019s Office, entitled \u201cPleadings.\u201d Although that filing, again, was proeedurally defective, it was filed by leave of the undersigned. In his \u201cPleadings\u201d submission, plaintiff correctly identifies this court as the United States Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Federal Claims and properly names the United States as the defendant. As discussed more fully below, considering plaintiffs <em>pro se </em>status, and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor, the court will treat plaintiffs \u201cPleadings\u201d submission as an amended complaint, as it correctly identifies the United States as the defendant, and this court as the court in which plaintiffs complaint is filed. In his confused filing, plaintiff alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">1. I Karey Coleman am pleading Tanya Pratt<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> made a ruling on my claim that was ruled fraudulently by the statements Tanya Pratt made l:13-cv-00718MHB [sic] IC 35^4-2-1<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">2. Tanya Pratt held a ruling on a supplemental complaint against J.

Todd Delay was the basis of the claims towards J.

Tanya Pratt were the statements made under oath if so isn\u2019t that a federal crime not justice evidently if the stamens [sic] are known to be false</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">5.

Defendant also asserts that \u201c[e]ven if the Court were to possess jurisdiction over Mr. Coleman\u2019s complaint,\u201d plaintiffs complaint is barred by res judicata. Moreover, the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ernment alleges that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and should be dismissed pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6) because to the extent plaintiffs complaint \u201cdoes state any claim at all, it appears to attempt to state a claim against a Federal judge for dismissing plaintiffs previous complaint,\u201d filed in the Southern District of Indiana. Defendant states that \u201cit appears that Mr. Coleman\u2019s complaint in this Court is really a result of dissatisfaction\u201d with United States District Court Judge Tanya Walton Pratt\u2019s decision dismissing plaintiffs previous \u201ccivil rights\u201d complaint for failure to state a claim. Mr. Coleman appealed Judge Pratt\u2019s decision to the Seventh Circuit but his appeal was dismissed for failure to pay the docketing fee. <em>See Coleman v. J. Everett Light Career Ctr., </em>No. 13-1509. To date, plaintiff has not responded to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, although plaintiff has been allotted more time than provided under the court\u2019s Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">When determining whether a complaint filed by a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff is sufficient to invoke review by a court, <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs are entitled to liberal construction of their pleadings. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (requiring that allegations contained in a <em>pro se </em>complaint be held to \u201cless stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>405 U.S. 948, 92 S.Ct. 963, 30 L.Ed.2d 819 (1972); <em>see also Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007); <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 9-10, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980); <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>429 U.S. 1066, 97 S.Ct. 798, 50 L.Ed.2d 785 (1977); <em>Matthews v. United States, </em>No. 2013-5109, 750 F.3d 1320, 1321, 2014 WL 1758664, at *1 (Fed.Cir. May 5, 2014); <em>Diamond v. United States, </em>115 Fed.Cl. 516, 524 (2014). \u201cHowever, \u2018 \u201c[t]here is no duty on the part of the trial court to create a claim which [the plaintiff] has not spelled out in his [or her] pleading.\u2019 \u201d \u201d <em>Lengen v. United States, </em>100 Fed.Cl. 317, 328 (2011) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Scogin v. United States, </em>33 Fed.Cl. 285, 293 (1995) (quoting <em>Clark v. Nat\u2019l Travelers Life Ins. Co., </em>518 F.2d 1167, 1169 (6th Cir.1975))); <em>see also Bussie v. United States, </em>96 Fed.Cl. 89, 94, <em>aff'd, </em>443 Fed.Appx. 542 (Fed.Cir.2011); <em>Minehan v. United States, </em>75 Fed.Cl. 249, 253 (2007). \u201cWhile a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff is held to a less stringent standard than that of a plaintiff represented by an attorney, the <em>pro se </em>plaintiff, nevertheless, bears the burden of establishing the Court\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Riles v. United States, </em>93 Fed.Cl. 163, 165 (2010) (citing <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. at 9, 101 S.Ct. 173 and <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>303 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed.Cir.) (\u201cPlaintiff bears the burden of showing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g and reh\u2019g en banc denied </em>(Fed.Cir.2002)); <em>see also Harris v. United States, </em>113 Fed.Cl. 290, 292 (2013) (\u201cAlthough plaintiffs pleadings are held to a less stringent standard, such leniency \u2018with respect to mere formalities does not relieve the burden to meet jurisdictional requirements.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Minehan v. United States, </em>75 Fed.Cl. at 253)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">In order to provide access to this court to those who cannot pay the filing fees mandated by RCFC 77.1(c) (2013), the statute at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 (2012) permits a court to allow plaintiffs to file a complaint without payment of fees or security, under specific circumstances. Plaintiff, Karey Coleman, filed an Application to Proceed <em>In Forma Pauperis. </em>The standard in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1) for <em>in forma pauperis </em>eligibility is \u201cunable to pay such fees or give security therefor.\u201d Determination of what constitutes \u201cunable to pay\u201d or unable to \u201cgive security therefor,\u201d and, therefore, whether to allow a plaintiff to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is left to the discretion of the presiding judge, based on the information submitted by the plaintiff or plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g., Rowland v. Cal. Men\u2019s Colony, Unit II Men\u2019s Advisory Council, </em>506 U.S. 194, 217-18, 113 S.Ct. 716, 121 L.Ed.2d 656 (1993); <em>Fuentes v. United States, </em>100 Fed.Cl. 85, 92 (2011). In <em>Fiebelkorn v. United States, </em>the United States Court of Federal Claims indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">[T]he threshold for a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is not high: The statute requires that the applicant be \u201cunable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>pay such fees.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1). To be \u201cunable to pay such fees\u201d means that paying such fees would constitute a serious hardship on the plaintiff, not that such payment would render plaintiff destitute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><em>Fiebelkorn v. United States, </em>77 Fed.Cl. 59, 62 (2007); <em>see also Hayes v. United States, </em>71 Fed.Cl. 366, 369 (2006). Although Mr. Coleman\u2019s lack of income and absence of savings could qualify him for <em>in forma pauperis </em>status, his complaint is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Moreover, plaintiff has violated the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, by filing at least three complaints in federal courts which were dismissed for failure to state a claim. See <em>Coleman v. J. Everett Light Career Ctr., </em>No. l:13-cv-170-TWP-DKL; <em>Coleman v. Bureau of Ind. Educ., </em>No. l:12-cv-1005JMS-MJD (S.D.Ind. Nov. 2, 2012);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Coleman v. Ind. Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, </em>No. 1:12\u2014cv-1238-SEB-DML (S.D.Ind. Sept. 6, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The statute at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), titled the Prison Litigation Reform Act, denies <em>in forma pauperis </em>status to repetitive complainants, and also was enacted to discourage frivolous lawsuits. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">In no event shall a prisoner<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section [titled \u201cProceedings in forma pauperis\u201d] if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior oecasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see also McLean v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 391, 394 (4th Cir. 2009); <em>Pettus v. Morgenthau, </em>554 F.3d 293, 296 (2d Cir.2009); <em>Warren v. United States, </em>106 Fed.Cl. 507, 509-10 (2012); <em>Dudley v. United States, </em>61 Fed.Cl. 685, 686 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">As noted above, plaintiff has filed numerous previous lawsuits in federal courts, three of which were dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See, e.g., Coleman v. J. Everett Light Career Ctr., </em>No. 1:13-cv-170-TWP-DKL (Dismissing the case because \u201cno plausible claim has been stated.\u201d); <em>Coleman v. Bureau of Ind. Educ., </em>No. 1:12-cv-1005-JMS-MJD (\u201cDespite repeated efforts and directions as to applicable guidelines for pleadings, Coleman remains unable to assert a plausible claim against the defendant.\u201d); <em>Coleman v. Ind. Civil Rights Comm\u2019n., </em>No. 1:12-cv-1238-SEB-DML (Holding that plaintiffs \u201ccomplaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d). Therefore, Mr. Coleman is subject to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule and his Application to Proceed <em>In Forma </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>Pauperis </em>must be denied. Plaintiff is barred from filing further <em>in forma pauperis </em>petitions in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Moreover, on the merits, Mr. Coleman\u2019s complaint is insufficient to establish a cause of action in this court. It is well established that \u2018\u201csubject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves a court\u2019s power to hear a ease, can never be forfeited or waived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arbaugh v.Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)). \u201c[F]ederal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.\u201d <em>Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. Shinseki, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 1202, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011); <em>see also Hertz Corp. v.

The case number 1:13-CV-00718 refers the proceedings in this court, and should read l:13-cv00718-MBH, not to the proceedings before \"Tanya Pratt\u201d in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The reference to \"IC 35-44-2-1,\u201d appears to be a reference to the former Indiana Code Provision for \"Perjury.\u201d The statute stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">(a) A person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">(1) makes a false, material statement under oath or affirmation, knowing the statement to be false or not believing it to be true; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">(2) has knowingly made two (2) or more material statements, in a proceeding before a court or grand jury, which are inconsistent to the degree that one (1) of them is necessarily false; commits perjury, a Class D felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-13\">(b) In a prosecution under subsection (a)(2) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-20\">(1) the indictment or information need not specify which statement is actually false; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-21\">(2) the falsity of a statement may be established sufficient for conviction, by proof that the defendant made irreconcilably contradictory statements which are material to the point in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-22\">The statute was repealed, effective July 1, 2012, and replaced with Indiana Code 35-44.1-2-1 (2012), which contains substantially similar language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b476-23\">.

Plaintiff also filed two appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which were dismissed for failure to pay the docketing fee. <em>See Coleman v. J.

A number of courts have reviewed the words of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1), regarding <em>in forma pauperis </em>applications by non-prisoner litigants in federal courts, and have concluded that Congress did not intend for non-prisoners to be barred from being able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in federal court. <em>See, e.g., Floyd v. United States Postal Serv., </em>105 F.3d 274, 275-76 (6th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied </em>(6th Cir. 1997); <em>Schagene v. United States, </em>37 Fed.Cl. 661, 663 (1997) (finding that it was not the intent of Congress to eliminate the <em>in forma pauperis </em>right of access to federal courts of eligible, indigent, non-prisoners), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>152 F.3d 947 (Fed.Cir.1998); <em>see also In re Prison Litigation Reform Act, </em>105 F.3d 1131, 1134 (6th Cir. 1997) (discussing how to administer <em>in forma pauperis </em>rights to a non-prisoner, thereby acknowledging the rights of non-prisoners to apply for <em>in forma pauperis </em>status); <em>Leonard v. Lacy, </em>88 F.3d 181, 183 (2d Cir.1996) (using \"sic\u201d following the word \"prisoner\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1) seemingly to indicate that the use of that word was too narrow); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>113 Fed.Cl. 241, 243 (2013); <em>Powell v. Hoover, </em>956 F.Supp. 564, 566 (M.D.Pa.1997) (holding that a \"fair reading of the entire section [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1)] is that it is not limited to prisoner suits\u201d). Moreover, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1) refers to both \"person\u201d and \"prisoner.\u201d The word \"person\u201d is used three times in the subsection, while the word \"prisoner\u201d is used only once. This court, therefore, finds that the single use of the word \"prisoner\u201d in the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1) was not intended to eliminate a non-prisoner from proceeding in federal court <em>in forma pauperis, </em>provided that the civil litigant can demonstrate appropriate need. Any other interpretation is inconsistent with the statutory scheme of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
