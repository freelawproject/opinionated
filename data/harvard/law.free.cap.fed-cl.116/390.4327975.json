That motion has been fully briefed and is ripe for decision. Oral argument was neither requested by the parties nor deemed necessary by the court. For the following reasons, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">In this lawsuit, Plaintiff Carmine J. Pucciariello<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeks damages, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief, based upon the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) decision to terminate plaintiffs appointment as a designated airworthiness representative (DAR). Plaintiff alleges that the FAA, in terminating plaintiffs appointment, breached a settlement agreement pursuant to which the FAA had promised to appoint plaintiff as a DAR. In addition, plaintiff alleges that the FAA\u2019s termination decision resulted in an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">1. Designated Airworthiness Representatives</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">Congress has charged the FAA with the responsibility to prescribe air safety standards, including certification requirements for aircraft, pilots, airports, and airlines, in order to \u201cpromote safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44701(a) (2006). To that end, Congress has authorized the FAA to \u201cdelegate to a qualified private person\u201d the authority to issue certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>cates identifying aircraft as airworthy, and to conduct inspections, testing, and examinations necessary to issue such certificates. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702(d)(1) (2006). Pursuant to its statutory authority, the FAA Administrator has appointed a group of private individuals, called designated airworthiness representatives (DARs), to perform these tasks. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 183.33 (2013). DAR appointments are for one to three years, and are renewable at the discretion of the Administrator. <em>See FAA </em>Order 8100.8D, \u00b6 1414 (Oct. 28, 2011), <em>available at </em>http://www.faa.gov/regulations_ policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/ document.information/documentID/1019601.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702, the FAA Administrator may rescind, or choose not to renew, a DAR appointment \u201cat any time for any reason the Administrator considers appropriate.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702(d)(2). The FAA in its implementing regulations, has delineated certain \u201cappropriate\u201d reasons justifying termination or nonrenewal of a DAR appointment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">(1) Upon the written request of the representative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">(2) Upon the written request of the employer in any case in which the recommendation of the employer is required for the designation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">(3) Upon the representative being separated from the employment of the employer who recommended him or her for certification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">(4) Upon a finding by the Administrator that the representative has not properly performed his or her duties under the designation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">(5) Upon the assistance of the representative being no longer needed by the Administrator; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">(6) For any reason the Administrator considers appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">14 C.F.R. \u00a7 183.15(b) (2013); <em>see also FAA </em>Order 8100.8D, \u00b6 1105(b) (stating that \u201c[d]esignation is a privilege that conveys responsibilities, but does not imply employment or other rights unrelated to FAA needs,\u201d and incorporating the bases for termination of a DAR appointment as set forth in 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 183.15(b)), \u00b6 1108(a) (stating that \u201c[a] designation is a privilege, not a right,\u201d and \u201ctherefore[] the Administrator has the authority to terminate a delegation for any reason\u201d), \u00b6 1414 (stating that \u201crenewal of any designee appointment is at the option and sole discretion of the FAA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">The FAA, however, has developed internal procedures to guide the nonrenewal or termination of DAR appointments. <em>See </em>FAA Order 8100.8D, \u00b6\u00b6 1100-1110, 1414-1415. Of particular relevance to this dispute, FAA Order 8100.8D sets forth the procedures for administrative appeals of decisions to terminate a DAR appointment, and provides that a DAR, upon timely appeal, may request a meeting with the appeal panel and the FAA. inspector or project engineer who made the recommendation to terminate the DAR appointment. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 1108(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">II. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b408-17\">In December 1998, Mr. Pucciariello entered into a settlement agreement with the FAA to resolve a discrimination complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b6 7 &amp; Attach. A at 1-3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the agreement, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Pueeiariello agreed to retire from employment with the FAA on or before February 28,1999, in exchange for the FAA appointing him as a DAE. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 7 &amp; Attach. A at 1-2. In addition, the agreement stated that it \u201cin no manner denies [Mr. Pueeiariello] the right of renewal of [his] DAR [appointment] provided he otherwise satisfies all regulatory requirements in place or hereafter added to said regulatory requirements, and is otherwise qualified to be the holder of a DAR.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Attach. A at 2-8. In accordance with the agreement, Mr. Pueeiariello retired on or before February 28, 1999, and the FAA appointed him as a DAR. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 8 &amp; Attach. A at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Several years later, on January 25, 2012, the FAA terminated Mr. Pueciariello\u2019s DAR appointment after finding that he had not properly performed his duties as a DAR. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6 15 &amp; Attach. B at 1 (January 25, 2012 letter stating that Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s DAR appointment was \u201cterminated pursuant to 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 183.15(b)(4)\u201d based upon the FAA\u2019s determination that Mr. Pueeiariello had failed to adequately perform his duties as a DAR). The events leading to the FAA\u2019s termination of plaintiffs DAR appointment began on January 8, 2012, when Mr. Puceiariello contacted the South Florida Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) by e-mail with questions relating to the airworthiness certification of a helicopter scheduled to be exported to Brazil. <em>Id. </em>Attach. B at 1. As a result of additional e-mail correspondence with Mr. Pueeiariello over the next two days, officials at the South Florida FSDO became concerned about Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s competence to handle his DAR functions. <em>Id. </em>On January 10, 2012, Mr. Pueeiariello was instructed to cease all export certification activity until a meeting could be held to assess his capabilities and to determine if remedial training was necessary. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 14 &amp; Attach. B. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The meeting between FAA personnel and Mr. Pueeiariello took place on January 18, 2012. Compl. Attach. B at 1. According to FAA records, Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s responses to various queries of FAA personnel during the meeting revealed that plaintiff lacked the requisite knowledge to properly perform his DAR functions. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. Specifically, FAA personnel found the documentation provided by plaintiff to be out-of-date or otherwise not in compliance with FAA regulatory guidance. <em>Id. </em>at 1. In addition, although Mr. Pueeiariello represented during the meeting that he had inspected the helicopter when it was fully assembled, as required by FAA regulations, further investigation by FAA personnel revealed that the helicopter was, in fact, disassembled when Mr. Puceiariello performed his inspection. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Based on these events, on January 25, 2012, Sergio Lopez, manager of the South Florida FSDO, advised Mr. Pueeiariello by letter that his DAR appointment had been terminated. Compl. \u00b6 15 &amp; Attach. B at 1-2. Mr. Lopez\u2019s letter set forth the bases for termination and also advised Mr. Pueeiariello of his administrative appeal rights. <em>Id. </em>Attach. B at 2 (advising Mr. Pueeiariello that he \u201cmay submit a request for appeal in writing to this office no later than 14 calendar-days from the date of receipt of this letter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">III. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Mr. Pueeiariello submitted a timely administrative appeal on February 6,2012. Compl. \u00b6 16. Thereafter, the FAA Southern Region Office convened an appeal panel to review plaintiffs termination. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 17 &amp; Attach. B at 3. Upon reviewing the reasons for termination provided by the South Florida FSDO, as well as Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s appeal submission, the appeal panel upheld the decision to terminate plaintiffs DAR appointment. <em>Id. </em>By letter dated March 29, 2012, Thomas A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Winston, division manager for the FAA Southern Region Office, notified Mr. Pueciariello of the appeal panel\u2019s \u201cfinal decision\u201d to uphold the termination of his DAR appointment. <em>Id. </em>Attach. B at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Nearly five months later, on August 27, 2012, plaintiff filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging violations of due process arising out of his DAR termination. <em>Pucciariello v. LaHood, </em>No. 12-61675 (S.D.Fla); <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. App. at A18. The government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 (2006), the United States courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to review the FAA\u2019s termination of Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment. The district court agreed, holding that Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s due process claims in that forum amounted to a \u201cchalleng[e] [of] the FAA\u2019s final decision to terminate his DAR status,\u201d over which the United States courts of appeals possessed exclusive jurisdiction. Def.\u2019s Mot. App. at A18-A19 (citing <em>Doe v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>432 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2005)). Accordingly, by order dated April 8, 2013, the district court dismissed Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction without leave to amend. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the district court dismissed Mr. Pueciariello\u2019s complaint \u201cby default\u201d and \u201con the merits\u201d because Mr. Pucciariello never responded to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at A18.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">On August 19, 2013, Mr. Pucciariello filed a complaint in this court, seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief based upon the FAA\u2019s decision to terminate his DAR appointment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff characterizes his current challenge to the FAA\u2019s termination decision as \u201can action for 5th Amendment taking of property without just compensation, and without complying with procedural due process and written procedural rules and regulations designed to protect the Plaintiff.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 1. Additionally, plaintiff asserts that his current claims \u201care based on [the] Government\u2019s breach of an explicit written settlement agreement where Plaintiff agreed to retire and the FAA agreed to assign him as an FAA Designated Airworthiness Representative (DAR).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Plaintiffs complaint contains two counts. In the first count, plaintiff alleges that the FAA breached the terms of the December 1998 settlement agreement by terminating Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment \u201cwithout due process or cause,\u201d and in an \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201ccapricious\u201d manner. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. In the second count, which plaintiff styles as a claim for \u201cunjust taking without due process,\u201d plaintiff alleges that he possesses a property interest in his DAR appointment by virtue of the settlement agreement, and that the FAA deprived him of that property interest without adhering to the agency\u2019s internal procedures for appeals from termination decisions. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-18. Specifically, plaintiff asserts that the agency failed to honor Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s request for a meeting with the FAA appeal panel, as provided for by FAA Order 8100.8D, \u00b6 1108(b)(2). <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">As compensation for the FAA\u2019s alleged wrongdoing, plaintiff requests damages for lost past and future earnings, as well as damages for \u201closs of earning capacity\u2019 and \u201closs of reputation in the aviation industry.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 19; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 20-21. In addition to monetary damages, plaintiff requests \u201cdeclaratory relief concluding that the United States Government removed him as a DAR in violation of its written agreement and in violation of Plaintiffs procedural due process rights,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b62, as well as \u201c[injunctive relief enjoining the FAA from denying Plaintiff his right to a meeting to appeal [the] termination of his [DAR] designation,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b622.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">On November 18, 2013, the government filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) and RCFC 12(b)(6). Defendant\u2019s motion presents four jurisdictional arguments. First, the government contends that plaintiffs claims amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>to a challenge to his DAR termination, and that the United States courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to review such challenges pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 9-10; Def.\u2019s Reply at 8. Second, defendant argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s breach of contract claim because plaintiff fails to identify a provision of the settlement agreement that mandates the payment of money in the event of the government\u2019s breach. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 13-14 (citing, <em>e.g., Holmes v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1303, 1314-15 (Fed.Cir.2011)). Third, defendant argues that plaintiff has failed to establish jurisdiction over his breach of contract claim because the complaint does not identify the substantive provisions of the settlement agreement upon which Mr. Pueeiariello relies, as required by RCFC 9(k). <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 14 (citing <em>Kissi v. United States, </em>102 Fed.Cl. 31, 35 (2011), and <em>Gonzalez-McCaulley Inv. Grp., Inc. v. United States, </em>93 Fed. Cl. 710, 715 (2010)). Finally, defendant argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs claims for equitable relief because such claims are not tied to a money judgment. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 14-16 (citing, <em>e.g., James v. Caldera, </em>159 F.3d 573, 580 (Fed.Cir.1998)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The government also seeks dismissal of plaintiffs complaint pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6). With respect to plaintiffs breach of contract claim, defendant argues that plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts from which the court may reasonably infer that the FAA breached the settlement agreement by terminating Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 16-17; Def.\u2019s Reply at 4-6. With regard to plaintiffs takings claim, the government contends, first, that plaintiff has failed to allege facts plausibly suggesting that Mr. Pueeiariello has a cognizable property interest in his DAR appointment that could be the subject of a valid takings claim under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 18-19; Def.\u2019s Reply at 6. In addition, defendant argues that, even if the court were to conclude that plaintiff sufficiently pleaded a cognizable property interest in his DAR appointment, plaintiffs takings claim should nevertheless be dismissed because it is premised upon allegedly unlawful governmental action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19-20; Def.\u2019s Reply at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ach\">I. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"APl\">A. RCFC 12(b)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The relevant issue in a motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(1) \u201c \u2018is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u2019\u201d <em>Patton v. United States, </em>64 Fed.Cl. 768, 773 (2005) (quoting <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). In considering the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, this court must presume all undisputed factual allegations to be true and construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Scheuer, </em>416 U.S. at 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683; <em>Reynolds v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>846 F.2d 746, 747 (Fed.Cir.1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Where the court\u2019s jurisdiction is challenged, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence and by presenting competent proof. <em>Alder Terrace, Inc. v. United States, </em>161 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir.1998) (citing <em>McNutt v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp. of Ind., </em>298 U.S. 178, 189, 56 S.Ct. 780, 80 L.Ed. 1135 (1936)); <em>Reynolds, </em>846 F.2d at 748 (citations omitted). If the plaintiff fails to meet his burden, and jurisdiction is therefore found to be lacking, the court must dismiss the action. RCFC 12(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In considering a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction which challenges the truth of jurisdictional facts alleged in the complaint, the court may make findings of fact pertinent to its jurisdiction. <em>Ferreiro v. United States, </em>350 F.3d 1318, 1324 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citing <em>Moyer v. United States, </em>190 F.3d 1314, 1318 (Fed.Cir.1999), and <em>Reynolds, </em>846 F.2d at 747); <em>Rocovich v. United States, </em>933 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed.Cir.1991) (\u201cIn determining whether a motion to dismiss should be granted, the Claims Court may find it necessary to inquire into jurisdictional facts that are disputed.\u201d). In making findings of fact pertinent to its jurisdiction, the court is not restricted to the face of the pleadings, but may review evidence extrinsic to the pleadings, including declarations or affidavits. <em>Rocovich, </em>933 F.2d at 994 (citing <em>Land v. Dollar, </em>330 U.S. 731, 735 n. 4, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 91 L.Ed. 1209 (1947), and <em>Reynolds, </em>846 F.2d at 747).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">B. RCFC 12(b)(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">It is well-settled that a complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim under RCFC 12(b)(6) \u201cwhen the facts asserted by the claimant do not entitle him to a legal remedy.\u201d <em>Lindsay v. United States, </em>295 F.3d 1252,1257 (Fed.Cir.2002). To survive a motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6), \u201ca complaint must allege facts \u2018plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)\u2019 a showing of entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Kam-Almaz v. United States, </em>682 F.3d 1364, 1367 (Fed.Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). In order to meet the requirement of facial plausibility, the plaintiff must plead \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is a \u201ccontexLspecific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">When considering a motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6), the court is bound to accept the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint as true. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. However, the court is not bound to accept as true mere \u201c\u2018labels and conclusions\u2019\u201d or \u201c\u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>(quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Although the court primarily examines the allegations in the complaint when considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6), it may also consider \u201c \u2018matters incorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, [and] matters of public record.\u2019\u201d <em>A &amp; D Auto Sales, Inc. v.

Those documents, which are incorporated by reference into the complaint and are integral to plaintiff\u2019s claims, may properly be considered by the court without converting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. <em>E.g., Toon, </em>96 Fed.Cl. at 298-99. Likewise, the court may consider public court documents filed in Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s district court action, including Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s complaint and the district court\u2019s order dismissing that lawsuit. <em>E.g., DeKalb, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">A. The Court Lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Pursuant to the Tucker Act, the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction \u201cto render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (2012). The Tucker Act, however, \u201cdoes not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages\u201d but \u201cmerely confers jurisdiction ... whenever the substantive right exists.\u201d <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976) (citation omitted). A plaintiff coming before this court, therefore, must identify a separate provision of law conferring a substantive right for money damages against the United States. <em>Id.; see also Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 216, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983), and <em>Testan, </em>424 U.S. at 398, 96 S.Ct. 948); <em>Todd v. United States, </em>386 F.3d 1091, 1094 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citing <em>Testan, </em>424 U.S. at 398, 96 S.Ct. 948). In other words, the source underlying the cause of action must be money-mandating, in that it \u201c \u2018can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained as a result of the breach of the duties [it] impose[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1173 (Fed. Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. at 217, 103 S.Ct. 2961).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">To establish Tucker Act jurisdiction, a plaintiff need only make a \u201cnonfrivolous allegation that it is within the class of plaintiffs entitled to recover under the money-mandating source\u201d identified in the complaint. <em>Jan\u2019s Helicopter Serv., Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>525 F.3d 1299, 1309 (Fed.Cir.2008). \u201cThere is no further jurisdictional requirement that the court determine whether the additional allegations of the complaint state a nonfrivolous claim on the merits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">Here, the alleged money-mandating sources of law identified by Mr. Pueciariello are; (1) the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and (2) his settlement agreement with the FAA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>9-11; PL\u2019s Resp. at 9-12. As set forth below, the court concludes that although both sources can fairly be interpreted as mandating the payment of money, and therefore would normally be sufficient to establish Tucker Act jurisdiction, neither source provides a basis for Tucker Act jurisdiction in this case because a separate statutory provision\u201449 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110\u2014bars this court from exercising jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">1. Plaintiff\u2019s Fifth Amendment Takings Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The first money-mandating source of law alleged by plaintiff is the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \u201cIt is undisputed that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment is a money-mandating source for purposes of Tucker Act jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Jan\u2019s Helicopter, </em>525 F.3d at 1309 (citing <em>Moden v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed.Cir.2005)). Because plaintiff, having alleged a taking of his property by the government, is within the class of plaintiffs entitled to recovery if a Fifth Amendment takings claim is established, the court would normally have Tucker Act jurisdiction over plaintiffs takings claim. <em>See id.; </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1,11-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">2. Plaintiffs Breach of Settlement Agreement Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The second alleged money-mandating source of law identified in plaintiffs complaint is his settlement agreement, which plaintiff alleges was breached by the FAA when the agency terminated his DAR appointment. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 6, 9-10. As set forth below, the court concludes that the settlement agreement can fairly be interpreted as mandating the payment of money, and thus would normally be sufficient to confer Tucker Act jurisdiction over plaintiffs breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The term \u201ccontract,\u201d for purposes of the Tucker Act\u2019s grant of jurisdiction over claims based \u201cupon any express or implied contract with the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), includes settlement agreements, <em>see, e.g., Lutz v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>485 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2007); <em>Greco v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed.Cir.1988) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that a settlement agreement is a contract.\u201d). When the substantive source of law identified as the basis for Tucker Act jurisdiction is an express or implied contract with the United States, the money-mandating requirement for Tucker Act jurisdiction ordinarily is satisfied. <em>See Bank of Guam v. United States, </em>578 F.3d 1318, 1325 (Fed.Cir.2009) (\u201cA well pleaded allegation of a breach of either an express or implied-in-fact contract is sufficient to overcome challenges to jurisdiction.\u201d (citing <em>Trauma Serv. Grp. v. United States, </em>104 F.3d 1321, 1325 (Fed.Cir.1997))). That is because monetary damages \u201care always the default remedy for breach of contract.\u201d <em>United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 885, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996) (citations omitted); <em>see Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1314 (noting that \u201c \u2018[i]n the area of government contracts, as with private agreements, there is a presumption in the civil context that a damages remedy will be available upon the breach of an agreement\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>252 F.3d 1329, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2001))). As a general matter, therefore, a suit seeking money damages for the alleged breach of a settlement agreement with the government falls within this court\u2019s jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">Despite this general pronouncement, however, it is well-settled that \u201c[t]he government\u2019s consent to suit under the Tucker Act does not extend to every contract.\u201d <em>Rick\u2019s Mushroom Serv., Inc. v. United States, </em>521 F.3d 1338, 1343 (Fed.Cir.2008) (citations omitted). This court would not, for example, have Tucker Act jurisdiction over a claim alleging the breach of a settlement agreement that expressly provides that damages are not an available remedy for its breach. <em>See Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1314 (noting that \u201c[a] contract expressly disavowing money damages would not give rise to Tucker Act jurisdiction\u201d). Nor would Tucker Act jurisdiction extend to a claim for breach of an agreement providing for \u201cpurely nonmonetary relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>In <em>Holmes, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit resolved a split of authority in this court over whether Tucker Act jurisdiction extends to a claim alleging breach of an agreement to settle an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(2012). The majority view at the time was that the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction over such claims because Title VII established an integrated and comprehensive scheme providing for exclusive review of Title VII actions in district courts. <em>See Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1311 (citing cases). Rejecting that view, the Federal Circuit in <em>Holmes </em>held that a suit against the government alleging breach of a settlement agreement is fundamentally a suit to enforce a contract and therefore within the reach of this court\u2019s Tucker Act jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">At the same time, however, the Federal Circuit in <em>Holmes </em>cautioned that the alleged breach of a settlement agreement does not necessarily give rise to Tucker Act jurisdiction. 657 F.3d at 1315. Due to the particular nature of Title VII settlement agreements, which the Federal Circuit noted \u201ccould involve purely nonmonetary relief\u2014 for example, a transfer from one agency office to another,\u201d the court held that any plaintiff seeking damages under such an agreement must establish that the agreement could \u201cfairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages in the event of breach.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Applying that standard to the Title VII settlement agreements at issue in <em>Holmes, </em>the Federal Circuit concluded that the plaintiff in <em>Holmes </em>had demonstrated that the agreements in that ease could fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages in the event of breach, and the Federal Circuit therefore reversed this court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 1315-16. The plaintiff in <em>Holmes </em>alleged that the Department of the Navy (Navy) had breached two agreements settling Title VII employment actions. Under the terms of the settlement agreements, the Navy agreed to expunge a suspension letter from Mr. Holmes\u2019 personnel file and to document that he had resigned for personal reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 1315. The Navy also agreed to provide Mr. Holmes with a \u201cneutral reference\u201d in response to inquiries from future employers. <em>Id. </em>at 1316. Based on those terms, which the Federal Circuit found to \u201cinherently relate to monetary compensation through relationship to ... future employment,\u201d the court held that the settlement agreements in <em>Holmes </em>could fairly be interpreted as mandating the payment of money in the event of the government\u2019s breach. <em>Id. </em>The court also noted that \u201cthere is no language in the agreements indicating that the parties did not intend for money damages to be available in the event of breach.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In <em>Cunningham v. United States, </em>748 F.3d 1172 (Fed.Cir.2014), the Federal Circuit, in a precedential opinion, expanded the jurisdictional holding of <em>Holmes </em>to a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d claim for breach of an agreement settling the plaintiffs discrimination claim arising under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of Title 5 of the United States Code). <em>See </em>748 F.3d at 1177-78. The settlement agreement at issue in <em>Cunningham, </em>similar to the agreement in <em>Holmes, </em>limited what information the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) could disclose regarding the circumstances of Mr. Cunningham\u2019s departure from employment with OPM. <em>Id. </em>The agreement also required OPM to remove Mr. Cunningham\u2019s termination letter from his personnel file. <em>Id. </em>Based on those similarities to the settlement agreements in <em>Holmes, </em>the Federal Circuit held that the agreement in <em>Cunningham </em>\u201c \u2018could fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages in the event of a breach\u2019\u201d because the agreement inherently related to monetary compensation through relationship to Mr. Cunningham\u2019s future employment. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1315).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Citing <em>Holmes, </em>the government in the present case contends that plaintiff has failed to establish Tucker Act jurisdiction over his breach of contract claim because he has not identified any provision in the settlement agreement that mandates the payment of money in the event of the government\u2019s breach. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 12-14 (citing, <em>e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1314-15); Def.\u2019s Reply at 1-3. Plaintiff, also relying upon <em>Holmes, </em>responds by noting that money damages are presumptively available as a remedy for breach of a government contract and, in any event, the settlement agreement at issue can fairly be interpreted as mandating the payment of money because it provided for Mr. Pueciariello\u2019s DAR appointment and therefore contemplated monetary compensation. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 11 (\u201cAt least some term of employment was contemplated when the parties drafted the agreement; accordingly some future compensation was contemplated by the parties at the time of di\u2019afting.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The court agrees with plaintiff that Mr. Pueciariello\u2019s EEOC settlement agreement, like the settlement agreements in <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Cunningham, </em>can fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages under the standards established by the Federal Circuit in those cases. Under plaintiffs agreement, the FAA agreed to appoint Mr. Pueciariello as a DAR. Compl. Attach. A at 1-2. Athough, as noted, DAR appointments are terminable at the discretion of the FAA Administrator, <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702(d)(2); 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 183.15(b); FAA Order 8100.8D, \u00b6\u00b6 1105(b), 1108(a), 1414, plaintiff is correct that at least \u201csome future compensation was contemplated by the parties at the time of drafting\u201d of the agreement, <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 11. Athough DARs are not federal employees, they are paid for their services by applicants for airworthiness certificates, who may elect to use DARs to inspect their aircraft at their own cost or choose instead to allow FAA personnel to inspect their aircraft in accordance with existing FAA practice. <em>See, e.g., Charlima, Inc. v. United States, </em>873 F.2d 1078, 1081 (8th Cir.1989) (citing Designated Airworthiness Representatives Final Rule, 48 Fed.Reg. 16176, 16179 (Apr. 14, 1983)). Accordingly, a breach of Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s settlement agreement with the FAA could give rise to a claim for compensation because the agreement, like those in <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Cunningham, </em>contemplates at least some monetary compensation through relationship to Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s future service as a DAR. <em>See Cunningham, </em>748 F.3d at 1177-78; <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1316. Additionally, like the agreements in <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Cunningham, </em>Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s settlement agreement does not contain language indicating that monetary damages are not available. <em>See Cunningham, </em>748 F.3d at 1177-78; <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The government\u2019s attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Cunningham </em>are unavailing. Defendant argues that plaintiffs settlement agreement is unlike the agreement in <em>Holmes </em>because it \u201cdid not provide a guarantee of a perpetual DAR appointment,\u201d nor did it specifically require the payment of any wages to Mr. Pueciariello. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 13; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 2-3 (asserting that \u201cthe settlement agreement did not guarantee any amount of wages\u201d). Yet neither did the settlement agreements in <em>Holmes </em>or <em>Cunningham. </em>The Federal Circuit found the agreements in <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Cunningham </em>to inherently relate to future compensation not because the agreements guaranteed any future term of employment or mandated the payment of wages, but because the agreements placed restrictions on the personnel information available to Mr. Holmes\u2019 and Mr. Cunningham\u2019s prospective employers, thereby positively affecting Mr. Holmes\u2019 and Mr. Cunningham\u2019s future employment prospects. <em>See Cunningham, </em>748 F.3d at 1177-78; <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1316. The purpose of such an agreement was not to guarantee future employment or compensation, but \u201c \u2018to prevent [the plaintiff] from being denied future employment based on his record as the [agency] maintained it prior to the agreement ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>748 F.3d at 1177 (quoting <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1316).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Defendant also contends that plaintiffs EEOC settlement agreement cannot fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages because the standard remedy for breach of a settlement agreement resolving an employment dispute is enforcement of the settlement terms or rescission of the settlement agreement and reinstatement of the underlying action. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 13-14; Def.\u2019s Reply at 1-2. As support for this argument, the government cites the EEOC regulation at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.504 (2013), which provides that a complainant alleging breach of an EEOC settlement agreement \u201cmay request that the terms of [the] settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>agreement be specifically implemented or, alternatively, that the complaint be reinstated for further processing.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.504(a); <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 13. However, as the Federal Circuit specifically found in <em>Holmes, </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.504(a) does not deprive the Court of Federal Claims of subject matter jurisdiction over suits seeking damages for an alleged breach of an EEOC settlement agreement. <em>See Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1316 (\u201cWithout diminishing the force of this regulation, we see no reason for \u00a7 1614.504(a) to preclude a suit for money damages in the event of breach that is separate from, or in addition to, the relief the regulation provides.\u201d). In subsequent cases, this court has adhered to the Federal Circuit\u2019s view. <em>See, e.g., Mata v. United States, </em>107 Fed.Cl. 618, 623 (2012) (holding that a negotiated settlement agreement, which contained language nearly identical to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.504(a), could fairly be interpreted as mandating the payment of money under the standard announced in <em>Holmes </em>because the agreement \u201cdoes not contain any language limiting the remedies available to Mr. Mata\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Defendant also relies, unpersuasively, on dicta in a single footnote in the <em>Holmes </em>decision in which the Federal Circuit noted that \u201cmoney damages appear not to be the routine remedy for the breach of a settlement agreement involving an employment dispute.\u201d 657 F.3d at 1315 n. 8 (citing <em>Harris v. Brownlee, </em>477 F.3d 1043, 1047 (8th Cir.2007)); <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 13-14. The government asserts that this footnote \u201ceffectively rebuts\u201d the presumption that a damages remedy will be available upon the breach of a government settlement agreement. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 2. Defendant\u2019s strained interpretation of this single footnote runs headlong into the holding of <em>Holmes. </em>Contrary to the government\u2019s reading of <em>Holmes, </em>the Federal Circuit\u2019s acknowledgement that monetary damages are not the standard remedy for breach of a settlement agreement resolving an employment dispute is not dispositive of the issue at bar. Accordingly, the court concludes that Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s settlement agreement with the FAA can fairly be interpreted as requiring the payment of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">3. Preemption of Tucker Act Jurisdiction by 49 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00a7 46110</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Unfortunately for plaintiff, although his breach of contract and takings claims would otherwise be within this court\u2019s Tucker Act jurisdiction, a separate statutory provision bars jurisdiction. Specifically, defendant asserts that pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, \u201c[t]he United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, or for the circuit in which Mr. Pucciariello resides, possess[es] exclusive jurisdiction to review Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s DAR termination and any related constitutional claims.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 9; <em>see also id. </em>at 10; Def.\u2019s Reply at 8. The government contends that the FAA\u2019s decision to terminate Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s DAR appointment was an order subject to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, and that plaintiffs sole avenue of relief from that order was to file a petition for review in a federal court of appeals. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 9-10; Def.\u2019s Reply at 8. For the following reasons, the court agrees with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">a person disclosing a substantial interest in an order issued by ... the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration with respect to aviation duties and powers designated to be carried out by the Administrator[ ] in whole or in part under [Title 49, Subtitle VII, Parts A or B of the United States Code] may apply for review of the order by filing a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the person resides or has its principal place of business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(a). Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, any petition for review of an administrative order subject to that section \u201cmust be filed not later than 60 days after the order is issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When such a petition is filed with a federal court of appeals, the court receiving the petition \u201chas exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, amend, modify, or set aside any part of the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 46110(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">The court\u2019s analysis of the jurisdictional impact of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 begins with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>determination of whether the FAA\u2019s termination of Mr. Pueciariello\u2019s DAR appointment falls within the ambit of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110. If the answer to that initial query is \u201cyes,\u201d then the court must determine whether plaintiff may nevertheless bring his claims before this court notwithstanding the applicability of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110.</p>\n<p id=\"AS1\">a. The FAA\u2019s Termination of Plaintiffs DAR Appointment Is an Order Subject to the Exclusive Review Mechanism Set Forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110</p>\n<p id=\"AXC\">By its terms, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 applies if the FAA\u2019s termination of Mr. Pueciariello\u2019s DAR appointment constitutes an \u201corder issued by ... the [FAA] Administrator ... with respect to aviation duties and powers designated to be carried out by the Administrator[ ] in whole or in part under [Title 49, Subtitle VII, Parts A or B of the United States Code].\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(a).

Consequently, if the FAA\u2019s termination decision is an \u201corder\u201d within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, then the federal courts of appeals would have exclusive jurisdiction to review that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Although the court has not identified any reported decisions of the United States Supreme Court or the Federal Circuit applying 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> numerous decisions of other federal courts of appeals have interpreted and applied 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as well as its predecessor, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In the absence of applicable binding authority, the decisions of other courts of appeals are helpful aids to this court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The term \u201corder,\u201d for purposes of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, has been given \u201c \u2018expansive construction\u2019 \u201d by the United States courts of appeals. <em>Ligon v.

However, to be reviewable pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, an agency order must be final, and the agency record must be adequate to enable judicial review. <em>See, e.g., Ligon, </em>614 F.3d at 154 (citing <em>Atorie Air, </em>942 F.2d at 960).

The court agrees. The March 29, 2012 letter announced that the FAA appeal panel had \u201cdetermined [that] the facts ... supported] the managing office\u2019s decision to terminate [Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s] authority to act as a representative of the Administrator.\u201d Compl. Attach. B at 3. That letter clearly denied a right and fixed a legal relationship between Mr. Pucciariello and the FAA by terminating his ability to issue airworthiness certificates and to conduct inspections, testing, and examinations necessary to issue such certificates. Therefore, the FAA\u2019s March 29, 2012 \u201cfinal decision\u201d possesses the requisite finality to be an \u201corder\u201d within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Furthermore, although the entire extent of the administrative record is unknown, it is evident from the complaint and the parties\u2019 briefs that the record contains not only the settlement agreement itself, which sets forth the basis for Mr. Pueeiariello\u2019s DAR appointment, but also correspondence from the FAA to Mr. Pucciariello explaining the process by which the agency decided to terminate Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s DAR appointment as well as the agency\u2019s asserted bases for termination. <em>See </em>Compl. Attaehs. A-B; Def.\u2019s Mot. at 1^4. In his complaint, plaintiff challenges both the merits of the FAA\u2019s termination decision as well as the procedures used by the agency in arriving at that decision. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 (alleging that the FAA\u2019s termination decision was \u201cwithout due process or cause\u201d and was \u201carbitrary, capricious and otherwise in violation of the law\u201d). The record herein, which sets forth the reasons supporting the FAA\u2019s termination decision and describes the procedures afforded to Mr. Pucciariello, is sufficient to allow a reviewing court to make an informed decision on plaintiffs claims. <em>See Green, </em>981 F.2d at 519 (holding that an administrative record consisting of documents describing the FAA\u2019s investigation of alleged misconduct by plaintiff, a former designated pilot examiner, as well as related correspondence between plaintiff and FAA personnel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201cwould allow a reviewing court to make an informed decision of the procedure afforded and the reasons supporting\u201d the FAA\u2019s revocation of plaintiffs certificate of authority); <em>see also Gilmore, </em>435 F.3d at 1133 (noting that \u201c[a]n adequate record [under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110] ... may consist of \u2018little more\u2019 than a letter\u201d (quoting <em>San Diego Air Sports Ctr., Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>887 F.2d 966, 969 (9th Cir.1989))).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The court therefore concludes that the FAA\u2019s March 29, 2012 \u201cfinal decision\u201d to uphold the termination of Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment was an order subject to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110. Accordingly, pursuant to the plain terms of that statute, the United States courts of appeals have jurisdiction over any review of the FAA\u2019s termination decision, and any petition for review of that decision had to have been filed within sixty days of March 29, 2012. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">b. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 Provides a Specific and Comprehensive Scheme of Judicial Review that Preempts Tucker Act Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Mr. Pucciariello never filed a petition for review of the FAA\u2019s order with a United States court of appeals. Instead, he chose to file suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging that the FAA\u2019s termination of his DAR appointment violated his due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Pucciariello v. LaHood, </em>No. 12-61675 (S.D. Fla filed Aug. 27, 2012). Then, after his claims in that forum were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 as well as on the merits by default, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. App. at A18-A19, Mr. Pucciariello filed suit in this court, alleging that the FAA\u2019s termination of his DAR appointment breached his December 1998 settlement agreement and effected an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The question that remains is whether Mr. Pucciariello may bring his claims in this court pursuant to the Tucker Act, thereby circumventing the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States courts of appeals under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110. For the following reasons, the court concludes that he may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">It is fundamental that all federal courts, except the Supreme Court, are creatures of statute established by Congress, and therefore possess only the jurisdiction granted to them by Congress. <em>In re United States, </em>877 F.2d 1568, 1571 (Fed.Cir.1989) (citing U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 1). Congress, acting within its constitutional powers, may freely choose the court in which judicial review of administrative orders may occur. <em>See City of Tacoma v. Taxpayers of Tacoma, </em>357 U.S. 320, 336, 78 S.Ct. 1209, 2 L.Ed.2d 1345 (1958) (\u201cIt can hardly be doubted that Congress, acting within its constitutional powers, may prescribe the procedures and conditions under which, and the courts in which, judicial review of administrative orders may be had.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">As a court established by Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution, the Court of Federal Claims \u201cenjoys only so much judicial power as Congress expressly permits.\u201d <em>Cent. Ark. Maint., Inc. v. United States, </em>68 F.3d 1338, 1341 (Fed.Cir.1995) (citations omitted). Although Congress, via the Tucker Act, has granted broad authority to this court to adjudicate \u201cany claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in eases not sounding in tort,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), Congress may withdraw any grant of Tucker Act jurisdiction, <em>see Tex. Peanut Farmers v. United States, </em>409 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citing, <em>e.g., Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., </em>467 U.S. 986, 1016-17, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 81 L.Ed.2d 815 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">The Federal Circuit has consistently found preemption of Tucker Act jurisdiction where Congress has enacted a precisely drawn, comprehensive, and detailed scheme of review in another forum. <em>See, e.g., Texas Peanut Farmers, </em>409 F.3d at 1373 (finding preemption of Tucker Act jurisdiction over claims for breach of a crop insurance contract, where Congress granted the district courts exclusive jurisdiction over claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>against the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation); <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>405 F.3d 1002, 1009 (Fed.Cir.2005) (holding that Congress, by enacting the Medicare Act, withdrew Tucker Act jurisdiction over claims for Medicare benefits); <em>Folden v. United States, </em>379 F.3d 1344, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2004) (affirming dismissal of implied-in-fact contract claims and constitutional claims by applicants for cellular licenses because Congress, in the Communications Act, reserved judicial review of Federal Communications Commission licensing decisions exclusively in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit); <em>Vereda, Ltda. v. United States, </em>271 F.3d 1367, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2001) (holding that Tucker Act jurisdiction over plaintiffs takings claim was preempted by the \u201cspecific and comprehensive scheme for administrative and judicial review\u201d enacted by Congress in the Controlled Substance Act) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Massie v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 1184, 1188 (Fed.Cir.1999) (\u201c[A] contract will not fall within the purview of the Tucker Act if Congress has placed jurisdiction over it elsewhere.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The court concludes that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 provides such a specific and comprehensive scheme with respect to judicial review of FAA orders. In reaching that conclusion, the court has no reason to look beyond the plain text of the 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, in which Congress clearly expressed its intention that the federal courts of appeals would have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to affirm, amend, modify, or set aside any part of\u2019 an FAA order. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(e). Applying this clear language, several federal courts of appeals have held that the judicial review scheme set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 (and its predecessor, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486(a)) is exclusive. <em>See, e.g., Blitz, </em>700 F.3d at 740 (concluding that, by enacting 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, \u201cCongress clearly expressed its intention that any legal challenge to a \u00a7 46110 order ... be brought in the first instance in a court of appeals\u201d); <em>Americopters, </em>441 F.3d at 732 (noting that the federal courts of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction to review FAA orders pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 is \u201cexclusive\u201d); <em>Clark v. Busey, </em>959 F.2d 808, 811 (9th Cir.1992) (concluding that pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486, \u201cthe court of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction is exclusive with regard to review of final FAA actions\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Suburban O\u2019Hare Commission, </em>787 F.2d at 192 (same) (citations omitted). The court finds the reasoning of these decisions to be persuasive, and concludes that the specific and exclusive jurisdictional authority granted to the federal courts of appeals in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 controls and takes precedence over the general and nonexclusive jurisdictional authority afforded by the Tucker Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">c. Plaintiffs Claims Are Inescapably Intertwined with a Challenge to the FAA\u2019s Termination of Plaintiffs DAE Appointment</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The court\u2019s analysis does not end here, however, because plaintiffs complaint does not seek to \u201camend, modify, or set aside any part of\u2019 the FAA\u2019s termination order, <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(c), but rather seeks monetary damages based upon the FAA\u2019s alleged breach of a settlement agreement and alleged uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2014claims over which this court would normally possess Tucker Act jurisdiction. <em>See Americopters, </em>441 F.3d at 736 (noting that \u201c[i]n principle, a district court may decide a claim for damages because \u00a7 46110 does not grant the court of appeals jurisdiction over this form of relief\u2019 (citing <em>Mace v. Skinner, </em>34 F.3d 854, 858 (9th Cir.1994))). The question remains, therefore, whether 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 precludes this court\u2019s jurisdiction over plaintiffs Tucker Act claims for monetary damages. For the following reasons, the court concludes that Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s monetary claims are, in essence, challenges to the FAA\u2019s termination of his DAR appointment, and therefore are subject to the exclusive jurisdictional scheme set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Several United States courts of appeals, including the Federal Circuit, have recognized that statutes such as 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 that vest judicial review of administrative orders exclusively in the courts of appeals also extend to monetary claims that are \u201cinescapably intertwined\u201d with review of such orders. <em>See, e.g., Pines Residential </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Treatment Ctr. v.

Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 614, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984))); <em>Doe, </em>432 F.3d at 1263 (holding that aircraft mechanics\u2019 due process claims challenging the FAA\u2019s planned reexamination of plaintiffs\u2019 airmen competency \u201cnecessarily require a review of the procedures and actions taken by the FAA with regard to the mechanics\u2019 certificates\u201d and therefore fell within the exclusive scheme of judicial review set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44709 (citing <em>Green, </em>981 F.2d at 520)); <em>Merritt v. Shuttle, Inc., </em>187 F.3d 263, 271 (2d Cir.1999) (holding that a commercial airline pilot\u2019s due process claims based upon the FAA\u2019s suspension of plaintiffs flight privileges were \u201cinescapably intertwined\u201d with review of the FAA\u2019s suspension order and were therefore subject to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110); <em>Jones, </em>625 F.3d at 829-30 (holding that plaintiffs retaliation claims challenging the FAA\u2019s denial of plaintiffs application for an appointment as a designated engineering representative were \u201cinescapably intertwined with a challenge to the procedure and merits of that final order\u201d and therefore were impermissible collateral attacks barred by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110) (citations omitted). As recognized by the Ninth Circuit, the purpose of this \u201cinescapably intertwined\u201d doctrine is \u201cto prevent litigants from using a damages claim as a collateral attack on a pending FAA order and to allow courts to identify and dismiss damages claims that are actually thinly disguised attempts] at an end-run around the jurisdictional limitation imposed by [49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110].\u201d <em>Americopters, </em>441 F.3d at 736 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The court\u2019s review of the complaint and the parties\u2019 briefs confirms that Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s claims are inescapably intertwined with a challenge to the procedure and merits surrounding the FAA\u2019s order terminating his DAR appointment. As noted, the complaint alleges a number of procedural improprieties with the FAA\u2019s decision to terminate Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 4-5, 9, 12, 17-18. It also challenges the merits of the FAA\u2019s termination by alleging that the agency\u2019s decision was without \u201ccause\u201d and was \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201ccapricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b618 (asserting that \u201c[t]he FAA\u2019s alleged reasons for the termination of Plaintiffs DAR are without merit\u201d). Therefore, a consideration of plaintiffs claims would necessarily require a review of the procedures used and actions taken by the FAA with regard to the agency\u2019s termination of Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment, and would also require a review and balancing of the same evidence used by the agency to support its decision in that regard. The exclusive scheme of judicial review of FAA orders set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 bars such a collateral attack, and plaintiffs attempt to repackage what are essentially challenges to an FAA order into breach of contract and Fifth Amendment takings claims must fail. <em>See, e.g., Pines Residential Treatment Center, </em>444 F.3d at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Accordingly, the court concludes that it lacks jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs breach of contract claim and his Fifth Amendment takings claim because those claims are subject to the exclusive jurisdictional scheme set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110. Both claims must therefore be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>4. No Jurisdiction to Award Plaintiffs Requested Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Defendant next argues that the court lacks jurisdiction to award the injunctive and declaratory relief requested by plaintiff. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 14-16. The court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The Court of Federal Claims may award equitable relief in only very limited, statutorily defined, circumstances. <em>See United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians of Okla. v. United States, </em>480 F.3d 1318, 1326 n. 5 (Fed.Cir.2007) (citation omitted); <em>Kanemoto v. Reno, </em>41 F.3d 641, 644-45 (Fed.Cir.1994) (\u201cThe remedies available in [the Court of Federal Claims] extend only to those affording monetary relief; the court cannot entertain claims for injunctive relief or specific performance, except in narrowly defined, statutorily provided circumstances .... \u201d). One such circumstance, and the only one that is potentially relevant to this ease, is when the requested equitable relief is \u201ctied and subordinate to a money judgment.\u201d <em>James, </em>159 F.3d at 580 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2) (allowing equitable relief that is \u201can incident of and collateral to\u201d a money judgment in order to \u201cprovide an entire remedy and to complete the relief afforded by the judgment\u201d). In that circumstance, the court may \u201cissue orders directing restoration to office or position, placement in appropriate duty or retirement status, and correction of applicable records.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The government contends that equitable relief is \u201cthe primary goal of [plaintiffs] lawsuit,\u201d and therefore by definition cannot be tied and subordinate to any award of monetary damages. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 16 (citing, <em>e.g., Thorndike v. United States, </em>72 Fed.Cl. 580, 583 (2006), and <em>Rice v. United States, </em>31 Fed.Cl. 156, 164 (1994)). Although the court finds this assertion to be unfounded inasmuch as plaintiffs complaint clearly and repeatedly requests monetary damages in the form of lost past and future earnings, \u201closs of earning capacity,\u201d and \u201closs of reputation in the aviation industry,\u201d <em>see </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 19-21, the court nevertheless concludes that it lacks authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2) to provide the equitable relief requested by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">First, as noted <em>supra, </em>plaintiffs requested injunction would \u201cenjoin[ ] the FAA from denying Plaintiff his right to a meeting to appeal [the] termination of his [DAR] designation.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 22. This injunction would not be merely incidental to an award of lost earnings, \u201closs of earning capacity,\u201d and \u201closs of reputation in the aviation industry,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00b619, but rather would be separate from, and in addition to, such requested damages.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, even if plaintiffs requested injunction were merely incidental to the damages requested in his complaint, it does not fall within the narrow group of orders specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2) because it does not \u201cdirect[] restoration to office or position, placement in appropriate duty or retirement status, [or] correction of applicable records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">Furthermore, and most fundamentally, because the court concludes that it lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs monetary claims, <em>see supra, </em>and that plaintiff has failed in any event to state a claim for damages, <em>see infra, </em>the court has no basis upon which to exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims for injunctive or declaratory relief. <em>See, e.g., Legal Aid Soc\u2019y of New York v. United States, </em>92 Fed.Cl. 285, 301 (2010) (holding that jurisdiction was lacking with respect to plaintiffs equitable claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2) because plaintiff failed to state a claim for money damages); <em>Flowers v. United States, </em>80 Fed.Cl. 201, 217, 223 (2008) (holding that \u201cplaintiff does not have a claim for presently due money damages,\u201d and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs claims for equitable relief), <em>aff'd, </em>321 Fed.Appx. 928 (Fed.Cir.2008). Thus, the court cannot consider plaintiffs claims for injunctive or declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">B. Plaintiff Has Failed to State a Claim upon which Relief Can Be Granted</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The court has dismissed all of plaintiffs claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Nevertheless, in the interests of judicial economy, the court considers, in the alternative, defendant\u2019s RCFC 12(b)(6) arguments. Specifically, the government argues that even if the court were to assume jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims, his claims must nevertheless be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court agrees, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">1. Plaintiff Has Failed to State a Claim for Breach of the Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The government argues that plaintiff has failed to allege facts that, if true, would allow the court to reasonably infer that the FAA breached plaintiffs settlement agreement. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 16-17; Def.\u2019s Reply at 4-6. In that regard, defendant notes that under the settlement agreement which plaintiff attached to his complaint, Mr. Pucciariello agreed to retire from employment with the FAA on or before February 28, 1999 and the FAA agreed to appoint him as a DAR. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 16 (citing Compl. \u00b6 7 &amp; Attach. A at 1-2). Defendant asserts that, accepting as true the allegations of the complaint, both parties fulfilled their respective obligations under the settlement agreement when Mr. Pucciariello retired on or before February 28, 1999 and the FAA appointed him as a DAR. <em>See id. </em>at 16-17 (citing Compl. \u00b6 8 &amp; Attach. A at 4). In addition, defendant asserts that the settlement agreement \u201cdid not provide a guarantee of a perpetual DAR appointment,\u201d and therefore plaintiff has failed to make a plausible demonstration that the FAA\u2019s termination of Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment resulted in a breach of the agreement. <em>See id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">In response, plaintiff asserts that the FAA, in terminating his DAR appointment, breached the provision of the settlement agreement stating that the agreement \u201cin no manner denies [Mr. Pucciariello] the right of renewal of [his] DAR [appointment] provided he otherwise satisfies all regulatory requirements in place or hereafter added to said regulatory requirements, and is otherwise qualified to be the holder of a DAR.\u201d Compl. Attach. A at 2-3; <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 12. Plaintiff interprets this provision of the agreement as imposing a \u201cfor-cause\u201d limitation on the FAA\u2019s ability to terminate or refuse to renew Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s DAR appointment. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 12 (stating that the agreement \u201cclearly states that the FAA had to renew Plaintiff's DAR upon Plaintiffs request \u2018provided he otherwise satisfies all ... regulatory requirements in place\u2019 and was otherwise qualified to hold a DAR appointment\u201d (quoting Compl. Attach. A at 2-3)). In plaintiffs view, the FAA\u2019s termination of Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment breached the agreement because Mr. Pucciariello \u201chad at all times satisfied the applicable regulatory requirements and was otherwise qualified to hold the DAR.\u201d <em>See id. </em>In addition, plaintiff asserts that the FAA \u201cbreached the settlement agreement by failing to give Plaintiff an adequate hearing at which he could refute the basis for his DAR non-renewal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">In order to state a claim for breach of the settlement agreement, Mr. Pucciariello must allege facts plausibly suggesting: (1) a valid contract between the parties; (2) an obligation or duty arising out of the contract; (3) a breach of that duty; and (4) damages caused by the breach. <em>San Carlos Irrigation &amp; Drainage Dist. v. United States, </em>877 F.2d 957, 959 (Fed.Cir.1989). Interpretation of the settlement agreement, as with any contract, begins with the agree-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>merit\u2019s plain language. <em>See, e.g., Coast Fed. Bank v. United States, </em>323 F.3d 1035, 1038 (Fed.Cir.2003) (en banc); <em>United Int\u2019l Investigative Servs. v. United States, </em>109 F.3d 734, 737 (Fed.Cir.1997). In addition, the agreement should be interpreted as a whole and in a manner which gives \u201c \u2018reasonable meaning to all its parts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Northrop Grumman Corp. v. Goldin, </em>136 F.3d 1479, 1483 (Fed.Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Gould, Inc. v. United States, </em>935 F.2d 1271, 1274 (Fed.Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">For three reasons, the court concludes that plaintiff has failed to state a claim for breach of the settlement agreement. First, as a preliminary matter, the court does not agree with plaintiffs interpretation of the settlement agreement as guaranteeing the continuation of Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment absent a showing of \u201ccause\u201d for termination or nonrenewal. As noted <em>supra, </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702 and the regulatory scheme promulgated thereunder vest plenary discretion in the FAA Administrator to terminate, or choose not to renew, DAR appointments. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702(d)(2) (providing that the FAA Administrator \u201cmay rescind a delegation under this subsection\u201d\u2014including a DAR appointment\u2014\u201cat any time for any reason the Administrator considers appropriate\u201d); 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 183.15(b) (FAA\u2019s implementing regulations setting forth the bases for termination or nonrenewal of DAR appointments, including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[f]or any reason the Administrator considers appropriate\u201d); FAA Order 8100.8D, \u00b6 1105(b) (stating that \u201c[designation is a privilege that conveys responsibilities, but does not imply employment or other rights unrelated to FAA needs,\u201d and incorporating the bases for termination of a DAR appointment as set forth in 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 183.15(b)), \u00b6 1108(a) (stating that \u201c[a] designation is a privilege, not a right,\u201d and \u201ctherefore[] the Administrator has the authority to terminate a delegation for any reason\u201d), \u00b6 1414 (stating that \u201crenewal of any designee appointment is at the option and sole discretion of the FAA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The provision of the settlement agreement upon which plaintiff relies cannot be read as divesting the FAA Administrator of his statutorily-conferred discretion to decide whether to terminate or not renew Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment. That provision stated that the settlement agreement \u201cin no manner denies [Mr. Pueciariello] the right of renewal of [his] DAR [appointment] provided he otherwise satisfies all regulatory requirements in place or hereafter added to said regulatory requirements, and is otherwise qualified to be the holder of a DAR.\u201d Compl. Attach. A at 2-3. Far from imposing a \u201cfor-cause\u201d limitation on the FAA\u2019s discretion to terminate or not renew Mr. Pueeiariello\u2019s DAR appointment, this provision simply alluded to two of the non-exclusive bases for termination or nonrenewal of DAR appointments set forth in the FAA\u2019s implementing regulations\u2014namely, \u201c[u]pon a finding by the Administrator that the representative has not properly performed his or her duties under the designation,\u201d or \u201c[f]or any reason the Administrator considers appropriate.\u201d <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 183.15(b)(4), (6). To interpret this provision as guaranteeing Mr. Pueciariello a perpetual DAR appointment subject only to a finding of \u201ccause\u201d for termination would be unreasonable, particularly where, as here, such an interpretation would contradict the clear congressional grant of discretion with respect to the termination or nonrenewal of DAR appointments. <em>See Capital Props., Inc. v. United States, </em>56 Fed.Cl. 427, 434 (2003) (\u201cThe rule that contract terms will be given their ordinary meaning is particularly applicable where the contract language is easily construed in harmony with the pertinent statute.\u201d (citing, <em>e.g., Am. Science &amp; Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. United States, </em>663 F.2d 82, 88 (Ct.Cl.1981))), <em>aff'd, </em>89 Fed.Appx. 262 (Fed.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Second, even if the settlement agreement could reasonably be interpreted as imposing a \u201cfor-cause\u201d limitation on the FAA\u2019s ability to terminate or not renew Mr. Pueciariello\u2019s DAR appointment, plaintiff has failed to allege facts plausibly suggesting that the FAA lacked cause to terminate that appointment. As the government correctly notes, plaintiff attached to his complaint Mr. Lopez\u2019s January 25, 2012 letter. <em>See </em>Compl. Attach. B at 1-2. That letter, which is incorporated by reference into the complaint and may be considered without converting defendant\u2019s RCFC 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>a motion for summary judgment, <em>see Toon, </em>96 Fed.Cl. at 298-99, set forth the agency\u2019s justification for terminating Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment. The agency\u2019s bases for termination included its determination that Mr. Pucciariello had demonstrated during a meeting with FAA personnel on January 18, 2012 that he lacked understanding of FAA regulations and regulatory guidance pertaining to the inspection and testing of civilian aircraft, which resulted in his failure to properly discharge his DAR duties relating to the export of a helicopter to Brazil. <em>See </em>Compl. Attach. B at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Plaintiff alleges no facts from which the court can reasonably infer that the FAA\u2019s stated reasons for terminating Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment, as set forth in Mr. Lopez\u2019s January 25, 2012 letter, were incorrect or pretextual. Although plaintiff alleges, in paragraph 18 of his complaint, that \u201c[t]he FAA\u2019s alleged reasons for the termination of Plaintiffs DAR are without merit,\u201d that allegation is no more than a \u201clabel\u201d or \u201cconclusion\u201d that is not entitled to the presumption of truth afforded to well-pleaded factual allegations. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (citation omitted). The same is true of plaintiffs bald and unsupported assertion, in his response brief, that he had \u201cat all times satisfied the applicable regulatory requirements and was otherwise qualified to hold the DAR.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Finally, with respect to plaintiffs argument that the FAA \u201cbreached the settlement agreement by failing to give Plaintiff an adequate hearing at which he could refute the basis for his DAR non-renewal,\u201d <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 12, plaintiff has not identified any provision of the agreement requiring the FAA to utilize certain procedures in terminating Mr. Puceiariello\u2019s DAR appointment, nor did plaintiff allege the existence of any such provision in his complaint. Mr. Pueeiariello has therefore failed to allege facts plausibly suggesting any contractual obligation on the part of the FAA to afford Mr. Puceiariello the particular procedural protections he alleges were due him.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted with respect to his claim for breach of the settlement agreement. That claim must therefore be dismissed pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6), even if the court were to assume jurisdiction over the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">2. Plaintiff Has Failed to State a Claim for a Fifth Amendment Taking</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The government also contends that Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s takings claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. In that regard, defendant first argues that plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts from which the court may reasonably infer that Mr. Pucciariello has a cognizable property interest in his DAR appointment that could be the subject of a valid takings claim under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 18-19; Def.\u2019s Reply at 6. In addition, defendant argues that, even if the court were to conclude that plaintiff sufficiently pleaded a cognizable property interest in his DAR appointment, plaintiffs takings claim should nevertheless be dismissed because it is premised upon allegedly unlawful governmental action. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19-20; Def.\u2019s Reply at 6. The court agrees, as set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The court evaluates whether plaintiff has stated a Fifth Amendment takings claim under a two-part test. First, the court must determine whether plaintiff has established a property interest for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. <em>E.g., Acceptance Ins. Cos. v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 849, 854 (Fed.Cir.2009). As to this first question, \u2018\u201cexisting rules and understandings\u2019 and \u2018background principles\u2019 derived from an independent source, such as state, federal, or common law, define the dimensions of the requisite property rights for purposes of establishing a cognizable taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 857 (quoting <em>Conti v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 1334, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2002)). Because the existence of a cognizable property interest is a threshold requirement for a valid takings claim, \u201c[i]f the claimant fails to demonstrate the existence of a legally cognizable property interest, the eourt[\u2019]s task is at an end.\u201d <em>Am. Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United States, </em>379 F.3d 1363, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citation omitted). Only if the court concludes that a cognizable prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>erty interest exists does it then proceed to the second step, which is to determine whether the governmental action at issue amounts to a compensable taking of that property. <em>Acceptance Insurance, </em>583 F.3d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In this case, the court need not proceed past the first step, as plaintiff has failed to establish a cognizable property interest. To have a property interest cognizable under the Fifth Amendment, a plaintiff \u201c \u2018must have more than a unilateral expectation____ He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement....\u2019\u201d <em>Members of Peanut Quota Holders Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>421 F.3d 1323, 1330 (Fed.Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). Here, Mr. Pucciariello asserts a property interest in his DAR appointment. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6 11 (alleging that \u201c[t]he settlement agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant created a property right and property interest in Plaintiffs DAR\u201d). Yet, as recognized by at least two federal courts of appeals as well as this court, designations of authority by the FAA under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702 do not create cognizable property interests under the Fifth Amendment because they are terminable at the discretion of the FAA Administrator. <em>See Lopez v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>318 F.3d 242, 249 (D.C.Cir.2003) (holding that an engineer had no property right in his appointment by the FAA as a designated engineering representative) (citation omitted); <em>Fried v. Hinson, </em>78 F.3d 688, 692 (D.C.Cir.1996) (holding that a pilot examiner had no cognizable property interest in the renewal of his pilot examiner designation); <em>Greenwood v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>28 F.3d 971, 976 (9th Cir.1994) (same); <em>Mike\u2019s Contracting, </em>92 Fed.Cl. at 307-10 (holding that a helicopter owner lacked a cognizable property interest in his airworthiness certificate for purposes of a Fifth Amendment takings claim); <em>see also </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702(d)(2) (stating that the FAA Administrator may rescind, or choose not to renew, appointments under that section \u201cat any time for any reason the Administrator considers appropriate\u201d). As such, designees under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702 serve at the FAA\u2019s discretion and therefore have no more \u201c \u2018than a unilateral expectation\u2019 \u201d of renewal. <em>Lopez, </em>318 F.3d at 249 (quoting <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Any doubt that DARs lack a property interest in their designation is clarified by the FAA\u2019s regulatory guidance, which states that \u201c[a] designation is a privilege, not a right,\u201d and \u201ctherefore[] the Administrator has the authority to terminate a delegation for any reason.\u201d FAA Order 8100.8D, \u00b6 1108(a); <em>see also id. </em>111414 (stating that \u201crenewal of any designee appointment is at the option and sole discretion of the FAA\u201d). Based upon these background principles of law, the court concludes that Mr. Pucciariello has no cognizable property interest in his DAR appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">In an attempt to distinguish the authorities holding that designations pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702 are not cognizable property interests under the Fifth Amendment, plaintiff contends that his DAR appointment is different because it was conferred by his settlement agreement, which plaintiff asserts prohibited termination or nonrenewal except for \u201ccause.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 12. Yet, as the court has already found, the settlement agreement cannot reasonably be read as displacing the statutory and regulatory framework vesting in the FAA Administrator unfettered discretion to terminate or refuse to renew DAR appointments. Moreover, plaintiff cites no authority, and the court has found none, supporting the notion that designations of authority under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702 are converted from privileges to rights merely because they are conferred by contract. Plaintiff has therefore failed to establish a cognizable property interest under the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Furthermore, the court agrees with defendant that even if plaintiff could demonstrate a cognizable property interest in his DAE appointment, he nevertheless fails to state a valid takings claim because his claim is premised upon the FAA\u2019s alleged violation of its regulations. The gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s takings claim is his allegation that the FAA unlawfully terminated his DAR appointment by failing to follow applicable regulations and internal procedures governing the termination of such appointments. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-18; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b61 (asserting that \u201c[t]his is an action for 5th Amendment taking of property without just compensation, and without complying with procedural due process and written procedural rules and regulations designed to protect Plaintiff\u2019), \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 (alleging that the FAA terminated Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment \u201cwithout due process or cause,\u201d and in an \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201ccapricious\u201d manner). The Federal Circuit has held that such allegations do not state a claim for a Fifth Amendment taking. <em>See Acadia Tech., Inc. v. United States, </em>458 F.3d 1327, 1330-31 (Fed.Cir.2006) (stating that \u201cplaintiffs assertion that [the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s] actions ran afoul of the Customs statutes ... does not form the basis for a legal claim under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Lion Raisins, Inc. v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 1356, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2005) (\u201cWe have made clear that a claim premised on a regulatory violation does not state a claim for a taking.\u201d (citing <em>Rith Energy, Inc. v. United States, 247 </em>F.3d 1355, 1366 (Fed.Cir.2001))).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">In sum, because plaintiff has failed to establish a cognizable property interest under the Fifth Amendment, and because his takings claim is premised upon allegedly unlawful governmental action, his takings claim must be dismissed pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, even if the court were to assume jurisdiction over that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims. In addition, the court concludes that even if it did possess jurisdiction, plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiffs complaint must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">(1) Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, filed November 18, 2013, is GRANTED;</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">(2) The Clerk\u2019s Office is directed to ENTER final judgment in favor of defendant, DISMISSING the complaint without prejudice; and</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">(3) Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\">. The facts recounted in this opinion are taken from plaintiff\u2019s complaint and the parties\u2019 submissions in connection with defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, including the attachments to plaintiff\u2019s complaint as well as the order dismissing Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s previous lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, which defendant attaches to its motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Compl. Attachs. A-B; Def.\u2019s Mot. App. at A18-A19 (Order of Apr. 8, 2013, <em>Pucciariello </em>v. <em>LaHood, </em>No. 12-61675 (S.D.Fla)). In addition, the court has considered Mr. Pucciariello's district court complaint filed August 27, 2012. As explained <em>infra, </em>the court may consider these documents without converting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6) into a motion for summary judgment pursuant to RCFC 56.

However, the court, in an order dated March 31, 2014, noted that the docket in this matter did not reflect that plaintiff actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>filed any attachments with his complaint. The court therefore ordered plaintiff to file Attachment A and Attachment B, as referenced in the complaint, and to certify whether those attachments were identical to pages A6 through A17 of the appendix to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, which the government described as Attachment A and Attachment B to the complaint. On April 3, 2014, in compliance with the court\u2019s March 31, 2014 order, plaintiff filed a notice indicating that \"there are no apparent differences\u201d between the documents submitted by defendant and the attachments referenced in plaintiff\u2019s complaint. <em>See </em>Notice of Apr. 3, 2014, at 1.

The government raises two additional jurisdictional arguments. First, in its opening brief, the government argues that plaintiff's breach of contract claim and takings claim are, in essence, disguised procedural due process claims over which this court lacks jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 10-11 (citations omitted). The government, in its reply brief, withdrew its contention that plaintiff\u2019s claims are essentially due process claims. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 1 n. 1 (stating that plaintiff \"clarifies in his response brief that____ [h]e is not alleging any form of due process claim,\u201d and therefore the court \"need consider only whether plaintiff\u2019s two claims <em>[i.e., </em>his breach of contract claim and takings claim] survive [RCFC] 12(b)(1) and [RCFC 12(b) ](6)\u201d). Despite defendant's apparent concession that plaintiff does not assert due process claims, the court notes that certain portions of plaintiff's complaint may fairly be read as asserting due process claims. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 4-5, 9, 12, 17-18. In addition, in his response brief, plaintiff cites several cases addressing the procedural due process protections afforded to federal employees. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 13 (citing <em>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>940 F.2d 465, 474-75 (9th Cir.1991), <em>Polos v. United States, </em>621 F.2d 385, 389-90 (Ct.Cl.1980), and <em>Terry </em>v. <em>United States, </em>499 F.2d 695, 702 (Ct.Cl.1974)). To the extent that plaintiff's complaint may be construed as asserting due process claims, those claims must be dismissed because, as the government correctly notes, due process claims are beyond this court\u2019s Tucker Act jurisdiction. <em>Smith v. United States, </em>709 F.3d 1114, 1116 (Fed.Cir.2013) (citing <em>LeBlanc v.

The court's research has revealed only one, non-precedential, Federal Circuit decision applying 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110. In <em>BFI Waste Systems of North America, Inc. v. Garvey, </em>243 F.3d 565 (Fed.Cir.2000) (table), the Federal Circuit, citing 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider a petition for review of an unspecified FAA order, and granted BFI\u2019s motion to transfer its petition for review to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">This court's precedent applying 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 is nearly as sparse. In <em>Crane Helicopter Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>45 Fed.Cl. 410 (1999), the court noted that \"the various United States Courts of Appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to review FAA Orders\u201d pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110, but the court concluded that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 did not apply in that case because neither party challenged a decision of the FAA. <em>See </em>45 Fed.CL at 436 n. 27. Rather, the plaintiff in <em>Crane Helicopter </em>asserted that the United States Forest Service had breached a forest fire suppression contract, and the government asserted counterclaims alleging that the plaintiff had falsely represented its aircraft as a civilian aircraft in order to obtain a necessary FAA certification. <em>Id. </em>In that procedural context, the court concluded that \"FAA Orders are not the focus of review,\u201d and therefore 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 did not apply. <em>Id. </em>Perhaps the most directly applicable decision of this court is <em>Mike\u2019s Contracting, LLC v. United States, </em>92 Fed.Cl. 302 (2010), which involved a helicopter owner\u2019s constitutional and tort claims challenging the FAA's decision to suspend an airworthiness certificate for one of the plaintiff's helicopters based upon the agency's determination that the helicopter posed an \"ongoing and unacceptable risk to aviation safety.\u201d 92 Fed.CL at 305. In a footnote, the court noted that, to the extent that the helicopter owner's claims could be construed as challenging the FAA\u2019s safety determination, this court lacked jurisdiction to consider any such claims because 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110 vested exclusive jurisdiction in the United States courts of appeals over any direct challenge to the FAA\u2019s safety determination. <em>See id. </em>at 309 n. 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\">. <em>See, e.g., Lacson v.

As previously noted, defendant also argues, as an additional basis for dismissal of plaintiff's breach of contract claim pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1), that the complaint fails to identify the relevant substantive provisions of the settlement agreement, as required by RCFC 9(k). <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 14. The court rejects that argument. RCFC 9(k) provides that a party, in pleading a claim founded on a contract, must \"identify the substantive provisions of the contract ... on which the party relies.\u201d The rule also provides, however, that \"[i]n lieu of a description, the party may annex to the complaint a copy of the contract or treaty, indicating the relevant provisions.\u201d RCFC 9(k); <em>see Huntington Promotional &amp; Supply, LLC </em>v. <em>United States, </em>114 Fed.Cl. 760, 766 (2014). Here, plaintiff attached a copy of the relevant settlement agreement to his complaint. <em>See </em>Compl. Attach. A at 1-3. Although the complaint itself did not identify the specific provisions of the settlement agreement that plaintiff alleges were breached, plaintiff provided such information in his response brief. <em>See </em>Pl.'s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Resp. at 11-12 (asserting that the FAA breached the provision of the settlement agreement stating that the agreement \"in no manner denies [Mr. Pucciariello] the right of renewal of [his] DAR [appointment] provided he otherwise satisfies all regulatory requirements in place or hereafter added to said regulatory requirements, and is otherwise qualified to be the holder of a DAR\u201d (citing Compl. Attach. A at 2-3)). Plaintiff has therefore substantially complied with the requirements of RCFC 9(k).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">. In contrast, plaintiff\u2019s requested declaration\u2014 that the FAA terminated Mr. Pucciariello\u2019s DAR appointment \"in violation of its written agreement,\u201d <em>see </em>Compl.

Ultimately, however, the court lacks jurisdiction to award plaintiff\u2019s requested declaratory relief because, as explained <em>infra, </em>plaintiff has failed to state a claim for money damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\">. In support of his contention that he possesses a cognizable property interest in his DAR appointment for purposes of a Fifth Amendment takings claim, Mr. Pucciariello cites to several precedential and non-precedential decisions addressing the procedural due process protections afforded to federal employees with \"for-cause\u201d employment contracts. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 13 (citing <em>Fed.

Moreover, the court has already found that plaintiff's settlement agreement does not contain a \"for-cause\u201d limitation on the termination or nonrenewal of Mr. Pucciariello's DAR appointment. Therefore, plaintiff's reliance upon decisions involving \"for-cause\u201d employment contracts is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Plaintiff also relies upon several district court decisions addressing whether FAA designees possessed cognizable property interests in their certificates of authority for purposes of procedural due process claims. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 13-14 (citing <em>Green v. Brantley, </em>719 F.Supp. 1570, 1575-76 (N.D.Ga.1989), and <em>White v. Franklin, </em>637 F.Supp. 601, 610 (N.D.Miss.1986)). Those cases are likewise inapposite because, as explained <em>supra, </em>this court lacks Tucker Act jurisdiction over such due process claims. <em>See, e.g., Smith, </em>709 F.3d at 1116 (citing <em>LeBlanc, </em>50 F.3d at 1028).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
