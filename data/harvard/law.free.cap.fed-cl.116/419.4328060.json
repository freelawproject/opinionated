Wollman\u2019s (\u201cMr. Wollman\u201d or \u201cplaintiff\u2019) entitlement to disability retirement compensation and benefits under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 (2012),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> following a remand in 2013.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Wollman claims that under the various regulations governing military disability determinations, he should have received a disability retirement after the Army diagnosed him in 2005 as suffering from Ankylosing Spondylitis (\u201cAS\u201d or \u201cAnkylosing Spondylitis\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and determined that the back pain he suffered due to AS made him medically unfit for continued military service. The Army discharged Mr. Wollman without disability retirement benefits in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-18\">The government initially argued before this court that Mr. Wollman was not entitled to a disability retirement because AS is \u201chereditary in nature\u201d and Mr. Wollman failed to rebut the resulting regulatory presumptions that his condition (1) was incurred prior to his entry into service and (2) was not permanently aggravated by that service. <em>See Bel\u2019s </em>Cross-Mot. J. 28-29, ECP No. 11 (June 21, 2012); Def.\u2019s Reply 4 n.3, ECP No. 18 (Aug. 31, 2012).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the subject regulations, if Mr. Wollman\u2019s illness is <em>not </em>hereditary in nature, the government would have had the burden of rebutting the opposite presumptions: namely, that his disease was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>incurred in the line of duty and that his military service caused any permanent worsening of the disease.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Wollman, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 659-62 (discussing application of regulatory presumptions).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">On February 6, 2013, the court remanded the case to the Army Physical Disability Review Board (\u201cAPDRB\u201d or \u201cthe board\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to determine whether the Army had properly applied the relevant presumptions concerning service-incurrence and aggravation. Although AS is associated with a \u201cgenetic predisposition,\u201d the court found that the record did not establish that AS is a hereditary disease as the government had argued. Because the Army had placed the burden of proving service aggravation on Mr. Wollman, which would have been proper only if AS is a hereditary disease, the court could not determine whether the APDRB had properly adjudicated Mr. Wollman\u2019s claim. <em>See Wollman, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 672 n. 39, 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The court ordered the APDRB, on remand, to (1) determine whether AS could properly be characterized as a congenital, hereditary, or genetic disease (as the government had argued), and (2) if the disease could not be so characterized, to determine whether the Army had met its burden of demonstrating that Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS existed prior to service (\u201cEPTS\u201d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that any permanent worsening<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of his disease was not caused by military service (i.e., that any aggravation was due to the natural progression of his disease). The court also required the APDRB to address the overwhelming evidence in the record that showed that, prior to 2005, Mr. Wollman\u2019s military and civilian physicians had repeatedly ruled out AS as the cause of his back pain; as well as the fact that plaintiff had repeatedly passed his physical fitness tests through at least 2002. The court also instructed the APDRB to provide Mr. Wollman with an opportunity to respond to its findings before making any final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">On September 4, 2013, the APDRB\u2014without providing Mr. Wollman with any opportunity to respond to its findings\u2014rendered a second decision denying his claim for disability benefits. In the September 4 decision, the board did not address the issues identified in the remand order. Instead, the APDRB\u2014 for the first time\u2014asserted that Mr. Wollman had actually been found unfit due to a <em>symptom </em>of AS: \u201cchronic back pain.\u201d Without addressing the cause of Mr. Wollman\u2019s back pain or evidence suggesting that he contracted AS during his military service, the APDRB concluded that plaintiff was not entitled to compensation because he had suffered from back pain prior to entering military service. The board also asserted that there was no evidence that plaintiffs military service had permanently aggravated this pain. The board\u2019s decision was approved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs on September 18, 2013. The cross-motions presently before the court address whether the Army\u2019s decision following remand was arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, or contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">For the reasons that follow, plaintiffs motion for judgment on the administrative record is GRANTED, and the government\u2019s cross-motion for judgment on the administrative record is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The court\u2019s prior opinion presented a detailed review of the facts surrounding plaintiffs medical history and disability processing, including the military\u2019s extensive findings regarding Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS. <em>Wollman, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 662-70. In the interest of judicial economy, the court repeats only that which is necessary to resolve the motions before the court,</p>\n<p id=\"ACP\">a. Mr. Wollman\u2019s service and medical history</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Mr. Wollman enlisted in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (\u201cROTC\u201d) program on August 23, 1993, and was commissioned into the United States Army on May 8, 1998. Plaintiff served on active duty in the Field Artillery and was deployed to Iraq from May 6, 2003 until June 10, 2004. Mr. Wollman claims that he suffered from several gastrointestinal infections while serving in Iraq, which were followed by a severe worsening of his back pain.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> RAR 178. After attaining the rank of captain, Mr. Wollman was discharged on February 24, 2006. <em>Wollman, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Mr. Wollman fractured his pelvis as a child, and suffered from lower back pain both before and after he entered active duty in 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 662-70; RAR 219. Between November 1994 and January 2005, plaintiff received numerous medical examinations from civilian and military physicians in an effort to identify the source of this pain and, in some eases, to determine whether he suffered from AS. Many of these examinations involved the analysis of X-rays, computed tomography scans (\u201cCT scans\u201d), and magnetic resonance imaging (\u201cMRI\u201d) of plaintiffs back, and most (if not all) of his treating physicians were fully aware that he was predisposed to AS given his HLA-B27 positivity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Notwithstanding these examinations, Mr. Wollman <em>never </em>received an AS diagnosis prior to 2005. In fact, several of his physicians expressly, ruled out an AS diagnosis after examining medical imaging of his spine and/or hips.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>On June 10, 2005, Mr. Wollman received a permanent medical profile from the Army that indicated that he was no longer physically able to perform certain functional activities (e.g., wear body armor, receive live immunizations, or carry a 45-pound pack). RAR 338. Over the next two months he underwent further medical evaluation, including a rheumatology consultation on July 19, 2005 in which Mr. Wollman\u2014for the first time\u2014received a diagnosis of \u201cAnkylosing Spondylitis manifested by HLA B27 positivity, bilateral Sacroiliitis____\u201d RAR 321-27; <em>see Wollman, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 662-63. This diagnosis was based upon Mr. Wollman\u2019s medical history, prior laboratory data and imaging studies, as well as a physical exam by the military rheumatologist.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mr. Wollman\u2019s Medical Evaluation Board (\u201cMEB\u201d) was conducted the following day. The board concluded that Mr. Wollman suffered from AS, that the condition existed prior to service (i.e., was EPTS), and that his AS had been permanently aggravated by service. Mr. Wollman concurred in the result of his MEB, and his matter was forwarded to a PEB.</p>\n<p id=\"AGk\">b. Mr. Wollman\u2019s disability processing</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">On October 7, 2005, Mr. Wollman\u2019s Formal PEB met and concluded that Mr. Wollman was unfit for military service and recommended that he be separated from the service without disability benefits. In the form used to document the PEB\u2019s decision, the PEB assigned plaintiffs disability the Veterans Administration Schedule for Rating Disabilities (\u201cVASRD\u201d) code of \u201c5240,\u201d which corresponds to Ankylosing Spondylitis. In the section of the form used to describe the disability, the PEB stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">Chi\u2019onic [bjack [plain first noted while undergoing ROTC evaluation. The Soldier received a waiver [<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] for the back discomfort as he was suspected in 1995 of having Ankylosing Spondylitis, <em>which is the current unfitting diagnosis. </em>There is no history of trauma/injury while on active duty.... There is no evidence of permanent service aggravation. (MEB Dx)[.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The PEB has reviewed the medical evidence of record and concludes that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate an EPTS (existed prior to service) condition for which you are now unfit. Your condition has not been permanently aggravated by service but is the result of natural progression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">AR 237 (emphasis added). Thus, while accepting that Mr. Wollman had AS, the PEB concluded\u2014contrary to the MEB\u2019s earlier finding\u2014that Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS had not been aggravated by service. Notably, the PEB did not address the fact that in October 2001\u2014prior to his deployment to Iraq and reported gastrointestinal infections\u2014Mr. Wollman\u2019s physicians expressly concluded that he was not suffering from AS. Plaintiff did not concur with the PEB\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Plaintiff subsequently embarked on various unsuccessful attempts to overturn the Formal PEB\u2019s decision, including appealing to other Army review boards and enlisting the support of one of his United States Senators. <em>See Wollman, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 664-70. Following a March 9, 2007 APDRB opinion, which affirmed that Mr. Wollman\u2019s disability was EPTS and was not service-aggravated, plaintiff timely filed suit in this court on February 23, 2012. Plaintiffs complaint asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the PEB\u2019s conclusion that his AS was EPTS had been tainted by the MEB\u2019s erroneous statement that he had received an entry waiver for AS when he entered the service, and that the Army had failed to apply the proper regulatory presumptions concerning service-incurrence and service-aggravation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">As discussed above, on February 6, 2013 this court issued an opinion that remanded the case back to the APDRB in order to determine whether\u2014and on what basis\u2014the Army had determined that AS constituted a congenital, hereditary, or genetic disease (as the government argued in support of the APDRB\u2019s first decision). The court concluded that without this information, it was not possible to assess whether the agency properly adjudicated Mr. Wollman\u2019s claim. The court incorporated the regulatory provisions relevant to the case in its directions to the APDRB:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">On remand, the APDRB must determine whether AS can be properly characterized as a congenital, hereditary, or genetic disease and, if so, the basis for that conclusion. If the APDRB concludes that \u201cgenetic predisposition\u201d or \u201csusceptibility\u201d is not synonymous with a genetic disease, then the APDRB will need to carry its burden of showing that Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS was EPTS and that any worsening of his disease was not due to military service. Should this analysis prove necessary, the board should also address (1) the undisputed fact that the plaintiff continued to pass his Army Physical Fitness Tests until at least October 24, 2002; and (2) that the plaintiffs military physicians concluded that Mr. Wollman\u2019s X-ray, CT, and MRI results did not indicate that he had contracted AS until January 2005. In addition, Mr. Wollman should be provided an opportunity to respond to the board\u2019s findings. To the extent that the APDRB primarily relies on \u201caccepted medical principles\u201d to reach its conclusions, the board should provide the sources or principles relied upon to Mr. Wollman prior to rendering a final decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 673-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">c. The APDRB\u2019s decision on remand</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">On September 4, 2013, the APDRB issued an opinion in which it claimed to \u201caffirm\u201d the PEB\u2019s decision that Mr. Wollman\u2019s unfitting medical condition was not compensable because it was EPTS and had not been aggravated by his military service. <em>See </em>RAR 3-15. As noted above, in reaching this conclusion, the APDRB did not address whether AS is a congenital, hereditary, or genetic disease, which would have triggered certain presumptions. Rather, and as explained in greater detail below, the board (1) described Mr. Wollman\u2019s unfitting condition as \u201cchronic back pain,\u201d (2) concluded that Mr. Wollman\u2019s \u201cchronic back pain\u201d existed prior to service, and (3) determined that Mr. Wollman\u2019s \u201cchronic back pain\u201d was not permanently aggravated as a result of his military service,</p>\n<p id=\"AOi\">i. APDRB\u2019s findings as to the etiology of AS</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">The APDRB did not address whether AS was a congenital, hereditary, or genetic disease. Instead, the APDRB observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>It is clear in Court documents that the etiology of AS is of prime concern. Because the etiology of AS was not a finding or decision of the board under review ... the APDRB finds no Army or Government position with which to concur or non-concur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">The APDRB finds nothing in the record to indicate that the applicant inherited anything other than the susceptibility to AS and finds no previous PEB or [United States Army Physical Disability Agency (\u201cUSAPDA\u201d) ] finding to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">ii. APDRB\u2019s re-characterization of Mr. Wollman\u2019s unfitting medical condition</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Despite conceding that \u201c[t]he only condition referred to the PEB by the Medical Evaluation Board ... as having failed to meet retention standards was Ankylosing Spondylitis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 8, the APDRB elected to re-label his disability as \u201cchronic back pain.\u201d The board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">[i]n reality, Ankylosing Spondylitis per se does not fail retention standards. Apparently the condition that failed retention standards because it rendered the Soldier incapable of performing the duties of his [Military Occupational Specialty (\u201cMOS\u201d) ] was back pain (secondary to Ankylosing Spondylitis).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">[T]he PEB determined that the unfitting condition was chronic back pain acknowledging that the current unfitting diagnosis was Ankylosing Spondylitis____ The APDRB concurs with the PEB finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-12\"><em>Id. </em>Recognizing that the PEB had, in fact, assigned Mr. Wollman the VASRD code associated with Ankylosing Spondylitis, the APDRB explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">There are a host of codes that could have been used for back pain of other etiologies but in this case the back pain was attributed to AS and the specific code for AS is 5240. The APDRB concurred that the applicant was unfit due to chronic back pain and that the appropriate VASRD code was 5240, Ankylosing Spondylitis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">RAR 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">iii. APDRB\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Wollman\u2019s unfitting condition was EPTS and not permanently aggravated by service</p>\n<p id=\"b437-18\">Without citing to any accepted medical principles or requesting additional medical evidence or opinion, the APDRB asserted that the evidence was \u201coverwhelming\u201d that his back pain was the same back pain as he suffered prior to entering active duty. <em>Id. </em>at 14. In reaching this conclusion, the board acknowledged</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-19\">that back pain is not rare and [Mr. Wollman] could have had back pain in 1995 that was not in any way related to the back pain for which he was separated in 2006. There was considerable evidence, however, that the applicant\u2019s unfitting condition, -i.e. chronic back pain, existed prior to service and that that back pain was eventually discovered to be secondary to AS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 9-10. The only evidentiary basis for the board\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs 1995 and 2005 back pain were the same was (1) the fact that plaintiff reported suffering from some degree of back pain from at least 1995 through at least 2005, and (2) the fact that Mr. Wollman did not contest the MEB\u2019s initial finding that his AS existed prior to service and was service-aggravated. <em>See id. </em>at 9-11. Specifically, the APDRB noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-21\">in [a] sworn statement in 2007 ... [Mr. Wollman] reported that for the next 4 years his pain stayed the same. That is, the pain he had in 1995 he still had in 1999. The pain that existed prior to service was continuous and unchanged after entry on active service.... The pain currently under assessment had been going on for 7-8 years. The pain currently being discussed was first noted in ROTC in 1995. The APDRB determined that the history is clear that this was not a new pain and that it existed prior to service. The MEB determined that the condition that now failed to meet retention standards existed prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>to service and the applicant concurred.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] The APDRB concurs with the PEB determination that [Mr. Wollman\u2019s] unfitting condition existed prior to service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><em>Id. </em>at ll.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">After acknowledging that there \u201cis no objective information available that speaks to the applicant\u2019s current condition,\u201d the APDRB concluded that Mr. Wollman\u2019s back pain was not permanently aggravated by his military service. <em>Id. </em>In so finding, the board emphasized that Mr. Wollman\u2019s symptoms appeared to lessen when he ceased wearing body armor and began taking medication, including Vioxx and Enbrel. The board also noted that certain X-ray changes that had previously confirmed the presence of sacroiliitis were not apparent in later X-rays. <em>Id. </em>at 11-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">d. Finalization of the APDRB\u2019s decision and the instant motions</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Without allowing plaintiff an opportunity to comment on the APDRB\u2019s findings, the board forwarded its decision to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (\u201cAssistant Secretary\u201d), who approved the decision on September 18, 2013.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On October 25, 2013, counsel for the government represented to this court that \u201cthe board\u2019s decision adequately addresses the Court\u2019s instructions on remand and ... the decision is legally and factually sound.\u201d Joint Status Report, ECF No. 39 (Oct. 25, 2013). Following a joint status conference, the court set a briefing schedule for the parties\u2019 cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">On February 3, 2014\u2014approximately one month <em>after </em>plaintiff filed its motion for judgment on the administrative record\u2014the government moved for a voluntary remand back to the APDRB. Def.\u2019s Mot. to Remand, ECF No. 49. In that motion, the government acknowledged that \u201cthe board did not explicitly state the rationale for all of its findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The motion suggested that remand was appropriate because the APDRB may have failed to make a finding as to the etiology of AS, address appropriate evidence concerning the time and origin of Mr. Wollman\u2019s disease, or provide Mr. Wollman with an opportunity to respond to its findings\u2014all of which had been expressly required by the court\u2019s remand instructions. <em>Id. </em>In light of the government\u2019s prior representations concerning the sufficiency of the APDRB\u2019s decision, coupled with the prejudice to plaintiff, the court denied the government\u2019s motion. Order\u2019, ECF No. 50. Briefing was completed on April 1, 2014, and oral argument was held on May 22,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">a. The relevant statutory and regulatory framework</p>\n<p id=\"b438-16\">Chapter 61 of Title 10 provides that a member of the armed services may be entitled to disability benefits if, <em>inter alia, </em>the member incurs or aggravates a physical disability in the line of duty. <em>See </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201. Conversely, a service member who is discharged due to a medical condition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>was EPTS and was not permanently aggravated by service is not entitled to disability compensation. The procedures for making such determinations are laid out in several complementary Department of Defense and Army regulations. <em>See Wollman, </em>108 Fed. Cl. at 659-62 (reviewing DoDI 1332.38, Army Reg. 635^10, Army Reg. 600-8-4, and Army Reg. 40-501 (February 2005)). As explained at length in the court\u2019s prior opinion, these regulations establish a set of rebuttable presumptions concerning service-incurrence and service-aggravation, the application of which can turn on the etiology of the disease. <em>Id.; see also Emenaker v. Peake, </em>551 F.3d 1332, 1339 n. 2 (Fed.Cir.2008) (citing <em>Reese v. United States, </em>180 Ct.Cl. 932 (1967) and <em>Siegel v. United States, </em>148 Ct.Cl. 420 (1960) as providing guidance for application of similar regulatory presumptions concerning serviceincurrence and aggravation).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In general, service members are presumed to have been in sound physical and mental condition upon entering active duty, except for (1) medical defects and physical disabilities noted and recorded at the time of entrance, or (2) diseases that are hereditary, congenital, or genetic. As this court previously explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">DoDI 1332.38 and Army Reg. 635-40 entitle Mr. Wollman to the presumption that his AS was incurred in the line of duty if (1) his AS was neither noted nor recorded at the time he entered active duty; and (2) AS is not a congenital, hereditary, or genetic disorder. If both conditions are satisfied, then the government bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS was EPTS. This evidence must be based on accepted medical principles,[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] but need not be confirmed by specific reference to Mr. Wollman\u2019s medical records. However, should the government rely primarily on accepted medical principles to reach the conclusion that Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS was EPTS, then those principles must be cited and must show \u201cconsistent and universal\u201d agreement among medical authorities as to the (1) cause and (2) time of origin of AS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\"><em>Wollman, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 661 (internal citations omitted). Thus, because Mr. Wollman was not diagnosed with AS prior to entering service, as long as AS is not a congenital, hereditary, or genetic disease, the government bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of service-incurrence, which requires demonstrating by preponderant evidence that under accepted medical principles, it was \u201cvirtually certain\u201d that his disease existed prior to service.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Even if the government establishes that Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS existed prior to his entering active service, he is generally entitled to a rebuttable presumption that any additional disability or aggravation of his AS was in the line of duty and therefore potentially compensable. <em>See </em>DoDI 1332.38 \u00b6 E3.P4.5.2; Army Reg. 635-40 13-2(a)(3). This presumption is not available, however, in the ease of congenital, hereditary, or genetic diseases, and can be rebutted. As this court previously explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">[T]he government can rebut the presumption [of service aggravation] by making a specific finding that a preponderance of the competent medical evidence establishes that any aggravation of Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS was due to the natural progression of the disease. This showing can be made by reference to well-established medical principles alone, and need not specifically refer to Mr. Wollman\u2019s medical records.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>contrast, if AS is a congenital, hereditary, or genetic disease, then Mr. Wollman bears the burden of showing, with clear documentary evidence, that his condition was service aggravated beyond its natural progression or that he was permitted to continue on active duty after his AS was diagnosed or should have been diagnosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><em>Wollman, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 661-62. Thus, as long as AS is not a congenital, hereditary, or genetic disease, any aggravation of Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS would presumptively be due to his military service. To rebut this presumption, the Army would need to cite to either accepted medical principles or evidence in Mr. Wollman\u2019s medical files that demonstrate that the aggravation was actually due to the natural progression of AS. <em>See id.; </em>DoDI 1332.38 \u00b6 E3.P4.5.2.2; Army Reg. 635-40 \u00b6 3-2(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">b. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">When reviewing a motion for judgment on the administrative record under Rule 52.1(c) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d), the court makes factual findings based on record evidence \u201cas if it were conducting a trial on the record.\u201d <em>See Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2005). Therefore, unlike a motion for summary judgment, the existence of a disputed material fact does not preclude the court from reaching a decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1355. Should the administrative record be silent as to some disputed facts, the court may still render judgment if the agency provided an adequate discussion of the bases of its decision. <em>See Rebosky v. United States, </em>60 Fed.Cl. 305, 311-13 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">It is well-established that the military is afforded substantial deference in adjudicating disability claims. <em>Heisig v. United States, </em>719 F.2d 1153, 1156 (Fed.Cir.1983). The court\u2019s task is limited to determining whether the board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, or contrary to law. <em>Cameron v.

The APDRB\u2019s decision to re-label Mr. Wollman\u2019s unfitting condition as \u201cback pain\u201d was arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by substantial evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Plaintiff contends that the APDRB\u2019s decision to ignore Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS on remand did not comply with the court\u2019s order and was <em>per se </em>arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiff also argues that, as a matter of law, the government waived its right to change the nature of the diagnosis by failing to raise \u201cchronic back pain\u201d as the unfitting condition prior to the remand. In response, the government argues that the APDRB was not bound by its prior findings and was therefore free on remand to ignore Mr. Wollman\u2019s prior AS diagnoses and the grounds for denying him disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">As explained below, the court concludes that the APDRB\u2019s decision to ignore Mr. Wollman\u2019s prior AS diagnoses and instead find that his unfitting condition was \u201cchronic back pain\u201d was arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by substantial evidence. Because the APDRB did not support this new determination with a rational explanation that was supported by record evidence, the board\u2019s decision must be set aside,</p>\n<p id=\"AWc\">i. The APDRB\u2019s decision to re-label Mr. Wollman\u2019s unfitting condition as \u201cback pain\u201d lacked a rational basis</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">The first question that the court must resolve is whether there was a rational basis for the APDRB\u2019s decision to re-eharacterize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the medical disability that caused Mr. Wollman not to meet the necessary retention standards. Prior to the APDRB\u2019s remand decision, the MEB, Informal PEB, Formal PEB, and USAPDA issued decisions agreeing that Mr. Wollman was unfit for continued military service due to the back pain caused by his AS\u2014decisions that the APDRB previously affirmed. On remand, however, the APDRB decided to ignore these decisions by finding Mr. Wollman\u2019s unfitting condition was \u201cchronic back pain\u201d without regard to his AS. According to the board, \u201c[ajpparently the condition that failed retention standards because it rendered [Mr. Wollman] incapable of performing the duties of his MOS was back pain (secondary to Ankylosing Spondylitis).\u201d RAR 8. The APDRB explained that the cause of his back pain was not relevant because Ankylosing Spondylitis \u201cper se does not fail retention standards.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The court recognizes the APDRB\u2019s right to make a new causation determination if it is supported by the evidence. However, the APDRB does not have the right to ignore\u2014without meaningful discussion\u2014the Army\u2019s previously undisputed medical findings and conclusions regarding the cause of the back pain. Indeed, a military board\u2019s decision to reverse a previous finding by a disability evaluation board must be explained. <em>See Istivan v. United States, </em>689 F.2d 1034, 1039 (Ct.Cl.1982) (Army Board for Correction of Military Records\u2019 failure to address unexplained change in service member\u2019s disability rating was arbitrary and capricious); <em>Craft v. United States, </em>544 F.2d 468, 474 (Ct.Cl.1976) <em>(per </em>curiam) (where a military corrections board \u201csuddenly, and without explaining its reasons, reverse[s] a decision by a Physical Evaluation Board ... [s]uch a determination ... cannot be sustained\u201d); <em>see also </em>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 581.1(c) (reversal of prior disability determination requires complete written findings). To allow a board to completely ignore a previously recognized cause of an unfitting medical condition puts military service members at risk of losing their disability retirements simply because their unfitting medical conditions happen to share a symptom(s) with other medical conditions that the member suffered from prior to entering service.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Because the APDRB did not dispute that Mr. Wollman has Ankylosing Spondylitis, the board was not free to simply ignore that diagnosis by relabeling his unfitting condition as \u201cchronic back pain.\u201d Put another way, while the APDRB was free to find another cause for Mr. Wollman\u2019s back pain that was supported by the evidence, the board was not free to simply substitute a symptom of Mr. Wollman\u2019s illness for the cause. The cause of Mr. Wollman\u2019s back pain is at the crux of his disability entitlement, and the fact that AS does not cause a soldier to \u201cper se\u201d fail, retention standards is not a reason to ignore that diagnosed cause. Moreover, under DoDI 1332.38, a diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis requires referral for military disability evaluation. DoDI 1332.38 \u00b6 E4.4.1.2.2.1. A referral presumably is required because AS can cause back pain and other debilitating symptoms that fail to meet retention standards. Thus, Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS diagnosis required that he be entered into the Army\u2019s disability evaluation system, assessed for fitness for continued active duty, and potentially be evaluated for a disability retirement. Accordingly, the court finds that the APDRB\u2019s conclusion that it could ignore Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS on the grounds that it is not a \u201cper se\u201d unfitting medical condition was arbitrary and capricious and thus not rational.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">ii. The APDRB\u2019s September 2013 decision is not supported by substantial evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">The APDRB\u2019s decision to re-characterize Mr. Wollman\u2019s unfitting condition as \u201cchronic back pain\u201d\u2014and thus EPTS\u2014is also contrary to the evidence in the record. For the court to uphold the APDRB, the court would need to find that Mr. Wollman\u2019s unfitting back pain at discharge is the same back pain he had before he joined the service and thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>as the APDRB contends, his AS diagnosis was irrelevant. The record evidence simply does not support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Contrary to the board\u2019s conclusory statements that there was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cconsiderable\u201d evidence supporting its conclusions, there is almost nothing in the record to link Mr. Wollman\u2019s early back pain with the back pain he was found to have in 2005 in connection with his AS. The chronology set forth in footnote 12 lays out in detail the numerous times doctors expressly ruled out AS as the cause of Mr. Wollman\u2019s back pain before 2005\u2014after he reportedly suffered from several gastrointestinal infections. The only record evidence that the board cites for such a finding is the fact that in 2007, Mr. Wollman stated that the pain he suffered from in 1995 \u201cstayed the same\u201d until 1999. However, this finding has no medical merit and does not constitute an accepted medical principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">There is no question that Mr. Wollman had back pain for many years. The record establishes, however, that his back pain was attributable to a variety of causes, which may include the fractured pelvis he suffered as a child. In addition, as discussed above, the record evidence establishes that Mr. Wollman was tested repeatedly for AS but was not diagnosed with AS until 2005. Importantly, the record further establishes that despite his periodic bouts of back pain, Mr. Wollman was not found unfit for service until after he received the AS diagnosis. Prior to that time he was able to serve. Given this record, the APDRB\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Wollman\u2019s back pain in 1993 was the same back pain he suffered in 2005 is simply contrary to the evidence in the record. Therefore, the court finds that the APDRB\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Wollman\u2019s chronic back pain was the same from 1993 to 2005 is not supported by substantial evidence,</p>\n<p id=\"Att\">d. The government has failed to rebut the presumption that Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS was incurred in the line of duty</p>\n<p id=\"ACj\">Because Mr. Wollman was discharged due to back pain associated with his AS and the</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">The government also does not dispute that the board did not identify any evidence in the record to overcome the presumptions favoring Mr. Wollman with regard to his AS-related back pain being service-related. Because the APDRB on remand elected not to address\u2014and thus failed to rebut\u2014the presumptions of service-incurrence and service-aggravation, the court is required, in accordance with Army regulations, to presume that Mr. Wollman\u2019s AS was incurred in the line of duty and that, to the extent that he is rated for a disability, entitled to receive a disability retirement based on his rating.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs motion for judgment on the administrative record is GRANTED, and the government\u2019s cross-motion is DENIED. The court ORDERS the parties to file a joint status report no later than June 30, 2014, regarding the next steps the government will be taking to rate Mr. Wollman and ultimately determine his disability entitlement, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">.
