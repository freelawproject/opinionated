TRT-SCR-2012-03822\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the United States Court of Federal Claims, although he titled and referred to his complaint as filed \u201cIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO DIVISION.\u201d Plaintiffs two page, handwritten complaint is styled as a letter to a judge, albeit with the caption typical of a complaint. Based on the attachments included with plaintiffs complaint, it appears that on October 16, 2012, plaintiff filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division, alleging that he was wrongfully imprisoned \u201cFOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\u201d in federal prisons in Oklahoma and Texas. Plaintiff states that he \u201cWANT[S] $50,000.00 FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND MENTAL ANGUISH I HAVE SUFFERED THRU 45 YRS OF MENTAL ANGUISH, TURNED DOWN MANY TIMES FOR JOBS AS BEING A FELON !\u201d Plaintiff adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-23\">MY TOTAL OWED ME IS $74,640.00.

One such document is a May 17, 2013 letter addressed to \u2018Tour Honor,\u201d apparently intended for a judge of this court. In the May 17, 2013 letter plaintiff states that he \u201ctried to get Justice and compensation for wrongful Imprisonment. Two Judges here in San Antonio Federal Court said they Lacked Jurisdiction, Judge Primomo stated in his Legal document, a Federal Claim Judge has jurisdiction.\u201d Plaintiff adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">I should at least be paid minimum wages for my hours I have figured out and is Just for wrongful imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">Plaintiff continues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">I sent a letter to the Federal Court here to a Federal Claim Judge to Forward to him, I called several days, later to Clerks [sic] Office and they said they put my letter in the Files and closed my case and did not Forward my letter to a Federal Claim Judge, this is Not Justice. I am 68 yrs old 3-1-45 on Disability, I Hope you will pay me some compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">As another attachment to the complaint, plaintiff submitted a photocopy of a March 12, 2008 \u201cCertificate of Pardon Issued to Herman Leon Brickey,\u201d pursuant to a Proclamation of Pardon, dated January 21, 1977, issued by President Jimmy Carter. The photocopy of the Certificate of Pardon submitted with plaintiffs complaint is cut off on the right hand margin, making certain words difficult to read. The photocopy of the Certificate of Pardon appears to grant Mr. Brickey a pardon from his conviction for violation of the Military Selective Service Act \u201cirrespective of the dat [sic] of any offense against the United States of America----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">Plaintiffs complaint in this court was filed without the requisite filing fee, or a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Instead, Mr. Brickey attached the Application to Proceed <em>in Forma Pauperis </em>he had previously filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas ease. In plaintiffs October 16, 2012 Application to Proceed <em>in Forma Pauperis </em>submitted to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, plaintiff indicated that he had been unemployed since August 1999. He indicated his only sources of income were a social security supplement, social security disability and food stamps. He also claimed he did not have any cash on hand or money in a savings or checking account. He noted that he had a 1998 Mercury Marquis with 230,000 miles with an estimated value of $500.00. He stated on his Application that he \u201cCAN BARELY AFFORD GAS FOR MY CAR, AS I NEED IT TO GO TO STORE AND DOCTORS OFFICE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">In response to plaintiffs complaint, defendant filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC) (2013), or, in the alternative, RCFC 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Defendant argues that plaintiffs complaint, which defendant construes as \u201cone for compensation based upon unjust conviction and imprisonment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1495 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513,\u201d does not comply with the statutory requirements specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, therefore, should be dismissed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>To date, plaintiff has not responded to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, although plaintiff has been allotted more time than provided for under the court\u2019s Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">When determining whether a complaint filed by a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff is sufficient to invoke review by a court, <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs are entitled to liberal construction of their pleadings. <em>See Haines v.

According to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1495, \u201c[t]he United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim for damages by any person unjustly convicted of an offense against the United States and imprisoned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1495. Section 1495 of title 28, therefore, \u201cmust be read in conjunction with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513.\u201d <em>Humphrey v. United States, </em>52 Fed.Cl. 593, 596 (2002), <em>aff'd, </em>60 Fed.Appx. 292 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citations omitted). As quoted above, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513 requires that a plaintiff suing under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1495, \u201cmust allege and prove\u201d that \u201c[h]is conviction has been reversed or set aside on the ground that he is not guilty of the offense of which he was convicted ... or that he has been pardoned upon the stated ground of innocence and unjust conviction,\u201d and, that \u201c[h]e did not commit any of the acts charged.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513(a). In <em>Humphrey, </em>this court indicated, \u201c[t]hese jurisdictional requirements [of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1495 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513] are strictly construed, and a heavy burden is placed upon a claimant seeking relief under such provisions.\u201d <em>Humphrey v. United States, </em>52 Fed.Cl. at 596. Additionally, as noted in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>105 Fed.Cl. 231 (2012), \u201ca certificate or pardon must \u2018either explicitly or by factual recitation\u2019 state that the plaintiff has satisfied the requirements of Section 2513.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233 (quoting <em>Humphrey v. United States, </em>52 Fed.Cl. at 597). Plaintiff, however, has not alleged that his conviction was set aside or reversed because he had not committed, or was not guilty of, the acts underlying his original conviction. Furthermore, Mr. Briekey has not alleged, nor has he demonstrated, based on the documents currently before this court, that he has been pardoned on the \u201cground of innocence and unjust conviction.\u201d Plaintiffs photocopy of the Certificate of Pardon, attached to the complaint, although partially cut' off on the right margin, making a few words only partially legible, indicates that Mr. Briekey, \u201cwho was convicted, irrespective of the dat [sic] ... of any offense against the United States of America committed between August 4, 1964 and ... in violation of the Military Selective Service Act or any rule or regulation promulgated t [sic] ... pardoned by the Proclamation of Pardon of January 21,1977.\u201d Nowhere does the photocopy of the Certificate of Pardon state that Mr. Briekey was pardoned because he was found innocent of the acts for which he was charged or unjustly convicted. The photocopy of the affidavit by the Pardon Attorney Ronald L. Rodgers, included with the photocopy of the Certificate of Pardon, to certify that the copy included is a \u201ctrue and accurate copy\u201d of the Certificate of Pardon, only states that the copy is a \u201crecord of executive clemency.\u201d Although plaintiff alleges in his complaint \u201cWRONGFUL IN PRISONMENT FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM,\u201d he does not allege he did not commit any of the unnamed acts charged for which he was convicted. In fact, plaintiff never identifies why he was imprisoned. Therefore, plaintiffs attached photocopy of the Certificate of Pardon does not comply with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513, and cannot be a basis for jurisdiction in this court to review his claims arising from his alleged wrongful imprisonment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Moreover, to the extent that plaintiff requests compensation for a tortious act as the basis for his complaint, as he alleged his case is an \u201cADMINISTRATIVE TORT CLAIM NO.

Therefore, this court does not have jurisdiction over plaintiffs tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">As indicated above, the plaintiff did not pay the filing fee required to commence proceedings before the court. In order to provide access to this court to those who cannot pay the filing fees mandated by RCFC 77.1(c) (2013), the statute at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 (2006) permits a court to allow plaintiffs to file a complaint without payment of fees or security, under specific circumstances. The standard in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1) for <em>in forma pauperis </em>eligibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>is \u201cunable to pay such fees or give security therefor.\u201d Determination of what constitutes \u201cunable to pay\u201d or unable to \u201cgive security therefor,\u201d and, therefore, whether to allow a plaintiff to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is left to the discretion of the presiding judge, based on the information submitted by the plaintiff or plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g., Rowland v. Cal. Men\u2019s Colony, Unit II Men\u2019s Advisory Council, </em>506 U.S. 194, 217-18, 113 S.Ct. 716, 121 L.Ed.2d 656 (1993); <em>Fuentes v. United States, </em>100 Fed.Cl. 85, 92 (2011). In <em>Fiebelkorn v. United States, </em>the United States Court of Federal Claims indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">[T]he threshold for a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is not high: The statute requires that the applicant be \u201cunable to pay such fees.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1). To be \u201cunable to pay such fees\u201d means that paying such fees would constitute a serious hardship on the plaintiff, not that such payment would render plaintiff destitute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\"><em>Fiebelkorn v. United States, </em>77 Fed.Cl. 59, 62 (2007); <em>see also Hayes v. United States, </em>71 Fed.Cl. 366, 369 (2006). Although not included as a separate motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis. </em>Mr. Briekey attached to his complaint a copy of the Application to Proceed <em>in Forma Pauperis </em>he had previously submitted to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Recognizing the plaintiffs <em>pro se </em>status, the court accepts the previously submitted Application to Proceed <em>in Forma Pauperis </em>as a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in this court. Although plaintiffs income level and absence of savings may qualify him for <em>in forma pauperis </em>status, as discussed and determined above, plaintiffs complaint is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Because plaintiff fails to comply with the statutory requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513, plaintiffs complaint is DISMISSED, without prejudice.

In determining that this court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s complaint because plaintiff did not comply with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513, the court notes two recent unreported Federal Circuit decisions which address lack of jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513. <em>See Winston v.

In <em>Johnson, </em>the Federal Circuit indicated that \u201d[t]he court correctly determined that Johnson did not and could not allege that his conviction was reversed or set aside on the grounds of innocence or pardon, as \u00a7 2513 requires. Even when construed in Johnson\u2019s favor, the facts alleged do not suggest that Johnson\u2019s conviction was reversed or set aside on the ground that he is not guilty, that Johnson was found not guilty in a new trial, or that Johnson was pardoned upon the stated ground of innocence and unjust conviction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513 (2006). Accordingly, the Court of Federal Claims correctly held that amendment of Johnson\u2019s complaint would not cure its jurisdictional deficiency.\u201d <em>Johnson v.
