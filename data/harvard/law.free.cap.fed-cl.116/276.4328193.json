BACKGROUND<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">A. Medical History</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Petitioner Debra Chuisano\u2019s mother, Frances D\u2019Esposito, was born in 1942. Fee Dee., 2013 WL 6234660 at *2. Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s medical records from 2004 reflect that she suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic asthma, and arthritis. <em>Id. </em>On September 27, 2004, her doctor diagnosed an upper respiratory infection and prescribed an antibiotic. <em>Id. </em>On October 12, 2004, Ms. D\u2019Esposito received an influenza (flu) vaccine. <em>Id. </em>Four days later, she had aches, fever, and a sore throat. <em>Id. </em>Her primary care physician diagnosed \u201ca viral syndrome\u201d and did not prescribe more antibiotics. <em>Id. </em>On October 18, 2004, she was admitted to the hospital for breathing difficulties. <em>Id. </em>Her admission history notes that she recently had received a flu vaccine. <em>Id. </em>Her initial diagnosis was pneumonia and sepsis, and subsequent laboratory tests detected streptococcus pneumonia. <em>Id. </em>She remained in the hospital as her condition deteriorated and until she died on December 24, 2004. <em>Id. </em>The conditions listed on her discharge summary are pneumonia and congestive heart failure. <em>Id. </em>Her death certificate attributes cause of death to adult respiratory distress syndrome due to pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Ms. Chuisano approached the law firm of Conway, Homer &amp; Chin-Caplan (CHC-C) in early March 2005 to discuss a potential vaecine claim because she believed her mother died as a result of receiving the flu vaccine. <em>Id. </em>CHC-C specializes in the representation of claimants asserting vaccine-related injuries. <em>See </em>CHC-C Website, http://www. ecandh.com/default.asp (last visited May 12, 2014). CHC-C tasked Ms. Chuisano with \u201cforward[ing] records and estate does.\u201d Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at <em>*2. </em>CHC-C communicated periodically with Ms. Chuisano about the medical records but, \u201cfor reasons not explained\u201d in the record, more than a year went by and CHC-C was still waiting for materials. <em>Id. </em>In the fall of 2006, the firm sent Ms. Chuisano a \u201creject letter;\u201d however, she responded expressing a desire to continue her case. <em>Id. </em>On December 21, 2006, CHC-C reviewed a discharge summary provided by Ms. Chuisano. <em>Id. </em>at *2-3. After reviewing the discharge summary, CHC-C accepted the case pending receipt of the estate documents. <em>Id. </em>at *3. Legal representation appears to have been formalized in late January or early February, 2007. <em>See </em>CHC-C Timesheets, ECF No. 49-6 (attached as Exhibit 14 to petitioner\u2019s first motion for fee and costs, filed with the special master on December 16, 2011). Over the ensuing five months, CHC-C received estate documents and, for the first time, the firm began active pursuit of Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s medical records. Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">CHC-C filed Ms. Chuisano\u2019s vaccine petition on June 28, 2007, just days before the limitations period expired on July 1, 2007.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>It was a \u201cskeletal petition,\u201d <em>id., </em>that did not meet content requirements, <em>see </em>\u00a7 300aa-11(c); Vaccine Rule 2(c), but did aver that \u201cthe necessary \u2018[djocuments and affidavits in support of the petition [would] be filed, once received,\u2019 \u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Mem. in Resp. to Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mot. (Resp\u2019t\u2019s Mem.), Jan. 15, 2014, ECF No. 87, at 3 (quoting Petition at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>According to CHC-C\u2019s timesheets, CHC-C had received and reviewed Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s discharge summary before the petition was filed. Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *3. Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s discharge summary indicated that she had suffered from pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome and died from congestive heart failure, but did not mention the flu vaccine. <em>Id. </em>The firm also had received records from two medical providers; however, there is no evidence that an attorney reviewed these records before the firm filed the petition. <em>Id. </em>Those records were not included with the filed petition. <em>Id. </em>The records reflect that in February 2004 (approximately eight months before receipt of the flu vaccine), a doctor determined Ms. D\u2019Esposito required a portable nebulizer because of \u201cchronic and acute asthma.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The doctor also described Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s \u201cpulmonary disease\u201d as \u201cvery unstable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On November 26, 2007, nearly five months after filing the petition, the petitioner filed her initial medical records, of which the vast majority came from Good Samaritan Hospital. <em>Id. </em>at *4; <em>see also </em>Notice of Filing, ECF No. 14. Petitioner subsequently filed an Amended Petition and her affidavit on January 14, 2008. Am. Petition, ECF No. 17; Affidavit, ECF No. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Respondent filed its report on May 30, 2008, pursuant to Vaccine Rule 4(c). The report recommended against compensation because petitioner had not satisfied the criteria for receiving compensation under the Vaccine Act. Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *4. Specifically, respondent pointed to, <em>inter alia, </em>Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s medical records revealing multiple bouts of respiratory infection between 2002 and 2004; her death certificate attributing death to non-vaeeine-related causes; and the fact that none of her treating physicians ascribed her death to the flu vaccine, despite their awareness of its temporal proximity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In the ensuing two months, CHC-C consulted with two immunologists, seeking an expert opinion on causation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>One of petitioner\u2019s attorneys, Ms. Sylvia Chin-Ca-plan, also drafted a letter detailing her theories on causation. <em>Id. </em>CHC-C shared this letter with at least one of the potential experts. <em>Id. </em>The firm was unsuccessful in retaining an expert. <em>See id. </em>at *5 (discussing efforts in greater detail). By this time, CHC-C had invested approximately 190 hours in petitioner\u2019s representation; it had also been given four extensions of time to file an expert report. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">CHC-C sent petitioner a \u201creject letter\u201d and, on August 17, 2009, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. <em>Id. </em>In October and November, before the court ruled on withdrawal, CHC-C provided petitioner\u2019s materials to Mr. Robert Moxley, another seasoned vaccine program litigator. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">On November 16,2009, the court substituted CHC-C for Mr. Moxley as petitioner\u2019s new attorney of record. <em>See </em>Consented Mot. Substitute, ECF No. 38. Mr. Moxley continued CHC-C\u2019s efforts to obtain an expert opinion to support a causation theory. Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *5. Timesheets reveal Mr. Moxley communicated on numerous occasions with CHC-C and reviewed Ms. Chin-Caplan\u2019s causation-theory letter. <em>Id.; see also </em>Moxley Timesheets, ECF No. 49-2 (attached as Exhibit 10 to petitioner\u2019s first motion for fees and costs filed with the special master on December 16, 2011). Time-sheets also reflect that Mr. Moxley\u2019s firm attempted to reach one potential expert in April 2010, but the record is unclear what became of his firm\u2019s overtures. Fee Dee., 2013 WL 6234660 at *5; <em>see also </em>Moxley Timesheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">In September 2010, petitioner was ordered to file a status report concerning her efforts to obtain an expert report. Order, Sept. 27, 2010, ECF No. 39. Petitioner responded that she \u201cha[d] been actively seeking a medical expert to support the causation syllogism <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>required by the Vaccine Act.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Status Report, Oct. 29, 2010, ECF No. 40, at \u00b6 1. Petitioner also shared her causation theory that \u201cthe flu virus has been observed to disrupt the molecular processes of the immune system, and to promote a synergistic effect whereby other infections have a greater opportunity [to cause harm]. Fatal pneumonia, for instance, is made much more likely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1 n. 1; Fee Dee., 2013 WL 6234660 at *5 (quoting same).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">After additional status reports, <em>see </em>Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *6, petitioner was ordered to file an expert report by May 16, 2011, or \u201c[i]f ... unable to find an expert to opine as to causation, ... [then] a motion for ruling on the record,\u201d Order, Feb. 15, 2011, ECF No. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">On May 16, 2011 (roughly a year and a half after Mr. Moxley assumed representation), petitioner moved for a decision on the record. ECF No. 46. On May 18, 2011, the special master entered his no-compensation decision finding petitioner had failed to meet her burden of proof. <em>See Chuisano v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>Case No. 07-452V, 2011 WL 2268969 (Fed.Cl.Spec.Mstr. May 18, 2011) (Liability Dec.); <em>see also </em>Judgment, June 20, 2011, ECF No. 48. He found that petitioner \u201cfailed to demonstrate either that Ms. D\u2019Esposito suffered a \u2018Table Injury\u2019 or that her injuries were \u2018actually caused\u2019 by a vaccination.\u201d Liability Dec., 2011 WL 2268969 at *1. Petitioner offered only her own statement and evidence of temporal proximity to support her claim of a causal relationship between the vaccine\u2019s administration and Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s death. <em>Id.' </em>However, this evidence was insufficient. <em>Id.; see also </em>\u00a7 300aa-13(a)(l) (a special master may not award compensation \u201cbased on the claims of a petitioner alone, unsubstantiated by medical records or medical opinion\u201d). Petitioner pointed to no medical records, nor did she offer any expert opinion, to support a finding of causation-in-fact. Liability Dee., 2011 WL 2268969 at *1. The special master\u2019s decision denying program compensation has not been appealed, but petitioner has sought fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">On September 20, 2012, the special master entered an initial decision awarding reduced fees and costs to CHC-C ($38,365.45 of the $40,946.65 requested), but denying an award of fees and costs to Mr. Moxley, for which he had requested $3,706.90. <em>See </em>Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *6-7 (describing earlier fee decision, filed September 20, 2012, ECF No. 63, that was later withdrawn per Order, filed October 15, 2012, ECF No. 65); <em>see also </em>Resp\u2019t\u2019s Mem. 5-6 &amp; 5 n. 4 (dollar amounts). In this initial fee decision, the special master found that CHC-C had a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for pursuing petitioner\u2019s claim through the filing of her petition (on the eve of the statute of limitations deadline), the subsequent gathering of medical records, and the efforts to retain an expert. Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *7 (describing initial fee decision). Mr. Moxley, however, lacked a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to proceed with petitioner\u2019s claim after CHC-C had been unable to obtain an expert opinion supporting a finding of vaccine-related causation. <em>Id. </em>(describing initial fee decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">On October 11, 2012, petitioner sought reconsideration of the total denial of Mr. Moxley\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mot. Recons., ECF No. 64. Petitioner argued that the initial fee decision was premised on an erroneous view of the law. <em>Id. </em>at 2. According to petitioner, \u201creasonable basis\u201d for a claim was a one-time inquiry; thus, if the ease began under CHC-C with a reasonable basis, then the reasonable basis continued to exist when Mr. Moxley later assumed representation. <em>Id. </em>Petitioner \u201cpray[ed] an order of the court, setting aside and vacating the [initial fee decision], for reconsideration of the [initial fee decision] and an appropriate award for reasonable fees and costs to successor counsel under the correct legal standard____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">In response, the special master issued an order on October 15, 2012 that granted petitioner\u2019s reconsideration motion in part, by withdrawing the initial fee decision and soliciting further briefing on the fee issue. ECF No. 65. As the initial fee decision had been withdrawn, the government\u2019s briefing on reconsideration, as well as petitioner\u2019s reply, addressed not only the propriety of fees and costs for Mr. Moxley, but for CHC-C as well. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *7 (discussing the scope of reconsideration briefing).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">On October 25, 2013, the special master entered his final decision denying <em>in toto </em>the fees and costs sought by both CHC-C and Mr. Moxley. Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *1, 23-24. The special master found that a fee and cost award would be inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>at *1. Without supportive evidence of causation-in-fact, petitioner lacked a reasonable basis for her claim. <em>Id. </em>Afforded the opportunity to reconsider his earlier decision awarding fees and costs to CHC-C, the special master was persuaded by the government\u2019s argument that \u201cthe pendency of the statute of limitation does not dispense with the petitioner\u2019s obligation to furnish some evidence supporting the claim contained in the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the special master reconsidered the leeway he had accorded CHC-C for filing the petition on the eve of the statute of limitations\u2019 expiration\u2014the circumstance that informed his initial decision to award fees to that firm. <em>See id. </em>He ultimately concluded, with regard to petitioner\u2019s claim as a whole, that there remained a \u201cgap in evidence [] despite Ms. Chuisano\u2019s retention of two separate law firms and the participation of at least three doctors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The special master determined that \u201c[w]ithout any evidence linking Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s death to her flu vaccination, Ms. Chuisano\u2019s ease lacked a reasonable basis. And, without a reasonable basis, [her counsel] may not be awarded any attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Now before the court is petitioner\u2019s motion for review of this final fee decision, <em>see </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mot.; Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem., and the government\u2019s response, <em>see </em>Resp\u2019t\u2019s Mem. Neither party has challenged petitioner\u2019s good faith in filing her petition. Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *1 n. 2. The sole issues are (1) whether the special master erred in concluding there was never a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for her claim; and (2) whether he abused his discretion by denying fees and costs to either CHC-C or Mr. Moxley. Oral argument was deemed unnecessary. The matter is now ripe for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to review the decision of a special master. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(l); <em>see also </em>Vaccine Rule 23. After engaging in its re^ view, the court may take one of three actions: (1) uphold the special master\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and sustain the special master\u2019s decision; (2) set aside some or all of the special master\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and issue different findings of fact and conclusions or law; or (3) remand the petition for further action in accordance with the court\u2019s direction. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(A)-(C); <em>see also </em>Vaccine Rule 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The court may set aside a special master\u2019s decision only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B). As the Federal Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">These standards vary in application as well as degree of deference. Each standard applies to a different aspect of the judgment. Fact findings are reviewed ... by [the Court of Federal Claims] under the arbitrary and capricious standard; legal questions under the \u2018not in accordance with law5 <em>[de novo </em>review] standard; and discretionary rulings under the abuse of discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-12\"><em>Munn v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863, 870 n. 10 (Fed.Cir.1992) (commenting further that an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d will \u201crarely come into play except where the special master excludes evidence\u201d); <em>accord Saunders v.

Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>3 F.3d 1517, 1520 (Fed.Cir.1993) (citing <em>Perreira v.

Jan. 9, 2008) (Special Master Moran). \u201cThis [discretion] is appropriate in view of the [special master\u2019s] superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.\u201d <em>Saxton, </em>3 F.3d at 1521 (quoting <em>Hensley v.

If, however, the exercise of discretion turns on a potentially erroneous statutory interpretation of the Vaccine Act (a question of law), then the court will review the interpretation without deference. <em>Avera v.

DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AZV\">A. The \u201cReasonable Basis\u201d Standard</p>\n<p id=\"AbxI\">If a petitioner succeeds on the merits of his or her compensation claim, the Vaccine Act requires the special master to award reasonable fees and costs. \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(1). However, the special master also enjoys discretion to award fees and costs to unsuccessful petitioners, provided the unsuccessful petition was filed in good faith and there was a reasonable basis to support the claim. <em>Id.; Sebelius v. Cloer (Cloer </em>III),\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1886, 1891-92, 185 L.Ed.2d 1003 (2013) (discussing standard); <em>Avera, </em>515 F.3d at 1347 (same). If a special master determines that there is good faith and a reasonable basis for a claim, \u201che or she <em>may </em>award the fees.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 403. It is nevertheless possible that, after making the required findings of good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>and reasonable basis, the special master may decline to award fees or costs. <em>Id. </em>at 402 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The statute offers no further explanation or definition of what constitutes a \u201creasonable basis.\u201d Moreover, as the special master correctly noted, \u201c[n]either the Federal Circuit nor [the Court of Federal Claims] has had occasion to define the meaning of \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 for purposes of fee awards under the Vaccine Act.\u201d Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *11 (quoting <em>Woods v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>105 Fed.Cl. 148, 153 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The Circuit Court has observed, however, that \u201c[statutory construction ... is a holistic endeavor.\u201d <em>Figueroa v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs, </em>715 F.3d 1314, 1318 (Fed.Cir.2013) (citation omitted). To that end, \u201cthe language of [the Vaccine Act must be considered] in light of the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted). Further to the Circuit Court\u2019s guidance, the court finds here that recognizing a special master\u2019s discretion to make a fee award is paramount to developing a set of finite rules or criteria. Other decisions of the court appear to agree. <em>See, e.g., Silva, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 402 (\u201c[T]he statute grants to the special master maximum discretion in applying the standard.\u201d). The statutory text that includes the \u201creasonable basis\u201d provision shows that Congress drew a clear distinction between an automatic fee award for successful petitioners and a discretionary award for unsuccessful petitioners. <em>See </em>\u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l). This distinction would be subverted by a set of inflexible rules or criteria defining \u201creasonable basis.\u201d Moreover, such rules or criteria would strip a special master of his or her discretion and authority to deny fees even to those claimants who show \u201creasonable basis\u201d by, <em>inter alia, </em>implying that an unsuccessful petitioner who meets the minimum threshold of defined requirements is entitled to a fee award as of right. <em>See Cloer v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs. (Cloer II), </em>675 F.3d 1358, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2012) (en banc) (disagreeing with the dissent, which advocated a strict rule that untimely petitions can never be found to have been supported by a reasonable basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">A \u201creasonable basis\u201d standard that is not rigidly defined\u2014as amorphous as it may be\u2014is consistent with the Vaccine Act as a whole. The Federal Circuit has instructed that \u201c[r]emedial legislation like the Vaccine Act should be construed in a manner that effectuates its underlying spirit and purpose.\u201d <em>Cloer II, </em>675 F.3d at 1362 (citing <em>Atchison, Topeka, &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Buell, </em>480 U.S. 557, 561-62, 107 S.Ct. 1410, 94 L.Ed.2d 563 (1987)); <em>see also, e.g., Peyton v. Rowe, </em>391 U.S. 54, 65, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968) (citing the \u201ccanon of construction that remedial statutes should be liberally construed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u201cThe overarching purpose of the Vaccine Act[,] and the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Program it created,] is to award compensation \u2018to vaccine-injured persons quickly, easily, and with certainty and generosity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cloer II, </em>675 F.3d at 1362 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 99-908, at 3 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6344). A vaccine-related injury, however, is not always clear at the outset. As the Federal Circuit has noted, \u201c[t]he first time an injury is causally linked with a vaccine often occurs as a result of a successful non-Table petition.\u201d <em>Cloer v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs. (Cloer I), </em>654 F.3d 1322, 1332 n. 4 (Fed.Cir. 2011). Congress would not have \u201cintended to discourage counsel from representing petitioners who, because of the difficulty of distinguishing between the initial symptoms of a vaccine-related injury and unrelated malady ... may [nevertheless] have good-faith claims with a reasonable basis____\u201d <em>See Cloer III, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1895. Thus, \u201c[a] stated purpose of the Act\u2019s fees scheme was to avoid \u2018limiting] petitioners\u2019 ability to obtain qualified assistance\u2019 by making fees awards available for \u2018non-prevailing, good-faith claims.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting H.R.Rep. No. 99-908 at 22); <em>see also Cloer II, </em>675 F.3d at 1362 (\u201cCongress recognized that having to shoulder attorneys\u2019 fees could deter victims of vaccine-related injuries from seeking redress.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Although a special master may award fees and costs to unsuccessful petitioners under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the Vaccine Act, the statute does not compel such awards. \u201cCongress [did] not ... intend[] that every claimant, whether being compensated or not under the Vaccine Act, collect attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d <em>Perreira, </em>33 F.3d at 1377; <em>Phillips v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>988 F.2d 111, 112-13 (Fed.Cir.1993) (Plager, J., concurring) (stressing the negative ramifications of baseless appeals over the denial of fees and costs). There is no textual, historical, or logical support suggesting otherwise. Fee denials ai\u2019e expected to occur. A different construction of the statute would swallow the special master\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 300aa-15(e)(1). Congress vested such discretion with the special masters, plainly contemplating that not all petitioners would recover fees and costs. If Congress had intended all or nearly all petitioners to recover fees, it easily could have expanded fee awards to all petitions filed in good faith, rather than requiring good faith and a reasonable basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Also militating in favor of a discretionary authority that permits the denial of fee awai'ds are common law principles and policy concerns. As the dissent in <em>Cloer II </em>explained, \u201cbecause Congress departed from the [prevailing party requirement applicable] in virtually every other federal fee-shifting statute, [the court] should be cautious in interpreting the statutory mandate to extend beyond those cases in which fee-shifting was clearly intended.\u201d 675 F.3d at 1367 (Bryson, J., dissenting) (providing background for its view that fees should not be recoverable for untimely petitions) (citing <em>Robert C. Herd &amp; Co. v. Krawill Mach. Corp., </em>359 U.S. 297, 304-05, 79 S.Ct. 766, 3 L.Ed.2d 820 (1959)) (explaining that a rule of law \u201cin derogation of the common law ... must be strictly construed\u201d); <em>In re Crescent City Estates, </em>588 F.3d 822, 826 (4th Cir.2009) (\u201cBecause fee-shifting statutes are \u2018in derogation of the common law,\u2019 courts are obliged to construe them strictly.\u201d (citation omitted)). Well-set-tied principles of sovereign immunity are also a consideration. <em>Cloer II, </em>675 F.3d at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Premised in pertinent part on reasonableness, the standard for discretionary fee awards allows for the practical and logical necessities of vaccine program practice. As petitioner herself argues, \u201c[i]n [these] scientifically complex, expensive, and controversial cases, the interpretation of \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 demands a common sense approach based upon the totality of the circumstances of each individual case.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mot. 12. Numerous special masters, as well as this court, have held that reasonable basis is an objective standard determined by the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>E.g., McKellar v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>101 Fed.Cl. 297, 303 (Fed.Cl.2011) (citing <em>Hamrick, </em>2007 WL 4793152 at *4). Some have further interpreted the requirement as one that looks not at the likelihood of success of a claim but more to the feasibility of the claim. <em>See Di Roma v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 90-3277, 1993 WL 496981, *1 (Fed.Cl.Spec.Mstr. Nov. 18, 1993). The circumstances are simply too numerous and diverse in which any particular individual, who is otherwise healthy or unhealthy, may subsequently suffer a vaccine-related injury, or an unrelated malady in temporal proximity to a vaccination, and then seek compensation. Accordingly, the court finds that the special master\u2019s Fee Decision goes too far by rejecting, as a matter of course, any consideration of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See </em>Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *16 (favoring a reasonable basis standard premised exclusively on whether there is evidence constituting \u201csupporting documentation\u201d rather than a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d inquiry).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Nonetheless, the special master is correct that \u201c[Reasonable basis is a standard that petitioners,\u201d at least generally, \u201cmeet by submitting evidence.\u201d Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *12. Failure to submit such evidence \u201ccarries consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *13. \u201cAt the most basic level, a petitioner who submits no evidence would not be found to have reasonable basis because the petitioner could not meet the burden of proof needed to establish reasonable basis.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201c[A] \u2018petitioner must affirmatively establish a reasonable basis to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McKellar, </em>101 Fed. Cl. at 304). This burden is something less than the preponderant evidence ultimately required to prevail on one\u2019s vaccine-injury claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Because \u201creasonable basis is linked to \u2018the claim\u2019 contained in the petition, not the petition itself,\u201d the reasonable basis inquiry is broad enough to survive a statute of limitations flaw in a petition. Fee Dee., 2013 WL 6234660 at *15 &amp; 15 n. 26 (referring to \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l), which links the \u201cgood faith\u201d inquiry to the filing of the \u201cpetition,\u201d but the \u201creasonable basis\u201d inquiry to support for the \u201cclaim\u201d); <em>Cloer III, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1894-95. The court is similarly persuaded that the reasonable basis inquiry is broad enough to encompass any material submitted in support of the claim at any time in the proceeding, whether with the petition or later.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The court agrees with the special master that \u201c[i]n the absence of a Federal Circuit instruction, it may be easier to define a reasonable basis in terms of what it is not.\u201d Fee Dee., 2013 WL 6234660 at *13. For example, \u201c[reasonable basis requires presenting more than evidence showing only that the vaccine preceded the onset of the injury for which the petitioner seeks compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Temporal proximity is necessary, but not sufficient. <em>See id. </em>at *14.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">However, the court disagrees with the special master that \u201c[a]ll these reasons support the [conclusion that] whether petitioners have met their burden regarding reasonable basis should not include consideration of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at *16 (concluding same). A looming statute of limitations does not forever absolve a petitioner from his or her obligation to proceed with a reasonable basis to support his claim, at least not if the petitioner hopes to recover any fees and costs. <em>See </em>\u00a7 300(e)(1). However, the statute of limitations is a factor that may affect the reasonable basis analysis in appropriate circumstances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">The court also declines the special master\u2019s invitation to supplant the current reasonable basis test that is informed by a totality of the circumstances with a reasonable basis test that turns solely on evidentiary standards. <em>See </em>Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *17 (acknowledging that his \u201cdecision\u2019s focus on evidence supporting a finding of reasonable basis is different from the treatment in other eases\u201d). An evidentiary standard may serve as an excellent guidepost in fee decisions, but it cannot serve as the bright-line threshold. Such a rigid position is at variance with the flexible structure of the vaccine program.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">The court considers the following. First, evidentiary rules are relaxed in vaccine proceedings. <em>Griglock v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>687 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed.Cir.2012) (citing \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(3)(B)); <em>Masias v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>634 F.3d 1283, 1290 (Fed.Cir.2011) (\u201c[I]n Vaccine Act litigation, evidence need not be presented under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d) (citation omitted). Second, an effort to engraft a test for reasonable basis onto the statute would disregard Congress\u2019s plain choice not to do so, but instead to maximize the special master\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l). Third, even if this court were to adopt the proposed evidentiary standard, the court would be left to determine, just as the special master asks, \u201chow much evidence is sufficient?\u201d for a fee award to a non-prevailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>party on an unsuccessful vaccine petition. <em>See </em>Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *13.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In contrast, under the totality of the circumstances test for reasonable basis, a special master should consider a number of factors. <em>McKellar, </em>101 Fed.Cl. at 303; <em>Di Roma, </em>1993 WL 496981 at *1. Factors to be considered \u201cinelude[e] the factual basis, the medical support, and jurisdictional issues,\u201d and the circumstances under which a petition is filed. <em>Di Roma, </em>1993 WL 496981 at *1. Special masters have found reasonable basis for claims absent medical records or opinions supporting vaccine causation. <em>See Austin v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 10-362V, 2013 WL 659574, *8 (Fed.Cl.Spec.Mstr. Jan. 31, 2013) (citing <em>Hamrick, </em>2007 WL 4793152, at *7); <em>Lamar v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 99-583V, 2008 WL 3845165, *4 (Fed.Cl.Spec.Mstr. July 30, 2008). A reasonable basis might even exist if a petition is filed in an untimely manner after the close of the statute of limitations. <em>Cloer II, </em>675 F.3d at 1359-61, 1364 (finding petitioner would be eligible to receive fees and costs if, on remand, it was found her petition was brought in good faith and her claim was supported by a reasonable basis, even though her petition was ultimately found untimely).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The conduct of petitioner\u2019s attorneys also may be relevant in some circumstances. A reasonable basis is lacking, for example, when a petitioner\u2019s attorney does not properly investigate a case before filing it. <em>Silva, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 405 (sustaining a finding of no reasonable basis when a petitioner\u2019s attorney failed to perform minimal investigation and no medical evidence suggested the vaccine caused the injury). Generally, a petitioner must furnish some evidence in support of the \u201cclaim for which the petition is brought\u201d to establish the statutory requirement of reasonable basis. <em>See Woods, </em>105 Fed.Cl. at 152 (finding that the special master erred in failing to sufficiently analyze whether there was a reasonable basis when the special master\u2019s decision \u201ccited no allegations of injury or causation, no medical records, and no legal authority in determining that [petitioner\u2019s claim had a reasonable basis\u201d); <em>Turpin v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 99-564V, 2005 WL 1026714, *2 (Fed.Cl.Spec.Mstr. Feb. 10, 2005) (finding no reasonable basis when petitioner submitted only one affidavit and no other records); <em>Brown v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 99-539V, 2005 WL 1026713, *2 (Fed.Cl.Spec.Mstr. Mar. 11, 2005) (finding no reasonable basis when petitioner presented only e-mails between her and her attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The special master acts within his or her discretion when revisiting the reasonable basis inquiry if such reconsideration is warranted by changed circumstances during the proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Perreira, </em>33 F.3d at 1377; <em>McKellar, </em>101 Fed.Cl. at 303. Although a claim may have had a reasonable basis at the time of its filing, reasonableness may later come into question if new evidence becomes available or the lack of supporting evidence becomes apparent. <em>Perreira, </em>33 F.3d at 1377. \u201c[Wjhen the reasonable basis that may have been sufficient to bring the claim ceases to exist, it cannot be said that the claim is maintained in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1377 (\u201c[0]nce petitioner-appellants reviewed the expert opinion upon which their ease depended, they no longer had a reasonable basis for claiming causation-in-fact because the expert opinion was grounded in neither medical literature nor studies.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In this case, petitioner has asserted that reasonable basis is a one-time inquiry, and once it is found to exist, it cannot be lost in later proceedings of the same case. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 9-11. Petitioner\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. First, petitioner places undue reliance on the ease of <em>Commissioner, I.N.S. v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990), which held that the government\u2019s \u201csubstantial justification\u201d defense to a prevailing party fee award under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) operates as a \u201cone-time threshold.\u201d <em>Jean, </em>496 U.S. at 160, 110 S.Ct. 2316. Fee-shifting provisions in the EAJA and the Vaccine Act are \u201cfundamentally dissimilar,\u201d such that it is not helpful to analogize the EAJA\u2019s \u201csubstantially justified\u201d standard to the Vaccine Act\u2019s \u201creasonable basis\u201d standard. <em>Morse v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>93 Fed.Cl. 780, 785 (2010) (explaining distinctions between the statutory provisions); <em>see also Masias, </em>106 Fed.Cl. 700, 703 (2012) (explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>there are \u201cimportant distinctions between the Vaccine Act and EAJA\u201d). For example, EAJA awards are available to \u201cprevailing parties\u201d only. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). Also, the EAJA contains an explicit statutory eheek-and-balance framework\u2014in addition to the substantial justification defense\u2014that disallows recovery for any portion of the litigation in which the party has \u201cunduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), (1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Second, contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, permitting further inquiry into reasonableness is not an invitation to propagate litigation. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 10 (arguing same). The court does not sanction the revisiting of a claim\u2019s reasonable basis for every case-related activity; nor does the court sanction the revisiting of a claim\u2019s reasonable basis at certain pre-set stages of a proceeding. <em>See Morse, </em>93 Fed.Cl. at 786 (reversing special master\u2019s finding that a separate determination of reasonable basis is necessary for fees litigation). Rather, the court interprets the statute to permit the reexamination of a claim\u2019s reasonable basis if a notable change in circumstance should arise (such as here, when the original counsel was unable to find an expert to support causation, but substitute counsel continued with the litigation anyway). <em>See Perreira, </em>33 F.3d at 1377 (affirming the special master\u2019s decision to deny the award of attorney fees for activities after petitioner received an expert opinion that was \u201cgrounded in neither medical literature nor studies\u201d); <em>Murphy, </em>30 Fed.Cl. at 62 (finding that expert testimony not corroborated by the facts was insufficient to establish reasonable basis for a fee claim), <em>aff'd, </em>48 F.3d 1236 (Fed.Cir.1995) (table); <em>see also Stevens v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 90-221V, 1992 WL 159520, *4 (Cl.Ct.Spec.Mstr. June 9, 1992) (denying fees where doctor and lawyer ignored glaring factual shortcomings), <em>aff'd, </em>996 F.2d 1236 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The court also rejects petitioner\u2019s attempt to equate reasonable basis with an attorney\u2019s good faith or \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d in pursuing a claim. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 9, 19-20. Petitioner argues that \u201c[t]he economics and dynamics of Program practice ... requires the professional judgment of experienced attorneys____ [T]he Program would not function without the expectation that such professional evaluation will equate to a reasonable basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Section 15(e) has two distinct facets: good faith and reasonable basis. \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l). Fees and costs on an unsuccessful vaccine-injury petition may be recovered only if \u201cthe petition was brought in good faith <em>and </em>there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The statute is unambiguous that both requirements must be met before a petitioner becomes eligible for an award. Moreover, only \u201cgood faith\u201d is subjective; \u201creasonable basis\u201d is objective. <em>McKellar, </em>101 Fed.Cl. at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Further, petitioner misinterprets the special master\u2019s decision. The court agrees with respondent that, \u201c[ejontrary to petitioner\u2019s allegation, the special master clearly did not \u2018equate reasonable basis with preponderant or prima facie evidence of vaccine causation.\u2019 \u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s\u2019 Mem. 12 n. 7 (quoting Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. at 15). Rather, the special master reasoned that \u201c[b]eeause reasonable basis is an alternative way to become eligible for attorneys\u2019 fees, reasonable basis to support a claim <em>cannot be </em>based upon the same (preponderance of the evidence) standard.\u201d Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *13 (emphasis added). Instead, something less than preponderant evidence is required for reasonable basis. <em>Id. </em>The special master simply declined to define what affirmative evidence would be required to support reasonable basis. <em>See id. </em>at *18-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Lastly, petitioner complains that \u201cthe special master failed to explain what constitutes enough \u2018evidence\u2019 for a petitioner to establish reasonable basis.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 15. The special master did not err in his refusal to define specifically \u201chow much\u201d evidence, or what evidence, is required to satisfy the reasonable basis standard. As respondent succinctly explains, \u201cthe special master did not have to \u201cweigh\u2019 a quantum of evidence because petitioner produced no relevant evidence to support her causation claim.\u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Mem. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>In sum, section 300aa-15(e)(l) provides that the special master may exercise discretion to award an unsuccessful petitioner attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, but only if the petitioner filed the petition in good faith and had a reasonable basis for his or her claim. Reasonable basis is an objective standard that considers the totality of the circumstances. This standard is consistent with the underlying spirit and purpose of the Vaccine Act, and strikes the right balance between an award of fees to counsel who have represented unsuccessful claimants and the statutorily expressed congressional intent to impose some limitations on fee awards. Both the statute and ease law may contemplate the evidentiary standard set out by the special master, but neither the statute nor case law compels it. Accordingly, the court declines to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">B. The Special Master Did Not Abuse His Discretion In Denying Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The special master did not abuse his discretion in determining that petitioner was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees or costs on her unsuccessful petition for compensation. <em>See </em>Fee Dee., 2013 WL 6234660 at *18-24. Although the special master ventured too far in his attempt to impose an evidentiary test for reasonable basis under \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l), he properly exercised his discretion, in this case, to deny fees to petitioner based on the complete lack of evidentiary support for her claim and counsel\u2019s delayed due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As the special master correctly noted, petitioner \u201ceite[d] to no evidence supporting a causal connection between the flu vaccine and Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s death.\u201d Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *18. An examination of the record supports the special master\u2019s conclusion. None of her medical records reflected a causal connection; rather, her medical records detailed comorbidities and attributed Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s injuries and death to nonvaceine-related causes. In addition, neither the hospital discharge summary, nor her death certificate, mentions the flu vaccine. Further, there is no evidence in the record that any of her treating providers were willing to attribute any of her injuries to the vaccination. Lastly, although counsel consulted with three immunologists, no one was willing to opine on causation in this case. Instead, petitioner relies solely on temporal proximity and petitioner\u2019s affidavit, but these materials are not sufficient. <em>See </em>\u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1) (A special master may not award compensation \u201cbased on the claims of a petitioner alone, unsubstantiated by medical records or medical opinion.\u201d); <em>see also Cedillo v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>617 F.3d 1328, 1347-48 (Fed.Cir.2010); <em>Caves v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>100 Fed.Cl. 119, 135-37 (2011), <em>aff'd per curium without opinion, </em>463 Fed.Appx. 932 (Fed.Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">In support of her reasonable basis arguments, petitioner also points to the activities of her counsel in preparing and pursuing the claim. Contrary to the special master\u2019s finding, <em>see </em>Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *19, the court is persuaded that counsel\u2019s activities can inform the totality of the circumstances that factor into a reasonable basis analysis. The court cannot say, however, that the special master abused his discretion by not crediting counsel for their work in this case. Reasonable minds can differ on whether counsel\u2019s activities reflected sufficient, timely due diligence. <em>See </em>Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *2-3 (detailed recitation of CHC-C\u2019s work before filing petition); <em>id. </em>at *4-5 (detailed recitation of CHC-C\u2019s work after filing the petition); <em>id. </em>at *5-6 (detailed recitation of Moxley\u2019s work).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">For example, although CHC-C engaged in some effort to procure Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s medical records before filing the petition, one could construe the firm\u2019s timesheets to reflect an earnest effort only after they filed the petition. <em>See </em>CHC-C\u2019s Timesheets. In addition, there is no evidence that CHC-C engaged in any survey of medical or legal literature concerning causation, such as a review of medical studies or vaccine caselaw, until January 2008, five months after the petition was filed. <em>See </em>CHC-C Timesheets at 15. Likewise, communications with experts did not begin in earnest until July 2008, after respondent had filed its report. <em>Id. </em>at 18. While the court does not require, as a rule, that the firm engage in causation research or expert communications earlier, an earlier effort arguably was warranted in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ease given that counsel knew or should have known there was no evidence of causation in the records, no support for causation from treating providers, and ample evidence of non-vaceine-related eomorbidities. Even an earlier telephone call to one of the firm\u2019s regularly retained experts might have provided some evidence of timely due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The petition was filed on the eve of the expiration of limitations and the facts here indicate that counsel played a role in the delayed filing of the petition. Ms. Chuisano approached the firm in March 2005, but the petition was not filed until June 2007. <em>See </em>Fee Dee., 2013 WL 6234660 at *2-3. During the two year period before counsel filed the petition, counsel largely placed the burden of assembling records on Ms. Chuisano, and did not bring its expertise in procuring records to bear until sometime later. The court will not encourage delays in the filing of petitions, or delay in the exercise of other due diligence, by sanctioning a bright-line rule that finds the existence of a reasonable basis for every claim filed on the eve of the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Petitioner insists that her ease \u201chad a reasonable basis in medicine and literature\u201d that was \u201cknown to counsel and revealed to the [special] master.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 15. The court agrees with respondent, however, that \u201c[t]his assertion is specious and without any basis in the record.\u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Mem. 14. The only \u25a0 evidence petitioner offered to support causation-in-fact was a temporal proximity between the vaccination and her injury, and an affidavit detailing her subjective belief of vaccine-related injury. Counsel\u2019s own unsupported medical theory does not provide evidence of causation-in-fact; nor is it sufficient to create a reasonable basis to support a claim. Further undercutting petitioner\u2019s assertion that she had a reasonable basis for bringing her claim is the refusal of the three consulted immunologists to opine favorably about causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Petitioner contends that her \u201creaction to this vaccine\u201d is \u201cindisputable.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 17; <em>see also id. </em>at 18 (arguing that \u201cmedical records demonstrated that Ms. D\u2019Esposito became ill soon after the vaccine and that no other cause was identified for that illness\u201d). But, as a factual matter, petitioner\u2019s assertion is not only unsupported by the medical records, but is contradicted by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Petitioner presses for consistency in the decisions of the special masters and this court, Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 1, 3-4, 7-8, although such is not required as a matter of law, <em>see Hanlon v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>40 Fed.Cl. 625, 630 (1998), <em>aff'd, </em>191 F.3d 1344 (Fed.Cir.1999). Petitioner erroneously relies on the case of <em>Davis v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>105 Fed.Cl. 627, 637 (2012). Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 8. In <em>Davis, </em>the court \u201cg[ave] weight to the outcome\u201d in a similar case in which a special master had found that a claimant had established causation and was entitled to compensation. 105 Fed.Cl. at 637. However, the court also noted that \u201c[t]here is nothing inherently improper in the disparate outcomes of these two eases, of course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(explaining further that there were salient differences between the two eases).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">The special master\u2019s decision in this case finds support in the caselaw. As the special master points out, the Court of Federal Claims entered a similar decision on similar facts in <em>Silva v. Secretary of Health and Human Services. </em>Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *21 (discussing <em>Silva, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 401, <em>aff'g </em>Case No. 10-101V, 2012 WL 2890452 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. June 22, 2012)). In that case, the court affirmed the special master\u2019s decision, finding he did not abuse his discretion in denying fees to attorneys on an unsuccessful petition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Silva, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 405. As in the case at bar, Ms. Silva\u2019s attorneys filed the petition with little preliminary investigation of her claim. <em>Id. </em>at 403-04. Ms. Silva ultimately failed to offer any evidence of causation-in-fact and her case was dismissed for lack of proof. <em>Id. </em>The special master denied fees, and this court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 405. The failure to offer a medical opinion was not the sole reason for the denial of fees; rather, other factors were at play, such as counsel\u2019s delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>in reviewing records that were in counsel\u2019s possession when the petition was filed; counsel\u2019s failure to account for records that east doubt on the proposed causation theory; counsel\u2019s general lack of due diligence; and the complete lack of any evidence of causation-in-fact. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In <em>Austin v. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, </em>the special master awarded fees to CHC-C in a similar factual circumstance, but the special master acknowledged that \u201c[t]he issue of [whether a] reasonable basis [existed] to file and maintain this claim [was] a very close one.\u201d No. 10-362V, 2013 WL 659574, *15 (Fed.Cl. Spec.Mstr. Jan. 31, 2013). In that case, petitioner\u2019s counsel had a twenty-month period in which to process the potential claim before filing, but no effort was made to obtain a review by a medical expert. <em>Id. </em>at *5. However, counsel could cite to at least one statement by a medical provider to support causation and timing. <em>Id. </em>at *6. The special master reasoned that this single notation \u201csalvage[d] the reasonable basis for this case [because it] suggested] a link between [the injury] and [petitioner\u2019s] vaccination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *11. Thus, the special master \u201ceonclude[d] that there was a reasonable basis, albeit an extremely weak one, to file and maintain this claim, up to the point when a favorable expert report could not be obtained.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Although petitioner asserts, Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 7, that the events surrounding Ms. D\u2019Esposito\u2019s death are \u201calmost indistinguishable from the ... successful death-benefit claim\u201d in <em>Bragg v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 08-477V, 2012 WL 404773 (Fed. Cl.Spec.Mstr. Jan. 18, 2012), this is simply not the case. Mr. Bragg died after receipt of a flu vaccine, with a diagnosis of sepsis. <em>Bragg, </em>2012 WL 404773 at *1-2. He had been in good health before the vaccine was administered and died within days of the vaccine administration. <em>Id. </em>At least one treating physician expressed concern regarding a possible causal connection between the flu vaccine and Mr. Bragg\u2019s declining medical health. <em>Id. </em>at *3. The hospital sent a vaccine adverse event report (VAER) to the Center for Disease Control, reflecting some concern of a vaccine-related injury. <em>Id. </em>Counsel submitted numerous articles reflecting medical studies and other literature to support causation. <em>Id. </em>at *3-6. An expert opined on causation. <em>Id. </em>at *12. And, petitioner ultimately prevailed on the compensation claim. <em>Id. </em>at *30. None of these facts or circumstances are present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The court does not question CHC-C\u2019s good faith in pursuing this claim on petitioner\u2019s behalf. Moreover, the court might have sustained the original reduced fee award to CHC-C had it come before this court on review; however, it did not. The special master\u2019s initial fee decision was withdrawn, and the court does not conclude that the special master abused his discretion in determining, on reconsideration, that the press of the statute of limitations did not furnish CHC-C a reasonable basis for an award of its fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Petitioner contends that the special master had no authority to revisit the award to CHC-C. Pet\u2019r\u2019s Mem. 11. But petitioner misses the mark. The special master properly reconsidered CHC-C\u2019s fees. As he correctly explained, Vaccine Rule 10(e) provides that a withdrawn decision is \u201cvoid for all purposes and the special master must subsequently enter a superseding decision.\u201d Fee Dec., 2013 WL 6234660 at *8 (quoting Vaccine Rule 10(e)). \u201cAs a consequence of the withdrawal, it is as if the [initial fee decision] never issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, CHC-C\u2019s original request for fees and costs was still pending and ripe for review. The special master, therefore, necessarily had to issue new findings with respect to CHC-C\u2019s fees. Both petitioner and respondent were afforded an opportunity to brief CHC-C\u2019s entitlement on reconsideration, and petitioner now balks at the decision issued further to her request that the special master reconsider his earlier decision. The special master found, on the facts of this case, that CHC-C lacked a reasonable basis for bringing a claim on petitioner\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The special master also found that Mr. Moxley lacked a reasonable basis for continuing to pursue petitioner\u2019s claim after his seasoned colleagues at CHC-C had exerted multiple efforts to locate a medical opinion on causation and failed to obtain one. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>so, if Mr. Moxley had a reasonable likelihood of otherwise obtaining an expert, the court would have expected some record evidence to reflect that likelihood, such as a preliminary conference with a potential expert before he agreed to assume representation. In any event, Mr. Moxley should have pursued and exhausted his efforts to retain an expert in an expeditious manner immediately after he assumed representation in November 2009. Instead, Mr. Moxley continued the litigation for an additional one and a half years before moving on petitioner\u2019s behalf for a decision on the record in May 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Respondent has correctly observed that \u201c[a]s long as \u2018the special master has considered the relevant evidence,\u2019 \u2018drawn plausible inferences,\u2019 and stated \u2018a rational basis for the decision,\u2019 reversible error is extremely difficult to establish.\u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Mem. 9 (quoting <em>Hines v. Sec\u2019y Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>940 F.2d 1518, 1528 (Fed.Cir.1991)). Here, the special master considered relevant evidence, drew plausible inferences, and set forth a rational basis for his decision. Accordingly, the court sustains his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">IV. FEES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The Court of Federal Claims also enjoys discretion to award a petitioner\u2019s fees and costs on motion for review, even if the motion is unsuccessful. \u00a7 300aa-15(e)(l); <em>see Masias, </em>106 Fed.Cl. at 704 (\u201c[Mjembers of the Vaccine Bar should be encouraged to seek clarification of doctrine by way of appeal, even regarding the availability of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d). The court does not question counsel\u2019s good faith, but does find the motion for review wanting for reasonableness. Although the court declines to articulate a bright-line test for reasonable basis, the court does not disagree with the factors the special master considered when denying fees. The special master\u2019s decision reflects a reasoned analysis in which he properly exercised his discretion to deny fees. As such, the court does not find counsel had a reasonable basis to seek review.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The special master\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs was permissible under the Vaccine Act; accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the decision. It was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law. The Clerk of the Court shall enter judgment accordingly.
