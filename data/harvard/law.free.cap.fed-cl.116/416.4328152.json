CAMPBELL-SMITH, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file their Second Amended Complaint. Pis.\u2019 Mot., May 8, 2014, ECF No. 29. The reasons offered for the requested leave were \u201cto add the names of over 900 new plaintiffs wishing to opt in to the litigation, to delete the Back Pay Act claim asserted in the First Amended Complaint, and to add allegations about individuals who worked overtime during the period from October 1 through October 5, 2013.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Plaintiffs signaled their intent to withdraw the Back Pay Act claim in their response to defendant\u2019s pending motion to dismiss, stating therein: \u201cPlaintiffs do not oppose the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss their claims under the Back Pay Act, and ... will seek leave to file [a Second Amended Complaint] drop[ping] Count IV.\u201d <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Opp. at 4, Apr. 11, 2014, ECF 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">Athough plaintiffs do not address the Back Pay issue substantively in their response to the motion to dismiss, we infer from plaintiffs\u2019 subsequently filed request to withdraw the claim that either plaintiffs cannot support that claim or that no remedy would be available even if a violation of the Act had occurred. Defendant asserted in its motion to dismiss, <em>inter alia, </em>that because plaintiffs have been paid for the work at issue, the only potential remedy available to plaintiffs under the Back Pay Act would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>interest. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 35, Mar. 11, 2014, ECF No. 23. But the Act does not authorize the payment of interest if a payment of owed back pay occurs within thirty days of an unwarranted denial of payment. <em>Id. </em>(citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596(b)(2)(B)\u00a9; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.806(a)(2)). There is no dispute that plaintiffs in the instant case were paid approximately two weeks after their scheduled paydays. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Opp. 2-3; Def.\u2019s Mot. 4. Thus, pursuit of a Back Pay Act claim on the facts of this ease would appear futile.</p>\n<p id=\"Aro\">Defendant opposes the filing of the Second Amended Complaint because: (1) defendant prefers a dismissal with prejudice of Count IV in lieu of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendment that simply omits the claim; and (2) the Second Amended Complaint seeks to add more than 900 opt-in plaintiffs, some of whom, defendant argues, would be ineligible for inclusion in the collective action if the court were to grant defendant\u2019s pending motion to dismiss Count III, Failure to Pay FLSA-Exempt Employees Overtime. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Opp., May 27, 2014, ECF No. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Defendant contends that plaintiffs should be required to dismiss their Back Pay Act claim with prejudice so that plaintiffs \u201cwho will have had the opportunity in this proceeding to fully litigate the claim, will not have the opportunity at some time in the future to re-assert the claim in another case,\u201d creating potential inefficiencies. <em>Id. </em>at 2. As support for its argument that plaintiffs should be forced to dismiss their claim with prejudice, defendant cites to the court\u2019s observation in a recent ruling in the case of <em>Kandel v. United States, </em>No. 06-872, 2014 WL 1708444, 115 Fed.Cl. 752 (Fed.Cl. Apr. 30, 2014), that piecemeal litigation is generally disfavored. <em>See id. </em>at 757, 2014 WL 1708444 at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In <em>Kandel, </em>the court declined to rule on dispositive issues of law pertinent to only a few plaintiffs in a class action on the ground that such a limited ruling would have been inefficient. <em>Id. </em>The instant motion presents in a wholly different context. Here, plaintiffs request the <em>withdrawal </em>of a claim, instead of court action on a matter\u2014as was sought in <em>Kandel. </em>Thus, the court\u2019s discussion in <em>Kandel </em>of piecemeal litigation is inapposite in this circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">The rules of this court provide that \u201c[t]he court should freely give leave [to a party to amend its pleading] when justice so requires,\u201d RCFC 15(a)(2), and the Supreme Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">In the absence of any apparent or declared reason\u2014such as undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.\u2014the leave sought should, as the rules require, be \u2018freely given.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACu\"><em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">Of the enumerated reasons for denying leave to amend a pleading, only prejudice is alleged by the government here. Specifically, defendant contends that it might be subject to \u201cpotential prejudice in the future\u201d if plaintiffs are permitted to amend their complaint \u201cbecause it would require continued litigation of a claim that should have been resolved in this litigation.\u201d Def.\u2019s Opp. 2. The court disagrees. Plaintiffs have made no arguments in support of their Back Pay Act claim at this stage, and this litigation has progressed only to the court\u2019s consideration of a motion to dismiss. The court will not force the litigation\u2014nor the dismissal with prejudice\u2014of an issue plaintiffs wish to withdraw from the lawsuit at this early stage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">Defendant\u2019s second point of opposition to the amended pleading is that the additional opt-in plaintiffs should not be added at this time because some may turn out to be dismissed from this action if the court grants the government\u2019s motion to dismiss FLSA-exempt plaintiffs. The court has not yet ruled on the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, and defendant has not yet responded to plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify the collective action. Thus, it would be premature to ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>elude <em>potential </em>opt-in plaintiffs at this stage on the basis that they <em>might </em>not be able to continue as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">None of the concerns described by the Supreme Court in <em>Fornan </em>are present here, and defendant\u2019s arguments are unavailing. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to file their Second Amended Complaint is GRANTED. The Second Amended Complaint is deemed filed as of today.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">. Any subsequent reversal in plaintiffs' current position on the issue would be appropriately and closely scrutinized.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
