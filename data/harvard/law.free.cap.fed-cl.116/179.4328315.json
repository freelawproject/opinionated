Am. Compl. \u00b6 1. The USDA, plaintiffs allege, failed to adequately compensate them for the destruction of three breeds of colored broiler chickens and eggs that are no longer extant. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 2. Previously, this court granted in part and denied in part defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. <em>See Cebe Farms, Ind. v. United States, </em>83 Fed.Cl. 491 (2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a second ruling, the court also denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action. <em>See Cebe Farms, Inc. v. United States, </em>103 Fed.Cl. 174 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">Now before the court are defendant\u2019s two motions for summary judgment upon (1) plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action (breach of contract to pay per egg and per bird values agreed upon by USDA counsel) and (2) plaintiffs\u2019 fourth cause of action (Fifth Amendment Taking), as well as plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment upon plaintiffs\u2019 first (breach of contract to pay the appraised value as indemnity) and second causes of action. Because genuine issues of material fact remain for all three of these causes of action, the court denies the three motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">A. The Poultry Industry and Plaintiffs\u2019 Niche Market</p>\n<p id=\"b196-17\">The poultry industry is dominated by large commercial producers, and is generally divided into three separate components: broiler producers; egg producers; and breeders that provide great-grandparent, grandparent, and parent breeder stock to the broiler and egg producers. Am. Comp. \u00b6 7. Beginning in the 1950s, the broiler and egg industry within the United States \u201cintentionally bred the color out of chickens to produce the lines of white chickens and eggs typical in U.S. markets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 9. Consequently, due to a \u201cdwindling supply of colored broilers and their breeders, colored broilers demand a much higher price in the market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-18\">Cebe Farms, Inc. (\u201cCebe Farms\u201d), established by Joseph Cebe in 1981, is a small family farm located in California. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 2. Unlike large commercial producers, Cebe Farms, which consists of two breeder ranches and five broiler production ranches, vertically integrates the production of breeder stock, hatching of eggs, and production of broilers. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7. For over twenty years, Cebe Farms held a dominant position in a niche market specializing in the breeding of colored broiler chickens possessing \u201cunique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>qualities.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-13. The great-grandparent chickens Cebe Farms bred for approximately thirty years were \u201cthe only descendants of lines of colored chickens that no longer exist anywhere in the world.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">B. END in Poultry</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Poultry, like humans, are susceptible to various diseases. Velogenie Newcastle Disease, also known as END, is \u201cthe most severe form of Newcastle disease and ... the most serious disease affecting poultry in the world.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 15. Chickens infected with END develop lesions in their brains or gastrointestinal tracts. <em>Id. </em>Once END is introduced into a flock, the disease spreads by the movement of apparently uninfected chickens, contaminated objects, or other animals. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 17. The common incubation period in chickens is between two and six days, and the first clinical signs of END exhibited in laying hens are a rapid decline in egg production and a high mortality rate. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 18. Within the first day after clinical signs of END are observed, between ten and fifteen percent of a flock may die, though most infected chickens die suddenly and without any observable clinical symptoms. <em>Id. </em>Morbidity is near one hundred percent, with mortality near ninety percent. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 15. Chickens that survive two weeks after an END outbreak will generally not die, though they typically exhibit permanent neurological damage, including paralysis. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 18. And egg production will not return to normal levels. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Chickens can be protected against END by vaccination and parental antibodies. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 19. It is plaintiffs\u2019 practice to vaccinate its chickens. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, vaccination only reduces, rather than eliminates, the incidence of END in an exposed flock. <em>Id. </em>In addition, vaccination can also increase the difficulty of identifying END. <em>Id. </em>During an outbreak of END, dying chickens may be collected twice weekly for testing. <em>Id. </em>Alternatively, unvaccinated, uninfected \u201csentinel\u201d chickens may be placed in a vaccinated flock and observed for disease and death. <em>Id. </em>A tentative diagnosis of END can be made in the field based upon history, clinical signs, and lesions. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 20. However, because END is similar to other diseases, including cholera and avian influenza, a final diagnosis requires isolation and identification of the virus, itself. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">C. 2002 Outbreak of END in Southern California</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">On October 1, 2002, an outbreak of END was confirmed in backyard poultry in Los Angeles and Riverside Counties, California. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15, 22. The Secretary of Agriculture declared an \u201cextraordinary emergency\u201d on January 6, 2003, <em>id. </em>\u00b622, and the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (\u201cAPHIS\u201d) established an Inland Desert Task Force (\u201cIDTF\u201d) to respond to and eradicate the END outbreak, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 25. The USDA imposed a quarantine on Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernandino Counties; it later extended the quarantine to a total of nine California counties and portions of Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">1. The USDA Claims That Plaintiffs\u2019 Flock and Eggs Were Infected With END</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">During the END outbreak, plaintiffs\u2019 flock did not display any clinical signs of the disease, and there was no significant decline in egg production. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 24. The mortality rate in plaintiffs\u2019 flock remained below normal levels, even for an uninfected flock. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs requested prophylactic and surveillance measures, including the use of \u201csentinel\u201d chickens and testing of their great-grandparent eggs. <em>Id. </em>According to plaintiffs, them eggs \u201ccould have been safely saved without risk to the END eradication program, thereby preserving the unique breeder stock.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>\u00b647 (alleging that, regardless of whether the flock and eggs were infected with END, the eggs \u201ccould have been safely quarantined, cleaned, and hatched in the ordinary course of [plaintiffs\u2019] breeding program\u201d). The USDA, however, claimed that plaintiffs\u2019 flock was infected. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 24. Despite plaintiffs\u2019 repeated requests, the USDA never provided any evidence, such as laboratory test results, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>substantiate its claim. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, plaintiffs \u201cfully cooperated\u201d with the USDA and \u201cfully agreed with the goals of the END eradication program,\u201d making their veterinarian available to the USDA and authorizing entry by USDA officials and related personnel onto their ranches. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">2. Depopulation of Plaintiffs\u2019 Flock and Destruction of Its Eggs</p>\n<p id=\"APZ\">On March 17, 2003, plaintiffs met with USDA officials in order to develop a plan to save their breeder lines from destruction. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 25. One possible option included quarantine of plaintiffs\u2019 flock and saving the eggs from destruction. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the USDA rejected any plan to save plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cunique and irreplaceable breeds,\u201d <em>id. </em>and instead informed plaintiffs that it would dispose of their flock and eggs, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 27. The USDA indicated that it would present to plaintiffs an offer of compensation, which would constitute the agency\u2019s official appraisal of plaintiffs\u2019 property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIj\">On April 16, 2003, Dr. Jack Shere, the USDA\u2019s END Task Force Area Commander, issued an \u201cOrder to Dispose of Poultry and Eggs,\u201d which provided that plaintiffs would \u201cbe compensated the fair market value for [their] poultry and eggs in accordance with 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 8306(d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b645. The order also reflected that the APHIS <em>\u201chad appraised </em>[plaintiffs\u2019] poultry and eggs to determine their fair market value.\u201d <em>Id.-, see infra </em>Part I.D. Between April 18 and April 21, 2003, the USDA depopulated plaintiffs\u2019 flock and destroyed their eggs. Am. Compl. \u00b6 46. Although plaintiffs fully cooperated with the USDA, they maintain that the USDA\u2019s destruction of their eggs was wholly unnecessary to prevent the spread of END. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 47. Rather, \u201cthe eggs could have been safely quarantined, cleaned, and hatched in the ordinary course of Cebe\u2019s breeding program, saving the expense and time of re-engineering Cebe\u2019s three unique breeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A total of 1,364 great-grandparent and 1,732 grandparent birds, together with 105,143 eggs, were destroyed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 48. Thereafter, plaintiffs\u2019 ranch was cleaned and disinfected. <em>Id. </em>Following depopulation, plaintiffs, in order to facilitate repopulation, signed a Commercial Poultry Compliance Agreement, which contained provisions obligating the USDA to compensate them for the appraised value of their flock and eggs. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">D. Valuation of Plaintiffs\u2019 Property and Negotiations Related to Compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Prior to the depopulation of their flock and destruction of eggs, plaintiffs, on March 20, 2003, met with USDA officials to agree upon the valuation of their property. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 26. During the meeting, Dr. Ann Seitzinger, a USDA economist, proposed a valuation of $2,280,500.00 for plaintiffs\u2019 flock and eggs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The meeting concluded without the USDA extending an offer to plaintiffs based upon Dr. Seitzinger\u2019s valuation, however, because none of the USDA officials participating in the meeting had the authority to approve a settlement exceeding $1 million. <em>Id. </em>Although plaintiffs requested the documentation upon which Dr. Seitzinger relied to calculate her valuation, the USDA never responded to plaintiffs\u2019 request. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Rather than utilize Dr. Seitzinger\u2019s valuation, the USDA decided to hire a special appraiser to independently determine the value of plaintiffs\u2019 property. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 26. Bob Gray, a USDA representative, advised plaintiffs that the amount determined by the special appraiser would constitute the agency\u2019s official offer of compensation, even if the appraised amount was less than Dr. Seitzinger\u2019s valuation. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 28. Plaintiffs were informed that appraisals could yield amounts that were \u201cboth above and below valuations determined by USDA officials\u201d and, since the appraisal would constitute the USDA\u2019s official offer, plaintiffs could benefit from an appraisal that valued their property in excess of Dr. Seitzinger\u2019s valuation. <em>Id. </em>According to plaintiffs, the various USDA officials with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>whom they were negotiating represented that they had the requisite authority to bind the government. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The USDA, without any input from plaintiffs, selected Richard Udale, one of plaintiffs\u2019 direct competitors, to perform the special appraisal. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 28. Although plaintiffs initially objected to the USDA\u2019s selection, they eventually agreed to be bound by Mr. Udale\u2019s determination, \u201csubject to full disclosure and understanding of his methodology and any appeal procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b629; <em>accord id. </em>\u00b6 35. Specifically, plaintiffs requested (1) the opportunity to be present, with their counsel, during Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal, (2) an explanation of how Mr. Udale would arrive at his determination, and (3) an explanation of all postappraisal procedures. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 29. The USDA advised plaintiffs that they would receive a copy of Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal, which would represent the \u201c \u2018market value\u2019 for purposes of USDA paying compensation\u201d to plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 31. The parties, together with Mr. Udale, met on two separate occasions, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 30, and Mr. Udale proceeded with his appraisal. Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal was dated March 30, 2003. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">After Mr. Udale completed his appraisal, plaintiffs allege that the USDA \u201cattempted to renege on its agreement to pay the appraised value----\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 33; <em>accord id. </em>\u00b6 37. The USDA did not provide to plaintiffs a copy of Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 32. Instead, the USDA advised plaintiffs that Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal \u201cwas not available and that the appraised valuation would not be disclosed.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>\u00b6 36 (noting the USDA\u2019s \u201ccontinued ... refusal to provide a copy of the appraisal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">On April 2, 2003, the USDA presented to plaintiffs an offer of $2,280,500.00, an amount identical to Dr. Seitzinger\u2019s valuation. <em>Id. </em>\u00b633. Plaintiffs responded that they could neither accept nor reject the government\u2019s offer without first reviewing Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 34. They again requested a copy of Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal and asked the USDA-to honor its \u201cpromise\u201d to compensate them based upon the market value determined by Mr. Udale. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 35. Plaintiffs also reiterated their acceptance of the USDA\u2019s appraisal procedures, subject only to the verification of errors and any appeal rights. <em>Id. </em>The government never honored plaintiffs\u2019 request for a copy of the Udale appraisal; consequently, plaintiffs requested and received a copy of the appraisal directly from Mr. Udale. The Udale appraisal determined that the total market value of plaintiffs\u2019 property was $5,506,092.50.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">On April 14, 2003, the USDA presented with plaintiffs another offer, which was based upon lower unit values $196.18 per grandparent bird, $660.89 per great-grandparent bird, and a blended price of $19.06 per egg than Dr. Seitzinger\u2019s valuation. <em>Id. </em>\u00b640. The USDA represented that these unit values were \u201c\u2018based on information from various sources,\u2019 \u201d though the USDA never identified those sources. <em>Id. </em>The USDA\u2019s offer of \u201cestimated total compensation\u201d was $1,722,193.00, but the final amount would be determined later by applying the unit values set forth in the April 14, 2003 offer for the birds and eggs that were actually depopulated. <em>Id. </em>According to plaintiffs, the USDA\u2019s offer ultimately approximated $3,226,203.30. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">Plaintiffs objected to what they perceived as the USDA\u2019s \u201cattempts to walk away from and renegotiate the original agreement to pay the appraised value\u201d as determined in Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 41. They advised the USDA that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-15\">the government negotiated an offer to purchase the flock at the appraised value derived by Mr. Udale. We believe that the government must uphold [its] promise and comply with its unilateral decisions to compensate [plaintiffs] pursuant to Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal____ [Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s] letter of April 4, 2003, respectfully requested] copies of both the Udale appraisal and the Ann Seitzinger assumptions and conclusions____ [W]e feel the government has randomly re-written the rules to suit its agenda.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-19\"><em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs interpreted the USDA\u2019s offer of $1,722,193.00 as a \u201cminimum initial payment\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>and reserved their right to continue seeking full market value for their flock and eggs. <em>Id.; accord id. </em>\u00b6 42 (alleging that plaintiffs\u2019 consent to destruction of their flock and eggs by the USDA did not limit their right to pursue additional compensation). In a letter dated April 17, 2003, Rick Herndon, counsel for the USDA, acknowledged plaintiffs\u2019 reservation of rights and that plaintiffs\u2019 agreement to authorize the destruction of their flock and eggs \u201c \u2018d[id] not waive any legal recourse [they] might have to challenge USDA\u2019s determination of the fair market value of the poultry and eggs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Following the depopulation of their flock and destruction of their eggs, plaintiffs, on April 25, 2003, requested that the USDA provide them with an indemnity payment in the amount of $3,226,203.30, which plaintiffs derived using the unit values set forth in the USDA\u2019s April 14, 2003 offer. <em>Id. </em>\u00b648. Thereafter, plaintiffs executed a contract entitled \u201cCompliance Agreement Between California Exotic Disease Task Force and Commercial Poultry Producers for Expedited Indemnity Payment,\u201d which provided that the task force would, among other things, approve and submit for payment all indemnity claims arising from the destruction of materials and animals at the rate amounts set forth in Mr. Herndon\u2019s April 17, 2003 letter. <em>Id. </em>By executing this contract, plaintiffs \u201csought to receive the minimum payment agreed to by [Mr.] Herndon as quickly as possible while continuing to press for payment of the full official [appraisal].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although plaintiffs were promised a payment within a reasonable time after the depopulation concluded, the USDA did not issue any payment until June 17, 2003, at which time plaintiffs received $1,768,614.40 in compensation. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In a June 17, 2003 letter to plaintiffs, Dr. Shere explained the basis for the USDA\u2019s $1,768,614.40 payment, which plaintiffs interpreted as \u201ca post hoc \u2018rationalization\u2019 to pay a lower unit value\u201d for their eggs. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52. Dr. Shere indicated that the USDA paid the April 14, 2003 unit price of $19.06 per egg for only 24,053 great-grandparent eggs. <em>Id. </em>As for the remaining 81,090 eggs, Dr. Shere reduced the USDA\u2019s offer to a unit price of $0.85 per egg. <em>Id. </em>The USDA\u2019s payment of $1,768,614.40, Dr. Shere represented, did not constitute the agency\u2019s final offer of compensation. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 53. Plaintiffs claim that the unit price of $0.85 per egg was based upon the USDA\u2019s erroneous belief that these eggs were only suitable for hatching into meat birds when, in fact, they were great-grandparent and grandparent eggs that were fully suitable for use in plaintiffs\u2019 routine breeding program. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52. Plaintiffs also maintain that the USDA should have paid the April 14, 2003 unit price of $19.06 per egg for all of their eggs, and that Dr. Shere never explained the USDA\u2019s refusal to pay the market value set forth in Mr. Udale\u2019s appraisal. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Plaintiffs, on August 15, 2003, filed an agency appeal with Ron DeHaven, Deputy Administrator for Veterinary Services at the USDA, in which they challenged Dr. Shere\u2019s decisions not to compensate plaintiffs in accordance with Mx*. Udale\u2019s appraisal, and not to adhere to the indemnity payment terms offered by Mr. Herndon on April 17, 2003. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 54. In a December 8, 2003 response, Mr. DeHaven offered plaintiffs an additional indemnity payment in the amount of $54,502.53, which was \u201cbased on additional \u2018calculations\u2019\u201d that the USDA did not disclose. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 55. Mr. DeHaven\u2019s offer only addressed the valuation of the eggs, not plaintiffs\u2019 appeal with respect to the USDA\u2019s refusal to pay the market value determined by Mr. Udale. <em>Id. </em>In a separate letter, Mr. DeHaven noted that plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, as well as the parties\u2019 negotiations, remained ongoing. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 57. Plaintiffs ultimately accepted the additional indemnity payment of $54,502.53 \u201cas a partial additional payment, with reservation of rights to seek [additional indemnity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 56. Plaintiffs received a total of $1,823,116.93 in compensation from the USDA. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">On May 27, 2005, plaintiffs, in response to a USDA audit seeking information about outstanding claims against the agency, indicated that they had a pending claim for $1,403,086.37 based upon the April 17, 2003 \u201ccontract\u201d between them and the USDA, and a total claim of $5,506,092.50 \u201c \u2018based upon a written appraisal requested and prepared by APHIS and their appraiser, not including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>interest from the date of destruction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 58. On July 27, 2005, John Clifford, a deputy administrator for veterinary services at the APHIS, notified plaintiffs that the USDA would \u201c\u2018not provide any additional compensation to Mr. Cebe for the depopulation of his flock\u2019 \u201d and that Mr. Cebe \u201c \u2018exhausted all procedures within USDA to resolve this matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Unable to resolve their dispute with the USDA, plaintiffs filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cCourt of Federal Claims\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint asserts four causes of action against defendant, only three of which are relevant to the parties\u2019 respective motions for summary judgment: (1) First Cause of Action \u201cbreach of contract to pay the appraised value of plaintiffs\u2019 chickens and eggs as indemnity,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 61-62; (2) Second Cause of Action \u201cbreach of contract to pay per egg and per bird values agreed by the USDA,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 63-65; and (3) Fourth Cause of Action \u201cViolation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Just Compensation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 67-71. Defendant moves, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d), for summary judgment upon plaintiffs\u2019 second and fourth causes of action, and plaintiffs\u2019 cross-move for summary judgment upon their first and second causes of action. In this case, the parties present conflicting evidence that must be weighed by the court in order to resolve the salient legal issues. Consequently, as the court will explain below, genuine issues of material fact remain which preclude the court from granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">II. LEGAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"ArY\">A. Motions for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. RCFC 56(a); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). A fact is material if it \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). An issue is genuine if it \u201cmay reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. <em>Celotex Corp., 477 </em>U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548. The nonmoving party then bears the burden of showing that there are genuine issues of material fact for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548. Both parties may carry their burden by \u201cciting to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d RCFC 56(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">The court must view the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Ind. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 </em>U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). However, the court must not weigh the evidence or make findings of fact. <em>See Anderson, 477 </em>U.S. at 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (\u201c[A]t the summary judgment stage the judge\u2019s function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d); <em>Contessa Food Prods., Inc. v. Conagra, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 1370, 1376 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201cOn summary judgment, the question is not the \u2018weight\u2019 of the evidence, but instead the presence of a genuine issue of material fact ____\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Egyptian Goddess, Inc. v. Swisa, Inc., </em>543 F.3d 665 (Fed.Cir.2008) (en banc); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. United States, </em>157 F.3d 849, 854 (Fed.Cir.1998) (\u201cDue to the nature of the proceeding, courts do not make findings of fact on summary judgment.\u201d); <em>Mansfield v. United States, </em>71 Fed.Cl. 687, 693 (2006) (\u201c[T]he Court may neither make credibility determinations nor weigh the evidence and seek to determine the truth of the matter. Further, summary judgment is inappropriate if the factual record is insufficient to allow the Court to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>salient legal issues.\u201d). Entry of summary judgment is mandated against a party who fails to establish \u201can element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp., </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548. However, if neither party meets this burden on the filing of cross-motions for summary judgment, then the court must deny both motions. <em>See, e.g., Canal 66 P\u2019ship v. United States, </em>87 Fed.Cl. 722, 723 (2009); <em>Dick Pac./ GHEMM, JV v. United States, </em>87 Fed.Cl. 113, 126 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">B. Contracts With the United States</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Tucker Act confers upon the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to \u201crender judgment upon any claim against the United States founded ... upon any express or implied contract with the United States....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (2006). It does not, however, \u201ccreate any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages.\u201d <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). Instead, the right to money damages must be found in a separate source of law. <em>Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, </em>27 F.3d 1545, 1554 (Fed.Cir.1994) (en bane); <em>accord Martinez v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1295, 1302-03 (Fed.Cir.2003) (en banc). \u201c[I]n a contract case, the money-mandating requirement for Tucker Act jurisdiction normally is satisfied by the presumption that money damages are available for breach of contract, with no further inquiry being necessary.\u201d <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed.Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In order to invoke Tucker Act jurisdiction based upon an express or implied-in-fact contract, a plaintiff must allege all of the requisite elements of a contract with the United States, <em>Peninsula Grp. Capital Corp. v. United States, </em>93 Fed.Cl. 720, 731 (2010) (stating that an implied-in-fact contract \u201crequires the existence of the same elements as an express contract\u201d), which requires \u201ca mutual intent to contract including offer, acceptance, and consideration,\u201d <em>Total Med. Mgmt., Inc. v. United States, </em>104 F.3d 1314, 1319 (Fed.Cir.1997). Additionally, any \u201ccontract with the United States ... requires that the Government representative who entered or ratified the agreement had actual authority to bind the United States.\u201d <em>Trauma Serv. Grp. v. United States, </em>104 F.3d 1321, 1325 (Fed.Cir.1997); <em>accord Lion Raisins, Inc. v.

Grp., </em>104 F.3d at 1325)).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The authority to bind the United States can be implied. <em>H.F. Allen Orchards v.

Bissett-Berman Corp., </em>481 F.2d 764, 768-60 (9th Cir.1973) (government attorney possessed implicit authority to bind the government). The theory of implied actual authority is of limited application and is not intended to supplant the well established rule that only government agents possessing actual authority can enter into contracts on behalf of the United States. <em>Cal. Sand &amp; Gravel v. United States, </em>22 Cl.Ct. 19, 27 (1990). Rather, some contracting authority must be actually delegated. <em>Id. As </em>the United States Supreme Court (\u201cSupreme Court \u201d) cautioned in <em>Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, </em>332 U.S. 380, 68 S.Ct. 1, 92 L.Ed. 10 (1947): \u201c[A]nyone entering into an arrangement with the Government takes the risk of having accurately ascertained that he who purports to act for the Government stays within the bounds of his authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 68 S.Ct. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Nevertheless, the court will attribute implied actual authority where the action taken \u201cis an essential or necessary part of the employee\u2019s occupation.\u201d <em>SGS-92-X003 v.

Cath-dr/Balti Joint Venture, </em>497 F.3d 1339, 1347 (Fed.Cir.2007) (authority to bind government to contract modifications is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>implied where such conduct is assigned as an integral part of a government employee\u2019s duties). Agreements made by a government agency lacking such authority can be subsequently ratified by the proper government official if that individual has actual or constructive knowledge of the unauthorized acts. <em>Harbert/Lummus Agrifuels Projects v. United States, </em>142 F.3d 1429, 1434 (Fed.Cir.1998). In such cases, the ratifying official must possess knowledge of the material facts concerning the unauthorized facts and approve of the conduct. <em>Winter v. Cath-dr/Balti Joint Venture, </em>497 F.3d 1339, 1347 (Fed.Cir.2007). Mere awareness of unauthorized acts by the proper approving official, however, is insufficient to create ratification contract acceptance must be proved. <em>Stout Road Assocs., Inc. v. United States, </em>80 Fed.Cl. 754, 758 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">C. Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cThe chief and one of the most valuable characteristics of the bundle of rights commonly called \u2018property\u2019 is \u2018the right to sole and exclusive possession the right to <em>exclude </em>strangers, or for that matter friends, but especially the Government.\u2019\u201d <em>Mitchell Arms, Inc. v.

The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that private property shall not \u201cbe taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. This provision \u201cwas designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S.Ct. 1563, 4 L.Ed.2d 1554 (1960). The Takings Clause does not prohibit the taking of property. Rather, it proscribes a taking without just compensation. <em>Brown v. Legal Found. of Wash., </em>538 U.S. 216, 235, 123 S.Ct. 1406, 155 L.Ed.2d 376 (2003); <em>see also First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.

United States, </em>291 F.3d 1334, 1338-39 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citations omitted). Lease rights are recognized property rights that are subject to the Takings Clause. <em>See Lynch v.

United States, </em>626 F.3d 1241, 1246 (Fed.Cir.2010). As a general rule, without physical encroachment, no physical taking will lie. However, the clear line between physical and regulatory takings is not always as apparent when the government \u201ctakes\u201d private property pursuant to a statute or regulation. To aid courts in their analysis, the Federal Circuit \u201chas developed a two-step approach to takings claims.\u201d <em>Boise Cascade Corp. v. United States, </em>296 F.3d 1339, 1343 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>accord Acceptance Ins. Cos., </em>583 F.3d at 854. First, a plaintiff must identify the property interest that was allegedly taken. <em>Nw.

Second, \u201c[o]nee a property right has been established, the court must then determine whether a part or a whole of that interest has been appropriated by the government for the benefit of the public.\u201d <em>Members of Peanut Quota Holders Ass\u2019n v.

United States, </em>177 F.3d 1360, 1364 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citing <em>Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1014, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992)). Until the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 43 S.Ct. 158, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922), \u201cit was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only a \u2018direct appropriation\u2019 of property or the functional equivalent of a \u2018practical ouster of [the owner\u2019s] possession.\u2019\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1014, 112 S.Ct. 2886 (quoting <em>Transp.

A categorical taking is one in which <em>\u201call </em>economically viable use, i.e., all economic value, has been taken by the regulatory imposition.\u201d <em>Palm Beach Isles </em>Assocs. <em>v. United States, </em>231 F.3d 1354, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2000); <em>see also Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1015, 112 S.Ct. 2886 (indicating that categorical treatment is appropriate \u201cwhere regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land\u201d). Thus, \u201cwhen the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice <em>all </em>economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a taking.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1019, 112 S.Ct. 2886. A categorical taking, like a permanent physical invasion of property, is deemed a <em>per se </em>taking under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Lingle, </em>544 U.S. at 538, 125 S.Ct. 2074; <em>see also Res.

A noncategorical taking is the \u201cconsequence of a regulatory imposition that prohibits or restricts only some of the uses that would otherwise be available to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>property owner, but leaves the owner with substantial viable economic use____\u201d <em>Palm Beach Isles Assocs., </em>231 F.3d at 1357. \u201cWhere a regulation places limitations on land that fall short of eliminating all economically beneficial use, a taking nonetheless may have occurred, depending on a complex of factors____\u201d <em>Palazzolo, </em>533 U.S. at 617, 121 S.Ct. 2448 (citing <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co., </em>438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646). As Justice Brennan explained in <em>Penn Central Transportation Co., </em>the' Supreme Court had \u201cbeen unable to develop any \u2018set formula\u2019 for determining when \u2018justice and fairness\u2019 require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government,\u201d 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, and instead focused \u201clargely \u2018upon the particular circumstances [in that] ease,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v.

Nevertheless, the <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>Court extrapolated from prior decisions \u201cseveral factors that have particular significance,\u201d namely: (1) economic impact of the regulation on the plaintiff; (2) extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) character of the governmental action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646; <em>see also Lingle, </em>544 U.S. at 540, 125 S.Ct. 2074 (stating that the <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>inquiry \u201cturns in large part, albeit not exclusively, upon the magnitude of a regulation\u2019s economic impact and the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests\u201d). Such a test for regulatory takings requires a comparison of \u201cthe value that has been taken from the property with the value that remains in the property____\u201d <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n v. DeBenedictis, </em>480 U.S. 470, 497, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (1987). While the Supreme Court\u2019s regulatory takings jurisprudence \u201ccannot be characterized as unified,\u201d courts \u201caim[] to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.\u201d <em>Lingle, </em>544 U.S. at 539, 125 S.Ct. 2074.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">3.

United States, </em>39 Fed.Cl. 81, 84 (1997). In <em>Lucas, </em>the Supreme Court explained: \u201cWhere the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner\u2019s estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his title to begin with.\u201d 505 U.S. at 1027, 112 S.Ct. 2886. This approach, the <em>Lucas </em>Court indicated, \u201caccords ... with our \u2018takings\u2019 jurisprudence, which has traditionally been guided by the understandings of our citizens regarding the content of, and the State\u2019s power over, the \u2018bundle of rights\u2019 that they acquire when they obtain title to property.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">A \u201cproperty owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers[.]\u201d <em>Id.; see also Hendler v.

The <em>Lucas </em>Court rejected as inconsistent with the Takings Clause the notion that a landowner\u2019s title \u201cis somehow held subject to the \u2018implied limitation\u2019 that the State may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable use.... \u201d 505 U.S. at 1028, 112 S.Ct. 2886.

DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">A. Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Defendant argues that this court should grant summary judgment in its favor on plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action, \u201cbreach of contract to pay per egg and per bird values agreed upon by USDA counsel.\u201d In support of its motion, defendant claims that no binding agreement arose between the parties; thus, defendant could not breach something that did not exist. Specifically, defendant contends, no contract between the pai\u2019ties was created because: (1) plaintiffs and the USDA never agreed to a specific valuation for plaintiffs\u2019 flock, Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment Upon Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Cause of Action (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot. Second\u201d) at 7, and (2) the government received no consideration for its April 13, 2003 determination of fair market value of plaintiffs\u2019 flock and eggs, <em>id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Defendant maintains that any discussions between USDA personnel and plaintiffs or with plaintiffs\u2019 then-counsel, Mr. Athanasios K. Preovolos (a/k/a, Thanasi K. Preovolos), concerning the valuation of plaintiffs\u2019 flock are irrelevant because there was no written agreement between the parties \u201cthat define(s) what USDA would pay as fair market value compensation pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 8306(d)(1). Specifically, there was no offer and acceptance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Moreover, defendant argues, Mr. Preovolos\u2019s April 16, 2003, response to Rick Herndon\u2019s transmission of the USDA\u2019s April 14, 2003 final offer demonstrates that the government\u2019s \u201cpresentation\u201d was rejected. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. According to defendant, \u201cRick Herndon presented to plaintiffs an April 13, 2003 valuation of $196.18 per grandparent breeder, $660.89 per great-grandparent breeder, and $19.06 per egg [ ], but [ ] plaintiffs\u2019 counsel insisted that USDA pay $5,506,092.50.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant\u2019s Reply to Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment Upon Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Cause of Action, and Response to Plaintiffs\u2019 Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment Upon Plaintiffs\u2019 First and Second Causes of Action (\u201cDef.\u2019s Reply and Response\u201d) at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Plaintiffs dispute defendant\u2019s characterization of Mr. Preovolos\u2019s April 16 electronic message to Mr. Herndon as the rejection of an offer. Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition to Def.\u2019s Mot. Second (\u201cPis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n.\u201d) at 26. Rather, plaintiffs claim, the April 16 electronic message merely sought clarification of several matters referenced in the USDA\u2019s April 14 offer. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, plaintiffs explain, Mr. Preovolos\u2019s April 16 electronic message does not contain language specifically rejecting the USDA\u2019s April 14, 2003 communication, which plaintiffs point out is styled as the USDA\u2019s \u201cFinal Offer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26-27. Mr. Preovolos\u2019s April 16 electronic message response to Mr. Herndon provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">We have summarily reviewed the appraisal assumptions and calculations provided in your facsimile of April 14, 2003. There are several points which we would like to have clarified____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">I understand from our discussion that the birds are to be destroyed expeditiously. The goal is to destroy the birds by weeks end. While the government does not require our consent to do so, you would like our consent and our abstention from any legal opposition to their destruction. You have indicated that the appraisal by Mr. Ott, ... is the offer of the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>However, you have kindly assured me that we have this opportunity to request additional information and identify items which we believe to be in error in the model which may increase the valuation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n. Appendix (\u201cPis.\u2019 App.\u201d) at 94. Mr. Preovolous then posed seven areas of inquiry related to the USDA\u2019s valuation methodology, which was performed by Stephen L. Ott, in determining the USDA\u2019s \u201cFinal Offer.\u201d The letter concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">Finally, we would like an explanation of the procedure going forward. You have kindly explained that the government will consider the items proposed above and respond to the same with an explanation and an increase in the valuation where they deem appropriate. Following that, I understand that an order for the destruction of the birds will issue. I have confirmed for you that once the issues above are addressed and taken into consideration, we will consent to the destruction of the birds. Specifically, we will not oppose the destruction and we will voluntarily provide access to the farm and birds so they can be destroyed; an order need not issue for our cooperation. Of course, this offer is made with the explicit understanding that the offer by the government, the acceptance of that offer by my client, and the consent to the destruction of the birds does not in any way limit his right to pursue additional compensation for the flock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">You have explained to me, ... that the appraisal final compensation will be determined by the actual number of birds and eggs on the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The following day, by letter transmitted via electronic message, the USDA\u2019s counsel wrote to Mr. Preovolos:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">This letter is to confirm that your client, Mi\u2019. Cebe, agrees to comply with the USDA Order to Dispose of Poultry and Eggs and allow USDA/APHIS to enter his property ... on Friday, April 18, 2003, to seize and dispose of all poultry and eggs located on the property. This also confirms that Mr. Cebe agrees to cooperate and assist in the cleaning and disinfecting] of this property____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">This letter also is to provide Mr. Cebe with notice of USDA\u2019s determination of the fair market value of the chicken and eggs---- I previously provided to you in writing, on April 14, 2003, USDA\u2019s determination of the fair market value of the grandparent breeders, great grandparent breeders and eggs. It also provided, in detail, the sources and methods used to make those determinations____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-15\">I understand that Mr. Cebe may disagree with USDA\u2019s determination of the fair market value of his poultry and eggs. USDA recognizes that Mr. Cebe\u2019s agreement to ... disposal ... does not waive any legal recourse to challenge USDA\u2019s determination of the fair market value of the poultry and eggs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 102. Thus, plaintiffs argue that there was no explicit rejection of defendant\u2019s offer; plaintiffs simply wanted to reserve their rights. Moreover, plaintiffs rely on the deposition testimony of Mr. Shere, who made clear at his January 2008 deposition that as the USDA\u2019s Associate Regional Director and Area Commander of the END Taskforce, he was aware that the USDA would never depopulate \u201cwithout an agreement in place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177. Indeed, during his January 2008 deposition, Mr. Shere testified that, \u201cIn my 18 years of working with [Veterinary Services], we\u2019ve never taken any we never depopulated any farm without an agreement being in place first.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, plaintiffs raise genuine issues of material fact regarding whether a binding agreement was, in fact, in place prior to depopulation of plaintiffs\u2019 flock and eggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\">Defendant\u2019s second argument to support its entitlement to summary judgment upon plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action is that the contract alleged by plaintiffs fails for lack of consideration. According to defendant, plaintiffs cannot prove \u201ca detriment incurred by the promisee, or a benefit received by the promisor at the request of the promisor.\u201d <em>Am. Red Ball Int\u2019l, Inc. v. United States, </em>79 Fed.Cl. 474, 478 (2007). Plaintiffs dispute the factual underpinnings of defendant\u2019s argument that it received no benefit from plaintiffs because defendant\u2019s factual recitation fails to account for plaintiffs\u2019 forbear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>anee, a fact, which if proved at trial, can supply the detriment/promise element that defendant claims is missing. Plaintiffs assert that rather than seek a retraining order against the USDA, they consented to and did not obstruct the USDA\u2019s destruction of their flock and eggs. In addition to cooperating with the USDA in its depopulation activities, plaintiffs contend that they also cooperated with the cleanup and disinfection of their property. According to plaintiffs, their restraint from hindering, and cooperation with, the USDA constitutes the consideration element necessary for their contract claim. Although defendant attempts to counter plaintiffs\u2019 contention by arguing that their counsel\u2019s April 16, 2003 letter to the USDA does not refer to clean-up and disinfection, but only to depopulation of the flock, plaintiffs\u2019 consent to depopulation activity and their agreement to forbear from seeking a restraining order could, if proved at trial, constitute consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Finally, given the competing evidence presented by both parties, the court will not apply the parole rule to bar facts surrounding plaintiffs\u2019 willingness to forego litigation in exchange for receiving appropriate compensation for the destruction of their flock and eggs, even though they are not x\u2019eflected in the USDA\u2019s written communication of Api'il 14 or 17, 2003. The parties\u2019 conflicting evidence regax\u2019ding whether there was consideration raises a genuine issue of material fact that must be tried. The court must, therefox\u2019e, hear the testimony of the pai\u2019ties\u2019 x\u2019espective witnesses in order to detex-mine their ex\u2019edibility, weigh the evidence adduced, and then make findings of fact. Thus, the pi\u2019esence of genuine issues of material fact x\u2019equix-e the court to deny defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment upon plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment on their First and Second Causes of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to summaxy judgment on their first cause of action, namely, \u201cbreach of contract to pay the appx-aised value as indemnity\u201d and their second cause of action, discussed <em>infra </em>at III. A. As a preliminary matter, the coui\u2019t finds for the reasons explained above, that genuine issues of material fact are raised concerning plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their second cause of action is similarly denied. Consequently, this portion of the court\u2019s decision will addi\u2019ess plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In order to piwe their claim for \u201cbi'each of contract to pay the appraised value as indemnity\u201d against the United States, plaintiffs must demonstrate that four elements ai\u2019e satisfied: \u201c(1) mutuality of intent to conti\u2019aet; (2) consideration; (3) unambiguous offer and acceptance; and (4) actual authority on the part of the government\u2019s representative to bind the government.\u201d <em>Flexfab, L.L.C. v. United States, </em>424 F.2d 1254, 1265 (Fed.Cir.2005). Hei\u2019e, plaintiffs contend that the uniqueness of their flock, coupled with defendant\u2019s inexperience in valuating rare breeds of birds, caused defendant\u2019s initial offer of compensation to plaintiffs to be considerably below market value. For that reason, plaintiffs explain, the initial offer of compensation was immediately rejected. Ultimately, because the parties could not agree as to an amount to properly compensate plaintiffs for the destruction of their flock and eggs, defendant x\u2019etained an independent appraiser to detex\u2019mine their value. Although defendant selected one of plaintiffs\u2019 competitors, Mr. Richard Udale, plaintiffs agx\u2019eed to be bound by the Udale appx-aisal so long as no Cebe ti\u2019ade secret was x\u2019evealed, plaintiffs x-eeeived a copy of the appi\u2019aisal for review, and they eonfii\u2019med the calculations made in the appx\u2019aisal. In the event of ex\u2019roneous calculations, plaintiffs retained the light to challenge any mathematical errors in the Udale appi\u2019aisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Plaintiffs support their version of the facts by relying on the December 15, 2008 affidavit and December 3, 2010 declaration of plaintiff Joe Cebe. Specifically, in his December 15, 2008 affidavit, Mr. Cebe asserts that Bob Gx\u2019ay of the USDA advised Mr. Cebe and his attorney \u201cthat the best way to resolve the disagx\u2019eement over valuation was to hire an independent appraiser and that the valuation dexived by their appraisal would become the \u2018official appraisal.\u2019 \u201d Pis.\u2019 App. at 230. Sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>sequent to his conversation with Mr. Gray, Mr. Cebe was contacted by David Vogt, Operations Chief of the USDA. <em>Id. </em>During that conversation, Mr. Vogt told Mr. Cebe, that Richard Udale of Arkansas was \u201cthe best person that USDA could find to appraise [plaintiffs\u2019] flock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Cebe expressed his concern that Mr. Udale, a competitor of Mr. Cebe would have access to proprietary information. <em>Id. </em>at 231. It was agreed that USDA representatives, not Mr. Udale, would be permitted into Mr. Cebe\u2019s chicken houses. According to paragi-aph 26 of Mr. Cebe\u2019s affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">Mr. Vogt assured me that my two primary concerns (i.e. that Udale give an honest and fair appraisal and that trade secrets would not be disclosed) would be met. Mr. Vogt told me that the government needed this third-party appraisal so they could \u201cjustify to the taxpayers paying me whatever was determined to be the fair market price\u201d, as determined by an independent appraiser. We then agreed that the Udale appraisal would become the \u201cofficial appraisal\u201d and that both Cebe Farms and the government would be bound by the Udale appraisal, regardless of the outcome____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Fully supporting plaintiff Cebe\u2019s factual recitation of events is the affidavit of his then-counsel, Mr. Preovolos. In his April 13, 2009<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> affidavit, Mr. Preovolos explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">6. Initially we were hesitant to agree upon the hiring of an independent appraiser, particularly since the appraiser USDA hired was Richard Udale [ ], a direct competitor. However, we were assured by USDA representatives, including David F. Yogt, that Udale would be fair and that both Plaintiffs and USDA would both be bound by the special appraiser\u2019s valuation, whether or not it was higher or lower that USDA\u2019s initial evaluations. Based upon such representations and assurances, Plaintiffs agreed to allow the Udale appraisal to become the official [appraisal] which both side would be bound by-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">7. As part of this agreement ..., plaintiffs agreed that [they] would forgo [their] rights to seek a restraining order to prevent the depopulation,____ The Udale report was to be given to us so that we could make sure that the amount Plaintiffis] w[ere] paid was the same amount as the Udale appraisal. Lastly, as part of this arrangement, Plaintiffs agreed to comply with USDA\u2019s post depopulation clean up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeZ\"><em>Id. </em>at 247-48. Moreover, plaintiffs also rely on a typewritten note made by Mr. Vogt, wherein he confirmed his understanding of the offer he made to plaintiff Cebe in order to resolve the parties\u2019 impasse regarding valuation. Mr. Vogt\u2019s note recites that because of the unique nature of plaintiffs\u2019 flock, the \u201cbest available person to appraise [plaintiffs\u2019] birds\u201d was Mr. Udale. <em>Id. </em>at 45. This factual recitation is confirmed by the contemporaneous written note made by Mr. Vogt in which he also explained to plaintiff Cebe that \u201cour primary concern was that we had to be able to justify the price of the birds to the tax payers [sic].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based upon evidence presented by plaintiffs, both parties agreed that the Udale appraisal would be the \u201cofficial\u201d appraisal, regardless of the dollar amount. In addition and as explained above, plaintiffs rely on the deposition testimony of several USDA employees that an agreement had been reached between the parties. For example, they rely on the testimony of Jack Shere that the USDA \u201cwould not have proceeded [with the depopulation of plaintiffs\u2019 flock and eggs] without that agreement or understanding of that agreement. Pits\u2019.App. at 205. Mr. Shere also testified at his deposition that he was the individual on behalf of the USDA who had reached an agreement with plaintiff Cebe and that the agreement was reached \u201cjust before depopulation occurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">His deposition testimony notwithstanding, in paragraph four of his declaration, Mr. Shere explains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-13\">4. In March 2003, USDA employees David Vogt and Dr. Craig Nettles informed me that the [sic] Mr. Cebe and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>USDA could not agree upon an appraisal of Mr. Cebe\u2019s and Cebe Farm\u2019s chickens and eggs and suggested that USDA seek a third-party appraisal of the chickens and eggs. No one told me that USDA representatives had informed Mr. Cebe or Cebe Farms that USDA would pay the results of a third-party appraisal regardless of those l\u2019esults. Moreover, I did not agree to any such arrangement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><em>Id. </em>App. at 60. Thus, it is clear that genuine issues of material fact concerning contract terms and the authority to bind the government abound and must be reserved for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Finally, defendant argues that plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment because they failed to demonstrate that they contracted with a government representative who had actual authority to bind the government. Thus, defendant contends, plaintiffs\u2019 contract claim must fail. As discussed above, it is true that plaintiffs must prove that the USDA official or representative upon whom they relied had the actual, not merely apparent, authority to bind the United States, or that the agreement was ratified by the appropriate government official. Plaintiffs have, however, presented evidence to the court that shows that individuals within the USDA believed an agreement existed. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 App. 205 (Shere) (\u201c... we would not have proceeded without that agreement or understanding of that agreement.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 263 (testimony from Robert Gray stating that if depopulation occurred some type of agreement must have been in place); (Mr. Preovolos\u2019s April 13, 2009 affidavit \u201cwe were assured by USDA representatives, including ... David F. Yogt, [sic] that Udale would be fair and that both Plaintiffs and USDA would both be bound by the special appraiser\u2019s valuation\u201d). Thus, plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment because of the conflicting testimony regarding whether the USDA representative with whom they dealt possessed the authority necessary to bind the government, or whether a ratifying official later approved the parties\u2019 alleged agreement. Rather, the issue concerning defendant\u2019s representative\u2019s authority to bind the government raises genuine issues of material fact that must be reserved for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">C. Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Defendant requests summary judgment in its favor on plaintiffs\u2019 fourth cause of action, which seeks compensation pursuant to the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution for the destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 chickens and eggs. Am. Compl. \u00b6 67-71. According to defendant, plaintiffs are not entitled to compensation \u201cbecause USDA depopulated plaintiffs\u2019 poultry flock, pursuant to its police power, after tissue samples from the flock tested positive for [END].\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. Sum. Judg. Fourth Cause of Action (Def.\u2019s Mot. Fourth\u201d) at 4. In effect, defendant asserts that when acting pursuant to its police powers, it does not owe any compensation pursuant to the Takings Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Plaintiffs challenge the factual predicate of defendant\u2019s argument. Specifically, plaintiff Joe Cebe explains in his December 3, 2010 declaration that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">3. The Shere Declaration describes the procedures purportedly utilized by____ USDA which resulted in USDA declaring that Cebe Farms chickens were infected with END. The Shere Declaration states that \u201cwhen lesions compatible with END were found on birds located on plaintiffs\u2019] premises and tissue samples were sent to the [California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System (\u201cCAHFS\u201d) ] laboratory for testing\u201d (Shere Declaration paragraph 5) and that on or about March 12, 2003 [Mr. Shere] received, via fax, test results which revealed the END virus was isolated from three (3) out of four (4) samples taken from plaintiffs\u2019] poultry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-12\">4. Plaintiffs] question[ ] the accuracy, reliability and integrity of USDA\u2019s testing for a variety of reasons more fully set forth herein. Serious questions exist concerning the chain of custody of the chickens tested, in addition to the accuracy of CAHFS\u2019 reporting. There are serious questions concerning the security of the samples taken and whether or not the birds referenced in the CAHFS\u2019 March 12, 2003 lab report even originated from Cebe Farms []. In addition to the single report that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>submitted in support of [its] motion, there are numerous other inconsistencies and errors contained in other CAHFS reports exchanged by defendant] in discovery. These inconsistencies and errors contained in other CAHFS reports as well as the single report relied upon by defendant ] in support of [its] motion for summary judgment suggest[] a pattern of unreliable testing and reporting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Pis\u2019 Resp. &amp; Opp\u2019n. Def.\u2019s Mot. Fourth Appendix at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Plaintiff Joe Cebe offers what appears to be sound reasoning for questioning the integrity of the CAHFS report(s). In his 2010 declaration, he explains that \u201ccolored broiler was the only type of chicken[] that was farmed\u201d by the plaintiffs and that the color the those chickens was red, not brown. <em>Id. </em>If the CAHFS report does describes brown colored, not red colored, chickens then the report does not pertain to Cebe chickens. Thus, plaintiffs raise yet another genuine issue of material fact for trial, namely whether the Cebe flock was healthy and not infected with END?</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Finally, even though plaintiffs have received some monies from defendant to compensate them for their losses, that fact does not resolve the issue of whether a taking has occurred. Assuming plaintiffs can establish that their flock was healthy, the question then becomes whether a taking without just compensation occurred. As this court previously explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">\u201cA determination of whether a taking compensable under the Fifth Amendment has occurred is a question of law based on factual underpinnings.\u201d <em>Rose Acre Farms, Inc., </em>373 F.3d at 1183 (citing <em>Alves v. United States, </em>133 F.3d 1454, 1456 (Fed.Cir.1998)). Thus, the \u201cfact-intensive nature of just compensation jurisprudence ... argues against precipitous grants of summary judgment,\u201d <em>Yuba Goldfields, Inc. v. United States, </em>723 F.2d 884, 887 (Fed.Cir.1983); accord <em>Moden v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1335, 1346 (Fed.Cir.2005) (recognizing the \u201cfact-intensive nature of takings cases\u201d), or, in this ease, judgment on the pleadings, <em>see </em>5C Wright &amp; Miller, supra, \u00a7 1369 (noting similarities between motions for judgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment). With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 fourth cause of action, it is clear that the parties dispute whether the flock and eggs were, in fact, diseased. Athough defendant is correct that, in takings jurisprudence, a plaintiff must concede the validity of the government action that forms the basis for a takings claim, <em>Fla. Rock Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>791 F.2d 893, 898-99 (Fed.Cir.1986), it does not logically follow that plaintiffs here must concede the correctness of defendant\u2019s assertion that the flock was diseased in order to maintain a constitutional takings theory____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">If, in fact, the flock and eggs were healthy, then the destruction of that property, even though based upon flawed findings, would nevertheless be legal. Under such a scenario, just compensation pursuant to the Fifth Amendment would be required. Defendant cannot circumvent this bedrock constitutional provision by resorting to the circular logic that by conceding the legality of the government\u2019s action in order to maintain a takings claim, plaintiffs must also concede that the government was correct in all of its determinations, including whether the chickens and eggs were diseased and the appropriate amount of compensation. To accept such a proposition would destroy the constitutional cheek on the government\u2019s exercise of power over private property rights. Thus, the court denies defendant\u2019s motion regarding plaintiffs\u2019 fourth cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-12\"><em>Cebe Farms, Ind. v. United States, </em>83 Fed. Cl. 491, 496-97 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">The allegations set forth in the amended complaint\u2019s fourth cause of action and the evidence presented by plaintiffs to counter defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment raise genuine issues of material fact concerning: (1) whether plaintiffs\u2019 flock was healthy, and (2) whether the USDA\u2019s payment, pursuant to regulation for the destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 flock and eggs, properly compensated plaintiffs for their loss. Because plaintiffs claim that their flock was healthy and should not have been destroyed, and that they did not receive adequate compensation, it is clear that genuine issues of material fact exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>pertaining to whether a taking has occurred and, if so, the amount of compensation owed to plaintiffs. Because these questions turn on conflicting testimony and documentary evidence presented by the parties that must be weighed at trial, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment upon plaintiffs\u2019 fourth cause of action is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the court denies defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action and fourth ease of action. The court further denies plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment on their first and second causes of action. The parties shall confer to discuss future proceedings and then by no later than Friday, June 27, 2014, file a status report setting forth their proposed schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-12\">.
