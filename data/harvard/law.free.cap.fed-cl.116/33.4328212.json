Plaintiff also alleges \u201cthat Congress has authorized the [Copyright] Office through the Library of Congress,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] to provide means for permissive registration of <em>any </em>exclusive copyright.\u201d (emphasis in original). Further, plaintiff requests the court to \u201c[r]emand the Plaintiffs request for registration of his exclusive rights to the [Copyright] Office, with proper instruction to the Office, ordering the Office to develop and implement the rules and fees for such permissive registration as required by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">According to Mr. Driessen, Vibme, LLC (Vibme)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> petitioned the Copyright Office and requested the Copyright Office commence rulemaking to establish a new system of registration using the \u201cCircle Section\u201d registration mark, which would address \u201cconsumer ... ownership rights in first-sales of online digital media.\u201d The petition for rulemaking requested that the Copyright Office \u201cclearly establish that consumers have ownership rights in first-sales of online digital media,\u201d and, \u201cif it is determined that ownership rights for cloud media storage are mechanical or compulsory, then pursuant to its existing authority under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 408, establish procedures for a preferred service provider to file an application for supplementary registration on behalf of consumers----\u201d The petition for rulemaking also outlined the reasons plaintiff suggested for creating a new system of registration, including \u201cconsumer demand for digital ownership\u2014at least as it is marketed at present\u2014is beginning to disappear.\u201d The petition for rulemaking stated \u201c[i]t seems difficult to even understand the industry im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>petuous [sic] behind these perceived efforts to hide ownership from the consumer.\u201d The petition for rulemaking also argued that, \u201c[t]he personal media collection (as a concept) could actually assist in creating better bandwidth optimization.\u201d The petition for rulemaking describes the potential consequences of not granting his petition, stating, \u201cconsumers feel they are left with no choice but to seek to satisfy that demand outside of industry channels.\u201d The petition for rulemaking warned, \u201c[i]f, however, we allow the fears and prejudices of industry content producers to dictate our path, the personal media collection will disappear as physical media sources become obsolete____\u201d The petition for rulemaking further warned that \u201cattempts to deprive citizens of ownership have had grave, even violent consequences.\u201d Vibme then submitted a second petition to the Copyright Office titled \u201cPETITION FOR WAIVER OR SUSPENSION OF RULES (OR CONSOLIDATION MOTION IN THE ALTERNATIVE) RE: DOCKET 2011-07.\u201d (emphasis and capitalization in original). As explained by the Copyright Office, in a letter to Maguente A. Driessen, Vibme \u201crequested that the Copyright Office consolidate the rulemaking with [the] office\u2019s rulemaking pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1)(C),\u201d or, in the alternative, that the office \u201csuspend the section 1201 rulemaking until the conclusion of the rulemaking\u201d requested in Vibme\u2019s prior petition. In the same letter to Maguente A. Driessen, the Copyright Office denied the petitions for rulemaking. Subsequently, in a third petition, Vibme requested reconsideration of its proposals and a final notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A final decision by the Copyright Office denying the two petitions, as well as the request for reconsideration, was set forth in a subsequent letter to Mr. Driessen. As the Copyright Office noted in that final decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">Under the copyright law, the exclusive rights in copyrighted works are set forth in sections 106 and 106A of the copyright law. Limitations to those exclusive rights are set forth in sections 107 through 122 of the copyright law. The first sale doctrine, which permits the owner of physical copies to transfer possession of the copy, is set out in section 109 of the copyright law. Section 109 clarifies that the first sale right is a limitation on the exclusive right of distribution. The first sale doctrine does not limit the exclusive right of reproduction. As the Office stated in its Section 104 Report to Congress, a report mandated by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the first sale doctrine is inapplicable when the disposition of a copy or phonorecord of a work implicates the reproduction right, as is the case when a copy or phonorecord of a work is transmitted over the Internet. <em>See, http://www. copyright, gov/reports/studies/dmca/dmca^study. html. </em>Thus, from the perspective of the Copyright Office, a fundamental premise in your rulemaking request is flawed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">Nowhere in section 109 is the Copyright Office authorized to establish a registration system for ownership rights in the first-sale of online digital media. Moreover, as explained in the Section 104 Report to Congress, because the transfer of a copy or phonorecord online implicates the reproduction right, the first sale doctrine is generally inapplicable. <em>See, http://www. copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/dmcastudy.html.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">In absence of express authorization from Congress, the Copyright Office finds no discretion to consider the matters advanced in your petitions. This decision constitutes final agency action on your requests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Thereafter, Mr. Driessen filed an application to register his \u201cmaterial objects\u201d with the Copyright Office. In his complaint plaintiff indicates that he \u201crequested that the [Copyright] Office would grant the registration of exclusive first sale distribution rights,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>with the fair use time-shifting, space-shifting, and place-shifting rights, joined with the transmitting for the private home viewing right from an authorized copy of ... material objects.\u201d Plaintiff requested the Copyright Office to protect the following \u201cmedia material objects:\u201d \u201cThe Dark Side of the Moon (music album CD)\u2014quantity 2,\u201d \u201cShort Circuit (motion picture DVD)\u2014quantity 2,\u201d and \u201cThe Outlaw Josey Wales (motion picture Bluray)\u2014quantity 2.\u201d Plaintiff claimed that his company\u2019s patented technology helps make these specific copies <em>\u201cfully distinguishable from each other and from any other such authorized copy of the work, of which it is known that there are </em>millions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (emphasis in original). According to plaintiff, he \u201crequested that the [Copyright] Office would determine procedures, policies, and fees for such registration, but was ignored,\u201d and, subsequently, was \u201cfinally denied a request for rulemaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">After filing his various petitions and applications at the Copyright Office, plaintiff filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims. Defendant responded with a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Specifically, defendant claims that this court does not have jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs request for non-monetary requested relief, which is not a claim based on to a money mandating statute. Defendant also argues that plaintiffs claims should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Plaintiff filed his complaint in this court <em>pro se. </em>When determining whether a complaint filed by a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff is sufficient to invoke review by a court, <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs are generally entitled to liberal construction of their pleadings. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (requiring that allegations contained in a <em>pro se </em>complaint be held to \u201cless stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>405 U.S. 948, 92 S.Ct. 963, 30 L.Ed.2d 819 (1972); <em>see also Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007); <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 9-10, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980); <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>429 U.S. 1066, 97 S.Ct. 798, 50 L.Ed.2d 785 (1977). Defendant argues, citing <em>Holtz v. Rockefeller &amp; Co., Inc., </em>258 F.3d 62, 82 n. 4 (2d Cir.2001), that plaintiff, who is an attorney, should not be allowed the more lenient <em>pro se </em>status which is typically accorded to a non-attorney, <em>pro se </em>plaintiff. The court notes that plaintiff, although not a member of this court\u2019s bar, is a member of the Utah bar.6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court agrees that a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff who is also a licensed attorney should not be accorded the extra protections allowed to one who is not trained in the law, especially in this case because, according to the information on the law firm website, Mr. Driessen \u201chas become a recognized expert in the field of intellectual property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">It is well established that \u201c\u2018subject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves a court\u2019s power to hear a ease, can never be forfeited or waived.\u2019\u201d <em>Arbaugh v.

Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)). \u201c[Federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.\u201d <em>Henderson ex rel.

The above-captioned case is not a copyright infringement action brought by the owner of a valid copyright. Instead, plaintiffs complaint alleges that the Copyright Office refused to register his exclusive rights. Mr. Driessen seeks a declaratory judgment and asks the court for four types of relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">a. Declare Plaintiff is a lawful purchaser and owner of content media; and that as a lawful purchaser and owner of a content media material object, Plaintiff has <em>exclusive </em>rights to lawful enjoyment, including displaying, viewing, and transmission of the same for home viewing, within the bounds of copyright law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">b. Declare that there is no physical or ethereal length of cord which too long which [sic] could prohibit such lawful enjoyment, as mentioned above, within any distance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">c. Declare that Congress has authorized the Office through the Library of Congress, to provide means for permissive registration of <em>any </em>exclusive copyright; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">d. Remand the Plaintiffs request for registration of his exclusive rights to the Office, with proper instruction to the Office, ordering the Office to develop and implement the rules and fees for such permissive registration as required by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Plaintiff has not based his claims on a provision of law over which this court has jurisdiction. Plaintiffs alleged basis for his claims is Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution, which vests general legislative powers in Congress. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiff also relies on Title 17 of the United States Code, which, plaintiff alleges, the Copyright Office can use to support the ralemaking he requested. Plaintiff asserts that \u201c[t]he Copyright Office has been given sufficient direction from Congress through Title 17 ... for providing registration of exclusive viewing and transmission rights____\u201d Plaintiff contends that Congress legislated Title 17 through its Article I authority to mandate the Copyright Office\u2019s rulemaking. Although the complaint does not reference a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>section of Title 17, plaintiff attaches Vibme\u2019s first petition to the Copyright Office for his proposed new type of registration, which claims that there is \u201ca new and pressing need for the [Copyright] Office to reconsider the legitimate registration of specific ownership for consumers who purchase existing first sales rights under \u00a7 109 of the United States Copyright Code (Title 17 of the United States Code).\u201d The court notes, however, that the first-sale doctrine, as reflected in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 (2006), does not provide a purchaser, such as the plaintiff with an exclusive right, but instead applies to the copyright owner. <em>See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>133 S.Ct. at 1354-56. Therefore, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 does not apply to plaintiff. Additionally, the Copyright Office has the discretion to reject petitions, which it did when rejecting Vibme\u2019s petition for rulemaking, and those decisions are not reviewable in this court. <em>See Gavlord, v. United States, </em>678 F.3d at 1340; <em>Walton v. United States, </em>551 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Defendant notes that \u201c[n]owhere in plaintiffs Complaint does he allege that any copyright owner in the digital media that he has sought to register has ever threatened him with suit for copyright infringement in relation to his use of the media that alleges [sic] he has lawfully purchased.\u201d Moreover, as discussed above, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(b), the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction only in eases of copyright infringement against the United States. <em>See Gaylord v. United States, </em>678 F.3d at 1340. In this case, plaintiff does not allege, and does not have the ability to allege, infringement because he is not the copyright owner. Rather, plaintiff merely claims to have \u201cfirst sale distribution rights, with the fair use time-shifting, space-shifting, and place-shifting rights, joined with the transmitting for private home viewing rights from an authorized copy.\u201d Since copyright ownership, and infringement by the United States, are threshold issues for jurisdiction in copyright actions in this court, this court does not have jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Plaintiff also asserts that the Copyright Office violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It is well established, however, that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not a money-mandating provision which establishes jurisdiction in this court. <em>See LeBlanc v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed.Cir.1995) (A claim under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not sufficient for jurisdiction in the United States Court of Federal Claims because it does not \u201cmandate payment of money by the government.\u201d (citing <em>Carruth v. United States, </em>224 Ct.Cl. 422, 445 (1980))); <em>Potter v. United States, </em>108 Fed.Cl. 544, 548 (2013) (finding that \u201cthis Court lacks jurisdiction over violations under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments ... because they do not mandate payment of money by the government.\u201d) (internal citations omitted) (modifications in original); <em>Warren v. United States, </em>106 Fed.Cl. 507, 511 (2012) (holding that, since the \u201cFourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection\u201d is not money mandating, \u201c[accordingly, the court lacks jurisdiction over these claims.\u201d); <em>Pleasant-Bey v.

United States, </em>369 F.3d at 1301. The United States Court of Federal Claims does not have jurisdiction to grant the general equitable relief requested by plaintiff under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, to force the Copyright Office to act on his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">The language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction ... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.

Plaintiff states that the Copyright Office \u201cdid not merely deny an application for copyright registration\u2014it denied Plaintiff the very right to file an application for registration of an exclusive right. Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded that digital ownership is real and plausibly an exclusive right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">The Tucker Act allows waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity in cases when claims against the United States are founded on an express or implied contract with the United States, when the plaintiff seeks a refund from a prior payment made to the government, or when the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>is based on federal constitutional, statutory, or regulatory law mandating compensation by the federal government for damages sustained. <em>See United States v. Navajo Nation, </em>556 U.S. at 289-90, 129 S.Ct. 1547. However, \u201c[n]ot every claim invoking the Constitution, a federal statute, or a regulation is cognizable under the Tucker Act.

Both the statutory basis and the monetary nature of the claim are threshold issues when considering whether the Tucker Act confers jurisdiction upon this court. Although the plaintiffs new contract claim was not asserted in the complaint, and plaintiff has not requested monetary damages, even if the court were to consider the contract claim, subject matter jurisdiction is not established because plaintiff had neither an express nor an implied contract with the government. \u201cAn agreement implied in fact is \u2018founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hercules, Inc. v.

The elements of an implied-in-fact contract are the same as those required for an express contract: (1) mutuality of intent; (2) lack of ambiguity in offer and acceptance; (3) consideration; and (4) actual authority to bind the government. <em>See Hanlin v.

Plaintiff is ready, willing, and able to pay the required fee once the Office will supply the procedure for paying the fee for such supplemental registration as requested.\u201d (internal citations and footnote omitted). Using plaintiffs terminology, however, there never was an offer from the Copyright Office to register plaintiffs purported \u201cexclusive right.\u201d As already noted above, it is not possible for plaintiffs purported \u201cexclusive right\u201d to be registered as a copyright in the Copyright Office and plaintiff was never granted a copyright by the Copyright Office. Plaintiff, therefore, does not have such an \u201cexclusive right\u201d for which he can seek protection in this court, or any other court, and no contractual right could have come into existence or was breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss also alleges that plaintiffs complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim, because plaintiffs claims are legally unsupported with no possible remedy. As the court already has found that this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs claims, the court only briefly addresses defendant\u2019s failure to state a claim argument. A motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6) (2013) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted \u201c \u2018is appropriate when the facts asserted by the claimant do not under the law entitle him [or her] to a l\u2019emedy.\u2019\u201d <em>Murdock v.

Allain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 283, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986)); <em>Cary v. United States, </em>552 F.3d at 1376 (citing <em>Gould, Inc. v. United States, </em>935 F.2d 1271, 1274 (Fed.Cir.1991)); <em>Anaheim Gardens v. United States, </em>444 F.3d 1309, 1315 (Fed.Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied </em>(Fed.Cir.2006); <em>Boyle v.

If a defendant or the court challenges jurisdiction or a plaintiffs claim for relief, however, the plaintiff cannot rely merely on allegations in the complaint, but must instead bring forth relevant, competent proof to establish jurisdiction. <em>See McNutt v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp. of Ind., </em>298 U.S. 178, 189, 56 S.Ct. 780, 80 L.Ed. 1135 (1936); <em>see also Reynolds v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>846 F.2d 746, 747 (Fed.Cir.1988). Therefore, although the court must assume that the undisputed facts alleged in the complaint are true for the purposes of the motion to dismiss and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the facts alleged in the complaint must be plausible and not merely naked assertions devoid of a factual basis. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937; <em>see also McZeal v. Sprint Nextel Corp., </em>501 F.3d at 1363 n. 9 (mere allegations of law and conclusions of fact are insufficient to support a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Plaintiff asserts that he has \u201cexclusive rights\u201d because he \u201cowns media material objects in the form of discs, tapes, and records legally and lawfully purchased.\u201d The Copyright Act, at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (2006), however, only confers protection to the author of such works, stating \u201c[e]opyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in <em>original works of authorship </em>fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device,\u201d (emphasis added). The Copyright Act at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 further clarifies that \u201c[c]opyright in a work protected under this title vests initially in the author or authors of the work.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 (2006). Indeed, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 202 explicitly states the following about ownership of material objects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">Ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied. Transfer of ownership of any material object, including the copy or phonoreeord in which the work is first fixed, does not of itself convey any rights in the copyrighted work embodied in the object; nor, in the absence of an agreement, does transfer of ownership of a copyright or of any exclusive rights under a copyright convey property rights in any material object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 202 (2006). Mr. Driessen, therefore, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the rights plaintiff alleges were violated do not exist. In fact, Vibme\u2019s first petition itself is evidence that plaintiff knew and understood that there was no protectable right, as Vibme requested the Copyright Office perform rulemaking to expand the \u201cexclusive rights.\u201d Even considering the allegations in plaintiffs complaint as trae for the purposes of the motion to dismiss, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff, the court finds that plaintiff has failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">For the reasons stated above, the court GRANTS defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs complaint is DISMISSED. The Clerk of the Court shall enter JUDGMENT consistent with this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-4\">.
