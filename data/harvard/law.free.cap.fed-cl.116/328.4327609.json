In issuing the pertinent solicitation, DHS sought proposals by offerors responding in one of two different tracks, small business and unrestricted. DHS anticipated making multiple awards of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (\u201cID/IQ\u201d) contracts for each track. The procurement was subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (\u201cFAR\u201d), 48 C.F.R. Part 15. This case focuses on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>small business track. Business Integra submitted a timely offer under that track but was not awarded a contract because it had omitted some pricing information. It filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (\u201cGAO\u201d) and, after GAO denied its protest, brought suit in this court. Now pending before the court is Business Integra\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mot.\u201d), ECP No. 18, as well as the government\u2019s Cross-Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record (\u201cDef.\u2019s Cross-Mot.\u201d), ECF No. 19. Business Integra contends that its omission of certain pricing information was <em>de minimis </em>and should have been waived or corrected by the government. The government contends that rejection of Business Integra\u2019s proposal was within DHS\u2019s discretion because the missing pricing information was material to evaluation of Business Integra\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">FACTS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">A. The Solicitation</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On November 1, 2010, DHS, acting through the Information Technology Acquisition Center within its Office of Procurement Operations, issued request for proposal no. HSHQDC-1 l-R-10001 for the \u201cEnterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions II (EAGLE II) program.\u201d AR 1-6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The EAGLE II solicitation sought IT solutions for a full range of the agency\u2019s needs over a five-year base period with a two-year option period, as an enhancement of the original EAGLE program. AR 1-13, -21. DHS anticipated awarding multiple ID/IQ contracts, where awardees would bid on future task orders to provide services. <em>See </em>AR 1-13, -38. Besides the two tracks, DHS specified three functional categories of particular services sought: Service Delivery (FC1), Program Support (FC2), and Verification and Validation (FC3). AR l-l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Of particular interest is Functional Category 1, which sought \u201ca full range of services and products in support of developing, implementing, and maintaining technology to support the DHS mission and business functions across the entire lifecycle of a program.\u201d AR 1-22. For proposals in FC1, the small business track was divided into four groups, \u201c8(a),\u201d \u201cHUB Zone,\u201d \u201cSDVOSB,\u201d and \u201cMl SB,\u201d depending on the classification of the business. AR 1-1. The 8(a) group was designated for businesses certified as 8(a) by the Small Business Administration or falling within specified codes of the North American Industry Classification System. AR 1-104. Proposals under the FC1, 8(a) group were evaluated against other offerors within that track and group, separately and distinctly from the other groups within the small business track. AR 1-116 to -17.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">The solicitation explained that the government would award contracts to proposals representing the best value, <em>i.e., </em>those which, in the government\u2019s estimation, will \u201cprovide[] the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.\u201d AR 1-116 (quoting the definition of \u201cbest value\u201d found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>in FAR \u00a7 2.101). Each proposal would be evaluated on six factors, five of which were non-price factors. AR 1-117 to -18. In descending order of importance, the factors were corporate experience, past performance, program management, staffing, small business participation approach (unrestricted track only), and price. <em>Id. </em>Combined, the non-price factors were \u201csignificantly more important than price.\u201d AR 1-118. DHS stated that price proposals would be evaluated for accuracy, completeness, and reasonableness, but not assigned a rating. AR 1-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">DHS required that offerors provide rates for all 36 labor categories for the base and option years. <em>See </em>AR 1-120, -128 to -33. DHS emphasized that failure to provide complete pricing information would render a proposal ineligible for an award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\n<em>Note: Failure to offer ceiling rates for all labor categories and all contract periods will result in offer ineligibility. This means that the omission of a rate for just a single category will result in a material non-conformity in the proposed junctional category.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">AR 1-120 (all emphasis in original). Elsewhere in the solicitation, in the section providing instructions to offerors for cost and price proposal information, the agency mandated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">[e]aeh [o]fferor shall provide a completed Attachment L-l, <em>Pricing Templates, </em>including all of the information described below. The [o]fferor shall propose fully burdened ceiling labor rates for <em>ALL </em>labor categories inclusive of all contract periods. The fully-burdened labor rates include all direct labor and indirect costs applicable to that direct labor ... and profit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">AR 1-112 (emphasis in original). This instruction was repeated in an amendment issued on January 18, 2011, in response to vendors\u2019 questions. <em>See </em>AR 4-244, -250. There, the agency confirmed that \u201call offerors should bid all labor categories\u201d and that \u201cofferors that do not bid all categories will not be in compliance with the [solicitation].\u201d AR 4-250, ref. no. 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">To encourage uniformity in proposals, the agency provided spreadsheets for offerors to use in submitting labor rates with their bids. AR 1-112 to -13. The agency supplied separate spreadsheets to be completed based on where the work would be performed, namely, government sites or contractor sites. AR 1-113. For each spreadsheet, rows represented labor categories and columns represented years of the contract. <em>See </em>AR 2-173 to -82. DHS included \u201cevaluation hours,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>estimated annual hours, for each labor category. <em>Id. </em>Each year (\u201cYR1,\u201d \u201cYR2,\u201d etc.) had a column for the labor rates per hour (\u201cPricing\u201d) and a column for total cost (\u201cTotal Value\u201d). A default value of $0.00 was set for cells under the \u201cTotal Value\u201d column for each year, and the pricing columns were blank. <em>See id.; see also </em>Def.\u2019s Cross-Mot. at 6. When offerors placed their labor rates in the \u201cPricing\u201d columns, the \u201cTotal Value\u201d columns would automatically calculate the total price based on the provided hours. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Cross-Mot. at 6. If no \u201cPricing\u201d value was specified, the \u201cTotal Value\u201d for that year would remain $0.00. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. to Def.\u2019s [Cross-]Mot. for Judgment upon the Administrative Record (\u201cPl.\u2019s Resp.\u201d) at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">B. Business Integra\u2019s Proposal</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">In response to the EAGLE II solicitation, Business Integra timely filed a proposal under the FC1, 8(a) group of the small business track. AR 7-777. In its proposal, Business Integra took no exceptions or deviations from the solicitation, AR 7-770, and stated that it \u201cproposes ... labor rates for all government-required labor categories and for all contract periods,\u201d AR 7-771. Business Integra elaborated on its labor rates by noting that they increased \u201cat about 2.0% per year over the life of the contract,\u201d and it included a chart to illustrate this rate of increase in labor rates. AR 7-774. On the labor-rate spreadsheets provided by DHS, Business Integra listed its pricing for the various positions, as required by DHS. <em>See </em>AR 7-781 to -81.10. Although Business Integra stated that it had completed rates for all labor categories and all contract periods, it failed to fill in rates for the Level I Applications Systems Analyst, Secret or below, Government Site position (\u201cLevel I Systems Analyst\u201d) for Year 5, Option Period Year 1, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Option Period Year 2. AR 7-781; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 6-7; Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Business Integra apparently intended to provide rates for these years but inadvertently omitted the relevant information. Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 4-5. The company filled out each spreadsheet by providing a dollar value in each row for the first year\u2019s labor rate, under the column \u201cYR 1 Pricing,\u201d and used the formula it created and imposed on the spreadsheet to calculate the rates for subsequent years. Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 3. The formula in the spreadsheet for Level I System Analyst in Year 5 Pricing was accidently deleted. <em>Id. </em>at 4. The resulting blank for Year 5 meant that the years following Year 5, <em>i.e., </em>Option Year 1 and Option Year 2, reflected $0.00 for both the Pricing and Total Value columns because the rates for those years depended on the previous year\u2019s rate per Business Integra\u2019s formula. <em>Id. </em>at 5; <em>see also </em>AR 7-781.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">C. DHS\u2019s Action</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Due to the missing information regarding pricing, Business Integra was eliminated from consideration for an award. During a debriefing, DHS explained its evaluation of Business Integra\u2019s proposal. <em>See </em>AR 13-890 to -95 (DHS\u2019s debriefing with Business Integra (Nov. 22, 2013)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The government rated Business Integra highly for all of the non-price factors. AR 13-891 (\u201c[Business Integra\u2019s] proposal clearly demonstrated the capability to deliver exceptional performance related to the services.\u201d). While the price factor was \u201cdetermined to be reasonable and realistic ..., \u201cit was inaccurate and [incomplete.\u201d AR 13-893. Business Integra \u201cleft three labor rates blank under the [Level I Systems Analyst].\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>DHS found that \u201cthis omission results in material non-conformity with the requirements of the [solicitation]\u201d and resulted in the \u201cpricing proposal [being] deemed non-compliant with the instructions of the solicitation and therefore ineligible for award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>DHS had received 160 proposals in the FC1, 8(a) group, and awarded 15 contracts from that array. <em>See </em>AR 11-853,16-890.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">D. Protests</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">On November 26, 2010, Business Integra filed a protest with GAO. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 1. After GAO denied the protest, <em>see Business Integra, Inc., </em>B-107273.22, 2014 CPD \u00b688, 2014 WL 930281 (Comp.Gen. Feb. 27, 2014), the company filed a complaint in this court, along with a motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>Id. </em>Proceedings on the merits were accelerated, and in accord with RCFC 65(a)(2), consideration of the motion for a preliminary injunction was consolidated with the hearing on the cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">The court\u2019s jurisdiction over bid protests is derived from the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, as amended by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, Pub.L. No. 104-320, \u00a7 12, 110 Stat. 3870, 3784 (Oct. 19, 1996) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)). The Tucker Act permits \u201can interested party [to] objeet[ ] to a solicitation by a [f]ederal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract\u201d by bringing suit in this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1). An \u201cinterested party\u201d is an actual or prospective bidder who possesses a direct economic interest affected by the award or failure to award the contract. <em>Rex Service Corp. v. United States, </em>448 F.3d 1305, 1307 (Fed.Cir.2006). A showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the bidder had a substantial chance of winning the contract is generally sufficient to establish a direct economic interest. <em>Orion Tech., Inc. v. United States, </em>704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed.Cir.2013) (citing <em>Rex Serv., </em>448 F.3d at 1308). More specifically, \u201c \u2018a bidder has standing to challenge the lawfulness of discretionary acts that operate to exclude the bidder from consideration in eases where the bidder\u2019s ratings are such that had the government acted lawfully the bidder would have had a substantial chance of winning the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>ST Net, Inc. v. United States, </em>112 Fed.Cl. 99, 107 (2013) (quoting <em>G4S Tech. CW LLC v. United States, </em>109 Fed.Cl. 708, 719 (2013)). The parties agree that Business Integra is an \u201cinterested party\u201d because it was an offeror whose direct economic interest was adversely affected by the government\u2019s decision to eliminate it from consideration for an award of a contract. <em>See BCPeabody Constr. Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>112 Fed.Cl. 502, 508 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">STANDARDS FOR DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The court\u2019s proceedings in a bid protest are governed by the standards set forth in Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4) (\u201cIn any action under this subsection, the courts shall review the agency\u2019s decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5.\u201d). Under the specified standard, a reviewing court may set aside an agency\u2019s decision if the agency\u2019s actions were \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), overruled on other grounds by <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2001). To reach such a finding and set aside an award, the court must conclude that the agency\u2019s \u201cdecision lacked a rational basis\u201d or \u201cthe procurement procedure involved a violation of regulation or procedure.\u201d <em>Centech Grp., Inc. v. United States, </em>554 F.3d 1029, 1037 (Fed.Cir.2009) (citing <em>Impresa Construzioni, </em>238 F.3d at 1332). The court cannot \u201csubstitute its [own] judgment for that of the agency ... and it must uphold an agency\u2019s decision against a challenge if the contracting agency provided a coherent and reasonable explanation of its exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>BCPeabody, </em>112 Fed.Cl. at 508 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Keeton Corrs., Inc. v. United States, </em>59 Fed. Cl. 753, 755 (2004), and <em>Axiom Res. Mgmt., Inc. v. United States, </em>564 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Business Integra\u2019s protest centers around the solicitation\u2019s provisions regarding labor rates and its own omission and errors regarding three such rates in its proposal. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 1. Specifically, Business Integra argues that the government\u2019s determination that the proposal\u2019s omissions rendered the entire proposal unacceptable was arbitrary and capricious because (1) the single omission of the Year 5 pricing for a Level I Systems Analyst was <em>de minimis </em>and therefore not material, and (2) the government should have recognized the errors and either waived the errors, corrected the errors itself, or allowed Business Integra to correct the errors. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 28, 34; Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 7-17. Thus, the court must consider: (1) whether the solicitation\u2019s provision that proposals include all labor rates is a material term, and (2) what the government\u2019s obligations were in addressing the errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">A. Materiality</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">To be acceptable, a proposal in a procurement \u201cmust represent an offer to provide the exact thing called for in the request for proposals, so that acceptance of the proposal will bind the contractor in accordance with the material terms and conditions of the request for proposals.\u201d <em>Centech Grp., </em>554 F.3d at 1037. Correspondingly, \u201ca proposal that fails to conform to the material terms and conditions of the solicitation should be considered unacceptable.\u201d <em>E.W. Bliss Co. v. United States, 77 </em>F.3d 445, 448 (Fed.Cir.1996) (internal citations and quotations omitted). While the parties agree that the government has the right to reject an offer that has a material defect, they disagree whether the labor-rate provision in the EAGLE II <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>solicitation constituted a material technical requirement or a <em>de minimis </em>administrative directive. <em>See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 22:7-13, 34:22 to 35:15 (Apr. 25, 2014).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Business Integra argues that its errors were <em>de minimis </em>because the omitted prices would have amounted to only 0.0041% of the projected Total Value of its proposal. Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 8. In support of this assertion, the company relies on GAO\u2019s decision in <em>W.B. Constr. &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>B405818, 405818.2, 2012 CPD \u00b6 17, 2012 WL 32162 (Comp.Gen. Jan. 4, 2012). Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 8-9. In <em>W.B. Construction, </em>GAO determined that failure to bid on a line item was a minor informality because the price of that item was <em>de minimis </em>compared to the total cost of the contract, amounting to less than 0.07%, and would not have affected the competitive standing of the bidders. <em>W.B. Constr., </em>2012 WL 32162, at *4. In the circumstances, GAO determined that the federal agency\u2019s rejection of the bid as nonresponsive was unreasonable; the agency should have waived the omission as a minor informality. <em>Id., </em>at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Business Integra\u2019s reliance on <em>W.B. Construction </em>is unavailing because the regulatory regime applicable to that procurement differs significantly from that established for EAGLE II. The solicitation in <em>W.B. Construction </em>was a sealed-bid procurement, regulated under FAR Part 14. <em>W.B. Constr., </em>2012 WL 32162, at *1 n. 1, *4. Contrastingly, the EAGLE II solicitation was a procurement by negotiation subject to FAR Part 15. <em>See </em>AR 1-116. \u201c[A] fairly sharp divide remains between the clarification rules in Part 15 for negotiated procurements and the mandatory nature of comparable provisions in Part 14 for sealed bidding.\u201d <em>BCPeabody, </em>112 Fed.Cl. at 510.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under FAR Part 14, the government is <em>required </em>to seek clarification for minor informalities and irregularities, but under FAR Part 15, the government is <em>permitted </em>but not required to allow offerors to resolve minor or clerical errors. <em>Id. </em>at 509-10 (comparing the effect of FAR \u00a7 14.407-1 to that of FAR \u00a7 15.306(a)(2)). Specifically, FAR Part 14 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">[a] defect or variation is immaterial when the effect on price, quantity, quality, or delivery is negligible when contrasted with the total cost or scope of the supplies or services being acquired. The contracting officer either shall give the bidder an opportunity to cure any deficiency resulting from a minor informality or irregularity in a bid or waive the deficiency, whichever is to the advantage of the [government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">FAR \u00a7 14.405. The GAO relied on this provision when it determined that the omission in <em>W.B. Construction </em>was <em>de minimis </em>and that the agency was unreasonable in rejecting the bid. <em>See W.B. Constr., </em>2012 WL 32162, at *4.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In contrast, FAR \u00a7 15.306 provides that \u201cofferors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals <em>(e.g., </em>the relevance of an offeror\u2019s past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors.\u201d FAR \u00a7 15.306(a)(2). Price is not mentioned in Section 15.306, and FAR Part 15 provides no definition for \u201cminor or eleri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>cal errors.\u201d <em>See BCPeabody, </em>112 Fed.Cl. at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In this instance, \u201csince the [proposal] at hand was the result of a negotiated procurement process, its administration is governed only by the provisions in [FAR Part] 15.\u201d <em>C.W. Over &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>54 Fed.Cl. 514, 521 n. 10 (2002) (disapproving of application of FAR Part 14 to a negotiated procurement). While this court has found an abuse of discretion in bid protests governed by FAR Part 15 where the government failed to inquire into copying errors that affected the procuring authority\u2019s evaluation of past performance, <em>see BCPeabody, </em>112 Fed.Cl. at 513, an omission of pricing information has not been found to be a minor or clerical error in these types of procurements, <em>see ST Net, </em>112 Fed.Cl. at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">This court\u2019s decision in ST <em>Net </em>provides a helpful analog to the ease at hand. In <em>ST Net, </em>the protester omitted pricing information in its proposal for a negotiated procurement, which, if included, would have increased the total price by about 7%. 112 Fed.Cl. at 110. The court determined that the error was material, not because of the dollar amount of the error, but because the price information was important to the government\u2019s evaluation of the offer. <em>See ST Net, </em>112 Fed.Cl. at 109-10 (\u201cImportantly, the price, brand/model information, and discount rates were not simply estimating tools, but were actually binding on the offerors.\u201d). Business Integra attempts to distinguish <em>ST Net </em>by arguing that its error, amounting to 0.0041 % of its projected Total Value, is far smaller than the pricing error in <em>ST Net. </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 12:21 to 13:7. This argument is at odds with the EAGLE II solicitation, which explicitly states that omission of even a single labor rate, no matter its significance, \u201cwill result in a material non-conformity.\u201d AR 1-120. Business Integra asserts that this provision, along with other similar provisions in the solicitation, \u201ccannot convert an [otherwise] immaterial requirement into a material one.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 27.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To support this argument, Business Integra cites a number of cases from this court and from GAO. <em>See id. </em>Business Integra focuses on two cases in particular: <em>Linc Gov\u2019t Servs., LLC v. United States, </em>108 Fed.Cl. 473 (2012), and <em>DMS All-Star Joint Venture v. United States, </em>90 Fed.Cl. 653 (2010). Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 13. Athough these cases addressed negotiated procurements under FAR Part 15, the courts relied exclusively on Part 14 as a legal ground for determining that missing pricing breakdown information was immaterial. <em>See Linc Gov\u2019t Servs., </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 503 (citing FAR \u00a7 14.405 in determining a blank in pricing was a <em>de minimis </em>error); <em>DMS All-Star, </em>90 Fed.Cl. at 666 n. 16 (citing as its only authority <em>Am. Spare Parts, Inc., </em>B224745, 87-1 CPD \u00b6 4, 1987 WL 101290 (Comp.Gen. Jan. 2,1987), which involved a Part 14 sealed bidding). Nonetheless, both eases are inapposite here not because they looked to FAR Part 14 but instead because the errors being addressed were in formatting rather than in setting out pricing information. In <em>Line Government Senices, </em>the court allowed the government to exercise its discretion to accept blanks in place of zeros in a bid. 108 Fed.Cl. at 503-04 (\u201c[The] oversight did not deprive the [agency] of any information.\u201d). Similarly, the government in <em>DMS All-Star </em>could allow a proposal that did not format information already in the proposal into a specific section. <em>DMS All-Star, </em>90 Fed.Cl. at 666 n.16 (\u201c[A]ll material information required by the solicitation [was] present.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Thus, even if <em>Line Government Services </em>and <em>DMS Alb-Star </em>had applied FAR Part 15, the result in those eases would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The other cases Business Integra cites are also inapposite. Some are sealed biddings under FAR Part 14 and therefore are not pertinent to the EAGLE II solicitation. <em>See Tri-Services, Inc., </em>B-245698, 92-1 CPD \u00b6 75, 1992 WL 15020 (Comp.Gen. Jan. 15, 1992); <em>Am. Spare Parts, </em>1987 WL 101290. Others are distinguishable because the proposals at issue contained omissions unrelated to price or included total price but omitted unit pricing. <em>See AABCO, Inc. v. United States, </em>3 Cl.Ct. 109, 117-19 (1983) (finding that omission of leading zeros in rate information was immaterial when determining the value of the rate); <em>Challenger Piping, Inc., </em>B-221855, 86-1 CPD \u00b6 3 85, 65 Comp. Gen. 505, 1986 WL 60613, at *l-*2 (Apr. 18, 1986) (determining that failure to provide a list of manufacturers and suppliers was not material when compliance was otherwise indicated); <em>Andrea Radio Corp., </em>B-198240, 80-2 CPD \u00b6 165, 1980 WL 16036, at * 1 (Comp.Gen. Sept. 2, 1980) (finding that pricing per line item was unnecessary when a bid included a total price); <em>Fisher Berkeley Corp., </em>B-196432, B-196432.2, 80-1 CPD \u00b6 26,1980 WL 17309 (Comp.Gen. Jan. 9, 1980) (finding that failure to include a testing certification from a specific laboratory on equipment was immaterial); <em>Mountain Eng\u2019g &amp; Constr. &amp; Weisz &amp; Sons, </em>B-194472, 79-2 CPD \u00b6 153, 1979 WL 12114, at <em>*2 </em>(Comp.Gen. Aug. 27, 1979) (determining that unit pricing was unnecessary when it could be derived from provided total price and quantity of items); <em>Space Age Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>B176425, 1972 WL 6219, at *3-*4 (Comp.Gen. Oct. 18, 1972) (same).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> None of the errors in the cited eases resulted in a change in pricing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In addition, Business Integra fails to account for the fact that the EAGLE II solicitation is for an ID/IQ procurement. The government asserts that the requirement to commit to ceiling rates in all labor categories for all years is important because the solieitation\u2019s purpose includes providing a basis for robust competition within a pool of small businesses that are ready and willing to provide all the FC1 IT services DHS requires. This purpose would be frustrated if the labor-rates provision were to be considered immaterial. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 17. Without this requirement, DHS would have been unable properly to select a manageable pool of businesses that would be able to compete for future task orders. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 17; Hr\u2019g Tr. 17:12 to 18:5. In addition, pricing on individual elements of the proposal might become important in selecting awardees to perform particular task orders under the ID/IQ framework. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 17 (\u201c[I]t is safe to say the requirement that contractors commit in advance to ceiling rates for the entire ID/IQ contract in all labor categories is a substantial concession that will have a significant impact on future task order pricing.\u201d). The court accepts that the requirement to provide pricing for all labor categories for all years was a material term of the solicitation. While Business Integra\u2019s argument regarding the inability of an agency to declare an immaterial term to be a material one is valid in an abstract sense, it has not been supported on an as-applied basis in challenging DHS\u2019s exercise of discretion in this particular set of circumstances. Rather, the warning in the EAGLE II solicitation that pricing omissions would be considered a material defect was reasonably applied by DHS\u2019s procurement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">B. DHS\u2019s Discretion In Addressing Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Business Integra\u2019s second asserted ground for error is closely related to its first argument. In asserting that DHS abused its discretion, Business Integra contends that the agency should have recognized the error and waived or corrected it. PL\u2019s Resp. at 15-17. Business Integra states that the pattern of its labor-rate increases, stepping upward at <em>2% </em>per year, was specified in its proposal, and that the government should have corrected the errors by calculating and then inserting the missing rates. PL\u2019s Resp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>at 15-16. The government resists any suggestion that DHS could have made the calculations necessary to provide the missing information or that it had an obligation to exercise its discretion to take such a step, emphasizing the high number of proposals submitted. Hr\u2019g Tr. 26:5 to 28:15.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In support, Business Integra cites <em>Military Wa</em>ste <em>Management, Inc., </em>B-228862, 87-2 CPD \u00b6 424, 1987 WL 103070 (Comp.Gen. Oct. 30, 1987). <em>See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 10:11 to 11:16. The GAO determined in <em>Military Waste </em>that the contracting officer could, under FAR \u00a7 14.406-2(a) (1986), recodified as FAR \u00a7 14.407-2, seek an explanation from a bidder regarding an evident clerical error. 1987 WL 103070, at *1. Because the bidder confused a \u201cper housing unit\u201d term with a monthly price, it was \u201csimple mathematics\u201d to correct the problem. <em>Id. </em>Business Integra argues that the mathematics required to calculate a 2% increase is simpler than converting per-housing-unit to per-month. Hr\u2019g Tr. 11:12-16. Even if this statement were true, it does not legally require an agency to conduct such calculations. <em>Military Waste </em>stated that, under the former provisions of FAR Part 14, an agency acted reasonably when seeking clarification in a sealed bidding procurement; it does not support a correlated reverse proposition\u2014that failing to seek clarification in negotiated procurements is unreasonable. In addition, unlike Business Integra\u2019s omission, the mistake in <em>Military Waste </em>did not change the final proposed cost. Instead, the government is permitted to reject an offer that is materially incomplete without needing to conduct an investigation into the omission and to calculate the gap-filling information. <em>Accord ST Net, </em>112 Fed.Cl. at 110 (citing <em>IBM Corp v. United States, </em>101 Fed.Cl. 746, 758-59 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Aternatively, Business Integra argues that the government should have waived the defect or allowed Business Integra to correct the defect. Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 17-20; Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 34-36. Business Integra relies on FAR \u00a7 52.215-1, incorporated into the EAGLE II solicitation, AR 1-100, for the proposition that the government had the authority to waive the defect or allow corrections, <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 11. FAR \u00a7 52.215-1 states that \u201c[t]he [gjovernment may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.215-l(fj(3). The next paragraph of this subsection of the FAR provides that \u201c[t]he [gjovernment intends to evaluate proposals and award [contracts] without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR [\u00a7 ] 15.306(a)).\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.215-l(f)(4). As noted earlier, the cited provision of the FAR permits clarifications as \u201climited exchanges\u201d to provide offerors \u201cthe opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals ... or to resolve minor or clerical errors.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(a)(1), (2). Because Business Integra\u2019s error was material, the government was under no obligation to waive the error or allow Business Integra to correct the error. <em>See ST Net, </em>112 Fed.Cl. at 110. As the government points out, requiring the agency to waive Business Integra\u2019s error could result in disparate treatment among offerors and thus constitute an abuse of discretion. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19; <em>see also Hunt Bldg. Co. v. United States, </em>61 Fed.Cl. 243, 273 (2004) (\u201c[An] agency\u2019s failure to follow the terms of its own [solicitation and selection of an offer- or based upon different requirements than those imposed upon the only other offeror are quintessential examples of conduct which lacks a rational basis.\u201d), <em>modified on other grounds </em>by <em>Hunt Bldg. Co. v. United States, </em>63 Fed.Cl. 141 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">For the reasons stated, Business Integra\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record is DENIED, and the government\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record is GRANTED.

Although knowledgeable commentators have criticized the divergent approaches taken by FAR Part 14 and FAR Part 15 in this regard, <em>see BCPeabody, </em>112 Fed.Cl. at 511 n.9 (quoting Ralph C. Nash, 27 No. 9 Nash &amp; Cibinic Rep., <em>Correcting Mistakes: Negotiation v.

The government argues that Business Integra has waived the right to challenge the fairness of the DHS\u2019s evaluation of its offer by not filing its protest before proposals were due. Def.'s Mot. at 11-14 (citing <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, </em>492 F.3d 1308, 1315 (Fed.Cir.2007)). In the government\u2019s view, the solicitation stated that labor rates were material terms and Business Integra\u2019s protest directly challenges that aspect of the solicitation. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 13. Although the government is correct that challenges to the solicitation\u2019s terms themselves should be brought as a pre-award bid protest, Business Integra is not arguing that the EAGLE II solicitation itself is flawed.
