(\u201cCCS\u201d) challenges the Army and Air Force Exchange Service\u2019s (\u201cAAFES\u201d) award of a contract for internet and telecommunications services to Resolute Partners, LLC (\u201cResolute\u201d). AAFES, a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States Government (\u201cNAFI\u201d), provides merchandise and services to active duty and reserve military members and their families. AAFES\u2019 earnings support the Army\u2019s Family Morale Welfare and Recreation Command <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>(\u201cFMWRC\u201d) programs. CCS brings this bid protest invoking this Court\u2019s general contract jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a), claiming that Defendant breached its implied duty to fairly consider CCS\u2019 proposal. This matter comes before this Court on CCS\u2019 motion for summary judgment and Defendant\u2019s and Intervenor\u2019s motions for judgment on the Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d). CCS seeks its proposal preparation costs and an order remanding the procurement to AAFES.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">CCS presents five grounds of protest. First, CCS claims that the Army Recreation Machine Program (\u201cARMP\u201d), a subsidiary of FMWRC, acted as subcontractor to the awardee, Resolute, in violation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2492a. This statute prohibits Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d) entities from offering or providing telecommunications services to consumers for a fee and from competing for contracts to provide such services. Second, CCS claims that FMWRC\u2019s role in the procurement created an organizational conflict of interest (\u201cOCI\u201d) because FMWRC shaped the solicitation and participated in the source selection process, and because FMWRC\u2019s subsidiary, ARMP, competed in the procurement as a subcontractor to the awardee. Third, CCS argues that the technical and price evaluations conducted by AAFES were unreasonable and contrary to the terms of the solicitation. Fourth, CCS contends that AAFES improperly determined that Resolute was a responsible contractor. Lastly, CCS claims that an appearance of impropriety tainted the competition because Resolute was indebted to AAFES and AAFES considered this debt in making the award decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The Court denies the protest. CCS waived its statutory violation and OCI claims because it knew the grounds for those claims prior to award but failed to timely raise them. The evaluation of proposals and responsibility determination were reasonable, and CCS failed to demonstrate that either an OCI or an appearance of impropriety tainted the competitive process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\"><em>Findings of </em>Fact<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">\n<em>Information Services Provided on Air Force and Army Installations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">There are two kinds of information services provided on Air Force and Army installations, Personal Information Services and FMWRC Information Services. <em>See </em>AR 4, 119, 366. Personal Information Services include \u201cfor-fee\u201d internet, telephone, and television services paid for by civilian or military personnel for personal use\u2014for \u201cunofficial services\u201d\u2014in barracks, housing, and internet cafes. AR 334, 362, 427-28, 1776.' Prior to December 2009, both AAFES and FMWRC provided \u201cfor-fee\u201d internet services on Army and Air Force installations. AR 119, 366. AAFES provided the services through contracts with internet service providers (\u201cISp\u201d), while FMWRC utilized a government-owned infrastructure operated by ARMP to provide the services. AR 2, 119, 366. This protest arose after FMWRC and AAFES executed an agreement to transfer management, sale, and operation of the for-fee internet services to AAFES. AR 4-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">The FMWRC Information Services supported \u201cofficial\u201d business functions where users do not pay a fee, and ARMP provided these free services using the FMWRC Information Services network, a telecommunications system of government-owned utilities and infrastructure\u2014the same infrastructure ARMP used to provide Personal Information Services. AR 1, 2, 334, 427; <em>see </em>AR 119,366, 8768, 8808, 8822, 8836.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">\n<em>Legislative and Regulatory Changes Regarding the Provision of Personal Information Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">On February 23, 2009, AAFES and FMWRC entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) to \u201cestablish a noncompetitive partnership between AAFES and FMWRC to provide common levels of personal information services based on best business practices and cost benefit analysis that minimizes the cost of services to individual users.\u201d AR 9158; <em>see </em>AR 9158-62. The MOU stated that the partnership would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201cexecuted\" in accordance with implementing instructions that would \u201cdescribe the detailed responsibilities\u201d of each partner. AR 9159.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">On May 11, 2009, Army, AAFES, and DoD officials met with the House Armed Services Committee (\u201cHouse Committee\u201d) concerning the proposed plan to transfer all Personal Information Services operations and related contracts to AAFES. <em>See </em>AR 10537. In a letter dated May 22, 2009, the House Committee approved this plan and provided the following direction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">The Committee views military resale and nonappropriated fund business activities as government entities that must not compete directly with private sector enterprises capable of providing the desired services. In this regard, the Committee directs that within the Department of Defense, no DoD entity may either provide personal information services using DoD resources, personnel or equipment, or compete for contracts to provide such sendees when the intent is to charge users to recover cost or to earn profits. This prohibition does not prevent or preclude the use of DoD personnel, resources or equipment to administer and oversee personal information services contracts, nor does it preclude [AAFES] from carrying out the plan to provide personal information sendees through contractors as approved by the Committee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">AR 10531.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The final version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 incorporated the House Committee\u2019s directive. <em>See </em>Pub.L. 111-84, \u00a7 651, 123 Stat. 2368. Now codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2492a, this legislation became effective on October 28, 2009, and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">(a) Limitation.\u2014(1) Notwithstanding section 2492 of this title, the Secretary of Defense may not authorize a Department of Defense entity to offer or provide personal information services directly to users using Department resources, personnel, or equipment, or compete for contracts to provide such personal information services directly to users, if users will be charged a fee for the personal information services to recover the cost incurred to provide the services or to earn a profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">(2) The limitation in paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prohibit or preclude the use of Department resources, personnel, or equipment to administer or facilitate personal information services contracts with private contractors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">(c) Personal Information Services Defined.\u2014In this section, the term \u201cpersonal information services\u201d means the provision of Internet, telephone, or television services to consumers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2492a (Supp. Ill 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">On December 24, 2009, FMWRC and AAFES finalized a Memorandum of Agreement (\u201cMOA\u201d) implementing the requirements of \u00a7 2492a. AR 4-7. The December MOA provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-15\">AAFES will be responsible for provisioning for-fee Internet services on Military Installations through a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-16\">FMWRC will transfer for-fee internet service programs currently operated by ARMP to AAFES on a mutually agreed upon schedule that minimizes disruption to the customer. All transfers must be completed by 31 December 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-17\">To the extent that AAFES\u2019 commercial ISP[s] can provide their own infrastructure to maintain connectivity at existing locations they may do so. Otherwise, AAFES\u2019 ISP[s] will have the option of using ARMP provided resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-18\">The level of ARMP Internet Sendees provided to the AAFES ISP will meet or exceed current service levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-19\">[FMWRC will] [o]ffer to sell or lease existing Internet assets dedicated to Personal Information Services ... directly to AAFES\u2019 ISPs at a negotiated value where AAFES\u2019 ISPs intend to use existing assets and/or infrastructure to deliver the Internet services to a location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-20\">AR 5-6.

The December MOA further stated: \u201cThere will be no transfer of Internet assets from FMWRC to AAFES as a component of this agreement. FMWRC through [its] ARMP program will offer Internet network services as an option to AAFES\u2019 ISP[s] for a fee.\u201d AR 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\n<em>CCS\u2019 and Resolute\u2019s Bridge Contracts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">As part of the transfer of Personal Information Services from FMWRC to AAFES, ARMP awarded CCS a bridge contract on May 4, 2010, to use ARMP\u2019s network infrastructure and equipment to provide Personal Information Services for consumers at 318 building locations on military installations. AR 1867-92. CCS\u2019 bridge contract was set to terminate on November 30, 2011. AR 1868, 1875. The bridge contract provided that ARMP planned to use its network to provide bandwidth for personal information services, as it had before the bridge contract. AR 1869-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">On July 10, 2010, ARMP entered into a similar bridge contract with Intervenor Resolute, that covered 243 buildings. <em>See </em>AR 2025-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\n<em>The Instructions for Personal Information Services Implementation on FMWRC\u2019s Website</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u201cImplementation Instructions\u201d were issued to \u201cprovide a centralized reference document\u201d in support of the MOU governing the AAFES/FMWRC \u201cnon-competitive partnership\u201d to provide Personal Information Services. AR 330-63.

AR 353-54.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">\n<em>The Request for Information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">On February 11, 2010, AAFES issued a Request for Information (\u201cRFI\u201d) to prospective contractors to provide for-fee consumer telecommunication services at various military installations. AR 8. The RFI notified vendors that \u201cARMP [would be] able to provide AAFES selected suppliers\u201d network support, but that \u201c[a]ny agreements with ARMP [would] be independent of contracts with AAFES.\u201d AR 29.

Individual evaluators were encouraged to use 50 points as a baseline, and then increase or decrease the score based on their \u201canalysis of the vendor\u2019s response and [its] ability to fulfill the requirement.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The individual score sheets also provided spaces for written comments and suggested using comment codes to indicate whether a feature of the proposal was a Significant Strength, Strength, Weakness, Significant Weakness, or Risk. <em>See, e.g. </em>AR 1248-53; <em>see also </em>AR 8106.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">After each voting member of the Source Selection Committee scored the proposals, the Committee would meet for discussion, with the goal of coming to a consensus on the evaluations and preparing a written report to summarize the results and rank the proposals. AR 7935, 7942-43. The report was to discuss the basis for the Source Selection Committee\u2019s ranking in sufficient detail to support the Committee\u2019s recommendation. AR 7935, 7943. Exchange Operating Procedure 65-13 provided that the Source Selection Committee report would \u201csummarize[] the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each proposal.\u201d AR 7935. All original individual scoring sheets were required to be attached to the report. AR 7943.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In addition to a technical evaluation, the solicitation stated that AAFES would review the offerors\u2019 fee proposals for the projected financial benefit to AAFES, and explained that \u201c[a]s the technical rankings [became] closer, the Fees to AAFES [would] become more important.\u201d AR 453, 455. Under the solicitation, the fees for internet, voice, and video services were to be weighted as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">a. Initial Contract Ordering Period Fees - will be multiplied by 2</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">b. Contract Option Periods 1-5 Fees - will be multiplied by 1</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">AR 455. For purposes of evaluation, the voice and video services fees would not be combined with internet service fees. <em>Id. </em>The purpose behind these weights was \u201cto ensure that AAFES ... received a balanced proposal and obtained a reasonable fee proposal for \u2018firm\u2019 periods (years 1-5) versus the uncertain Contract Option Periods.\u201d AR 1512 (emphasis in original). Each offeror was to submit a single fee percentage for each military installation and each service being proposed within a geographic group, accounting for every installation within the geographic location being proposed. AR 458. As part of these fee proposals, offerors were required to provide pro forma Operating Statements, containing projections for internet service in each geographic group being proposed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">Offerors were also required to submit past performance references. AR 456, 458. The solicitation required each offeror to \u201cprovide descriptions of three (3) to five (5) operations in use during the past five (5) years of similar type and size of the project; as described within this solicitation.\u201d AR 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">On June 14, 2010, AAFES amended the solicitation by, inter alia, adding an internet services pro forma Operating Statement form and delineating the type of information to be included in that Statement. AR 882, 908 (Tab 12). Offerors were required to provide financial information in eight categories: investment outlays, sales, gross operating income, operating expenses, total operating expenses, operating earnings before interest and taxes, pre-tax income, and net income. AR 908 (Tab 12). The pro forma Operating Statements were to cover only the first five-year contract period, even though offerors were required to provide fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>data for a 10-year period, and were to be evaluated based on a 10-year period. <em>Id.; see </em>AR 407. The Amendment also extended the due date for the submission of proposals until June 23, 2010. AR 882 (Tab 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\n<em>CCS\u2019 Pre-Proposal Communications with AAFES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In March 2010, CCS emailed AAFES objecting to build-out activities at Fort Bliss, a location where CCS was providing services under its bridge contract, claiming ARMP\u2019s activities violated 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2492a. AR 2515-16; <em>see </em>AR 279, 1887. This statute prohibited DoD entities from offering or providing Personal Information Services to consumers using DoD resources, personnel, or equipment or competing to provide Personal Information Services for a fee. CCS stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">[W]e are becoming increasingly concerned that ARMP has every intention of not only staying in the WIFI business, but monopolizing it per their previous effort, in what appears to be blatant disregard of [C]ongress\u2019 wishes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">We had previously informed you that we would take Fort Bliss and give consideration to the ARMP \u201cservices\u201d where [it] had deployed infrastructure. We presumed, based on our conversations, that [ARMP] would not continue to invest tax dollars in adding infrastructure since we are willing to provide the internet services[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">However, [ARMP] continue[s] to add or attempt to add to [its] network ... despite our stated willingness and ability to provide service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">AAFES replied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">We are not privy to all of [ARMP\u2019s] plans and negotiations between you as it relates to the optional infrastructure use. However, we are aware and do understand ARMP has a command commitment to complete build-out work at Bliss\u2014and other locations\u2014and that you both were in discussions on how that could be accomplished at Bliss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">The legislative guidance is clear on how [Personal Information] services will be provided and FMWRC has made a commitment to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">AR 2515. In a response sent to both AAFES and FMWRC, CCS stated: \u201cAll due respect to ARMP and [its] \u2018commitments.\u2019 The Congress and the Law is clear. What part of this is not understandable? Congress ... has said stop doing this and it is continuing.\u201d AR 2514; <em>see </em>AR 107, 279, 8150.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">In May 2010, CCS submitted questions to the contracting officer regarding ARMP\u2019s planned role in the procurement. AR 2943. CCS stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-16\">[ARMP\u2019s] role is a little confusing and the scope of [its] support is not clear. Will [it] only be able to provide support services where [it has] deployed [Personal Information Services] already? Will [it] be able to provide those services where [it deploys FMWRC Information Services] going forward (over [its FMWRC Information Services] network)? Is there any certainty around where and on what time schedule [it] will be able to provide services going forward? If [ARMP\u2019s] business model is to receive a percentage of revenue, in exchange for providing infrastructure and capital investment, [is ARMP] in a position to deploy \u201crisk\u201d capital for the winning bidder(s)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-17\"><em>Id. </em>The contracting officer responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-18\">a) ARMP is not limited to deploy [Personal Information Services] to provide support. The deployment of ARMP\u2019s official service support network [FMWRC Information Services] is independent from the for fee services that AAFES will offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-19\">b) ARMP would need to confirm [its] capability outside the Army sphere and [FMWRC Information Systems] network. As the [FMWRC Information Services] network expands, the capability to support providers will also expand; although, separate agreements and [service-level agreements] are required with ARMP to consider future expansion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-20\">c) This will be handled on a case by case basis directly with ARMP and included in the [service-level agreement]. It is [AAFES\u2019] understanding that ARMP will work collaboratively with the vendors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>d) This will be handled on a ease by ease basis directly negotiated with ARMP. Under the ARMP proposal, [its] risk is the same as the vendor\u2019s], since the reimbursement to ARMP is based upon revenue and there is a fixed cost for ARMP to install and maintain the network.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\n<em>Offerors\u2019 Knowledge of the Implementing Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">On February 4,2010, Resolute\u2019s Vice President of Marketing, Paul Guertin, found the Personal Information Services Implementing Instructions \u201cduring [a] web-based search,\u201d and forwarded them to other Resolute executives. Guertin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4. The Implementing Instructions focused on the newly formed partnership between AAFES and FMWRC and its effort to create an integrated strategy to manage Personal Information Services. <em>Id. </em>at Ex. B (Version 3.6, Jan. 21, 2010 Implementing Instructions); <em>see also </em>AR 333-34 (Version 3.9, May 10, 2010 Implementing Instructions). The annexes to the Jan. 21, 2010 Implementing Instructions Mr. Guertin located online included: (1) the 2009 February MOU between AAFES and FMWRC on Personal Information Services, (2) an explanation of the roles and responsibilities of FMWRC-appointed telecommunications operations manager and FMWRCassigned business manager and contracting officer, and (3) a sample statement of work for Personal Information Services. Guertin Decl. 21-32. The annexes to the May 10, 2010 version of the Implementing Instructions also included the 2009 December MOA between FMWRC and AAFES and the April 6, 2010 memorandum from the Army\u2019s Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management to all Army bases regarding Personal Information Services. AR 358-63. On March 3, 2010, Mr. Guertin again accessed the Implementing Instructions and forwarded them to two Resolute executives. Guertin Decl. \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Mr. Evard, Executive Vice President of CCS, testified in a declaration that CCS did not obtain the Implementing Instructions prior to June 18,2010, and that he personally became aware of the Implementing Instructions on October 14, 2010, after proposals were submitted, \u201cwhile performing research on a matter unrelated to this litigation.\u201d Third Evard Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5(1), (3). Mr. Evard \u201cdid not review the document in detail, and did not review the Annexes at all, until mid-December when [CCS was] preparing the Complaint in this action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">\n<em>The Proposals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">AAFES received six proposals. AR 1501.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> CCS proposed to use ARMP for some of its existing infrastructure needs, stating it had \u201cplans and the necessary partnerships; including ARMP, in place to roll services out to all locations by June 30, 2011.\u201d AR 713 (Tab 13) (emphasis omitted). The proposal indicated that CCS would self-deploy many of the networks and infrastructure but that ARMP would be a \u201cdeployment partner\u201d at 18 mandatory bases. AR 830-834 (Tab 13). In its proposal, CCS stated it chose to limit ARMP\u2019s role because of concerns over the availability of ARMP\u2019s infrastructure. AR 804 (Tab 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">CCS proposed a [* * *] AAFES commission for internet services at four of the five geographic locations\u2014except for the Alaska region. AR 843-49 (Tab 13). According to CCS\u2019 pro forma Operating Statements, CCS projected [*****] jn combined internet sales from the Western, Hawaii, Central, and Eastern regions, giving AAFES an estimated commission of [* * * * * *] for the five-year period. AR 857 (Tab 13); <em>see </em>AR 858-63 (Tab 13). CCS\u2019 pro forma Operating Statements did not provide its estimated penetration rate, <em>i.e., </em>the estimated percentage of the base population that would pay for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly internet service plans. AR 857 (Tab 13); <em>see </em>AR 858-63 (Tab 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">Resolute also submitted a timely proposal for all geographic regions. <em>See </em>AR 464-709 (Tab 14). Resolute divided the mandatory military bases into three groups: Group A\u2014 locations with an existing and operational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ARMP network without a service provider, Group B\u2014locations with an existing but nonoperational ARMP infrastructure without a service provider, and Group C\u2014locations with an existing provider with contracts expiring in 2011. AR 535^2 (Tab 14). For Group A locations, Resolute proposed partnering with ARMP to transition existing services to Resolute. AR 535 (Tab 14). At Group B locations, Resolute planned to partner with ARMP to make services operational on ARMP\u2019s existing infrastructure. AR 538 (Tab 14). For Group C locations, Resolute would partner with ARMP when available. AR 540-42 (Tab 14). Resolute did not expressly reference a \u201csubcontract\u201d with ARMP, but called its relationship with ARMP a partnership and referred to ARMP as its \u201cpreferred vendor.\u201d AR 466-67, 535, 538, 540, 619, 662, 664 (Tab 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Regarding fees, Resolute assumed an average monthly penetration rate of [* * * *] in 2011 on fully built-out mandatory bases, but applied a [*] discount to its estimated penetration rates to account for competition from existing franchises (in locations with provider contracts expiring in 2011). AR 686-87 (Tab 14); see AR 540-42 (Tab 14). Resolute\u2019s pro forma Operating Statements reflected [* * * * *] commission [* * * *] for AAFES, an [* * *]. AR 687 (Tab 14).

For example, when scoring CCS for past performance, one evaluator wrote: \u201c10+ years in internet business, worked [with] [\u2022 * *], has experience working on a military base.\u201d AR 1271. Individual evaluation scores were then modified based on the Source Selection Committee\u2019s consensus discussion. AR 1248-1499. These modifications were made either directly on score sheets, or were reflected as differences between the numerical scores listed on individual score sheets and the final Source Selection Committee Spreadsheet reflecting the consensus numbers. <em>See, e.g., </em>AR 1270-73 (an evaluation team member\u2019s score sheets for CCS, noting changes in factor scores made after the discussion); AR 1328-33 (an evaluation team member\u2019s score sheets for CCS highlighting several large point increases from the original scores).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Below is a summary of the changes between the initial individual scores and the Source Selection Committee consensus scores for CCS\u2019 and Resolute\u2019s proposals for internet services:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Individual Source Selection Committee Member Scores for CCS</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Individual Scores Pre Consensus Meeting</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Individual Scores Post Consensus Meeting</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">AR 1228,1248-53,1268-73,1290-95,1308-13, 1328-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Individual Source Selection Committee Member Scores for Resolute</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">Individual Scores Pre Consensus Meeting</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">Individual Scores Post Consensus Meeting</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b259-18\">AR 1230, 1349-54,1369-74,1389-94,1407-12, 1427-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-17\">The individual scores were then weighted for each evaluation factor as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>CCS\u2019 Weighted Scores for Internet</p>\n<p id=\"Ajk\">Resolute\u2019s Weighted Scores for Internet</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">AR 1228,1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The Source Selection Committee Report ranked each offeror based on its raw score for internet services.

Mr. Wright\u2019s forecast indicated that once Resolute began full operation under the contract, its net income would increase by [* * *] between 2011 and 2012, and estimated that Resolute could be debt free by 2014.

AR 1221. Mr. Wright found that the rate of return from Resolute\u2019s operation under the contract would exceed its cost of capital, thereby increasing its net present value, and that Resolute\u2019s strengthened financial position would attract additional capital. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Fourth, Mr. Wright considered that Resolute would \u201cneed [* * *] over the first two yeai\u2019s of the contract period for continuing operations and contract execution,\u201d and that it was likely that [* * *] would \u201cprovide as much funding as needed to execute the contract requirements,\u201d given the bank\u2019s vested interest in Resolute\u2019s continued success.

AR 1755. [* * *]. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">With respect to Resolute\u2019s financial projections, the contracting officer, relying on Mr. Wright\u2019s analysis, determined that Resolute had suffered declining revenues in 2010, but that the award of this contract would significantly improve Resolute\u2019s financial outlook.

AR 1757. The first was a warning letter from AAFES for a service disruption dated October 16, 2009, at a European military base. AR 1757, 8497-98. The contracting officer stated: \u201cThe issue was resolved in a timely manner by the contractor and service was restored the same day.\u201d AR 1757. The second issue was \u201ca cure demand,\u201d issued by AAFES on January 13, 2010, for the nonpayment of $199,740 in fees under the 2005 contract. AR 1757-58. The contracting officer found that Resolute was taking corrective action to cure this debt. AR 1758. AAFES and Resolute entered into a debt repayment plan for 12 monthly payments of [* * *] effective June 1, 2010, so that by the time of the responsibility determination on November 8, 2010, the outstanding debt had been reduced from $[* * *] to $[* * *]. <em>Id. </em>In spite of this debt to AAFES, Resolute\u2019s 2005 contract had been extended for an additional year for all Continental United States locations, and for three years for all locations outside the Continental United States. <em>Id. </em>The contracting officer stated, \u201cTo date, [Resolute] continues to provide satisfactory performance and submit payments by the required due date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, on November 8, 2010, the contracting officer determined that Resolute was responsible and the Source Selection Authority concurred with this determination.

The government breaches this implied contract if its consideration of offers is found to be arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In 1996, Congress enacted the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (\u201cADRA\u201d), which provides for judicial resolution of all bid protests in a single court, the Court of Federal Claims, under the standard of review enunciated in the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Pub.L. No. 104-320,110 Stat. 3870 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b) (2000)).

Because AAFES, the entity that conducted this procurement, is not a federal agency, jui\u2019isdiction is not granted under \u00a7 1491(b). However, the Tucker Act bestows jurisdiction over any claim founded upon any implied-in-fact contract with AAFES; ADRA did not diminish the jurisdictional grant in \u00a7 1491(a). <em>Res.

Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, while Defendant and Intervenor filed motions for Judgment on the Administrative Record.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> CCS points out that no rule requires that all bid protests, including those brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a), be resolved on motions for judgment on the AR. Pl.\u2019s Supplemental Br. 3. Defendant and Resolute contend that the ease is appropriately resolved via motions for judgment on the administrative record because bid protests brought under Section 1491(a)\u2014while predicated on breach of the implied duty of fair dealing\u2014are not a differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ent species of protest than those brought under \u00a7 1491(b) and therefore should not require a different process. The Federal Circuit has not yet addressed this procedural issue. <em>See Creation Upgrades, Inc. v. United States, </em>417 Fed.Appx. 957, 959 (Fed.Cir.2011) (\u201cSince our decision in <em>Resource Conservation, </em>we have not decided whether bid protest eases brought under \u00a7 1491(a)(1) of the Tucker Act are to be decided on the administrative record, and we see no need to decide that question in this case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s chosen procedure, summary judgment, is a \u201cshort cut\u201d to resolving a case by eliminating the need for fact-finding and trial. In ruling on summary judgment motions, the Court does not make findings of fact. Rather, the Court assesses whether any material facts are genuinely in dispute and, if they are not, resolves solely questions of law. If there are genuine issues of material fact, the Court must deny motions for summary judgment, and the parties proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In contest, under the regime of motions for judgment on the AR, governed by Rule 52. 1, the Court makes findings of fact based upon the administrative record. As the Federal Circuit explained in <em>Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>the trial court must make factual findings \u201cfrom the record evidence as if it were conducting a trial on the record.\u201d 404 F.3d 1346, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2005). Then, the Court must determine if the agency\u2019s conduct violated the law. <em>Id. </em>In adding Rule 52.1 in 2006, this Court expressly acknowledged that \u201c[sjummary judgment standards are not pertinent to judicial review upon an administrative record.\u201d RCFC 52.1, Rules Committee Notes, 2006 Adoption (citing <em>Bannum, </em>404 F.3d at 1355-57).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Despite the different procedural mechanisms, the standard of review for resolving bid protests is substantially the same whether the protest is brought under \u00a7 1491(a) as a breach of an implied contract or as a traditional bid protest under \u00a7 1491(b). In \u00a7 1491(a) protests, the Court reviews whether the agency\u2019s conduct was arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Keco Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>192 Ct.Cl. 773, 783-84, 428 F.2d 1233 (1970) (\u201c[Ajrbitrary and capricious action on the part of the Government ... clearly is a violation of the rule laid down in <em>[Heyer Products Co. v.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4), the Court employs the standards set forth in the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, which requires the Court to set aside agency action found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">In the instant ease, a determination of whether the agency\u2019s conduct was arbitrary and capricious can be readily made utilizing the AR. Defendant has filed an ample administrative record, and Plaintiff has invoked that record, seeking to add declarations from its executive vice president and consultant. In short, all parties rely on facts in the AR in support of their requests for judgment with very limited supplementation. As such, the Court treats Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment as a motion for judgment on the AR.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">\n<em>The Scope of the Record and Defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">CCS seeks to support its protest with five declarations, three from Timothy Evard, Executive Vice President of CCS, and two from Jimmy J. Jackson, a consultant, and the Government moves to strike all these declarations. In resolving cross-motions for judgment on the AR, the Court must assess whether CCS has justified its request to supplement the AR. <em>Axiom Res.

As such, the Court supplements the record with the third Evard declaration. Further, the Court supplements the record with information on CCS\u2019 knowledge of ARMP\u2019s role in the procurement as reflected in Paragraphs 12 and 13 of Mr. Evard\u2019s first declaration (discussing CCS\u2019 bridge contract and communications with ARMP and AAFES concerning ARMP\u2019s future role) and Paragraphs 1 through 11 of Mr. Evard\u2019s second declaration (discussing CCS\u2019 interpretation of the RFP, information presented at Industry Day, and communications with ARMP and AAFES concerning ARMP\u2019s future role).

Finally, Mr. Jackson critiques the contracting officer\u2019s past performance evaluation because the agency only used a three-point scale\u2014 Strong, Modest, and Weak\u2014\u201cwithout having a fourth possible score for Unacceptable,\u201d a technique that in his view \u201cmasked the high risk of Resolute\u2019s financial performance.\u201d First Jackson Deck \u00b6\u00b6 85, 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">As the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recognized in <em>Axiom Resource Management, Inc. v. United States, </em>the parties\u2019 ability to supplement the AR in a bid protest is limited, and the \u201cfocus of judicial review of agency action remains the administrative record, which should be supplemented only if the existing record is insufficient to permit meaningful review____\u201d 564 F.3d at 1379-81. It is appropriate to supplement the AR when \u201ctechnical aspects of the procurement process [would] remain unexplained\u201d without supplementation or \u201cwhen necessary for the Court to understand technical or complex information involved in the challenged procurement.\u201d <em>Guzar Mirbachakot Transp. v. United States, </em>104 Fed.Cl. 53, 63-64 (2012) (citations omitted) (supplementing the record with expert testimony regarding electronic file compression and transmission utilities); <em>Global Computer Enters., Inc. v. United States, </em>88 Fed.Cl. 52, 67 (2009) (finding declarations necessary to illuminate the difference between audit-supporting financial management system services and mission and administrative support IT services); <em>see also Mike Hooks, Inc. v. United States, </em>39 Fed. Cl. 147, 158 (1997) (permitting supplementation to enable the Court to understand technical solicitation language regarding minimum production rates for shoal dredging).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Consistent with these decisions, an expert in this case could have properly explained complex financial principles and offered an opinion on their impact and application. There is a fine line though between an expert offering technical analysis\u2014an acceptable addition to the record\u2014and an expert substituting his subjective judgment for that of the Government in areas not dependent upon complex technical matters. In the instant ease, Mr. Jackson crossed that line.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Mr. Jackson proffers his opinion on Resolute\u2019s responsibility predicated on his subjective evaluation of the record, not on any inscrutable technical matters. <em>See </em>First Jackson Deck \u00b6 12 (stating it was \u201cirrational\u201d for the contracting officer to find Resolute financially responsible when it was \u201ccleared for less than[* *] percent of the contract amount\u201d); \u00b6 17 (claiming the contracting officer should have found Resolute\u2019s Dun &amp; Bradstreet Report to have been based on outdated information); \u00b625 (opining that Resolute\u2019s financial statements support only an unfavorable financial responsibility determination); \u00b6\u00b6 26-40 (questioning the contracting officer\u2019s interpretation of letters and communications from [* * * * *], and speculating that Resolute was in \u201cdefault\u201d on its loan); \u00b6 72 (stating that Mr. Wright\u2019s financial model provides no \u201crational basis\u201d for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>favorable responsibility determination). Mr. Jackson\u2019s opinion does not provide technical clarification necessary for effective judicial review. <em>Cf. Allied Tech. Grp., Inc. v. United States, </em>92 Fed.Cl. 226, 231 (2010) (refusing to consider proffered declarations because the AR was not too complex for the Court to review).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Similarly, Mr. Jackson\u2019s critique of AAFES\u2019 evaluations are inappropriate supplementation. <em>See </em>First Jackson Deck \u00b6 85 (stating that AAFES\u2019 evaluation criteria for risk scoring should have included an \u201cunacceptable\u201d score); <em>see also </em>Second Jackson Deck \u00b6\u00b6 9-12 (presenting how Mr. Jackson would have calculated the AAFES fee percentages). Expert opinions that purport to assess an agency\u2019s procurement decisions are not proper supplementation of the AR. In <em>PlanetSpace Inc. v. United States, </em>the Court rejected declarations proffered by the plaintiff because they essentially \u201cattack[ed] the merits of [the agency\u2019s] award decision.\u201d 90 Fed.Cl. 1, 6 (2009). Although the <em>PlanetSpace </em>plaintiff claimed that the declarations there were a technical aid to explain the pricing differences among proposals, the Court found that the declarations re-argued the merits of the parties\u2019 financing plans and amounted to a \u201ccomparative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposals____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. So too, Mr. Jackson questions the correctness of the contracting officer\u2019s and Source Selection Committee\u2019s conclusions. Whether or not the contracting officer and Source Selection Committee and Source Selection Authority made \u201creasonable\u201d decisions on these procurement matters is a determination for this Court and is not a proper subject for expert opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In <em>Al Ghanim Combined Group Company General Trading &amp; Contracting W.L.L. v. United States, </em>the Court excluded two declarations by Mr. Jackson in a bid protest. 56 Fed.Cl. 502, 504 (2003). In challenging the pricing evaluation, Mr. Jackson opined that the agency had failed to perform a \u201cprice realism analysis\u201d that would have revealed that the awardee\u2019s pricing was unrealistic. <em>Id. </em>at 511. The Court excluded Mr. Jackson\u2019s declarations because they did not \u201cfill a gap in the record\u201d or provide necessary clarification, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">Even if characterized as expert testimony, Mr. Jackson\u2019s opinions do not aid the court in its analysis of plaintiffs arguments. Admissible expert testimony, as governed by [FRE] 702, must assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. Plaintiffs arguments are devoid of complexities that might require expert assistance, and plaintiffs counsel is able to explain its arguments fully without the need of expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 512 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Here, as in <em>Al Ghanirn, </em>because Mr. Jackson re-argues the merits of the Government\u2019s award decision, his declarations are unnecessary for a full and complete understanding of the issues in the protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\n<em>Waiver Under Blue &amp; Gold in \u00a7 1491(a)(1) Protests</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Defendant and Intervenor, relying on <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, </em>492 F.3d 1308, 1315 (Fed.Cir.2007), seek dismissal of Counts I and II on the ground that CCS knew the basis for these claims prior to the conclusion of the bidding process, but did not raise them until after award. In Count I, CCS claims that Defendant violated 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2492a by allowing ARMP to either (i) compete for a contract to provide Personal Information Services directly to fee-paying users, or (ii) itself provide Personal Information Services directly to fee-paying users. In Count II, CCS claims that ARMP\u2019s role as a subcontractor and FMWRC\u2019s participation on the Source Selection Committee and its involvement, along with ARMP\u2019s, in shaping the solicitation, constituted organizational conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">\n<em>Is the Blue &amp; Gold Waiver Doctrine Limited to \u00a7 1491(b) Protests?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">In <em>Blue &amp; Gold, </em>the Federal Circuit held \u201cthat a party who has the opportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation containing a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313. CCS argues that as a matter of law, the <em>Blue &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Gold </em>waiver doctrine only applies to bid protests brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b), not to protests invoking \u00a7 1491(a) jurisdiction, emphasizing the following language in <em>Blue &amp; Gold:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">[A] party who has the opportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation containing a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same objection afterwards <em>in a \u00a7 1191(b) action in the Court of Federal Claims.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">Having recognized a waiver <em>rule in \u00a7 14.91(b) bid protest actions, </em>we must decide whether the Court of Federal Claims erred in applying it to this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1315 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">While <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>itself concerned a \u00a7 1491(b) bid protest, there is nothing in the decision that limits the waiver rule to bid protests predicated on \u00a7 1491(b) jurisdiction. What drives the waiver rule is the pragmatic recognition that a bidder must object to the terms of a patently erroneous solicitation while the Government can still remedy the situation. <em>Id. </em>at 1314-15. The patent ambiguity doctrine as articulated in <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>is equally applicable in any bid protest whether brought under \u00a7 1491(a) or (b). As the Federal Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">[The patent ambiguity] doctrine \u201cwas established to prevent contractors from taking advantage of the government, protect other bidders by assuring that all bidders bid on the same specifications, and materially aid the administration of government contracts by requiring that ambiguities be raised before the contract is bid, thus avoiding costly litigation after the fact.\u201d These reasons ... apply with equal force in the bid protest context. In the absence of a waiver rule, a contractor with knowledge of a solicitation defect could choose to stay silent when submitting its first proposal. If its first proposal loses to another bidder, the contractor could then come forward with the defect to restart the bidding process, perhaps with increased knowledge of its competitors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1313-1314 (quoting <em>Cmty. Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. v. Kelso, </em>987 F.2d 1575, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">There is no reason to disavow the <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>waiver rule merely because jurisdiction is predicated on this Court\u2019s general breach-of-contraet jurisdiction instead of its more specific bid protest jurisdiction. To hold otherwise would permit bidders in \u00a7 1491(a) protests to do exactly what the <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>Court prohibited\u2014to roll the dice and wait to protest if they do not win. As the Federal Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-13\">It would be inefficient and costly to authorize this remedy after offerors and the agency had expended considerable time and effort submitting or evaluating proposals in response to a defective solicitation. Vendors cannot sit on their rights to challenge what they believe is an unfair solicitation, roll the dice and see if they receive award [sic] and then, if unsuccessful, claim the solicitation was infirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 1314 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Argencord Mach. &amp; Equip., Inc. v. United States, </em>68 Fed.Cl. 167, 175 n. 14 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">The Federal Circuit recently reemphasized that the <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>waiver rule should be broadly applied in bid protests in <em>COMINT Systems Corporation v. United States, </em>700 F.3d 1377 (Fed.Cir.2012). There, the Court held that the plaintiff waived its right to challenge an amendment to the solicitation by not protesting before contract award, even though the amendment was issued after the close of the bidding process. The Federal Circuit expanded <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>by applying its reasoning \u201cto all situations in which the protesting party had the opportunity to challenge a solicitation before the award and failed to do so.\u201d <em>COMINT, </em>700 F.3d at 1382. As such, the Federal Circuit extended the time a protestor may file a pre-award protest from the \u201cclose of the bidding process\u201d as articulated in <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>to any time before award is made. <em>See also Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>115 Fed.Cl. 257, 274 (2014). The Federal Circuit recognized that \u201c[t]he same policy underlying <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>supports it extension to all pre-award situations.\u201d <em>COMINT, </em>700 F.3d at 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>CCS contends that the <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>waiver rale should not apply in \u00a7 1491(a) protests because the implied-in-fact contract giving rise to jurisdiction is not formed unless an offeror submits a proposal, the very act which causes the waiver under <em>Blue &amp; Gold. </em>Thus, CCS posits that a plaintiff challenging a solicitation under \u00a7 1491(a) would have the Hobson\u2019s choice of either filing a protest prior to submitting a proposal, thus bypassing the requirement for establishing \u00a7 1491(a) jurisdiction, or waiving its ability to protest by submitting a proposal. Such a narrow and draconian view of the \u00a7 1491(a) bid protest process is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">CCS\u2019 perceived dilemma was apparently spawned by an overly broad reading of <em>Motorola, Inc. v. United States, </em>988 F.2d 113 (Fed.Cir.1993). CCS misconstrues <em>Motorola </em>to establish a general principle that submission of a proposal is always required to establish the implied-in-fact contract necessary for \u00a7 1491(a) pre-award protest jurisdiction. While the trial court in <em>Motorola </em>did articulate that principle, the Federal Circuit, using limiting language in its affirmance, did not adopt the trial court\u2019s reasoning wholesale. The plaintiff in <em>Motorola </em>filed suit challenging a solicitation as being unduly restrictive and precluding it from submitting a bid. The <em>Motorola </em>plaintiff based its assertion of implied contract jurisdiction on the Government\u2019s requests for, and Motorola\u2019s submission of, information to assist the Government in developing the solicitation. <em>Id. </em>at 114-15. In dismissing Motorola\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, the trial court concluded that \u201c[sjince there was no bid here, there was no promise; hence, no basis for finding the existence of a pre-award contract upon which a claim for injunctive relief can be based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In affirming <em>Motorola, </em>while agreeing that no implied contract arose because plaintiff had not submitted a bid, the Federal Circuit added important qualifiers, stating that Motorola had \u201cnot <em>otherwise </em>met its burden to show that an implied in fact contract existed,\u201d and that <em>\u201c[o]rdinarily </em>a bid is required to establish that a pre-award implied in fact contract exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). This language underscores the appellate court\u2019s recognition that the submission of a bid is not the <em>sine qua non </em>for establishing an implied-in-fact contract and acknowledges alternatives for \u201cotherwise\u201d establishing the implied-in-fact contract necessary for preaward protest jurisdiction. Further, the Federal Circuit expressly limited its endorsement of the <em>Motorola </em>trial court\u2019s opinion \u201cto the extent consistent with the above\u201d reasoning. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The Federal Circuit\u2019s refusal in <em>Motorola </em>to restrict the manner in which an implied-in-fact contract can be formed in the pre-award procurement process setting is consistent with fundamental principles of contract formation. As the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 24 teaches, \u201c[a]n offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.\u201d The Government\u2019s manifestation of a willingness to enter a bargain and a vendor\u2019s assent to that bargain need not be exclusively expressed via a formal bid or proposal in the pre-award context.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">But even if CCS were correct that it had to submit a proposal in order to form an implied-in-fact contract giving rise to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, it could still have preserved its rights. CCS could have protested the terms of the solicitation and in the alternative, timely submitted a proposal that purported to respond to the allegedly flawed solicitation. In sum, CCS\u2019 effort to insulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u00a7 1491(a) protests from the <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>waiver rule fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\n<em>CCS Knew Its Grounds of Protest Prior to Award</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">As explained above, parties who have the opportunity to object to the terms of a solicitation containing patent errors or ambiguities and fail to do in a timely fashion waive their ability to subsequently raise the same objections. <em>COMINT, </em>700 F.3d at 1382; <em>Blue &amp; Gold, </em>492 F.3d at 1316; <em>Bannum, </em>115 Fed.Cl. at 273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>CCS Waived Its Claim of a Statutory Violation</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">In Count I, CCS claims that the Government violated 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2492a, which provides: (a) Limitation.\u2014(1) Notwithstanding section 2492 of this title, the Secretary of Defense may not authorize a Department of Defense entity to offer or provide personal information services directly to users using Department resources, personnel, or equipment, or compete for contracts to provide such personal information services directly to users, if users will be charged a fee for the personal information services to recover the cost incurred to provide the services or to earn a profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">(2) The limitation in paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prohibit or preclude the use of Department resources, personnel, or equipment to administer or facilitate personal information services contracts with private contractors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2492a.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">CCS alleges that ARMP was either competing for a contract to provide Personal Information Services or providing these services directly to fee-paying users in violation of \u00a7 2492a, by acting as a subcontractor and continuing to build out its own network. However, by waiting to file its protest until after award, CCS waived this ground of protest. The solicitation clearly informed offerors that ARMP could be a subcontractor and lease its infrastructure to offerors reiterating identical communications conveyed to offerors in the draft solicitation and the Industry Day presentation.

According to CCS, it was not clear that ARMP\u2019s support included providing infrastructure. <em>Id. </em>at 37. CCS\u2019 interpretation is untenable. CCS asked: \u201cWill [ARMP] only be able to provide support services where [it has] deployed [Personal Information Services] already?\u201d AR 2943 (emphasis added). The contracting officer said no, stating \u201cARMP is not limited to deploy [Personal Information Services] to provide support,\u201d and added that ARMP\u2019s expanding FMWRC Information Services network could be utilized via separate agreements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>A </em>few weeks after this clarification, the Government issued the solicitation, listing the benefits of using ARMP as a subcontractor, and reiterating ARMP\u2019s role and clarifying that the ARMP network would continue to expand.

Even though it was aware of this alleged defect in the solicitation, CCS did not protest until after it failed to receive the award. As such, CCS waived its ability to protest this statutory violation under <em>Blue &amp; Gold.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">\n<em>The Court Declines to Invoke a Statutory Violation Exception to the Waiver Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">CCS argues that even if it waived its statutory claim, the Court should not apply <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>because a significant statutory violation is at issue. PL\u2019s Reply &amp; Opp\u2019n 43. CCS posits that the <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>waiver rule originated in part from the Government Accountability Office\u2019s (\u201cGAO\u201d) timeliness rule. This rule permits GAO to consider an untimely protest \u201cfor good cause shown, or where it determines that a protest raises issues significant to the procurement system____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44 (quoting 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(c)). As CCS recognizes, GAO\u2019s exception to the timeliness rule applies \u201conly where the untimely issue directly concerns the interpretation or application of the procurement statutes or regulations on a matter of widespread interest to the procurement community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(e) and quoting <em>DePaul Hosp. &amp; The Catholic Health Ass\u2019n of the United States, </em>B-227160, 87-2 CPD \u00b6 173, 1987 WL 102790, at *4 (Comp.Gen. Aug. 18, 1987) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">CCS contends that this Court should adopt a similar exception because AAFES violated the statute and contravened the legislative intent of prohibiting Government competition in the commercial marketplace. <em>Id. </em>at 45. Even assuming arguendo that CCS is correct that AAFES violated 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2492a in this procurement, applying a statutory violation exception to the <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>waiver rule would not be appropriate. The <em>Blue &amp; Gold </em>waiver rule as extended by <em>COMINT </em>is simple: if there is a patent ambiguity or error in the solicitation, a plaintiff must seek redress in court prior to award. In fashioning and reaffirming this judicial waiver rule, the Federal Circuit did not adopt GAO\u2019s rule or practice, it applied a judicial doctrine, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>patent ambiguity doctrine, and recognized that it was unfair and inefficient to allow protestors to game the system by waiting to raise problems with a solicitation until after they failed to receive the award. As such, this Court declines CCS\u2019 invitation to carve out an exception to the <em>Bhie &amp; Gold </em>waiver rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Even if the Court were to invoke GAO\u2019s rule, GAO\u2019s exception to waiver would not apply here. As GAO has noted, \u201cIn order to prevent the timeliness rules from becoming meaningless, the significant issue exception is strictly construed and seldom used,\u201d and the burden is on the untimely protestor to show that its protest is of \u201cwidespread interest to the procurement community.\u201d <em>DePaul Hosp., </em>1987 WL 102790, at *4. Statutory violations of widespread interest typically implicate broad procurement statutes. <em>See Adrian Supply Co.-Reconsideration, </em>66 Comp.

Paragraph 1-21 of this policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">Selection of contractors and award of contracts must be made free of any conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists when the person selecting items for purchase, selecting a contractor, placing an order or awarding a contract has a financial interest in the business of the firm receiving an order or contract, or is in a position to benefit because of a family interest. Contracting officers, their representatives, ordering agents and other AAFES personnel who are authorized to determine requirements, select items, or sign, approve, disapprove or administer contracts (including inspection), are required to disqualify themselves from contract transactions involving an actual or potential conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">AR 7980.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">CCS posits that two FMWRC employees, David LaPradd and John Temple, who were on the Source Selection Committee, and a third FMWRC employee, Nate Wills, an Army contracting specialist on the contracting team, had a financial interest in an award to Resolute, because Resolute proposed using ARMP as its primary subcontractor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ARMP is an affiliate of FMWRC. Specifically, CCS contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">ARMP, Resolute\u2019s primary subcontractor, is an affiliate <em>ii.e., </em>a subsidiary organization) of their employer, FMWRC. Thus, at a minimum, these individuals had a \u201cdirect or indirect financial interest\u201d or \u201cother beneficial interest\u201d in a \u201cproposed subcontractor\u201d of one of the firms submitting a proposal. Because they were involved in \u201cselecting items for purchase, selecting a contractor, placing an order or awarding a contract\u201d and, through their employer, had a \u201cfinancial interest in the business of the firm receiving\u201d award, these individuals had an impermissible conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A73\">Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Support of Mot.

Resolute likewise argues that CCS waived this claim because FMWRC/ARMP personnel attended the conference and identified themselves as employees of FMWRC and ARMP, and attendees, including at least four CCS employees, saw a slide entitled \u201cKey Procurement/Operations Team\u201d identifying three individuals from FMWRC and one from ARMP as team members.

LaPradd, Temple, and Wills would be on the procurement or operations side. Pl.\u2019s Reply &amp; Opp\u2019n 38. CCS\u2019 post-hoc interpretation of this slide is not persuasive. Even if the slide did not detail the precise involvement of the FMWRC employees in the procurement, it put CCS on notice that they would be \u201ckey\u201d players, triggering a duty to inquire. As Intervenor argues, \u201c[t]o the extent [ARMP\u2019s and FMWRC\u2019s role] was unclear, CCS was obligated to seek clarification of the issue and protest if there was any ambiguity.\u201d Intervenor\u2019s Reply 6. On several occasions, CCS sought clarification or voiced complaints about other aspects of the procurement, and AAFES regularly responded to these inquiries. Even though it was on notice of these individuals\u2019 \u201ckey\u201d roles in the procurement, CCS did not raise its OCI complaint until after it was denied the award. Therefore, CCS waived its ability to protest on these grounds under <em>Blue &amp; Gold.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\n<em>CCS\u2019 Organizational Con\u00f1ict of Interest Claim Fails</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Even if CCS had not waived its OCI claim, this claim is unfounded. CCS\u2019 OCI claim is predicated on AAFES\u2019 procurement policy, which provides: \u201cA conflict of interest exists when the person selecting items for purchase, selecting a contractor, placing an order or awarding a contract has a financial interest in the business of the firm receiving an order or contract ...\u201d AR 7980. AAFES enforced this aspect of its procurement policy by requiring the Source Selection Committee members to complete and submit a Conflict of Interest Statement. AR 8139. The form stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest exists that may diminish my capacity to perform an impartial and objective review of the offeror\u2019s proposal, or may otherwise result in a biased opinion or an unfair advantage____ In determining whether any potential conflict of interest exists, I agree to review whether my or my employer\u2019s relationships with other persons or entities, including but not limited to, ownership of stocks, bonds, other outstanding financial interests or commitments, employment arrangements (past, present, or under consideration) ... may place me in a position of conflict, real or apparent, with the evaluation proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">AR 8142. Each member was required to complete the form and return it to the contracting officer. AR 8139.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">However, Messrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills submitted a different form, entitled Certificate for Personnel Participating in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Source Selection Concerning Nondisclosure, Conflicts of Interest, and Rules of Conduct. AR 8152 (Mr. LaPradd), 8154 (Mr. Temple), 8157 (Mr. Wills). That form contained the following statement regarding conflicts of interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">To the best of my knowledge, I certify that neither I nor my spouse ... have any direct or indirect financial interest in any of the firms submitting proposals, or their proposed subcontractors or have any other beneficial interest in such firm except as fully disclosed on an attachment to this certification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\"><em>Id. </em>(\u00b6 2). None of these three employees disclosed a beneficial interest on an attachment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Plaintiff claims that \u201c[t]he representations made by Messrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills in such forms are demonstrably and unassailably inaccurate,\u201d based solely on the fact of their employment at FMWRC, their roles on either the Source Selection Committee or the contracting team, ARMP\u2019s status as a potential subcontractor, and FMWRC\u2019s relationship with ARMP. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The mere circumstances of these employees\u2019 positions and ARMP\u2019s role do not establish that the FMWRC personnel in question had a financial interest in Resolute. CCS\u2019 OCI claim is predicated solely on the fact that ARMP is an affiliate of FMWRC, Messrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills\u2019 employer. CCS asserts a broad-based speculative contention that these three employees necessarily had a financial interest in ARMP based on this affiliation. In essence, CCS would divine a prohibited financial interest on the part of these FMWRC employees \u201cin the business of\u2019 ARMP and attribute that interest to Resolute. Nothing in the record suggests that ARMP\u2019s performance under Resolute\u2019s contract could have impacted the compensation of Messrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills. CCS also ignores the fact that in its own proposal, it planned to use ARMP, thus creating the same conflict of interest it alleges. Specifically, CCS\u2019 proposal stated: \u201cCCS has plans and the necessary partnerships, including ARMP, in place to roll services out to all locations____\u201d AR 713 (Tab 13). Of the 74 mandatory bases CCS proposed to service with internet, CCS proposed using ARMP as its \u201cdeployment partner\u201d at 18 locations, and using ARMP infrastructure where available. AR 804, 830-34 (Tab 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">In this procurement, contractors were offering to provide Personal Information Services directly to service members. AAFES was to obtain a commission, but there was no showing that such commission would inure to the benefit of FMWRC personnel. To demonstrate an organizational conflict of interest, a protestor must identify \u201chard facts\u201d\u2014a mere inference or suspicion of a conflict is not enough. <em>PAI Corp. v. United States, </em>614 F.3d 1347, 1352-54 (Fed.Cir.2010) (finding that no organizational conflict of interest existed because the plaintiff failed to identify \u201chard facts\u201d); <em>see also JWK Int\u2019l Corp. v.

As the Court stated in <em>JWK International Corporation v. United States, </em>\u201c[i]n short, even assuming the existence of a conflict, plaintiff has not shown that \u2018had it not been for the alleged error in the procurement process, there was a reasonable likelihood that [it] would have been awarded the contract.\u2019 \u201d 52 Fed.Cl. at 658 (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>Data Gen.

Similarly, CCS has not shown that there was a reasonable likelihood it would have received the award if Messrs. LaPradd and Temple were not part of the evaluation team and Mr. Wills was not part of the contracting team. CCS has not claimed that the two FMWRC personnel on the Source Selection Committee evaluated CCS or Resolute differently than the other three voting Committee members. In fact, Resolute\u2019s score would have been higher than CCS\u2019 score even if the evaluations of Messrs. LaPradd and Temple were removed from the mix. As such, CCS\u2019 claim that an organizational conflict of interest existed in this procurement under AAFES\u2019 procurement policies fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>AAFES\u2019 Evaluation of Proposals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">CCS claims that AAFES incorrectly evaluated the proposals by failing to use the proposal scoring template and by normalizing the penetration rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>Scoring</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">CCS claims that AAFES\u2019 numeric scoring of the offerors\u2019 proposals did not reflect the actual strengths and weaknesses assigned by the Source Selection Committee. Specifically, CCS argues that the majority of the individual evaluators failed to use the \u201cproposal scoring template\u201d which provided the following comment codes: SS = significant strength, S = strength, SW = significant weakness, W = weakness, C = clarification, and R = risk. <em>E.g., </em>AR 1253, 10508. Only one evaluator used the recommended comment codes, while the other evaluators either used a plus, minus, and neutral system, or simply provided comments. <em>E.g., </em>AR 1308-13, 1369-74, 1486-91 (using the required codes); AR 1248-1253, 1349-1354 (using mix of plus/minus and written comments).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">CCS argues that the evaluators\u2019 plus/minus system did not distinguish between strengths and significant strengths or weaknesses and significant weaknesses, or identify risks. Given the subjective assessments required, CCS fails to appreciate the discretion afforded technical evaluators in scoring the technical elements in this procurement and overemphasizes the role of the proposal scoring template. Neither the solicitation nor AAFES\u2019 Exchange Operating Procedure 65-13 required the use of comment codes for Significant Strengths, Strengths, Weaknesses, Significant Weaknesses, and Risks. According to the solicitation, evaluators were to numerically score proposals for each of the 11 evaluation factors, and justify the final ratings \u201cby drawing upon the strengths, weaknesses, and risks identified.\u201d AR 453-54. The individual evaluation sheets reflect that the evaluators complied with this requirement. Each team member wrote notes articulating what aspects of each proposal warranted a given score. <em>See, e.g., </em>AR 1271 (noting that CCS has 10 years in the internet business and experience working on a military base, as justification for a past performance score of [* * *] out of 100); AR 1389 (noting that Resolute allows WiFi subscribers to print to Resolute printers and that gaming devices may be associated with user accounts, as justification for a products score of [* * *] out of 100). The failure to regurgitate the comment codes listed on the individual evaluator worksheets is a matter of form, not substance, and does not warrant invalidating the technical evaluation. As the Federal Circuit has recognized, challenges to the technical scoring involve the \u201cminutiae of the procurement process,\u201d \u201cdiscretionary determinations of procurement officials that a court will not second guess.\u201d <em>COMINT, </em>700 F.3d at 1384 (quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>E.W. Bliss Co. v. United States, 77 </em>F.3d 445, 449 (Fed.Cir.1996) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">CCS further argues that there is a disconnect between the Source Selection Committee\u2019s recommendation, the point scores assigned for each factor, and the strengths and weaknesses listed in the attachment to the Committee\u2019s Report. CCS submits that the ratings in the Report were not justified by \u201c\u2018drawing upon the strengths, weaknesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and risk[s] identified\u2019 \u201d as required by the solicitation. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. 40-43.

AR 1520. In so arguing, CCS disregards the results of the Committee\u2019s consensus evaluation of each proposal, which assigned Resolute more strengths and fewer weaknesses overall than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>CCS. <em>Compare </em>AR 7825-26, 7828-30 (Resolute\u2019s strength/weakness determinations) <em>with </em>7835-7839 (CCS\u2019 strength/weakness determinations). For example, under the Technical Design factor, one of the two most important evaluation factors, CCS received [* * *] weaknesses and [* * *] strengths as compared to Resolute\u2019s [* * *] weakness and [* * *] strengths, a finding that reasonably supports to the higher score Resolute received. AR 7825, 7838. The same is true for the other \u201cdisconnects\u201d CCS alleged, with the difference in scores reflecting the strength/weakness determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">\u2022 Scalability: Resolute had [* *] strengths and [*] weaknesses compared to CCS\u2019 [* *] strengths and [* *] weakness.

As the Federal Circuit has recognized, \u201cagencies \u2018are entrusted with a good deal of discretion in determining which bid is the most advantageous to the Government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., Inc. v.

The record does not support this allegation. Rather, the record reflects that each voting member of the Source Selection Committee independently evaluated and scored each evaluation factor for each proposal and wrote comments explaining or justifying the member\u2019s independent determination. AR 1248-1499. For example, for the Pi\u2019oducts evaluation factor, one member gave CCS a score of [*], with comments that CCS could \u201crollout by June 2011 as requested,\u201d had \u201cmultiple \u2018architectures\u2019 of systems used to serve different bases/environments,\u201d and could provide internet in public hotspots. AR 1248. A different Committee member gave CCS a score of [*] for the Products evaluation factor, noting that CCS \u201ccomplies with all requirements,\u201d that it was \u201c[currently providing internet service through DSL equipment,\u201d that it had \u201c[g]ood experience in [the] military environment, but seems to offer only one method, either DSL or Cable modem,\u201d and that it had \u201c[l]imited offerings dependent on partnership.\u201d AR 1328. While the individualized ratings spanned a wide range, this does not mean they were flawed or erroneous. Instead, this circumstance highlights the subjectivity of the evaluation process and the reality that different aspects of CCS\u2019 offer were valued by the individual raters. \u201cThis Court does not sit as a super source selection authority to second guess and re-score offerors\u2019 proposals.\u201d <em>AshBritt, Inc. v.

CCS has not demonstrated that the ratings were flawed, or the numeric scores unwarranted. <em>See COMINT, </em>700 F.3d at 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">CCS also contends that the Source Selection Committee\u2019s consensus scores were inadequately justified. Once the individual evaluations were completed, Source Selection Committee members met to determine their consensus scores and modified their individual scores as a result of the discussion. <em>See </em>AR 7492 (EOP 65-13 \u00b6 4-23). The modifications were either made directly on score sheets or were reflected as differences between the numerical scores on individual score sheets and the final Source Selection Committee Proposal Scoring Spreadsheet, which reflected the consensus numbers. <em>E.g., </em>AR 1270-73 (noting changes in specific factor scores \u201cafter discussion\u201d); AR 1328-33 (highlighting several large point increases for CCS from its original score).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Below is a summary of the changes between the initial individual scores and the Source Selection Committee\u2019s Proposal Scoring Spreadsheet for Resolute\u2019s and CCS\u2019 proposals for internet services:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Individual Source Selection Co; nittee Member Scores for CCS<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">AR 1228,1248-53,1268-73,1290-95,1308-13, 1328-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Individual Source Selection Committee Member Scores for Resolute</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">AR 1230,1349-54,1369-74,1389-94,1407-12, 1427-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">These tables show that as a result of Source Selection Committee discussions, individual Committee members reconsidered and at times altered their original scores. The modified individual scores were then converted into weighted scores for each factor by each individual evaluator. AR 1228, 1230. The average of each individual evaluator\u2019s modified weighted score was then used as a final score for ranking the proposals. AR 1228,1230,1525,1552-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">CCS does not argue that the comments and explanations accompanying these scores were inaccurate. Rather, CCS contends that, because not every comment or explanation of a strength and weakness was quoted in the Source Selection Committee Report, the scores were somehow flawed. However, the evaluators\u2019 comments indicate that they weighed the merits of each proposal and considered all aspects of the proposals in arriving at their scores and rankings. There is no reason for this Court to second guess the scoring here. \u201c[I]t is well established that the Court should not substitute its judgment to assess the relative merits of competing proposals in a government procurement.\u201d <em>AshBritt, </em>87 Fed.Cl. at 367 (citing <em>R &amp; W Flammann GmbH v. United States, </em>339 F.3d 1320, 1322 (Fed.Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">CCS also claims that the record does not support AAFES\u2019 representation that it called each offeror\u2019s past performance reference, but this allegation is belied by the AR. AR 1520, 7840. The Source Selection Committee Report states that \u201c[rjeferences for each offeror were contacted and used in evaluations. The reference calls were incorporated into the past performance factor and scored accordingly. No information was received from the reference calls that resulted in any scoring impact.\u201d AR 1520. The record reflects that each voting member of the Source Selection Committee made reference calls and <em>documented the information from each call. See </em>AR 1266-67, 1286-87, 1326-27, 1346-47 (reflecting eight reference calls about CCS and noting customers\u2019 feedback, <em>e.g., </em>customer was \u201cvery pleased with [CCS\u2019] performance,\u201d CCS had \u201cgreat customer support\u201d and was \u201con target [with] everything\u201d); 1367-68, 1387-88, 1425-26, 1445-46 (reflecting eight reference calls about Resolute and noting customers\u2019 feedback, <em>e.g., </em>customers were \u201cvery pleased with [Resolute\u2019s] performance\u201d and \u201chappy [with Resolute] on service and response to problems,\u201d and Resolute had a \u201cwell dedicated model\u201d and was \u201cvery responsive to all customer needs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">Lastly, CCS claims that the Source Selection Authority adopted the \u201cflawed ratings\u201d without discussing the significance of the technical differences in terms of contract performance or governmental needs. According to CCS, the Source Selection Decision high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>lighted the same scores, strengths, and weaknesses identified by the Source Selection Committee without \u201cdigging deeper and analyzing the significance of the scores.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mem. 45. However, CCS has not shown that the underlying technical evaluations were incorrect, irrational, or inadequately documented, or that the findings here warranted \u201cdigging deeper.\u201d Indeed, CCS ignores the fact that the Source Selection Committee found Resolute to be the hands down choice in the technical and past performance factors. The Committee\u2019s Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">With the exception of the corporate financial position, this is clearly the best proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">... Resolute has strong, flexible product options with ample bandwidth and value enhancements to offer customers. Network design and options for providing service are robust, leveraging [its] extensive experience with AAFES. Resolute consistently presented superior solutions to all factors requested within the RFP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">AR 1520-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\n<em>AAFES\u2019 Fee Evaluations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">CCS claims that AAFES\u2019 evaluation of price proposals was arbitrary and capricious because AAFES improperly \u201cnormalized\u201d the offerors\u2019 price proposals in two respects: (1) it used a \u201cnormalized penetration rate\u201d\u2014 the estimated percentage of the base population that would pay for internet service\u2014 based solely on ARMP\u2019s subscription information, and (2) it used a \u201cnormalized base revenue figure.\u201d CCS contends that the normalized penetration rate was improper because the solicitation allowed offerors to choose their technical approaches and did not force them to use ARMP. CCS claims the agency\u2019s use of a normalized base revenue figure was unnecessary because offerors submitted pro forma Operating Statements and cost projections as required by the RFP. CCS further contends that because these normalized protocols were not disclosed in the solicitation CCS was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The purpose of normalization is to measure offers against the same \u201cbaseline.\u201d As this Court has recognized, it is appropriate to use normalization techniques in procurements when there is no logical basis for differences in approach or when there is insufficient information available to accurately evaluate proposals. <em>Computer Scis.

In order to overturn an agency\u2019s normalization decision, the protestor must demonstrate that the choice made by the agency was irrational. <em>Marquette Med.

AR 5876, 5879. The rates used were 1.8% for pre-paid hourly service, 1.1 % for prepaid daily service, 0.8% for pre-paid weekly service, and 2.9% for pre-paid monthly service. AR 5879.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">In their pro forma Operating Statements, offerors assumed different penetration rates, which translated into different potential revenues. CCS proposed a flat fee of [* * *] based on a [* * * * * *] penetration rate, while Resolute proposed fees from [* * * * *] based on a penetration rate of [* * * *]. Neither offeror allowed for different penetration rates depending on whether a customer chose hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly service options, yet AAFES\u2019 historical data showed that there were different rates for these services. Because the dollar amount that AAFES would receive in fees was pegged to usage and dependent upon accurate penetration rates, AAFES needed to compensate for either overstatements or understatements of potential usage in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>to accurately measure revenues. Normalizing the penetration rate allowed AAFES to accurately measure how CCS\u2019 and Resolute\u2019s different fee percentages would translate into dollars received by AAFES. Thus, CCS has not shown that AAFES\u2019 decision to normalize the penetration rate was unreasonable or prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\n<em>AAFES\u2019 Responsibility Determination of Resolute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">According to AAFES policy, a responsible prospective contractor must meet seven minimum standards. <em>See </em>AR 8020 (ESR Policy 65-1 \u00b6 4-46). At issue in this case are two standards\u2014that a prospective contractor must (1) have adequate financial resources, or the ability to obtain such resources as required during performance, and (2) have a record of satisfactory performance \u201cor be able to document beyond reasonable doubt that any prior problems that created a marginal or unsatisfactory situation have been eliminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>CCS argues that the responsibility determination was arbitrary and capricious because the contracting officer unreasonably concluded that Resolute had adequate financial resources and that its prior performance difficulties had been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>The Financial Responsibility Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">CCS claims there is inadequate factual support to conclude that Resolute had sufficient financial resources to perform the contract and that AAFES placed too much emphasis on how the contract award would improve Resolute\u2019s financial outlook. \u201cContracting officers are \u2018generally given wide discretion\u2019 in making responsibility determinations and in determining the amount of information that is required to make a responsibility determination.\u201d <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citing <em>Grimberg, </em>702 F.2d at 1367); <em>NCL Logistics Co. v.

The Court \u201ccannot substitute [its] judgment for that of the contracting officer in making responsibility determinations.\u201d <em>Bender Shipbuilding &amp; Repair Co. v. United States, </em>297 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2002) (upholding a financial responsibility determination because even though the awardee had financial problems, the contracting officer examined the financial data before him and articulated a rational explanation for his decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Under AAFES\u2019 procurement policy, in order to be financially responsible, a prospective contractor must have \u201cadequate financial resources, or the ability to obtain such resources, as required during the performance of the contract.\u201d AR 8020. The contracting officer here considered Resolute\u2019s past financial difficulties, but placed more weight on the likelihood of Resolute\u2019s improved financial future, which was permissible under AAFES\u2019 policy\u2014requiring that a contractor have the \u201cability to obtain\u201d adequate financial resources. This is not arbitrary and capricious or irrational action.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">A paramount element of CCS\u2019 challenge to Resolute\u2019s responsibility determination concerns Resolute\u2019s [* * *]. CCS claims that Resolute was in \u201cdefault\u201d on this loan, but nothing in the record supports a conclusion that Resolute had defaulted or missed payments on its [* * *]. The contracting officer was aware of the loan. AAFES contacted the bank, and the bank provided documentation showing that Resolute was repaying the loan. AR 1755, 8539, 8540-41. Further, the bank [* * *]. Instead of finding Resolute in default, [* * *] unequivocally stated that Resolute was a stable business, \u201cperforming per its agreed loan terms with [* * *],\u201d that the bank would continue to support Resolute and was comfortable with Resolute\u2019s ability to meet its obligations. AR 8540.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">A responsibility determination is a business judgment, and contracting officials enjoy wide discretion in determining whether proceeding to award a contract to a particular entity poses undue risk. <em>NCL Logistics, </em>109 Fed.Cl. at 623 (citations omitted). Here, the agency made this award fully aware of Resolute\u2019s financial challenges and determined Resolute to be responsible. <em>See Ettefaq-Meliat-Hai-Afghan Consulting, Inc. v. United States, </em>106 Fed.Cl. 429, 436 (2012) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>(citations omitted) (\u201c[T]his type of assessment is a quintessential business judgment, and this Court will not second guess the contracting officer\u2019s judgment where there is supporting evidence.\u201d). In <em>Bender Shipbuilding, </em>the Federal Circuit affirmed a financial responsibility determination where the Army awarded a contract to a bidder that had recently filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. 297 F.3d at 1362-63. The contracting officer in <em>Bender Shipbuilding </em>acknowledged the seriousness of the company\u2019s financial situation but awarded it the contract, based in part on a guarantee of performance by the offeror\u2019s parent company and the availability of progress payments under the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 1360. In upholding the decision, the Federal Circuit noted the \u201cwide discretion\u201d that contracting officers have in making responsibility determinations and acknowledged that the awardee and its parent had financial problems, but did not disturb the contracting officer\u2019s determination that the awardee was financially responsible. <em>Id. </em>at 1362. The awardee in <em>Bender Shipbuilding </em>was in a more precarious position than Resolute here. There is no indication that Resolute was approaching bankruptcy, and Resolute demonstrated that it had support from \u25a0 [* * *]. CCS has not shown that the contracting officer abused her discretion in finding Resolute responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Citing the Vendor Financial Clearance data, CCS argues that since Resolute was not cleared for the full contract amount, or even for [*] of the contract amount, it should not have been found financially responsible. A financial clearance is \u201can independent source of information for the contracting officer\u201d indicating a \u201cfirm\u2019s financial capability.\u201d AR 8033. Financial clearance under AAFES\u2019 policy is only required for \u201cmerchandise, supplies, and equipment purchases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The purpose of AAFES\u2019 financial clearance policy is to \u201cmake sure the supplier will ship ordered merchandise timely and will reimburse AAFES for returns (QA rejections, recalls, aged merchandise, and so forth).\u201d <em>Id. </em>This contract was not for the purchase of \u201cmerchandise, supplies, or equipment,\u201d but rather involved provision of telecommunication services to users for a fee with a portion of that fee going back to the NAFI. As such, the financial arrangement here did not pose the type of risk AAFES\u2019 financial clearance was intended to address. In any event, AAFES policy states that the financial clearance process does not, by itself, dictate responsibility. <em>Id. </em>The policy allows a contracting officer to find an awardee financially responsible even if it does not receive financial clearance in an amount equivalent to the proposed purchase. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">CCS further challenges AAFES\u2019 use of financial statements. CCS correctly observes that the contracting officer erroneously claimed that Resolute\u2019s financial analysis was based on <em>\u201caudited </em>financial statements for 2007, 2008, and 2009.\u201d AR 1755 (emphasis added). In fact, Resolute submitted audited statements for 2007 and 2008, and unaudited statements for 2009. While CCS claims the absence of audited statements for 2009 should have \u201cset off alarm bells,\u201d its own actions belie this claim. CCS itself did not submit audited financial statements. AR 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The remainder of CCS\u2019 challenges to the financial responsibility determination rest solely on matters the Court may not address\u2014declarations that are not in the record containing Mr. Jackson\u2019s opinions as to Mr. Wright\u2019s financial analysis and the contracting officer\u2019s decision. The record provides no basis for this Court to overturn the contracting officer\u2019s responsibility determination. AAFES and the contracting officer were fully aware of Resolute\u2019s financial difficulties. AAFES\u2019 expert, Mr. Wright, acknowledged that Resolute faced severe financial challenges, but projected that if Resolute received the award of the AAFES contract, Resolute\u2019s financial outlook would greatly improve. AR 1755, 8484. The contracting officer reasonably relied on Mr. Wright\u2019s analysis, noting not only that award would improve Resolute\u2019s financial outlook, but that Resolute would be able to \u201cmeet commission payment requirements during the contract period of performance.\u201d AR 1756. As <em>Bender Shipbuilding </em>established, it is permissible for a contracting officer to consider income that a contractor would receive if the contract at issue were awarded. 297 F.3d at 1362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\n<em>Consideration of Past Performance in the Responsibility Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">CCS attempts to find fault with the contracting officer\u2019s consideration of Resolute\u2019s past performance, arguing that the contracting officer ignored critical information. The contracting officer identified two main past performance issues for Resolute. The first was a warning letter dated October 16, 2009, for a service disruption. AR 1757. The contracting officer noted that the issue had been resolved in a timely manner and that service had been restored the same day. The second issue was a demand for the nonpayment of fees issued on January 13, 2010, and CCS claims that the contracting officer ignoi\u2019ed a cure notice from February 2010, but this allegation is not supported by the record. The February 2010 letter discussed the same debt referenced in the January 13, 2010 letter, provided Resolute with an additional 30 days to provide a \u201cmore definitive action plan\u201d and was part of the corrective action process referenced in the responsibility determination. AR 10529; <em>see </em>AR 1757-58. The contracting officer found that Resolute took sufficient corrective action, including a renegotiation of debt owed to AAFES. AR 1757-58. While the contracting officer did not cite the February 2010 letter, this is not a basis to overturn her responsibility determination. As the contracting officer noted, Resolute began making payments on all debts in July 2010, and had consistently made payments since then. AR 1758.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>The Alleged Appearance of Impropriety</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">CCS alleges that the debt Resolute owed AAFES from a prior contract created an appearance of impropriety. CCS claims that FMWRC\u2019s and ARMP\u2019s involvement in the procurement, coupled with them and AAFES\u2019 interest in Resolute, created an \u201caura of inevitability\u201d in the outcome of the competition, and skewed the competition in favor of Resolute. However, CCS has not cited any ease where a procurement was overturned on the ground that a debt of an awardee to a government procuring entity created an appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">CCS contends that there was an appearance of impropriety for several reasons. First, CCS claims that Resolute\u2019s debt gave AAFES an interest in the financial success of Resolute and a reason to favor Resolute in the competition. However, as the Government points out, Resolute and AAFES had agreed upon a new payment schedule prior to award, and Resolute was current under that schedule. Further, the record contains no evidence that the debt affected any member of the Source Selection Committee, their scores, or the evaluations of any offerors.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Second, CCS argues that due to AAFES\u2019 partnership with FMWRC, AAFES had a vested interest in the outcome of the procurement, FMWRC as ARMP\u2019s parent organization would benefit from the fees Resolute would pay to ARMP for use of ARMP\u2019s network, and an award to Resolute would significantly expand ARMP\u2019s market share. However, there is no proof that the relationships of ARMP, AAFES, and FMWRC with Resolute were any different than their relationships with CCS. Both CCS and Resolute had prior working relationships with ARMP, and like Resolute, CCS planned to use ARMP at bases covered under the contract\u2014 as the solicitation permitted. AR 830-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Third, CCS points to an email from Resolute to an ARMP employee requesting that the employee inform AAFES how well Resolute and ARMP worked together as a team on an earlier project. The email states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apo\">AAFES will be evaluating bidders on their technical abilities and speed to market as extremely important criteria. The fact that ARMP and Resolute working together completed our [transfer of function] responsibilities within 35 days of our actually being told we could proceed. I believe this shows we make a formidable rapid response team. Any way you can get this information to them in writing [which] can only help our mutual ease[?] Bill Hart/ ARMP was listed as a reference in our reference binder that was submitted 3 weeks ago so there may be a couple ways you could get this scorecard to the right folks. Indirectly, I hope John Temple and Nate Wills are also aware of our mutual accomplishments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">AR 2195. According to CCS, this email shows both that Resolute was attempting to use its relationship with ARMP to its advan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tage in the evaluation and that ARMP had an interest in the procurement. The Government notes that no employee of ARMP, PMWRC, or AAFES ever responded to the email or agreed to reach out on Resolute\u2019s behalf. Nor is there any evidence that any member of the Source Selection Committee was contacted as a result of this email. As such, this email does not create an appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Government argues that CCS\u2019 appearance of impropriety argument is actually an allegation of bias in favor of Resolute on the part of government officials, and that CCS cannot meet the evidentiary standard to show bias which requires overcoming the presumption of good faith. In <em>Space Age Engineering, Inc. v. United States, </em>the Court applied the bias standard to an appearance of impropriety claim. 4 Cl.Ct. 739, 743-45 (1984) (finding that inferences and allegations failed to constitute the \u201cclear and convincing proof\u2019 required to show impropriety on the part of the government).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">CCS disputes that it alleged bad faith or bias, and thus argues it should not be required to meet the standard of \u201cwell-nigh irrefragable proof.\u201d Whether one characterizes CCS\u2019 claim as bias or an appearance of impropriety, CCS must demonstrate hard facts to prevail. <em>Turner Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>645 F.3d 1377, 1387 (Fed.Cir.2011); <em>see also CACI, </em>719 F.2d at 1583 (overturning trial court\u2019s decision to enjoin contract award based on an appearance of impropriety when the decision was based on \u201csuspicion and innuendo\u201d rather than hard facts); <em>Four Points By Sheraton v. United States, </em>66 Fed.Cl. 776, 787 (2005) (rejecting plaintiffs allegation of bias based upon alleged inconsistent or erroneous evaluations as vague and without evidentiary support); <em>Jacobs Tech. Inc. v. United States, </em>100 Fed.Cl. 198, 218 (2011) (finding that alleged access to offices, participation in meetings, and roles in development of databases were not \u201chard facts\u201d showing that a contractor obtained specific non-public source selection information about a pricing evaluation). In <em>Dynalectron Corporation v. United States, </em>the Claims Court declined to find an appearance of impropriety because the allegation was based on suspicion and innuendo, stating, \u201cPlaintiff wants relief because of how [the procurement] looked, not because of how it was.\u201d 4 Cl.Ct. 424, 430 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The only evidence proffered by CCS in support of this appearanee-of-impropriety claim is the email from Resolute to ARMP requesting that ARMP put in a good word for Resolute due to the good quality and speedy implementation of Resolute\u2019s prior work for ARMP. This email is similar to the situation addressed in <em>Galen </em>where the awardee listed a technical evaluator as a past performance reference, and the Federal Circuit held that the evaluator\u2019s name on a list of references was insufficient to show that the procurement was tainted. 369 F.3d at 1335-37. Similarly, the fact that Resolute requested an ARMP employee to provide what was essentially a past performance reference does not taint the competition here. As noted above, no employee of ARMP, FMWRC, or AAFES ever responded to the email, and there is no evidence in the record that ARMP contacted any member of the Source Selection Committee as a result of Resolute\u2019s email. CCS has failed to present sufficient evidence of an appearance of impropriety that tainted the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">1.

The solicitation was largely the same as the draft solicitation issued the prior month. <em>Compare </em>AR 119-231 <em>with </em>AR 366-463.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\">. The record only contains the proposals of Resolute, CCS, and NetNearU. AR 464-881 (Tabs 13-14), 909-1010 (Tab 15).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b261-48\">. CCS proposed a [* * *] fee to AAFES for four regions. AR 843-49 (Tab 13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b262-28\">. Resolute proposed an [* * *] fee to AAFES for all regions. AR 687.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\">. Mr. Wright is described as a financial technical expert and an advisor to the Source Selection Committee. AR 1500, 1519, 1754; Def.'s Mot. J. AR 15, 53, Aug. 8, 2011; Intervenor\u2019s Statement of Facts 25, Aug. 8, 2011; Def.'s Supp. Br. 10-11, Apr. 16, 2012. Mr. Wright holds the title of Financial Analyst III in the office of AAFES Advanced Telecommunications Initiatives. AR 8489.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\">. These AAFES standards are similar to FAR requirements. The first standard parallels FAR 9.104-1 (a) (requiring that the offeror \u201d[h]ave adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them\u201d) and the second is similar to 9.104-1(c) (requiring that the offeror \u201d[h]ave a satisfactory performance record\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b266-13\">. Defendant and Intervenor also filed motions to dismiss claiming that CCS lacked the financial ability to perform the contract and thus lacked standing as an interested party. The record indicates that CCS has standing. <em>See </em>AR 1521 (Source Selection Committee Report finding CCS' proposal \"to be a very viable solution\u201d and identifying CCS as financially strong, with a strong product offering, substantial experience, and aggressive monitoring of the network); <em>Ala. Aircraft Indust., Inc.-Birmingham v. United States, </em>83 Fed.Cl. 666, 685 (2008) (stating that \"DCAA's audit report, combined with payments of Alabama Aircraft expects to earn on the KC-135 PDM contract, strongly support the conclusion that if awarded the contract, Alabama Aircraft would have sufficient financial resources ____\u201d), <em>rev'd on other grounds, </em>586 F.3d 1372 (Fed.Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\">. In its response, Defendant stated that the Implementing Instructions were available to offerors prior to June 18, 2010, the information was made available online at a FMWRC web address, and that CCS either knew or should have known the information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b268-9\">. Mr. Jackson has evaluated financial and cost analyses in more than 185 bid protests and has been accepted as an expert by the Court of Federal Claims and Federal District Courts. First Jackson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4(d), 4(g). He has two masters degrees, one in Business Administration from Southern Illinois University and one in Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3(b)-(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\">. In so holding, the <em>Motorola </em>trial court departed from the holdings in <em>Standard Manufacturing Company v. United States, </em>7 Cl.Ct. 54 (1984) and <em>Magnavox Electronic Systems Company v. United States, </em>26 Cl.Ct. 1373 (1992). In <em>Standard Manufacturing, </em>the court held that a contractor\u2019s response to government requests for information created an implied contract that all responses would be fairly and honestly considered, satisfying the jurisdictional prerequisite for a preaward bid protest under Section 1491(a). 7 Cl. Ct. at 58-60. Similarly, in <em>Magnavox, </em>notices of intent to conduct a sole-source procurement published in the Commerce Business Daily coupled with a contractor\u2019s response that it could perform the work, resulted in an implied contract to give the contractor\u2019s response honest and fair consideration. 26 Cl.Ct. at 1377-78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b273-13\">. Mr. Evard, CCS' Executive Vice President, saw the slide \"showing that ARMP had an aggressive build-out plan,\u201d but assumed that the information on the slide was out of date and reflected ARMP\u2019s plans before the December MOA. Second Evard Decl. \u00b6 10. CCS\u2019 erroneous assumption does not change the fact that ARMP\u2019s role was disclosed during Industry Day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. Additionally, CCS claims violations of the FAR and Army Regulation 215-4, but these regulations do not apply to NAFIs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">. Neither Defendant nor Intervenor argue that CCS had notice of these employees\u2019 roles in the procurement by virtue of the Implementing Instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b279-52\">. Resolute presented its analysis in a different format than CCS. While CCS presented a full critical path graph for each installation, Resolute chose to group the installations into categories, then provide a critical path for each category. <em>Compare </em>AR 804-26 (Tab 14) <em>with </em>AR 535-41 (Tab 13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b281-14\">.
