SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-32\">On June 19,1944, the Standard Oil Company, Chevron\u2019s predecessor, and the United States Navy (\u201cNavy\u201d) entered into a Unit Plan Contract (\u201cthe UPC\u201d) to govern the joint operation and production of the oil and gas deposits located in three initial \u201ccommercially productive zones\u201d of the Elk Hills Reserve.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1977, Congress decided that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Elk Hills Reserve was no longer needed for defense and other strategic purposes and transferred the Navy\u2019s interests and management obligations to DOE.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">On February 10, 1996, Congress enacted a law that required DOE to retain a \u201cmutually acceptable\u201d independent petroleum engineer (\u201cIPE\u201d) to finalize the owners\u2019 equity interests in the Elk Hills Reserve. On June 17, 1996, the Secretary of DOE delegated this task to the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy (\u201cASFE\u201d). On July 8, 1996, the ASFE issued Administrative Order No. 96-01, \u201cProtocol on Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 Equity Finalization Implementation Process\u201d (the \u201cEquity IPE Protocol\u201d), to establish a procedure by which Chevron and DOE would present their respective positions to a \u201cmutually acceptable [IPE]\u201d to finalize equity. Although the Equity IPE Protocol clearly prohibited Chevron and DOE from having <em>ex parte </em>communications with the IPE, nevertheless, DOE\u2019s Deputy General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Procurement decided that she was authorized to provide the IPE with <em>ex parte </em>advice about equity finalization, and did so without Chevron\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">When this prohibited conduct was discovered by Chevron, the equity finalization process came to an abrupt impasse, but subsequently was renewed when the ASFE agreed to supplement the Equity IPE Protocol, authorizing DOE to hire an Independent Legal Advisor acceptable to Chevron and DOE to provide any legal advice requested by the IPE. In addition, DOE and Chevron executed two additional documents that enabled the equity finalization process to resume. The first was a May 19,1997 Agreement Regarding Fixing of Equity Interest at Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 for Purposes of Sale (the \u201cDecoupling Agreement\u201d). The Decoupling Agreement estimated the parties\u2019 interest in the four unitized zones in Elk Hills Reserve and provided that when equity was finalized, one party would compensate the other for any difference between the pre-sale equity estimate and the final equity determination. The second agreement, also executed on May 19, 1997, regarding the equity redetermination was the \u201cEquity Process Agreement.\u201d The purpose of the Equity Process Agreement was to establish an impartial, unbiased, and transparent process governing the ASFE\u2019s independent final equity decision to avoid the <em>ex parte </em>communications that arose regarding the Equity IPE Protocol.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">After an eleven day trial in Washington, D.C. and Dallas, Texas, the court determined that DOE not only violated the July 8, 1996 Equity IPE Protocol, as supplemented, to which Chevron was a third-party beneficiary, but DOE also \u201crepeatedly and materially\u201d violated the May 19, 1997 Equity Process Agreement. <em>See Chevron III, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 750, 803. The court also determined that written assurances made on May 19,1998 by DOE to Chevron that DOE was no longer engaged in prohibited <em>ex parte </em>communications \u201cwere misleading at that time and ... not honored by the DOE thereafter\u2014a classic breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The court\u2019s liability determination in this case, however, pre-dated the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Metcalf Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>742 F.3d 984 (Fed.Cir.2014). Therein, our appellate court held that the \u201cduty of good faith and fair dealing [is inherent in the contract] performance and enforcement,\u201d and \u201c[f]ailure to fulfill that duty constitutes a breach of contract, as does failure to fulfill a duty \u2018imposed by a promise stated in the agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 990 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 205, 235 (1981)). Therefore, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is thus an independent cause of action for which damages may be awarded. As such, even if the court\u2019s breach of contract rulings are errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ous, Chevron has established an independent cause of action for which it is entitled to recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The court has determined that Chevron is entitled to recover costs incurred to participate in the equity finalization of: (1) the Stevens Zone, excluding all financing costs, from July 8,1996 until June 17, 2010; (2) the Carneros Zone, excluding all financing costs, from May 19,1997 until July 6, 2000; and (3) costs incurred to file a Freedom of Information Act request and related proceedings. <em>See Chevron III, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 803-04; <em>see also Metric Constructors, Inc. v. NASA, </em>169 F.3d 747, 752 (Fed.Cir.1999) (holding that an agreement must be construed, pursuant to the \u201cmeaning that would be derived from the contract by a reasonably intelligent person acquainted with the contemporaneous circumstances\u201d (quoting <em>Hol-Gar Mfg. Corp. v. United States, </em>351 F.2d 972, 975 (Ct.Cl. 1965))). In addition, because of the Government\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d conduct relating to privilege assertions during discovery, the court also determined that, the Government was required to pay Chevron 42% of the legal fees that Chevron incurred from February 16, 2007 to March 5, 2009 as a sanction. <em>See Chevron III, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">At the liability trial, Chevron presented several alternative damage scenarios, but none conformed to the zones, precise periods, and specified costs that the court subsequently determined was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 805. Therefore, Chevron was instructed to provide the court with an itemized financial statement of the costs authorized by the court as reliance damages and sanctions, verified by a certified public accountant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">In response, Chevron filed a July 2, 2013 Supplemental Brief, together with: a June 26, 2013 Declaration of Norman D. Stone<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Ex. A); a June 28, 2013 Declaration of Kimberly Anne Melton<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Ex. B); a July 2, 2013 Declaration of Kenneth Metcalfe, CPA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Ex. C); and Mr. Metcalfe\u2019s work papers (Ex. D). In response, the Government filed the December 6, 2013 Supplemental Response, together with the Declarations of Alan A Burzlaff, P.E.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Burzlaff Ex. A) and Michele M. Riley, CPA<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Riley Ex. B). On January 27, 2014, Chevron filed a Supplemental Reply, together with Supplemental Declarations from Norman D. Stone (Stone Ex. A) and Kenneth P. Metcalfe (Metcalfe Ex. B), and an \u201cAppendix.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Between February 24, 2014 and March 5, 2014, the court and parties also exchanged a series of email communications regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>clarifications to the parties\u2019 supplemental briefing. On March 10, 2014, the court placed these emails on the record (\u201c3/10/14 Notice\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On March 12, 2014, the Government filed a Response to the March 10, 2014 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">On April 8, 2014, the court also issued an Order requesting that the parties calculate costs for one category of Chevron\u2019s estimated costs, based on certain assumptions. On April 14,2014, the parties filed a Joint Notice in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">II. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">A. The Relevant Burdens Of Proof Regarding Reliance Damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">To demonstrate entitlement to reliance damages, a plaintiff must proffer evidence that: \u201c(1) the damages were reasonably foreseeable by the breaching party at the time of contracting; (2) the breach is a substantial causal factor in the damages; and (3) the damages are shown with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Sys. Fuels, Inc. v. United States, </em>666 F.3d 1306, 1311 (Fed.Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Ind. Mich. Power Co. v. United States, </em>422 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2005)). Although a plaintiff need not demonstrate the quantum of damages \u201cwith absolute exactness or mathematical precision,\u201d a plaintiff may not recover speculative damages. <em>See Ind. Mich. Power, </em>422 F.3d at 1373 (quoting <em>San Carlos Irrigation &amp; Drainage Dist. v. United States, </em>111 F.3d 1557, 1563 (Fed.Cir.1997) (recognizing that \u201cabsolute exactness or mathematical precision\u201d need not be obtained in determining damages (internal quotations omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">Once a plaintiff has established entitlement to reliance damages, the defendant may seek a reduction by \u201cany loss the defendant can prove with reasonable certainty the plaintiff would have suffered had the contract been performed.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 38(2)(a) (2011); <em>see also </em>Restatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>(Second) of Contracts \u00a7 349 (1981); <em>Westfed Holdings, Inc. v. United States, </em>407 F.3d 1352, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2005) (affirming a trial court\u2019s finding that the Government did not meet its \u201cburden to prove with reasonable certainty the amount of offsetting benefit retained by [plaintiff]\u201d). Where the Government has elected to breach a contract, it bears the burden to prove that a plaintiffs expenditures would not have been lost despite the breach. <em>See Am. Capital Corp. v. FDIC, </em>472 F.3d 859, 869 (Fed.Cir.2006); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cDoubts are generally resolved against the party in breach.\u201d (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 352 emt. a (1981))).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Discretion lies with the trial court to determine proof of reliance damages. <em>See Glendale Fed. Bank, FSB v. United States, </em>378 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed.Cir.2004) (\u201cGiven the complexities of reconstructing the transactions and their consequences, absent a compelling showing of clear error, [the trial court\u2019s findings] should be the end of the matter.\u201d); <em>see also Dairyland Power Coop. v. United States, </em>645 F.3d 1363, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2011) (\u201cAs the primary finder of fact, part of the trial court\u2019s role is to fashion a fair assignment of responsibility\u2014even where ... the solution departs from the specific relief requested by either party.\u201d); <em>Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. United States, </em>573 F.3d 1271, 1276 (Fed.Cir.2009) (\u201c[The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit] affords the [United States] Court of Federal Claims wide discretion in assessing an appropriate quantum of damages.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">B. The Plaintiffs Claim For Reliance Damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">In response to the court\u2019s Order in <em>Chevron III </em>requiring that Chevron provide an itemized financial statement of court-identified costs, Chevron stated that it \u201cgenerally did not record or track its equity finalization costs by zone. Equity finalization for all zones was viewed and treated as a single project.\u201d 6/26/13 Stone Decl. \u00b6 7; <em>see also </em>7/2/13 Metcalfe Decl. \u00b6 12 (\u201cThere are no specific cost centers or designations in the Chevron accounting system corresponding to the four categories of damages identified by the court.\u201d); TR 1116 (6/3/11 Musika Testimony) (\u201c[T]he [accounting] system is not maintained to provide us any guidance or assurance that an expense was incurred in connection with Elk Hills finalization process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Instead, Chevron proposed an alternative methodology, by estimating all of its equity finalization costs<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and then allocating them to one of six major categories, as reflected in Court Exhibit l.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Court Exhibit 1: The Plaintiff\u2019s Initial Claim As Of October 2010, Presented By Cost Category._</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Category Cost Source:</p>\n<p id=\"AHR\">1.

Moreover, the Government contended that Chevron\u2019s allocation was biased towards the Stevens Zone. 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, 64-65.

Furthermore, Chevron allocated no payroll costs to the Carneros Zone, because equity finalization for that zone \u201cwas handled by outside contractors and lawyers.\u201d 1/27/14 Stone Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 19 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has considered salaried employees, working on multiple projects, as an indirect overhead cost. <em>See Charles G. Williams Constr., Inc. v. White, </em>326 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2003) (\u201cIndirect costs are usually those costs that are incurred despite ... inactivity on a project, such as home office overhead including accounting and payroll services, general insurance, salaries of upper level management, heat, electricity, taxes, depreciation. A contractor recovers its indirect costs by allocating them on a proportionate basis among all of its contracts.\u201d (quoting <em>Charles G. Williams Constr., Inc. v. White, </em>271 F.3d 1055, 1057-58 (Fed.Cir.2001)). But, that does not mean such employee costs must be allocated equally among those projects. For this reason, our appellate court has endorsed using an internal accounting system to establish \u201coverhead costs with reasonable certainty,\u201d to allocate costs to particular projects. <em>See Kan. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>685 F.3d 1361, 1369-71 (Fed.Cir.2012)' (\u201cThis court upholds an internal accounting system as showing overhead costs with reasonable certainty when it allocates a portion of the expenses to a particular\u2019 project using codes[.]\u201d) (citing <em>Carolina Power &amp; Light v.

And I guarantee that we both worked 40 hours a week plus on the Stevens, plus we did, in addition to that, other zones. And that\u2019s the way equity always was.\u201d). The court is aware that Mr. Stone and Mr. Holtzclaw\u2019s responsibilities were different than those of Mr. Burzlaff, despite the Government\u2019s statement that he was \u201cthe DOE counterpart to Mr. Stone.\u201d 12/6/13 Burzlaff Decl. \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">In the court\u2019s judgment, Mr. Metcalfe\u2019s approach was an accurate and reasonable estimate of Chevron\u2019s total costs by zone, because it considered different costs factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>and is \u201cgenerally similar to the relative percentage value of each zone.\u201d 7/2/13 Metcalfe Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2526 (\u201cThe results of this comparison provide a level of independent confirmation that the relative costs ... are reasonable, as it is reasonable that Chevron would have utilized its resources on the four zones generally consistent with the expected values of each of these zones.\u201d). Therefore, the court has determined that 23.2% of the salary and benefits for Mr. Stone and Mr. Holtzelaw should be deducted from Chevron\u2019s damages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The Government also proposed an \u201cOther Indirect Labor\u201d reduction of $784,479 from Chevron\u2019s 10/30/13 claim. 12/6/13 Riley Decl.

On April 8, 2014, the parties were asked to provide an estimated allocation of costs for the \u201cOther\u201d category, based on Mr. Metcalfe\u2019s methodology, adjusted to incorporate the Payroll and Benefits allocations reflected in Court Exhibit 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-35\">On April 14, 2014, the parties advised the court that of the $2,272,529 Chevron claimed in the \u201cOther\u201d category, both parties estimated that $1,930,565 should be allocated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Stevens Zone if the Payroll and Benefits allocations in Court Exhibit 10 are used. 4/14/14 Joint Notice 1. In addition, Chevron proposed allocating $28,614 to the Carneros Zone. 4/14/14 Joint Notice 1. The Government, however, argued that the court instead should allocate $7,427 to the Carneros Zone and criticized Chevron for failing to account for the date limitations imposed by the court, <em>i.e., </em>the exclusion of amounts incurred prior to May 19, 1997 or after July 6, 2000. 4/14/14 Joint Notice 1, 2 n. *. Chevron responded that \u201cmost of the Carneros payroll and \u2018other\u2019 costs were incurred after the OHA appeal was decided and work on the Carneros Zone ended\u201d and \u201cthat limiting the Carneros amount to the 1997-2000 timeframe would require a more complicated methodology.\u201d 4/14/14 Joint Notice 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">As the court previously ruled, Chevron may recover costs incurred for the Carneros Zone equity finalization \u201cuntil July 6, 2000, the date that Chevron\u2019s appeal to OHA was denied.\u201d <em>Chevron III, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 803. Therefore, Chevron\u2019s damages claim is reduced by $334,537, <em>i.e., </em>the difference between Chevron\u2019s initial claim of $2,272,529 and the revised allocation of $1,930,565 for the Stevens Zone plus $7,427 for the Carneros Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">iii. External Non-Legal Professional And Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">As to cost allocations for external non-legal professional and labor, Chevron allocated 100% of the software vendor Teehbase International (\u201cTechbase\u201d) costs to the Stevens Zone, although \u201cthe software ... was used by Chevron throughout the equity finalization process for all four zones.\u201d 12/6/13 Burzlaff Decl. \u00b6 39 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Instead, the Government contended that Chevron should \u201capply the monthly allocation ratio from the Payroll and Benefits category to the monthly costs incurred by Chevron for using the Teehbase software, because the monthly payroll cost allocations are a reliable metric of the relative work performed by Chevron on each zone, month-to-month.\u201d 12/6/13 Burzlaff Decl. \u00b6 41. Doing so, however, would reduce Chevron\u2019s damages claim in this category by $346,903: a reduction of $353,733 for the Stevens Zone, but an increase of $6,830 for the Carneros Zone. 12/6/13 Burzlaff Decl. \u00b6 42; 12/6/13 Riley Decl. \u00b6 18 and Ex. 3.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">Chevron responded that, because \u201cTech-base later was used for [the Shallow Oil Zone] data as well, at no incremental cost, does not justify splitting the Techbase costs [among the] zones.\u201d PI. Suppl. Reply 7 n. 6 (citing 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 8; 1/27/14 Stone Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 19). That is so, because the Stevens Zone equity finalization was the reason that Techbase was retained. 10/30/13 Stone Dep. 134-35 (testifying that the Stevens Zone equity finalization would not have proceeded without the Techbase system).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">Chevron conceded that it used Tech-base\u2019s software in more than just the Stevens Zone. PI. Suppl. Reply 7 n. 6 (\u201cTechbase later was used for [Shallow Oil Zone] data as well[.]\u201d); JE 1755 at 8 (describing Techbase International as a \u201c[s]oftware vendor ... that provided Techbase software for use in equity finalization\u201d); JE 1755 at 65 (listing an \u201cinteractive demonstration of ...

Of course, Chevron may be correct that it would not have undertaken equity finalization of the Stevens Zone, but for Techbase\u2019s software. But that is irrelevant. <em>See Glendale Fed. Bank, </em>378 F.3d at 1311 (\u201c[T]he focus of a recovery based on the reliance interest is the real costs incurred for capital and services that ... would not have [been] incurred but for the contract and its subsequent breach.\u201d). The proper inquiry is whether the Teehbase software costs were made in reliance on the procedures promised by May 19,1997 Equity Process Agreement. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 344(b) (1981) (Damages may be awarded to protect the \u201creliance interest\u201d of a promisee, i.e., the \u201cinterest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>being reimbursed for loss caused by reliance on the contract by being put in as good a position as [it] would have been in had the contract not been made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Therefore, allowing Chevron to allocate 100% of the Teehbase software costs, without consideration of the benefits that Chevron received in other zones would overcompensate Chevron. Because the Government\u2019s allocation depends on the monthly allocation ratio from the Payroll and Benefits category, the parties agree that, using the Payroll and Benefit allocations in Court Exhibit 10, the amount allocated to the Stevens Zone for the Teehbase software should be reduced by $203,180, and the amount allocated to the Carneros Zone should be reduced by $0. Docket No. 413. Thus, Chevron\u2019s claim for this category will be reduced by $203,180.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">iv. In-House Technical Consultants.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The Government argued that Chevron\u2019s 75.4% allocation of costs for in-house technical consultants to the Stevens Zone is \u201cis inconsistent with [Chevron\u2019s] own supporting documentation.\u201d 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b6 46. The Manager of Chevron\u2019s consultant team testified that they \u201ckept track of their hours very accurately and ... they would know exactly to which zone each charge would apply.\u201d 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b644 (citing 5/3/11 Thakur Dep. 101-02 (stating that Chevron\u2019s in-house consultants recorded this information on GO-113 Work Orders)). By examining the titles and work described, the Government argued that only 57% of the total cost for the GO-113 Work Orders should be allocated to the Stevens Zone. 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b6 45, Ex. K. In addition, \u201c99 percent of the line items [in Chevron\u2019s Native File] for the work performed by consultants in 1999 are identified, in the \u2018title\u2019 field, as being incurred in connection with the [Shallow Oil Zone].\u201d 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b6 47 (citing JE 1868 (5/26/11 Native File 3B)). Accordingly, the Government would allocate Chevron\u2019s in-house consultant costs for the Stevens Zone as follows: 50% for work from August 1997 through October 1997; 100% for work from November 1997 through March 1998; and 10% for work from April 1998 onward. 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b648.

He must, however, then prove that amount with reasonable certainty.\u201d). Mr. Stone\u2019s <em>post-hoc </em>explanation, however, failed to do so. 12/6/13 Riley Deck \u00b6 13 (noting that allocating costs based on Mr. Stone\u2019s chronology was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with Mr. Thakur\u2019s explanation of the GO-113 Work Orders) (citing 5/3/11 Thakur Dep. 14, 59-60). For this reason, Chevron\u2019s claim will be reduced by $789,451 for this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>v. Miscellaneous Expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Chevron\u2019s claim included $57,859 in miscellaneous expenses for the Stevens and Cameras Zones. 1/27/14 Metcalfe Ex. 1; 12/6/13 Riley Decl. Ex. 4.1. Because Chevron allocated these expenses based on an average allocation of other categories, the Government\u2019s recommended adjustments to those other categories would necessitate a reduction of $2,826 to Chevron\u2019s Miscellaneous Expenses claim. 12/6/13 Riley Decl. \u00b6 20 and Ex. 3. Chevron did not object, other than to dispute that \u201ccost items of less than $10,000 each\u201d does not overcome the assumption \u201cthat the process for making the assignments was reasonable and resulted in reasonably certain amounts for the categories identified by the [cjourt.\u201d 1/27/14 Stone Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The court has determined Chevron is entitled to $55,033 for this category, reflecting a $2,826 reduction.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">vi. Legal Costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The Government argued that Chevron\u2019s allocation of legal costs also is biased in favor of the Stevens Zone.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b6 53. Specifically, four invoices from the law firm of Fried Frank, in the amount of $282,171, \u201cshould, but do not, include allocations to the [other three zones],\u201d because during the relevant time period Chevron\u2019s lawyers were woi\u2019king on legal issues applicable to all four zones. 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b6\u00b6 51-52. In addition, the Fried Frank invoices do not provide any chronology or itemized description of services performed. 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b6 51 (noting that the only chronology available was identification of \u201clegal-related activities\u201d from the Equity Finalization Chronology (JE 17)). As a result, Chevron\u2019s costs for this category should be reduced by $126,420. 12/6/13 Burzlaff Deck \u00b6 54; 12/6/13 Riley Deck \u00b6 20 and Ex. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Chevron responded that, because \u201c[t]he value of the Stevens Zone was about 98 percent of the combined value of the [other three zones],\u201d it was reasonable to assign all of Chevron\u2019s legal costs to the Stevens Zone, because \u201cChevron would have incurred the same costs on these issues for the Stevens Zone alone.\u201d 1/27/14 Stone Suppl. Deck \u00b6 19. In addition, Mr. Burzlaff had no basis for assigning 60% of these legal costs to the Shallow Oil Zone. 1/27/14 Stone Suppl. Deck \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Furthermore, Chevron allocated <em>all </em>legal costs to the Stevens Zone, because the May 19, 1997 Decoupling and Equity Process Agreements were required before Chevron would resume equity finalization for the Stevens Zone. 1/27/14 Stone Suppl. Deck \u00b6 19. Both of these agreements, however, applied to all four zones. <em>See </em>12/6/13 Riley Deck \u00b6 21 and Ex. 3 (allocating legal costs); 1/27/14 Stone Suppl. Deck \u00b6 19 (acknowledging that the May 19, 1997 Decoupling and Equity Process Agreements \u201capplied to all four zones\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">Moreover, as a matter of law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that speculative damages are not recoverable; in this instance, an invoice, without any description of services, is insufficient to meet Plaintiffs burden. <em>See Ind. Mich. Power, </em>422 F.3d at 1373 (precluding recovery of \u201cspeculative damages\u201d); <em>see also Glendale Fed. Bank, </em>378 F.3d at 1311\u2014 12 (holding that establishing damages \u201cis a matter of proof; if too speculative, it can and should be denied as the burden lies with the plaintiff to establish its damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">For these reasons, the court has determined that Chevron\u2019s claim will be reduced by $126,420.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-16\">2. As To Other Costs Claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">a. Summary Of The Government\u2019s Argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">At trial, one of the Government\u2019s expert damage witnesses initially proposed a $24 million offset, reasoning that is the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that Chevron would have spent \u201cbut for\u201d the Government\u2019s breaches. <em>Chevron III, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 805. The court rejected that approach, because it was based on a misperception of the relevant theory underlying reliance damages. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[Establishing that Chevron retained <em>some </em>benefit is not a sufficient basis to establish an offset in a sum certain, a fact that the Government\u2019s damage expert recognized.\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>see also </em>12/6/13 Riley Decl. \u00b6 29 n. 8.

Dccl. Ex. 3 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-47\">Chevron countered that Ms. Riley\u2019s approach was \u201cflawed in that[,] rather than analyzing the overall support provided by all of the available information, she proposes to reduce Chevron\u2019s claimed costs based on individual transactions that she deems as imperfectly supported.\u201d 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deel. \u00b6 18. Deducting costs for inter-company or small-dollar transactions for lack of support is unreasonable, because, \u201cit would simply be too burdensome to retrieve all of the related supporting documentation\u201d or where \u201cone would not expect to find the type of \u2018support\u2019 she demands.\u201d 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deck \u00b6 18. Secondary documentation supports 86% of Chevron\u2019s claim, which is higher than that of many spent nuclear fuel cases. 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deel. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-49\">It is well established that all costs claimed must have supporting documentation. <em>See Ind. Mich. Power, </em>422 F.3d at 1373 (precluding recovery of \u201cspeculative damages\u201d). Moreover, these transaction costs are not, as Chevron suggests, simply small-dollar or <em>de minimis </em>amounts. For these reasons, the court has determined that Chevron\u2019s claim will be reduced by $1,194,471.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-50\">ii. Improper Fixed Costs Not Related To Equity Finalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-51\">The Government also argued that, but for the Elk Hills equity finalization, Chevron nevertheless would have incurred a portion of the fixed costs of the Energy Technology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Group.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> 12/6/13 Riley Deel. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34. According to Chevron\u2019s internal policies and procedures, \u201ckey cost components included in the standard rates developed by the [Energy Technology Group] to be charged to other Chevron programs included payroll costs, office rent, computers and software, telecommunications and network connectivity, material and supplies, general travel costs, the president, planning, human resources, and finance.\u201d 12/6/13 Riley Deck \u00b633 (citing CVXD5238-CVXD5247 (6/6/05 Chevron ETC Labor Rates)); 6/3/11 TR 1124-26. In addition, but for the Elk Hills equity finalization, Chevron would have re-tasked the Energy Technology Group to other projects. 12/6/13 Riley Deck \u00b633 (citing 5/3/11 Thakur Dep. 60-62).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The Government calculated that 43.1% of the fixed costs of Chevron\u2019s Energy Technology Group \u201cwould have existed even without the Elk Hills equity finalization process.\u201d 12/6/13 Riley Deck \u00b6 34. This amount was ascertained by comparing the rate of the most senior Chevron employee assigned directly to the Elk Hills project (Mr. Stone at $91 per hour) with the rate of the highest Energy Technology Group employee (approximately $55 per hour).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> 12/6/13 Riley Deck \u00b6 34 (citing JE 1911 \u00b6 18 (6/1/11 Musika Deck)).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">As Court Exhibit 13 shows, the Government proposed that Chevron\u2019s claim for Internal Technical Consultants be reduced by 43.1% or $1,615,264.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Court Exhibit 13: The Government\u2019s Proposed Adjustment For Internal Technical Consultants.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Stevens Zone Cameros Zone</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Total CVX Internal Technical Costs $ 3,747,712 S</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Adjustment of Labor Rate for Removal of Resources Costs 43.1% 43.1%</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Adjustment to Claimed Costs $ 1,615,264 S</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Source: 12/6/13 Riley Deel. \u00b6 34, Exs. 4.2 and 4.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Chevron responded that, in spent nuclear fuel cases, \u201cit is typical for an internal group to include overhead in its charging process, in exactly the way that [Chevron\u2019s Energy Technology Group] [is] billing here.\u201d 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deck \u00b6 22 (citing <em>Bos. Edison Co. v. United States, </em>658 F.3d 1361, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2011) (affirming the award of \u201coverhead costs associated with the procurement of materials and capital expenditures\u201d related to the Government\u2019s breach of its contractual obligation to collect nuclear waste)). For this same reason, these overhead costs were billed to DOE by Mr. Burzlaffs firm. 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deck \u00b6 23. Therefore, as part of Chevron\u2019s award, it should receive $3,747,712 for the amount that Chevron saved not hiring outside consultants. 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deck \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">In the court\u2019s judgment, it was foreseeable that Chevron\u2019s Energy Technology Group would be required to conduct equity finalization. If the Group had been assigned to other projects, presumably it would have contributed to profitable work and Chevron would have received a reasonable a return for this work product. <em>See Cyberchron Corp. v. Calldata Sys. Dev., Inc., </em>47 F.3d 39, 46 (2d Cir.1995) (allowing plaintiff to recover \u201creasonable overhead costs when it is shown that there is a demonstrable past history of ongoing business operations, without requiring proof that a specific alternative project would have absorbed the overhead costs at issue\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>see also Autotrol Corp. v. Cont'l Water Sys. Corp., </em>918 F.2d 689, 694-95 (7th Cir.1990) (allowing plaintiff to recover overhead costs on a reliance theory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>where the plaintiff established \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that the overhead costs would have been covered with another contract if the breached contract never occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Since Chevron would have incurred these overhead costs to avoid the more expensive alternative of retaining outside consultants, Chevron is entitled to recover internal technical consultant costs,</p>\n<p id=\"Aii\">iii. Accrued Benefit Costs Not Related To Equity Finalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In addition, the Government argued that four categories of employee benefits paid by Chevron, stock plan, savings plus plan, OPEB [Other Post-Employment Benefits] Cash, and OPEB non-cash, should not be allocated to all employees who worked on the Stevens Zone. 12/6/13 Riley Decl. \u00b6 37 (citing JE 1911 \u00b6 20 (6/1/11 Musika Deck)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Chevron responded that its Stevens Zone payroll reflected accrued benefits paid. 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deck \u00b626 (\u201cChevron\u2019s method to apply payroll burdens to its personnel is consistent with that of many organizations I have seen throughout my career.\u201d). As to the specific benefits contested by the Government, Mr. Metcalfe confirmed that Chevron\u2019s personnel \u201cactually do receive\u201d these benefits. 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deck \u00b627 (\u201c[S]tock options are not included in that benefit burden, and are not included in the amounts in total, and therefore should not be deducted.\u201d) (citing 6/1/11 TR 403-07 (Melton); 6/3/11 TR 1227-30 (Metcalfe)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The court has determined that the $1,102,362 in accrued benefit costs claimed by Chevron and contested by the Government are typical and appropriate costs that have been identified with reasonable certainty. <em>See Sys. Fuels, Inc. v. United States, </em>79 Fed.Cl. 37, 65-66 (2007) (\u201cThe payroll loader associated with employee benefit costs is for the most part a proper, directly allocable component of the internal labor costs for the mitigation activities, as the [Government concedes.\u201d), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>457 Fed.Appx. 930 (Fed.Cir.2012). Therefore, Chevron is entitled to recover these accrued benefit costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">iv. Other Costs Not Related To Equity Finalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">At the liability trial, the Government proposed to deduct other costs claimed by Chevron that were not related to equity finalization. 6/11/11 Musika Deck \u00b6 21 (JE 1911). After reviewing Chevron\u2019s revised damages claim, the Government found that Chevron still claimed $15,094 that should be excluded. 12/6/13 Riley Deck \u00b6 38 (citing JE 1718 \u00b6 18 (10/29/10 Stone Deck)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Chevron responded that it has accounted for all appropriate adjustments. 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deck Ex. 1 (reallocating $15,094 in costs for \u201cInvotex Adjustment for Sales-Related Costs\u201d from the Stevens Zone to \u201cOther\u201d). Of this $15,094, Chevron subtracted $11,021 from its claim, but indicated that $4,073 was attributable to invoices outside the date court\u2019s allowable time period, and thus had not been included in Chevron\u2019s original claim and did not need to be deducted from Chevron\u2019s claim. 1/27/14 Metcalfe Suppl. Deck Ex. 1 (decreasing the \u201cStevens Out of Date Range\u201d category by $4,073). The Government agreed with this analysis. 3/3/14 Riley Suppl. Deck Ex. 3 n. 4; Docket No. 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">Accordingly, $0 will be deducted from Chevron\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">III.

Moreover, the United States Supreme Court historically has held that a federal trial court has the inherent power to award attorneys\u2019 fees as a sanction. <em>See Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 45, 111 S.Ct. 2123. Although a federal trial court has discretion to impose sanctions in its court\u2019s inherent powers, it may not circumvent the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See Bank of Nova Scotia v.

[c]ourt with an arsenal of discovery sanctions designed to discourage dilatory practices and encourage full disclosure of relevant information prior to trial\u201d). In addition, RCFC 37(a)(5) authorizes the court to require a party to pay reasonable expenses incurred to compel disclosure from another party.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <em>See Ingalls Shipbuilding, </em>857 F.2d at 1450 (\u201cThe decision whether to impose discovery sanctions rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d); <em>see also Willhite v.

Lewis, </em>982 F.2d 1255, 1260 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that bad faith implicitly was established where a party engaged in intentional disruption of discovery process).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">As the court previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">Although Chevron was able to fund the costs to ascertain whether the Government\u2019s privilege assertions were legitimate in this case, most litigants cannot afford such protracted discovery battles. In ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>dition, the collateral discovery proceedings delayed the trial in this case by four years and imposed significant, unnecessary costs on Chevron, as well as the court.... [T]he United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit described \u201cbad faith\u201d conduct in words that express the court\u2019s view about this case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">Indeed, to say that the counsel\u2019s conduct during discovery raises the collective eyebrow of this court would be to understate the severity of their transgressions. Counsel\u2019s tactics during discovery evinced a brazen disregard for the legal process. Throughout discovery, counsel\u2019s strategy consisted of efforts to obfuscate, cover-up, and subvert evidence that was properly discoverable and responsive to [plaintiffs discovery] requests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">Federal trial courts necessarily tend to trust the parties\u2019 counsels\u2019 assertion of privilege, as officers of the court. But, when that trust is misplaced, appropriate consequences should follow. The court has determined that DOE and Government discovery tactics as to privileged documents in this case constitute \u201cbad faith\u201d conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\"><em>Chevron III, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 807 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Advanced Display Sys., Inc. v. Kent State Univ., </em>212 F.3d 1272, 1288 (Fed.Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">For the aforementioned reasons, the court has determined that Chevron is entitled to $904,483, as a sanction for the Government\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d conduct related to privilege assertions during discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">V.
