The Government opposed Tektel\u2019s motion to amend the complaint and filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that Tektel\u2019s March 17, 2011 claim letter to the District Court was untimely and that Tektel had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.

Cisneros, </em>16 F.3d 1204, 1210 (Fed.Cir.1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Tektel contends that both the September and October Orders were express contracts between Tektel and the District Court. The Government counters that the Orders were issued under the terms of Nortel\u2019s Prime Contract, and that as a schedule partner under the Prime Contract, Tektel was authorized to act on behalf of Nortel, but did not itself have privity of contract with the Government. The Government premises its argument on boxes two and 13 of each Order. In box two, the District Court identified the contract number as that of Nortel\u2019s Prime Contract. In box 13, the District Court identified the \u201ctype of order\u201d as a \u201cnon judiciary wide contract including GSA Federal Supply Services and schedule contracts (terms and conditions attached)\u201d delivery/task order. DX 001, 006; Tr. 5:21-6:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In focusing on references to Nortel\u2019s Prime Contract in both Orders, the Government asks the Court to ignore the District Court\u2019s express designation of Tektel as the \u201ccontractor\u201d in box nine. Without any supporting evidence, the Government contends this designation was no more than a scrivener\u2019s error. In essence, the Government urges the Court to correct the unproven scrivener\u2019s error by reading out the express designation of Tektel as the contractor in box nine, and to give meaning only to Nortel\u2019s contract number in box two and the cryptic order description in box 13 referencing the FSS contract. As such, the Government asks the Court to conclude that the Orders were issued under the terms and conditions of Nortel\u2019s Prime Contract and its Pricelist, Nortel was the contractor, Tektel was Nor-tel\u2019s representative, and Tektel did not have privity with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">However, the dearth of evidence of the scrivener\u2019s error advocated by the Government prevents the Court from finding such an error. As the Court commented during the hearing on the Government\u2019s first motion to dismiss, \u201cNowhere in [the] record does the term scrivener\u2019s error appear. I have no testimony. I have no documentation. I have no basis whatsoever on which to enter a factual finding in support of my decision under 12(b)(1) on jurisdiction, which of course requires a factual predicate.\u201d Tr. 14:11-18, 58:10-15. Defendant never <em>attempted </em>to remedy this factual void. Following this hearing and Tektel\u2019s filing of an amended complaint, the Government filed two dispositive motions, the subject motion and a motion for summary judgment. In support of its motion for summary judgment, the Government submitted a declaration from the District Court\u2019s contracting officer\u2014the same contracting officer who signed the Orders naming only Tektel as the contractor\u2014but that contracting officer never mentioned the scrivener\u2019s error. Summ. J.App. 015. In addition, there is no reference to this scrivener\u2019s error in the 184-page appendix the Government filed in support of the subject motion, or any of the appendices filed by the parties in support of earlier motions. <em>See </em>DX 1-184. As such, there is no factual predicate to support a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the Orders\u2019 references to Tektel as the contractor were scrivener\u2019s errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In contrast to the suggestion that Tektel was not a contractor, the course of dealing between Tektel and the District Court surrounding both the execution of the Orders and performance evinces a contractual relationship. <em>See Dalles Irr.

United States., </em>161 Ct.Cl. 418, 422 n. 4 (1963) (citations omitted) (\u201cThe conduct of the parties under a contract plays an important role in interpreting it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Here, the Orders are bilateral contracts arising from the District Court\u2019s September 30, 2009 instructions to Tektel\u2019s president, via the procurement administrator, to sign and return the September Order, and the president\u2019s signature on both Orders in the box marked \u201ccontractor/vendor (option for bilateral signature).\u201d DX 001, 006. As FAR 13.302-3(a) specifies, the contracting officer shall require written acceptance of the purchase order by the contractor when \u201cit is desired\u201d to consummate a binding contract between the parties before the contractor undertakes performance. Pursuant to FAR 13.302-3(a), Tektel consummated a \u201cbinding contract\u201d here when Tektel\u2019s president signed the Orders as instructed in the September 30, 2009 letter from the District Court\u2019s procurement administrator.6 ***<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if these Orders are not viewed as binding bilateral purchase orders, contracts would have been formed by virtue of Tektel\u2019s substantial performance of the Orders. As this Court recognized in <em>Ulysses, Inc. v. United States, </em>a purchase order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\">[I]s an offer by the government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specific conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the order, by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by ... substantial performance prior to the due date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">110 Fed.Cl. 618, 637 (2013) (citations and quotation marks omitted) (\u201cOnce the offeree substantially performs, a unilateral offer is irrevocable.\u201d); <em>see also </em>FAR 13.004(b) (2006). Here, because Tektel performed under the Orders, the contract that resulted from such performance was a contract between the party that issued the purchase orders, the District Court, and the party that performed, Tektel.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">The course of performance further evinces a contract between the District Court and Tektel. The District Court issued the Orders directly to Tektel. The Orders expressly identified Tektel as the \u201ccontractor,\u201d and, other than describing Nortel telephone equipment, did not reference Nortel. In its September 30, 2009 letter to Tektel, the District Court advised Tektel it had been awarded a \u201ccontract,\u201d and Tektel and the District Court began the \u201crelationship\u201d immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>via a telephonic conference discussing substantive details of the work Tektel was to perform. Tektel alone performed under the Orders. In all the correspondence surrounding Tektel\u2019s performance of these Orders, the District Court referred to Tektel as the contractor. When the District Court canceled the contract, it addressed the termination letter solely to Tektel. It was Tektel\u2019s conduct alone relating to the District Court\u2019s security requirements that prompted the District Court\u2019s cancelation. Thus, even assuming that the Purchase Orders by their terms did not constitute binding bilateral agreements, this course of performance establishes that Tektel had privity of contract with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The clause in Nortel\u2019s Prime Contract purporting to disclaim privity between Tektel as a schedule partner and the Government does not alter this result. Likewise, the clause in the Partner Agreement between Tektel and Nortel disclaiming privity between Tektel and the Government by virtue of the Partner Agreement is not controlling. As our appellate authority recognized long ago, \u201c[a] mere statement that a contractual relation did not exist would be ineffective if all the elements of such a relation were otherwise present.\u201d <em>Continental Ill. Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chi. v. United States, </em>112 Ct.Cl. 563, 566, 81 F.Supp. 596 (1949). Moreover, the Court is not bound by agreements that are contrary to law or fact. <em>See Int\u2019l Paper Co. v. United States, </em>39 Fed.Cl. 478, 481-82 (1997) (footnote omitted) (citing <em>Kaminer Constr. Corp. v. United States, </em>203 Ct.Cl. 182, 197, 488 F.2d 980 (1973)) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that the parties may not stipulate the court into error, for the court may disregard any stipulation that is inadvertent, contrary to law, contrary to fact, or made without proper authority.\u201d); <em>see also Swift &amp; Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., </em>243 U.S. 281, 289, 37 S.Ct. 287, 61 L.Ed. 722 (1917) (citations omitted) (\u201c[T]he court cannot be controlled by [an] agreement ... on a ... question of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Finally, the Government submits as a general matter that under the Federal Supply Schedule program, there can be no privity between the Government and distributors. Motion 15-16. To support this sweeping assertion, the Government relies on a sentence from a 1983 article about antitrust issues in Government contracting. <em>Id. </em>at 15 (citing C. Stanley Dees &amp; Robert M. Lindquist, \u201cAntitrust Considerations in Government Contracting,\u201d Briefing Papers (May 1983), West-law at 83-5 BRPAPERS 1). This article describes the antitrust prohibition against a supplier\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s control over a distributor\u2019s resale prices, and states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">The FSS program differs from the typical commercial situation where the manufacturer does not deal directly with the ultimate consumer in that (a) prices and terms of FSS contracts may be set by the manufacturer and the Govt, and (b) there is no <em>privity of contract </em>(i.e., direct contractual relationship) between the Govt and the distributors. Unless the distributor enters into its own contract with the Govt the manufacturer is ultimately responsible for complying with FSS pricing (and other) contract provisions. In this situation\u2014 where there is a direct contractual relationship between the manufacturer and the ultimate consumer (the Govt)\u2014some Courts have <em>allowed </em>restrictions on resale prices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-10\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted). Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, this commentary does not stand for the proposition that there can never be privity between the Government and distributors under FSS contracts, but instead recognizes that there are instances when distributors contract directly with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">\n<em>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">The Government claims that Tektel failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because it did not timely file its claim as required by the disputes clause. When a claim arising under a contract is not subject to the Contract Disputes Act, the Court looks to the contract\u2019s disputes clause to resolve the claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Maine Yankee Atomic Pow</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>er Co. v. United States, </em>225 F.3d 1336, 1339 (Fed.Cir.2000). If the disputes clause provides a specific administrative remedy, \u201cthe contractor must exhaust its administrative contractual remedies prior to seeking judicial relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1340 (citation omitted); <em>Oroville-Tonasket Irr. Dist. v. United States, </em>33 Fed.Cl. 14, 20 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Here, the Government invokes the judiciary\u2019s disputes clause \u201cJP3 Clause 7-235, Disputes.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under the judiciary\u2019s disputes clause, Tektel was obligated to file a written contract dispute within 12 months of the accrual of its claim. DX 002-03, 007; Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mot. Dismiss App. 10. \u201cA claim first accrues when \u2018all the events which fix the government\u2019s alleged liability have occurred and the plaintiff was or should have been aware of their existence.\u2019 \u201d <em>L-3 Commc\u2019ns Integrated Sys., L.P. v. United States, </em>79 Fed.Cl. 453, 461 (2007) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted); <em>see Martinez v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1295, 1303 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citations omitted) (\u201cA cause of action cognizable in a Tucker Act suit accrues as soon as all events have occurred that are necessary to enable the plaintiff to bring suit, i.e., when \u2018all events have occurred to fix the Government\u2019s alleged liability, entitling the claimant to demand payment and sue here for his money.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The Government contends Tektel\u2019s claim accrued on March 18, 2010, the date on the District Court\u2019s letter to Tektel canceling the Orders. Alternatively, the Government argues the claim accrued on March 19, 2010, the date Tektel\u2019s president learned of the cancelation during a telephone conversation with the District Court\u2019s Clerk and the District Court issued the cancelation letter. In so arguing, the Government ignores the fact that Tektel asked the District Court to reconsider the cancelation based on new evidence it submitted on March 19, 2010. Specifically, Tektel urged the Government to rescind the cancelation and submitted for the first time written evidence of Tektel\u2019s president\u2019s misdemeanor conviction to persuade the District Court that cancelation based on a felony conviction was unwarranted. The record does not contain a response from the District Court to Tektel regarding this evidence of the misdemeanor or indicate when Tektel knew the District Court had rejected its argument that the evidence of the misdemeanor should vitiate the cancelation. As such, it is unclear when Tektel knew the cancelation was effected and when the dispute regarding the cancelation accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Even accepting that Tektel learned that the cancelation remained unreseinded as early as March 19, 2010, and the dispute accrued on March 19, 2010, Tektel still \u201cfiled\u201d its written claim within 12 months on March 18, 2011, when it mailed its claim letter to the District Court\u2019s contracting officer via certified mail, as the postmark confirms. The Government interprets the disputes clause to impose a more onerous burden for filing a claim than the plain language indicates, urging that a claim must be <em>received </em>within 12 months, not just filed. The Government\u2019s argument fails because the disputes clause provides only that a claim must be \u201cfiled\u201d within 12 months of accrual; it does not say that the contracting officer must <em>receive </em>the claim within the 12-month period following accrual.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">The Government contends that Tektel\u2019s March 17, 2011 claim letter was untimely because the United States Postal Service did not deliver the claim letter until March 31, 2011. Given that Tektel\u2019s claim was postmarked on March 18, 2011, within 12 months after the earliest date its claim could have accrued\u2014March 19, 2010\u2014its claim was timely filed under the disputes clause. This holding is supported by the mailbox rule\u2014 \u201can act is deemed accomplished when the required submission is mailed as opposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>when it is received____\u201d <em>Irigoyen-Briones v.

Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>CBCA 1870, 12-1 BCA \u00b6 35,049 (citations omitted) (a notice of appeal is \u201cfiled\u201d on the date it is mailed to the Board of Contract Appeals through the United States Postal Service).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\n<em>Monetary Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The Government argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction \u201cto grant the declaratory judgment sought by Tektel because this request is unrelated to a claim for presently-due monetary relief pending before the Court.\u201d Motion 26-27 (citation omitted). The Government\u2019s position lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Since the Tucker Act is only a jurisdictional statute, a plaintiff must either demonstrate it has an express or implied contract with the United States, or invoke a source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages for claims asserted under the United States Constitution, federal statute or regulation. <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976); <em>Price v. Panetta, </em>674 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2012) (citations omitted); <em>Brown v. United States, </em>86 F.3d 1554, 1559 (Fed.Cir.1996) (citations omitted). Where as here a plaintiffs claim is based on a contract, the plaintiff is not required to show the contract is money-mandating, only that the contract exists. <em>Westover v. United States, </em>71 Fed.Cl. 635, 640 (2006) (citing <em>Ont. Power Generation, Inc. v. United States, </em>369 F.3d 1298, 1301 (Fed.Cir.2004)). Money-mandating inquiries are limited to non-eon-tract claims. <em>See Martinez v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1295, 1302-03 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citations omitted); <em>see also Tippett v. United States, </em>185 F.3d 1250, 1254-55 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citation omitted) (\u201cWhen a contract is not involved, to invoke jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify a constitutional provision, a statute, or a regulation that provides a substantive right to money damages.\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Metz v.

Compl. \u00b6 2. The Government argues Tektel has not presented a plausible claim for damages because Tektel offered no evidence to explain what happened to the equipment after retrieval.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">A \u201cplaintiff [must plead] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Here, the Government essentially argues that Tektel will not be able to prove its claim because it cannot be entitled to compensation for equipment it retrieved. While Tektel acknowledges it retrieved the equipment from the District Court following termination of the Orders, a plaintiff can be owed for the cost of \u201ccustom-made\u201d items if the supplied goods are \u201cso unique that [they are] not useful\u201d to the plaintiff. <em>Dairy Sales Corp. v.
