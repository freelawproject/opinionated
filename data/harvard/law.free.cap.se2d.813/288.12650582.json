(Avtex) argues the trial court erred in denying its motion to disclose settlement and motion for setoff. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   William Huck slipped and fell while walking into Wild Wing Caf\u00e9 in Mount Pleasant. Huck and his wife, Dianne Huck, filed a complaint against Wild Wing Caf\u00e9 and Avtex, as the building's owner, among other parties. Huck alleged he suffered bodily injury, causing him to have surgery and incur medical costs. Huck asserted causes of action for negligence and loss of consortium. Dianne also asserted a cause of action for loss of consortium. Prior to trial, a settlement was entered into with defendants Civil Site Environmental, Inc. and Chandler Construction Services, Inc. The terms of the settlement,\n   including the amounts, were not disclosed to the trial court. At the close of the Hucks' case, the court granted the remaining defendants' motions for directed verdict on Dianne's loss of consortium claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The jury returned a verdict in favor of Huck against Avtex only in the amount of $97,640, but the jury found Huck was fifty percent negligent in bringing about his own injuries. Accordingly, the court reduced the verdict by fifty percent to $48,820 and entered judgment against Avtex in that amount. Avtex filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Rule 50(b), SCRCP. It also filed a motion for disclosure of settlement and setoff, or in the alternative, to determine if the settlement was made in good faith. The trial court denied both motions. Avtex made a motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which the trial court denied. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of this Court extends merely to the correction of errors of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Townes Assocs., Ltd. v.

The\n   documents referred to in Rule 8 are designed to protect any documents prepared for use by the mediator and the parties to the mediation itself. Once the parties reach a settlement, documents prepared in conjunction with the settlement and release are not for the purpose of, or in the course of, mediation. Rather, they are documents prepared in connection with the litigation and to bring the litigation to a close. Rule 8 is designed to protect the communications made during the mediation itself and to protect the process. The parties' mediation agreement reinforces the rule and simply incorporates the same language. The request for production of the settlement documents does not disclose confidential information from the mediation (i.e., it does not disclose or discuss information the parties utilized to reach the settlement). Further, any confidential matters the parties do not want disclosed can be protected through court proceedings including confidentiality provisions. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Avtex asserts the Hucks allocated a substantial percentage of the settlement with Civil Site Environmental, Inc. and Chandler Construction Services, Inc. to Dianne's loss of consortium claim in an effort to deprive Avtex of a setoff. Therefore, Avtex argues the trial court erred in finding it \"has no jurisdiction to evaluate the 'fairness' or\n   'reasonableness' of such settlement agreements or to reallocate the settlements, assuming there is anything to reallocate,\" and \"[n]othing in the law or at equity permits this court to conduct such an inquiry.\" The Hucks argue the trial court did not\n   have any authority to reapportion the settlement proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pursuant to section 15-38-50, we agree Avtex is entitled to a setoff. There is no right to setoff until there is a verdict against a defendant.
