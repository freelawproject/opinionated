L. 158, has reduced all writs designed to have a cause reviewed to one name the distinguishing characteristics of the different writs that prevailed before the passage of that act still remain.

On December 5,1898, the court on presentation of petition decreed the adoption prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-9\">On February 27, 1899, Josephine Vandermis, the maternal grandmother of said Henry 'Bastin, presented her petition to said court praying the court to revoke, annul and set aside said decree of adoption for the reason that at the time said decree was made the father and mother of said Henry Bastin were both dead and that there was no one legally authorized to give consent as required by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-10\">On March 6, 1899, the said court by opinion filed refused to set aside said decree,.from which order this appeal was taken by Josephine Vandermis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>Error assigned </em>was in making the following order or decree: \u201c There is not any allegation in the petition that the father was not of sufficient mental capacity to give his consent, nor that any fraud or undue influence was brought to bear upon him to give the consent, and that being the only reason alleged in the petition for a revocation of the decree. We hold that the father had a right to give the consent for the adoption, and that having been acted upon and the decree made, it cannot now be revoked unless it were shown to the court that the consent was obtained by undue influence or fraud; and it does not matter whether the decree was made before or after the death of the father, as he had a right in his lifetime to direct who should have the custody and care of his child. For these reasons the prayer of the petitioner is refused.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b598-5\"><em>Orr </em>Buffington, with him <em>H.

In divorce proceedings the prochein ami is seldom a relative. The act itself uses the term \u201cnext friend \u201d and if the court should hold that the father\u2019s consent was not in court at the time of the adoption proceedings, then we hold that not only was the consent of the next friend in court, but that it was upon his own petition these proceedings were had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-14\">If by some means a lawsuit were to be brought by this boy, Henry Bastin, who would bring it as his \u201c next friend ? \u201d Would it be his grandmother, who never interested herself in the child, simply because she was his grandmother, or would it be Frank Gilbert, in whose home the boy actually was and is now, whose whole life is wrapt up in the boy? Would he not be the \u201cnext friend\u201d in every sense of the term?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-15\">Since the mother\u2019s death, Frank Gilbert, the appellee, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>had charge of Henry Bastin, the little orphan, and has at all times treated him as a child of his own. He is a man of \u201cgood moral character, and of sufficient ability to properly maintain said minor,\u201d and one in whose care \u201cthe welfare of the said Henry Bastin will be promoted by the adoption.\u201d This fact the lower court found by the decree of adoption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-5\">As the argument of appellant says, \u201cthe welfare of the child appears to be the main object of the act.\u201d In the present case there can be no question that the best interests of the boy and of his welfare will be promoted by his remaining in the house of those who have learned to love him, who have maintained and cared for him as zealously and carefully as one of their own children, whom he looks upon as his own parents and to whom his father, in his last illness, intrusted the life of his little motherless boy. This is not a case of a father giving his child over to the uncertain treatment of strangers, rather is it an instance of a father, on his death-bed, in an attempt to do the best thing possible for his child, consenting to the adoption of his boy by parents, who have been his intimate friends for years, who have proven by their past Idndness and affection for the little orphan that the future care of him will be no less.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-6\">His consent is in the nature of the appointment of a testamentary guardian for his child and as such it should be regarded.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AC9\">July 28, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AZdT\">Bbeber, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">This is a proceeding for the adoption of a child under the Act of May 19,1887, P. L. 125. On the 5th day of December, 1898, the petition was presented to the court and the decree made. The father of the child had signified his consent to the adoption by signing the petition on the 2d day of December, but he died the day before the petition was presented and decree made. The mother of the child had died some years before. The question is whether the court has proceeded in accordance with the provisions of the act of assembly regulating the manner of procedure to be followed to secure a decree of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Where a proceeding in an inferior court is purely statutory and no provision is made for an appeal, the only writ by which a review can be had is a writ of certiorari. This writ is allowable except in cases where it is expressly forbidden by the statute ; but upon such a writ the appellate court can only review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the regularity of the proceeding under the statute. Its only duty is to see whether the procedure of the court below has been according to the act of assembly under which it acts. In the consideration of this question the appellate court is confined to the record: Kimber v. Schuylkill County, 20 Pa. 366; Chase v. Miller, 41 Pa. 403. The fact that the proceeding is now before us by virtue of an appeal under the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 158, does not enlarge our power of review. Whilst this act has reduced all writs designed to have a case reviewed by an appellate court to one name, the distinguishing characteristics of the different writs that prevailed before the passage of that act still remain. If before the passage of that act the proper writ to secure a review by an appellate court was a certiorari, the court on an appeal is still compelled to consider the case as if it were before it upon such a writ, Rand v. King, 134 Pa. 641, and therefore the only matter now before us is the regularity of the procedure of the court below. If the\" record reveals that it has not been in compliance with the terms of the act, we must reverse, but in doing so we do not pass upon the merits of the case at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">An examination of the act under which this proceeding was had satisfies us that the record in this case reveals a fatal defect. The act requires the consent of the parents or surviving parent of the child to be given. If there are no parents, then the next friend of the child, or the guardians or overseers of the poor, or such charitable institutions as shall have supported the child for at least a year, must consent. This child had neither parent living at the time the petition was presented and the decree made. The fact that its father, who was the surviving parent, had died only'one day prior to the presentation of the petition and the making of the decree leaves the child as much without parents as if he had died a year before. The act contemplates a proceeding in court between parties who are to satisfy the court \u201c that the welfare of such child will be promoted by such adoption.\u201d Although the proceeding is by petition, the facts stated in it must be supposed to be made as of the date when the petition is presented. If, at that time, there is no living parent who can consent, then the next friend or the others mentioned in the act of assembly must be called to consent. In this case the father, by his death, lost his power to consent. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>cannot agree that his consent, given a few days before, conld be effectual beyond the moment of his death. If it could be effectual one day beyond we can see no reason why it should not be so one year beyond that event, even though the conditions may have changed materially in the mean time. As the act requires the consent of some one before the decree can be made, and as a dead person cannot legally consent, we think the father\u2019s consent in this case must be held not to be a compliance with the terms of the act of assembly under which the court was acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Judgment reversed and proceedings quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
