Hostetter. Before Brubaker, J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>This case was before the Superior Court on appeal on a former verdict and judgment and is reported in 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 618.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">It appears from the evidence that Ralph, the plaintiff, sold certain leaf tobacco to Hostetter and received therefor certain notes in payment. \u201d Before the maturity of the notes Hostetter executed two judgment notes aggregating $94,238.05 to Fon-Dersmith, trustee for certain creditors of defendant, on which execution was issued, and among other things the leaf tobacco sold by the plaintiff was levied upon by the sheriff. Plaintiff gave notice to the sheriff that he claimed the tobacco as his property, he having rescinded the sale made on February 21, 1895, which he alleged was induced by fraud practised upon him. An issue was framed on the petition of the sheriff to determine the title to the property at the time of the levy. On the trial the contention on plaintiff\u2019s part was that Hostetter designedly by trick and artifice practised a fraud upon him and secured the possession of the twenty cases of tobacco under circumstances which justified him in rescinding the sale and claiming the property as his own. The first trial of the feigned issue resulted in a verdict to the plaintiff which on appeal to the Superior Court was reversed for the reasons stated in 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 624. At the second trial plaintiff offered to prove that Amos B. Hostetter, the vendee and defendant in the execution, gave a false statement to Dun\u2019s Commercial Agency, and that he knew that \u201c D \u2014 2,\u201d the rating which was given him by the agency, meant in the book a rating from $40,000 to $75,000 in good credit; that the plaintiff relied on the rating thus given; that the vendee Plostetter knew at the time of the purchase that he was insolvent; that he had made certain statements after giving confessions of judgment tending to show both fraud and insolvency. Plaintiff also offered in evidence the judgments confessed both in Philadelphia and Lancaster. The plaintiff also offered to prove that Hostetter did not owe one W. M. Jacobs anything at the time the judgments in evidence were drawn and entered in court, one of them being in said Jacobs\u2019s favor for $25,000. Offers were also made of acts and words of the defendant for the purpose of showing a well defined intent to cheat and defraud plaintiff and other creditors. These offers were disallowed by the court and exception granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>to plaintiff and form the subject of twenty-five assignments of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-6\">Defendant presented the following point, which was affirmed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-7\">Under the law and the evidence the verdict in this case must be for the defendant. [26]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>among others was (26) in giving binding instructions for defendant; error was also assigned to the rejection of evidence as indicated in the statement of facts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-9\"><em>B. F. Davis </em>and <em>J. W. </em>Johnson, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkHf\">\u2014 It is true that the false and fraudulent representations were made by Hostetter to R. G. Dun &amp; Company, in September, 1894. They did not, however, reach Ralph for the purposes of this case until February 21,1895, when the sale was made. At that time Hostetter sent his agent to purchase the goods. Ralph then consulted his mercantile agency reference book and \u201c sold the goods and parted with the same and shipped them to him upon the faith of his commercial standing as given by R. G. Dun &amp; Company, in their January book of 1895.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-10\">That was the same as though the false representations had been made by Hostetter direct to Ralph, for \u201c false representations made to a mercantile agency for the purpose of influencing credit, constitute a fraud, and have the same effect as though made directly by a buyer: \u201d Eaton v. Avery, 83 N. Y. 31; Cazeaux v. Mali, 25 Barb. 578; Newbery v. Garland, 31 Barb. 121; Bruff v. Mali, 36 N. Y. 200; Morgan v. Skiddy, 62 N. Y. 319; Com. v. Call, 21 Pick. 515; Com. v. Harley, 7 Metc. 462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-11\">The case is a new one in its facts, but the principles by which it should be governed are well established: Eaton v. Avery, 83 N. Y. 31; The Genesee County Savings Bank v. Mich. Barg. Co., 52 Mich. 164; Mooney v. Davis, 75 Mich. 188; Hinchman v. Weeks, 85 Mich. 535; Holmes v. Harrigan, 20 Mo. App. 661; Lindauer v.

It was given September, 1894, and as of July, 1894, whereas the indebtedness was not contracted until February, <em>1895; </em>nor did the insolvency, if any existed, occur until May, 1895.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-6\">The seventh and eighth assignments of error are for the exclusion of testimony, showing admissions on the part of Hostetter that he was insolvent in May, 1895.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-7\">We submit that in an issue between Hostetter\u2019s execution creditors and his vendor this would be wholly irrelevant. Even if he preferred certain creditors or tried to \u201c catch \u201d other creditors in May, this would not, by any means, entitle Ralph to rescMd a contract of February, touchmg which no fraud or misrepresentation was shown. The court was clearly right in rejecting this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-8\">It would be destructive of many business transactions to hold that an executed contract could be summarily rescinded because the purchaser of the property had, months before, made a statement of his assets and liabilities to a commercial agency, the correctness of which he was willing at the time to verify by his solemn oath, wMch was, in fact, true, even if subsequent events proved Ms judgment and opinion to be erroneous: Ralph v. FonDersmith, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 618.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-9\">The eleventh, twelfth, tMrteenth and fourteenth assignments of error relate to the exclusion of certain depositions taken in Ohio to prove that, about the time Hostetter was buying goods on credit from Ralph, his agent was also buying goods from other parties throughout the country. This question has been disposed of by this court in Ralph v. FonDersmith, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 623.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-10\">The eighteenth and nmeteenth assignments of error relate to an attempt or an offer made to prove that the representations made by Hostetter in the statement of July and September, 1894, were not wholly true; but these offers were excluded by the court below, on the manifestly proper ground that Ralph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>did not pretend to be guided or affected by the statement made by Hostetter to the mercantile agency \u2014 which Ralph never said \u2014but only by the garbled version of it which was given out by the agency to its customers and which this court has pronounced wholly \u201cmisleading,\u201d \u201cincomplete,\u201d \u201cinconsistent and contradictory.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-5\">Upon the whole case there was nothing whatever for the court to do except to charge the jury that the verdict must be for the defendant, unless it directly ignored the rulings of this court in this case when here for review. The opinion, as we have quoted\u2019 it, proves incontestably that it is not the law of Pennsylvania that a rating by a mercantile agency can bind the man who furnishes it, unless it is furnished to the agency\u2019s customers in the form substantially as it is given by the person seeking and obtaining credit. Even if the agency, in this case, had furnished the transcript of Hostetter\u2019s books as he gave it of July, 1894, it was no proper basis for credit in February, 1895, and although the credit had been given by Ralph immediately after the statement was furnished by Hostetter, and there was no such remoteness of time as would relieve the debtor, there is, as has been pointed out, an essential difference between rating a man as worth from $40,000 to $75,000 over his liabilities and publishing a true statement, that the one who seeks credit has some $85,000 worth of debts, and that among bis available assets are counted $66,000 of uncollected book accounts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-6\">1. The statement as made by Hostetter is not shown to have been false. There is no evidence whatever that it was not substantially true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-7\">2. The credit given was not extended until February, whereas the statement was made as of the preceding September and July.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-8\">3. The rating was not only unintelligible, but untrue in fact. The schedule was retained by the agency, and its own abbreviated deduction given to the subscribers was only an incomplete abstract, \u201c very misleading,\u201d and \u201c while the schedule on which it was founded may have been true,\u201d the abbreviated and incomplete rating itself suggested \u201c that the agency had further information relating thereto, and, if Ralph proposed to rely on the rating, he was bound to make further inquiry.\u201d Failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>do this, he incurred the risk of the rating being incorrect, or that Hostetter\u2019s condition had changed in the meanwhile, and he cannot now make FonDersmith and other bona fide creditors pay the results of his negligent and slipshod method of doing business.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A1c\">July 28, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AAz\">Orlady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The first trial of this feigned issue resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, which on appeal to this court was reversed for the reasons stated in 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 618, 624. On the second trial the learned trial judge affirmed a point submitted by the defendant, viz: \u201c under the law and the evidence the verdict in this case must be for the defendant,\u201d and after judgment in accord with this instruction the plaintiff brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The evidence which was rejected under the offers, taken in connection with that which was admitted, presents a radically different state of facts than was adduced on the first trial, and if believed would establish the plaintiff\u2019s right to rescind the sale of February 21, 1895. On the first trial the evidence showed that Ralph was a subscriber to the commercial agency and that Hostetter was not connected with it in any way. There was no evidence to show that the statement furnished by Hostetter was not true in entirety and detail, and the indebtedness represented by the judgments of FonDersmith- was unquestioned. It was not shown that Hostetter ever saw the rating \u201c D \u2014 2 \u201d as issued by the agency, nor that he knew its meaning. The evidence failed to show that any fraud, trick, artifice or false representation had been made to induce the sale, or that any material fact had been withheld from his schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">On the retrial of the case Z. T. Wobensmith, a representative of the R. G. Dun &amp; Co. Agency, testified that Hostetter was a subscriber to this agency, and that, as-such, he had a reference book in his place of business, and had made use of it from 1893 to the time of his failure in 1895, being entirely familiar with the book, its use, and everything contained in it. He states in his testimony that \u201c I may say positively, once a week we had frequent conversations about mercantile business. We had often looked at the book together and discussed the ratings of various parties. I mean our reference book, that he was a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>scriber to at that time.\u201d The plaintiff offered to prove (1) that Hostetter knew that \u201c D \u2014 2 \u201d meant in the book, a rating of $40,000 to $75,000 and good credit; (2) that the report or statement made by Hostetter, upon which his rating was based, was false, in that he did not have the cash, sundry debtors, stock on hand, etc., as set forth therein; (3) that in the winter of 1894-1895 Hostetter was trading the tobacco he then bought for cigars for about one half their cost or value, and at same time bought cigars at $12.00 per 1,000 and sold the same at $6.00 to $6.50 per 1,000, and also sold tobacco for a price considerably below what it cost him; (4) that the judgments which Hostetter confessed to FonDersmith included over $36,000 to the use of W. M. Jacobs, and that he did not owe said Jacobs anything at the time the judgments were entered; (5) that Hostetter knew that he was insolvent at the time the goods were purchased. These offers were disallowed by the learned court below, and its rulings form the basis of nearly all of the assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The rejected evidence related to proof of knowledge of the insolvency of Hostetter at the time of the purchase, and that he fraudulently asserted his solvency and used his rating as a trick, artifice and representation to induce the plaintiff to part .with his goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">A subscriber to a commercial agency has a right to rely on the fairness and honesty of the statements of the financial condition made by the other subscribers. The reporting agency is the mutual agent of its subscribers in securing and communicating the desired information, and the subscribers must, from the very nature of the business, know that the rating is a representation of financial standing as of near the date of the publication of the reference book, and the representation thus made is intended to reach and influence persons who are entitled to use the book. Let it be conceded that the schedule was retained by the agency, and that the report or rating was a garbled and misleading deduction from this schedule. The testimony of Wobensmith, if believed, made Hostetter a subscriber to the agency. He was thoroughly familiar with its workings, and it was acting for him as well as for Ralph.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The rejected evidence, if believed, would tend to show his knowledge of the mistake of the agency, the effect of that mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>take being that others would reasonably be misled by it, and that it was founded upon his own errors and misstatements of fact. The statement and the judgment were directly attacked as false and fraudulent in the offers represented by the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth assignments, and the rejected evidence covered by the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth assignments, if believed, would tend to corroborate the plaintiff\u2019s allegation. As was said by Rice, P. J., in Claster Bros. v. Katz, 6 Pa. Superior Ct. 487, \u201c Prom the very nature of the transaction a fact not disclosed may be such that it is impliedly represented not to exist, and whilst under our decisions a buyer is not held to an implied representation of solvency, he may be fairly presumed to represent that he has not deliberately set a trap for an unwary seller.\u201d It was urged that Hostetter knew the important facts \u2014 his misstatements and the error of the agency \u2014 at the time of his purchase, and knowingly and fraudulently secured an advantage thereby. The question before us is not whether the statement was true or false, but, as to the admissibility of the rejected evidence as tending to show his knowledge of its falsity and his fraudulent use of the facts. The statement may have been true in every particular. He invited an examination of his affairs at the time when the means were readily accessible to disprove or establish its verity, and he was then willing to support it with his oath. Though the rating was unfair and misleading, and was founded upon the agency\u2019s mistake, it is contended that it was by him ratified and adopted; that his knowledge of the system of reporting credits would require that he practice good faith; and that he must have known that \u201c D \u2014 2 \u201d did not adequately and fairly represent the schedule. Standing alone \u201c D \u2014 2 \u201d was without any meaning, and it was competent to prove that, as between the subscribers, it was an intelligible part of a cipher code which had a mutually well understood signification. Ralph did not avail himself of his right to secure a copy of the statement as furnished by Hostetter, while Hostetter as a subscriber would know that such an inquiry was liable to be made, and under such facts it was competent evidence to submit to a jury to aid them in determining whether \u2014 if his insolvency be established \u2014 the rating was knowingly adopted by Hostetter as a trick, artifice, or deception used, or conduct which reasonably involved a false representation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>accomplish the purpose. The right to rescind the sale did not exist unless the sale was brought about by fraud. The insolvency of the purchaser and his knowledge of it are not alone sufficient to justify the vendor in rescission of his contract. The plaintiff must go further and prove a designed fraud which was successfully practised upon him, by and through which he was induced to part with his goods, and unless, therefore, there are convincing facts in evidence to show with clear certainty that a condition of insolvency was well known to the purchaser when he asserted solvency as a means of procuring the sale of goods to himself, his assertion does not have that aspect of fraud, or artifice or misrepresentation which is required to abrogate an executed contract. If the purchaser has a right to regard himself as solvent, and firmly believes that he is so, and therefore asserts his solvency to an intending seller, who sells him goods, his assertion of solvency is certainly not fraudulent, even though insolvency actually arises before payment for the goods is made: 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 618, 627, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">If the sale was solely induced by fraud the execution creditor had no higher title to the goods than Hostetter had, and if the goods were identified, the contract could be rescinded and the execution creditor had no right to sell because Hostetter did not have any title to them: Schoeneman v. Weill, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 119. The creditors have just the right, and no less, of their debtors. It is only because they have no higher one that plaintiff has the right to rescind at all. The purchaser\u2019s title to the goods, and consequently the creditors\u2019 right to appropriate them in payment of their debts, remains, until the defrauded vendor has made void that title by an effectual rescission of the contract which vested it in them: Schofield v. Shiffer, 156 Pa. 65. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to show that the Fon-Dersmith judgment was a fraudulent one in whole or in part, but it was competent for him to show that it was such, as a circumstance tending to show a general scheme on the part of Hostetter to obtain goods on a false credit, and after securing their possession have them seized and sold for his benefit on a voluntarily confessed judgment in the hands of a selected friend, with whom he colluded to effect his purpose. The judgment was good as against Hostetter. He could not assail it in this proceeding: Unangst v. Goodyear Co., 141 Pa. 127. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>alleged to be without consideration as to $36,000 of its face, and was being asserted against this property as a part of the fraudulent plan of Hostetter to secure these goods, and if established as fraudulent it was some evidence of his original intention to defraud the plaintiff. For this purpose we think the evidence was competent, but for no other. It is true the fund was not in court for distribution, and the sole question was the title of Ralph through the rescission of his contract. It is well settled that a collusive judgment may be attached collaterally by judgment or execution creditors, who would otherwise be defrauded thereby. Whenever such a judgment, or the execution issued thereon, thus comes in conflict with the claims of creditors they may avoid its effect by showing that, as to them, it is a nullity: McNaughton\u2019s Appeal, 101 Pa. 550; Meckley\u2019s Appeal, 102 Pa. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We see no reason for refusing to an owner the same measure and means of proof to determine his title to property which can be invoked by a creditor on distribution of its proceeds. An allegation of fraud opens a wide door to the admission of evidence, and in case of a conflict of evidence, a jury is the proper tribunal to weigh it, and to determine what it proves: Landis v. Neff, 9 Atl. Rep. 926. Upon the trial of questions of fraud, every circumstance in the condition and relation of the party, and every act and declaration of the person charged with the fraud may be given in evidence, if in the opinion of the judicial mind it bears such a relation to the transaction as is calculated to persuade the jury that the allegation of fraud is or is not well founded: Glessner v. Patterson, 164 Pa. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In order to prove that a purchaser knew that he was insolvent when he made a purchase, declarations as to his prior insolvency made by him after his goods were levied upon are admissible: Perlman v. Sartorius, 162 Pa. 320. Every fact or circumstance from which a legal inference of fraud may be drawn is admissible: Cover v. Manaway, 115 Pa. 338; Wheeler v. Ahlers, 189 Pa. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The testimony of Wobensmith laid the foundation for a wide range of investigation, and while some of the offers are faulty and indefinite, and their purpose not clearly stated they are repeated in different forms, and should be treated as progressive steps to establish the controverted fact. Enough was shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and offered to require some explanation and denial on the part of Hostetter to prevent the rescission of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth assignments of error are not sustained for the reasons given in 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 623. The other assignments are sustained. The judgment is reversed and the venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
