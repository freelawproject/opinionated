J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">It appears from the evidence that H. O. Frost owned a farm upon which he and the plaintiff, his wife, resided. In 1893 there were several judgments against H. C. Frost, among them one of his wife Betsy Frost for $676, and another in favor of Charles Allen for $100. In the spring of 1893 plaintiff issued a fi. fa. on her judgment and sold the personal property of H. C. Frost. At this sale she purchased a lot of personal -property leaving an unpaid balance of about $300 on her judgment. In the summer of 1895 the plaintiff issued a fi. fa. and sold the farm of H. C. Frost to James W. Piatt. There was not money enough realized on this sale to pay anything on either the judgment of Betsy Frost or Charles Allen. In 1895, Piatt conveyed the farm to Betsy Frost for $1,800, she paying no money, but giving a bond and mortgage for the full amount of the purchase mousy. In 1896, Betsy Frost reconveyed the property to J ames W. Piatt. H. C. Frost and family continued to reside on the farm since 1893 and on March 9, 1896, Piatt executed a lease of the farm to Betsy Frost for the term of one year for $125, it being agreed between them that the rent should be paid out of the products of the farm during the year. In August, 1896, Charles Allen upon another fi. fa. issued on his judgment, caused the sheriff to sell a quantity of grain, potatoes and hay produced on the farm in the summer of 1896. Betsy Frost, claiming the ownership of this property by virtue of her lease, brought an action of trespass against Charles Allen and the sheriff for selling the property and recovered a judgment of $100 on the verdict of the jury. There was evidence tending to show that Betsy Frost had certain separate estate of her own not derived from her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-7\">Defendant presented among others the following point, which was affirmed by the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-8\">[7.

Hall, 160 Pa. 60; Spering v. Laughlin, 113 Pa. 209; Holcomb v. Bank, 92 Pa. 338.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">The Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, gives a married woman the power to carry on a business as if she were a feme sole, and the proceeds of this business belong to her, and cannot be seized by her husband\u2019s creditors. The Act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332, was nominally repealed by the act of 1893, but is practically tobe considered as \u201cre-enacted and enlarged\u201d by the Act of 1893, P. L. 344: Nuding v. Urich, 169 Pa. 289; Curry v. Phillips, 14 Pa. C. C. R. 479; Kuhn v. Ogilvie, 178 Pa. 303.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-9\">Hence the cases under the act of 1887 are to be regarded as interpreting the law now in force: 2 Pepper <em>&amp; </em>Lewis\u2019s Dig. 2887, note 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-10\">The act of 1887 \u201c enabled a married woman to carry on a farm, and entitled her to all the products of the farm or the proceeds of the business, .... and belong to her and cannot be taken to pay her husband\u2019s debts:\u201d Wayne v. Lewis, 23 W. N. C. 441.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-11\">The act of 1887 works a radical change in the rights and liabilities of a married woman: Adams v. Grey, 154 Pa. 258; and has emancipated her from common-law disabilities (with a few exceptions) and authorized her to contract as if she were a feme sole: Steffen v.

Jones, 148 Pa. 589; and she may purchase land on credit and give a valid secuiity for its payment: Campe v. Horne, 158 Pa. 508.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AjE\">May 18, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AvT\">Rice, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Crops produced on a farm in the joint occupation of husband and wife presumptively belong to the husband, and in a contest between her and his creditors the burden of overcoming the presumption by clear and satisfactory testimony rests upon her: Eavanson v. Pownall, 182 Pa. 587. If, however, the farm belongs to her, the fact that the husband\u2019s labor entered into the production of the crops will not make them liable for his debts. A husband who, in the enjoyment of the marital relation is permitted to live and be maintained upon the property of his wife, managed by her for her own use and benefit, does not acquire a title to the products merely by the labor which he voluntarily bestows upon it: Phillips v. Hall, 160 Pa. 60, and cases there cited. This is conceded by the defendant\u2019s counsel, but he argues that a married woman, in order to maintain title to the crops raised on a farm leased to her, must prove that the lease was made to her exclusively upon the credit of a separate estate which she owned at the time, and further, that she must establish the fact by a higher quality of proof than is required in ordinary civil issues. It would follow, that even if she did own a separate estate, yet if the lessor trusted partly to her honesty and her ability to manage the farm so as to earn the money to pay the rent, the crops would be subject to seizure for her husband\u2019s debts. The result of re-establishing the doctrine of the cases cited in support of this contention would be that a married woman not possessed of a separate estate, and so unfortunate as to have a thriftless and impecunious husband, would be practically helpless, no matter how capable and honest she might be. It would be useless for her to take a lease of a farm with the expectation of being able to earn enough to pay the rent, because the products of her labor and skill could be seized for the debts of her husband. However the law was before the passage of the Married Woman\u2019s Property Act, it is not so now. In a case arising under the act of 1872 the present chief jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tice said: \u201c Known integrity and business qualifications coupled with the right to engage in business on her own account, with full control of her own earnings, secured to her under the act of 1872 ought to be and undoubtedly are recognized elements of substantial credit for any married woman: \u201d Orr v. Bornstein, 124 Pa. 311. Hence it was held that where a married woman who had become entitled to her separate earnings borrowed money upon her personal credit, whether possessed of a separate estate or not, and therewith in good faith purchased a stock of goods with which to engage in business, the goods could not be seized and sold for the debts of her husband. So it was held after the passage of the act of June 3, 1887, that a married woman without separate estate might, for the purpose of engaging in business, purchase property wholly on credit and hold the same against her husband\u2019s creditors: Walter v. Jones, 148 Pa. 589. Again, in Wayne v. Lewis, 1 Mona. 305; s. c. 23 W. N. C. 441, the court was requested to charge that the crops raised on a farm leased to a married woman belonged to her husband, and were liable for his debts unless she proved that she leased the farm on the credit of a separate estate owned by her. The refusal so to charge was sustained by the Supreme Court. This ruling was put by the court below upon the correct ground that under the act of 1887, a married woman had a right to engage in business as if she were a feme sole, and that the proceeds of such business, whether profits or crops, were secure against the claim of her husband\u2019s creditors. It is scarcely necessary to say, that the act of 1893 did not restrict, but rather enlarged, the rights of married women conferred by the act of 1887. The general tendency has been to construe its provisions liberally, as undoubtedly they should be if the courts are to carry out the intention of the legislature. It follows from what we have said that if there is any error in the instructions recited in the several assignments, it is not one of which the defendants have a right to complain. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted that the plaintiff had a separate estate at the time she took the lease, if that was essential; that she managed the farm; that she bought the seed from which the crops were produced; that she hired the team used in working the farm; that she hired and paid the help, and apparently conducted the business for her own use and benefit. The fact that she expected to pay the rent from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>proceeds of her labor and skill, did not invalidate her title to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
