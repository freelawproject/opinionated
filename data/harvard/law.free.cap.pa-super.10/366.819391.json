Twenty-two companies, including defendant, had insured in various sums amounting in the aggregate to $16,000. It was agreed by counsel that the amount that plaintiffs were entitled to recover in this case, if anything, was $902.02. It was contended by defendant company that it was not represented by any one authorized to act for it at the meeting of the agents held to adjust the loss, and that no proofs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>of loss as required by tbe policy were served upon tbe company within sixty days of loss, and that, further, no notice of loss was given within ten days as was required. There was evidence tending to show that notice and proofs of loss had been given to Eugene E. Weiser, an agent of the defendant company who was present at the time the adjustment of the loss was made. There was no evidence that any notice was given to the plaintiffs that their proof of loss was defective, or that anything further relative to the proofs of loss was required by the company. It also appears from the record that plaintiff filed a statement and specific averments of fact. Defendant filed an affidavit of defense in denial as required by Rule 4 of common pleas, York county, under the head of Admissions for the Purpose of Trial. It was alleged in the affidavit, among other facts and defenses, that plaintiffs had wilfully and fraudulentlysetfire to the insured <em>property; </em>that the conditions of the policy had not been fully complied with and it was denied that plaintiffs did all things and furnished all the information required by the company; it specifically denied receipt of notice, adjustment of the loss and receipt of proof of loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-5\">At the trial the plaintiffs submitted the following offers which were admitted by the court under objection of defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">[Plaintiffs (through Mr. Niles) offer in evidence the policy of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company, numbered 2,193,681, insuring Adam Jacoby &amp; Brother in the amount of $1,000 on property described therein, situated on the southwest corner of North George street and Hamilton avenue, York, Pa., and countersigned by Deininger &amp; Weiser, agents, January 18, 1897, for the purpose of sustaining the issue on the part of the plaintiffs.

It is further objected, that the witness cannot characterize the paper as a proof of loss so as to give it standing as a fact in the case without he produces the paper itself, or proves its contents. The offer is inadmissible for any purpose in the present state of the proof, it being specifically denied in the affidavit of defense that any notice of loss or proofs of loss whatever were ever received by this company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">Mr. Niles: We now call upon the defendant company, in accordance with the call served upon it, to produce the proof of loss, and all notices, letters and papers in regard to this loss in the possession of the company, or of its agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">Defendant by its counsel, Mr. Wanner, replies, first, that no such notice as has been referred to was served upon the counsel, nor with his knowledge upon the defendant, for such books, papers, or documents, at this trial; and replies further, denying at bar, as it has already denied on oath, that it has ever received any notice of proofs of loss whatever from these plaintiffs, and therefore cannot produce them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-9\">Mr. Wanner: I do not recall that notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Mr. Niles: It was served on you November 27, 1897, at 8:47 o\u2019clock P.

The proposed question does not tend to contradict anything testified to before by the witness, or in any manner to discredit him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\">The Court: Well, we think that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel may ask the witness why he made out these lists in the manner described; that is, why he stated in those other two lists, that he said he made out, that this company should pay so much of the share of the loss. We will allow that question, and seal an exception for the defendant, why he stated in those two lists that he did make out that this company was to pay such a proportion of the loss, $900, or whatever it was.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">[Mr. Niles: The witness having said that he had no special authority to send proofs of loss of the Jacoby &amp; Brother fire to the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company, we offer to ask him whether or not his usual custom in regard to this company, and every other company, is not to notify the company of the loss; and to show that the proofs of loss are prepared, made out and forwarded to the company without any specific instruction or authorization from the company to that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\">The Court: How does this become material under the act of assembly in regard to the subject ? The witness having denied that he made out any proof of loss for the company at the time stated by one of the plaintiffs, Adam Jacoby, in his testimony, and the cross-examination being as to the fact whether he did or not, we think it is competent for the question to be asked the witness whether he did not forward the notice of loss to the company, and whether it is not the custom for him to make out proofs of loss for the companies, and for this company, and send them on. We allow the question to be asked, and we seal an exception for the defendant. Wedonotthink it is very material one way or the other; but it may throw some light on whether or not the proof of loss was made out. I suppose that is the object of the question?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-8\">Mr. Niles: Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-9\">The Court: It is admitted for that purpose ?] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-10\">The court rejected the following offers made by defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AM1\">[Defendant\u2019s counsel, Mr. Wanner, in connection with the testimony already in, offers in evidence the affidavit of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>filed in this case, \u2014 it has already been made an instrument of evidence by the plaintiffs, \u2014 to show the defendant\u2019s denial of receipt of any notice, or proofs of loss; and also the defendant\u2019s denial of being represented by any agent and adjuster.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-4\">Objected to, by Mr. Niles, as not the best evidence; as incompetent, misleading and inadmissible for any purpose as offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">The Court: I understand that has already been offered in evidence ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">Mr. Niles: No, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\">The Court: We do not think the offer is competent and we overrule it.] [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-8\">[Mr. Wanner: Witness having stated that nothing was put in the proofs of loss as to judgments against him, defendant offers in evidence the records of the court of common pleas of York county, showing a judgment in favor of E. W. Spangler against Adam Jacoby and Samuel Jacoby for the sum of $2,000, No. 464, January term, 1894, entered February 21, 1894, and not satisfied at the date of the making of these proofs of loss; also the judgment of Sarah Gross against S. F. Jacoby and Adam Jacoby, to No. 466, January term, 1894, in the common \u25a0 pleas of York county, for $2,500, and remaining unsatisfied at the time of making the proofs of loss, for the purpose of showing incumbrances upon the property insured, which was real estate as well as personalty, and which under the terms of the policy are required to be set forth in the proofs of loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-9\">Objected to, by Mr. Niles, as not proper, legal or relevant evidence for the purposes offered, or for any of them; that the incumbrances referred to in the policy are the incumbrances mentioned in the policy itself, to wit: chattel mortgages on personal property, and that it is irrelevant and immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-10\">The Court: The only incumbrances provided against in the policy is chattel mortgages on personal property. There are no chattel mortgages in Pennsylvania, excepting in special cases, lumbering interest, and things of that kind. The incumbrances provided against are those upon personal property which are forbidden in the policy. We do not think the offer is competent in this case, and we therefore reject it, and seal an exception for the defendant.] [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-11\">The court refused the following points offered by defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>3. The uncontradicted evidence in the case being that Eugene F. Weiser, to whom plaintiffs allege they furnished proofs of loss, had no authority to adjust losses, the company defendant is not bound by any of his acts in connection with the adjustment of plaintiffs\u2019 loss by the various agents of the several companies who insured said plaintiffs; and if the juiy believe the testimony of the plaintiff, Adam Jacoby, that the signing by him of the proofs of loss which he alleges he furnished to the agent, Eugene F. Weiser, was a part of and completion of the adjustment of the loss by the other companies\u2019 agents which had been begun the day before, then the act of Weiser in assisting plaintiff to complete the proofs of loss, and his alleged receipt of them at that time, as a part of the adjustment, are not binding upon the company defendant as an act of adjustment, and does not render it liable to pay the amount agreed upon in the adjustment by the other companies, as the proportion payable by the defendant company. <em>Answer: </em>This point is not correct as written, and is refused.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-5\">[4. The only legal effect of the alleged signing and delivery of proofs of loss at the adjustment, as testified to by the plaintiff, to Eugene F. Weiser, defendant\u2019s local agent, was to show compliance of the plaintiffs in the matter of furnishing them within the time required by the policy, and does not operate as a waiver on the part of the company, of any defects in proofs of loss themselves, as it appears they were not sent to or received by the company. <em>Answer: </em>This point cannot be affirmed as written; the statement'of the testimony of Adam Jacoby, one of the plaintiffs, is not correctly stated in the point. He does not testify that he signed and delivered the proofs of loss to Eugene Weiser at the adjustment, but at the office of Kell &amp; Williams on the 24th of June, 1897. This point is refused.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-6\">[5. There is no evidence in the case to show that the company defendant, or any of its officers, received any proofs of plaintiffs\u2019 loss at the general office; and if they had actually been delivered to the agent, Weiser, as testified to by the plaintiff, and he did not send them to the general office, or to the company defendant, the conditions of the policy have not been complied with, and plaintiffs cannot recover. <em>Answer: </em>There is no proof in the case of the receipt of the proof of loss at the general office of the company.

The burden was upon the plaintiffs to show authority when they sought to bind the company by his acts: Amer. Underwriters Assn. v. George, 97 Pa. 238; Hays &amp; Wick v. Lynn, 7 Watts, 524; Amer. Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v.

Ins. Co., 142 Pa. 332; Hocking v. Howard Ins. Co., 130 Pa. 170; Ins. Co. v. Conover, 98 Pa. 384; Ins. Co. v.

Co. v. Weiss Bros., 106 Pa. 20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-10\">If plaintiffs had even produced the proofs of loss alleged to have been furnished, their contents would not have been admissible as evidence of the amount of loss. Where the other evidence is meager and unsatisfactory as in this case, the court will reverse a judgment for the plaintiff: Cole v. Manchester Fire Assurance Co., 188 Pa. 345; Sutton v. Amer.

The defense had been that no proofs of loss had been furnished, and upon call the defendant had failed to produce them; but this did not prevent it from contending that these same proofs, whose very existence it denied, contained false statements that should avoid the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-9\">To constititute such fraud or false answers or swearing in proofs of loss as will render the policy void, it must be wilfully made in regard to a material matter with the intention of thereby deceiving the insurer: 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 1047 , Franklin Fire Ins. Co. v. Updegraff, 43 Pa. 350.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-10\">Even if plaintiffs had sworn that there were no judgments upon the land, when there were several, it would not affect the policy, because in no way a material matter.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ayq\">May 18, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\">Opinion bt</p>\n<author id=\"AqD\">Beeber, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">Although the pleadings in this case raised many issues of fact, when the case came to trial the only question tried was whether notice of the fire and proofs of loss had been sent to the defendant. The plaintiffs were relieved of the necessity of proving an adjustment or the extent of their loss in view of the defendant\u2019s admission at the trial, that the amount claimed in the plaintiff\u2019s statement was the share due by the defendant in case it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>liable at all. This renders immaterial the first assignment of error, which is the refusal of the court to affirm the point sub mitted by defendant, asking the court to say that nothing done by Weiser at the time of filling up the proofs of loss could be binding on the defendant as an act of adjustment of the loss. As the question of adjustment was no longer in the case, it was immaterial whether the acts of Weiser on that occasion amounted to a binding adjustment or not. In view of the rule of court set forth in the appellee\u2019s paper-book, which is in force in the court in which this case was tried, the acceptance of the policy in evidence, which is the subject of the fifth assignment, was proper. The refusal of the defendant\u2019s offer in evidence of the affidavit of defense as testimony to prove the defendant\u2019s denial of the receipt of notice of the fire and of the proofs of loss, which is the subject of the tenth assignment, was right. No attempt has been made to show that the affidavit is evidence of the facts alleged in it, either under the said rule of court, or under any general rule of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The third and sixth assignments go to the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that proofs of loss were sent to the defendant. The testimony on the part of the plaintiffs was to the effect that proofs of loss were made on a certain day by one Weiser, signed and sworn to by the plaintiffs and then delivered to him, who was one of the members of the firm of Deininger &amp; Weiser, local agents of the defendant, which firm had also countersigned the policy. All this evidence as to making out the proofs of loss was, of course, contradicted by Weiser, but the jury found for the plaintiffs. It is insisted by the defendant that this is not sufficient evidence, even if believed, to prove that the proofs of loss were sent to any of the officers of the company. The court below correctly decided that it was sufficient to prove a compliance with the terms of the policy, and that it was expressly made so by the terms of the Act of. June 27, 1883, P. L. 165, which provided that where insured property was destroyed by fire in this commonwealth the conditions of the policy, as to notice of loss and furnishing of preliminary proofs, shall be considered complied with, if they are given to the agent of the company who countersigned the policy within a certain time.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The seventh, eighth and ninth assignments relate to the cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>examination of the defendant\u2019s witness. In his examination in chief he had testified that he had not filled out proofs of loss for the plaintiffs, nor had he sent any to the defendant. Plaintiffs sought to avoid the effect of this by asking him whether he had not, at a prior time, made a statement in reference to this matter contradictory to the one which he had just made on the stand. We think this was proper. It is common practice to show, if one can, that a witness on a prior occasion had made statements inconsistent with his present one. Such cross-examination is not admissible for the purpose of showing that the witness had deceived others, which was one of the announced purposes for which plaintiffs\u2019 counsel examined him in this way, but it is clearly admissible, under all the authorities, for the purpose of showing that his account of matters, as to which he is giving testimony, has not always been the same, which was the other purpose for which this examination was conducted. It is true such a witness has a right to explain any contradictions, if he can, and such right was exercised in this case \u2014 to such an extent, in fact, that we cannot believe that the defendant\u2019s case was weakened to any appreciable degree by this attempt to impeach the testimony of this witness. In any event, it is a legitimate way to impeach the testimony of a witness, and we must sustain this well established rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The second assignment is to the refusal of the court to affirm the fourth point of the defendant. So far as this point requested the court to charge that the delivery of the proofs of loss to the local agents did not operate as a waiver of any defects in them, as it appeared \u201c they were not sent to or received by the company,\u201d we think it would have been an error to have affirmed it, because to have done so would have been a declaration by the court that it appeared that the proofs of loss had not been sent to or received by the defendant. This was the crucial point of the case. There was testimony that the proofs of loss had been given to the countersigning agent, which, under the said act of assembly, is a compliance with the conditions of the policy requiring proofs of loss to be sent to the company. It would have been plainly improper for the court to affirm this point which required it to assert that it appeared that proofs of loss had not been sent to or received by the defendant, when this was the very question to be decided by the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>upon the conflicting evidence as to proofs having been made out and given to the countersigning agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">During the cross-examination of one of the plaintiffs he said that, in those proofs of loss which he had given to the agent, nothing was said as to the existence of incumbrances against their insured property. Defendant then offered in evidence the record of two judgments against the plaintiffs, which were liens against the insured property, so far as it was real estate, for some years prior to the date of the policy, and continued so down to the time of making proofs of loss, for the purpose of showing that the plaintiffs were precluded from recovering because they had sworn falsely as to the incumbrances upon the insured property, which was in violation of that clause of the policy making \u201c false swearing by the insured touching any matter relating to the risk whether before or after loss \u201d a defense to a claim upon the policy. The rejection of this offer is the eleventh assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In the consideration of the question involved in this assignment, care must be taken to distinguish this case from those where a false statement is made in the application, upon the faith of which the policy is issued, Commonwealth Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Huntzinger, 98 Pa. 41, and from those where, in violation of a condition in the policy, an incumbrance falls upon the property, with or without the knowledge of the insured after the date of the policy and before loss, without notice having been given to the insured: Seybert v. Penna. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 108 Pa. 282; Penna. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 119 Pa. 449; Hench v. Ins. Co., 122 Pa. 128. In all the cases, of which these are types, it is uniformly held that false statements and subsequent incumbrances defeat the policy, whether they are made innocently or otherwise, or whether they fall upon the property with or without the knowledge and consent of the insured, but the present case belongs to neither one of these classes. It does not appear that the plaintiffs ever made any false statements upon the faith of which the property was insured, but it does appear by this offer that these judgments were incumbrances prior to the time of the issuing of the policy. In such a case it has been expressly decided that such judgments do not invalidate the policy: Dwelling House Ins. Co. v. Hoffmann, 125 Pa. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>It is strenuously insisted that these incumbrances should have been submitted to the jury with instructions that false answers in the proofs of loss and concealment of the existence of these incumbrances would avoid the policy. But mere false answers or concealment of the existence of incumbrances, made in proofs of loss, do not defeat the policy. It must appear that the false answers were made wilfully and knowingly, and with a view to cheat the company: Franklin Ins. Co. v. Updegraff, 43 Pa. 350. The case of Ellis v. Ins. Co., 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 264, cited by appellant, is easily distinguished from the present case. In that case the insured testified that she had knowingly made the false statements in her proof of loss. With this evidence in the case, we said: \u201c This is not the case of mistake of statement unwittingly or ignorantly made. Such mistakes are open to correction. Here the sworn misstatements are made and repeated on the witness stand, with knowledge that they are untrue. The guilty knowledge determines the fraudulent intent. . . . The fact of false swearing is thus proven, and where perjury is thus knowingly committed, the question cannot be submitted to the jury whether the intent was to defraud. The intent is demonstrated not only by the acts of the insured but by her admissions.\u201d In the present case the offered evidence did not show that there was a false statement in the proof of loss knowingly made, but an omission to state something. The witness did not say that he stated in the proofs of loss that there were no incumbrances, but that nothing was stated as to them. If the defendant wishes to take advantage of defects in proofs of loss, which it insists at the same time that it never received,- it must stand charged with the duties of one who has received defective or unsatisfactory proofs. If the answer to the questions in proofs of loss is ambiguous, or if there is no answer at all, and if the insurer wants specific, definite information, it is its duly to return the proofs with information as to the defects to be remedied, and ask for more specific proofs: Ins. Co. v. Cusick, 109 Pa. 157. The jury have found, in effect, that the defendant did receive these proofs of loss. All the authorities show that it cannot hold the proofs of loss with knowledge of the defects in them, and then, on the trial, attempt to avail itself of the defects unless it has notified the insured and given him a chance to correct them. Failing in this, it will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>presumed that it is satisfied with the proofs as received in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The fourth assignment is to the refusal of the court to give binding instructions for the.defendant. No discussion of this is necessary. It was clearly a case for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Being of the opinion that the case was rightly tried, and that no reversible error was committed, all the assignments are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
