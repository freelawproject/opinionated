Burns on April 15,1898, in favor of plaintiff for $226 and costs, $3.15, paid by defendant; Chas. Dugan bail in $50.00 for costs. And now, June 6,1898, petition presented in open court and rule granted on defendant, to show cause why appeal should not be stricken off. Returnable- June 11,1898, at 9: 30 A. m:.

MeF. </em>Carpenter, with him <em>A. K. </em>Stevenson, for appellants.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6-\">The question as to the power of the court to allow an appeal to be filed after the time prescribed by law has elapsed has been before the Supreme Court in Ward v. Letzkus, 152 Pa. 318. The facts in the present case and in the case cited are so nearly parallel that further discussion would seem to be unnecessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-5\">The Act of May 18, 1871, P. L. 938, and the decision in Ward v. Letzkus, supra, based on that act are conclusive.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-6\"><em>R. S. </em>Martin, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5D\">\u2014 The \u201c docket entries \u201d as printed in appellants\u2019 paper-book do not show when the appeal was filed, and as it is to be presumed the appeal was filed in time, there is no ground appearing in the record for striking it off, and the court below was right in discharging the rule according to appellants\u2019 own showing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-7\">Appellants\u2019 assignments of error are defective, because neither of them quotes the order of the court below complained of, discharging said rule to show cause and allowing the appeal to be filed nunc pro tunc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-8\">But in this appeal we do not deem it necessary to pursue the subject further than to cite the case of Yost v. Davison, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 469, where it is held by this court that an order similar to the order appealed from in this case is an interlocutory order, and not the subject of an appeal. We submit that Yost v. Davison, supra, rules this case, and that this court has therein decided adversely to appellants all of the questions presented by this appeal.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJq\">May 18, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b308-9\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">In Yost v. Davison, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 469, we held that an order allowing a transcript of appeal from the judgment of a justice of the peace to be filed nunc pro tunc is interlocutory, and from it an independent appeal does not lie. This conclusion was reached after a full consideration of the question and we see no reason for not adhering to it. See also Starr\u2019s Estate, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 212, Drum v. Uplinger, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 404, and Powell v. Gayley, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">The appeal is quashed at the costs of the appellant, and the record is remitted with a procedendo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
