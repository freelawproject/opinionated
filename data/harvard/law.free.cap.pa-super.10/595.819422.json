His statement averred that the defendant, who was a butcher by occupation, with an employee, was driving a wild and vicious steer along the public highway, knowing the said animal to be wild and vicious, carelessly and recklessly, without taking proper care and caution to handle and control it, and that, by reason of the defendant\u2019s negligence, plaintiff received the injury complained of. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence failed to show any knowledge on the part of the defendant that the animal was of a dangerous and vicious character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-10\">Defendant presented the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-11\">1. The plaintiff having failed to show that the defendant had notice of any vicious disposition on the part of the animal that caused the injury, prior to defendant\u2019s having taken possession of the same, the latter is not liable unless he was guilty of carelessness or negligence in the handling and management of the steer after the same broke away. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-12\">[2.

If there was no negligence, as there surely was none on the part of the defendant, at the time the cattle escaped, there surely could be none after the cattle got beyond his control.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-7\">A. man has a right to drive his cattle along the public highways, and if in exercising this right he uses ordinary care and diligence, and the cattle escape into the adjoining inclosure without his fault, he is not liable for any damages they may do, provided he immediately pursues and drives them off as soon as possible: 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 362, quoting Dovaston v. Payne, 2 H. Bl. 528, Slackpoll v. Healy, 16 Mass. 33, Mills v. Stark, 4 N. H. 512, and R. R. Co. v. Munger, 5 Den. (N.

Wills, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 1, in which the opinion of the court was delivered by Judge Smith. We would also refer the court to the case of Rossell v. Cottom, 31 Pa. 525, in which the opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Thompson. We also refer the court to the case of Goodman v. Gay, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>15 Pa. 188, where the general subject is very fully discussed and considered in an opinion by Mr. Justice Coulteb. We desire, in conclusion, to refer the court to the case of Fichen v. Jonas, 28 Cal. 622, in which the opinion of the court is delivered by Mr. Justice Cubby of the Supreme Court, in which the principle or doctrine contended for by appellee is very fully discussed in a case almost parallel to the one at bar. We therefore submit that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A7gH\">July 28, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A2pY\">Oblady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The plaintiff was injured on a public highway, being thrown down by a runaway steer which had escaped from the control of the defendant while being driven, with three others, from the farm on which they were reared to the slaughter house of the defendant. The statement in this action of trespass avers that the defendant .... had the care and management of a certain ox, which before and at the time of plaintiff\u2019s injury \u201c was wild and vicious, and it was then unsafe and improper to drive, or permit, or suffer said ox to go over or through any public highway, without causing or procuring the same to be tied down or confined, or otherwise secured, so as to prevent said ox from doing mischief or damage to any person or persons passing along or being on such highway; of all of which the defendant before and at the time of the grievances hereinbefore mentioned had notice and that the defendant negligently by himself and servants drove and allowed the ox to run at large without being under proper control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">It is contended that the plaintiff cannot recover because the statement averred knowledge on the defendant\u2019s part of the vicious character of the steer when he undertook to drive it along the highway, and that the proof failed to show any such knowledge. This is too critical a view to take of the statement, as it also averred notice that the steer was wild and vicious \u201cbefore and at the time of the grievances.\u201d The case was tried on the theory that the defendant was negligent in not taking due precautions against the naturally to be anticipated acts of a wild and vicious steer while it was in his care. The first point submitted by the defendant was as follows: \u201c The plaintiff having failed to show that the defendant had notice of any vicious disposition on the part of the animal that caused the injury prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>to the defendant\u2019s having taken possession of the same, the latter is not liable, unless he was guilty of carelessness or negligence in the handling and management of the steer after the same broke away,\u201d which was affirmed by the court without any qualification, and which required the submission of the case to a jury. It was left to that body in an impartial and adequate charge, in which the trial judge said: \u201c The whole question turns upon whether or not the defendant, or those acting for him, did all that was reasonable and proper after the steer manifested that it was wild and perhaps dangerous \u2014 did all that they could to get him under control and to take him to some place of safety.\u201d With the conflict of testimony and the contradictory statements of some of the witnesses we have nothing to do, as they were properly submitted to the only tribunal authorized by the law to dispose of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
