Plaintiff, at the same time entered upon the record his agreement to a stay of execution for one year without requiring security. Afterward defendant filed with the justice receipts for various amounts paid to the plaintiff. On August 28,1880, plaintiff by writing filed with the justice, assigned $38.25 to James Pinks, the use plaintiff. On May 2,1898, a transcript of the judgment was taken and filed in the court of common pleas of Clarion county and on the same day a scire facias to revive was issued thereon. Plaintiff filed an affidavit of defense averring certain matters of set-off and also averring that since \u201c the date of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged judgment your affiant and W. A. Steltzer, the legal plaintiff, had various dealings and during the continuance of the same had several settlements in full of all accounts, the last of which was February 4, 1895, when there was found due your affiant the sum of $4.95 which was paid by the same W. A. Steltzer to your affiant at the date aforesaid.\u201d The affidavit further avers in regard to the use plaintiff as follows : \u201c That he and the use plaintiff James Pinks had various dealings after the date of the alleged assignment up and until the 3d of February, 1883, at which time there was a full settlement of the accounts and dealings between the said parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">The court below refused the rale for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.

Smith, 81 Pa. 182; Thompson v. Clarke, 56 Pa. 33. See also King v.

Sitgreaves, 81* Pa. 378. The Supreme Court has followed this principle in several later cases, and in Ensign v <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Kindred, 163 Pa. 638, it is said: \u201cWe do not mean to interfere where rules for judgment have been discharged in the lower courts in doubtful and uncertain cases, but only in such as are very clear and free of doubt, as we have frequently said.\u201d To the same effect is \u00c6tna Insurance Co. v. Confer, 158 Pa. 598, and in Radcliffe v. Herbst, 135 Pa. 568, and Holland &amp; Co. v. Sunbury Iron Works, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 261, the principle is fully discussed and the above cases cited.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6t\">May 18, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Alr\">William W. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">No error was committed by the court below in dismissing the rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense in this case. The averment of the defendant is that since \u201cthe date of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged judgment your affiant and W. A. Steltzer, the legal plaintiff, had various dealings and during the continuance of the same had several settlements in full of all accounts, the last of which was February 4,1895, when there was found due your affiant the sum of $4.95 which was paid by the same W. A. Steltzer to your affiant at the date aforesaid.\u201d In respect to the use plaintiff, who claims a part interest in the judgment, the defendant sets forth in his affidavit that \u201c he and the use plaintiff James Pinks had various dealings after the date of the alleged assignment up and until the 3d day of February, 1883, at which time there was a full settlement of the accounts and dealings between the said parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">We are of opinion that these allegations in view of the long period during which the plaintiff made no attempt to collect the judgment and of the solvency of defendant, furnish sufficient ground for the action of the court below in refusing to enter judgment. \u201c A legal presumption of payment does not indeed arise short of twenty years yet it has been often held that a less period with persuasive circumstances tending to support it may be submitted to the jury as a ground for a.presumption of fact: \u201d Moore v. Smith, 81 Pa. 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The allegations of full settlements between the parties were of facts sufficiently strong in support of the presumption of payment, to take the case to the jury where the sci. fa. to' revive was issued nineteen years and nine months from the date of the entry of the original judgment before the justice of the peace and seventeen years and three months from the last payment on account credited on his docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>As this case must be tried we refrain from discussion of the merits. The appeal is dismissed without prejudice, etc., at the cost of the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
