The judgment was taken in the name of the Whitesells and by them subsequently assigned to Maul. M. H. Stevenson bought the property and Whitesell agreed to accept certain securities in satisfaction of the judgment and thereupon entered satisfaction as \u201c attorney for plaintiff and use plaintiff.\u201d Suit was brought on these securities in Maul\u2019s name and with his knowledge. Maul subsequently asked for a rule to strike off the satisfaction of the judgment on the ground that he had not authorized the same. This rule was made absolute by the court below and reversed by the ' Supreme Court in an opinion given by Williams, J., reported in Whitesell v. Peck, 165 Pa. 571.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-11\">During the pendency of the appeal defendant issued an execution upon the judgment and made a levy upon the real estate of which M.

Stevenson applied to the court below for restitution, but that court in an opinion by Porter, J., held that the case was entirely within the control of the Supreme Court and that the common pleas had no power to ingraft an order of restitution upon the decree of the Supreme Court; whereupon Stevenson filed his petition in the Supreme Court for a writ of restitution which writ was awarded on May 25, 1896, in a per curiam opinion reported in Whitesell v.

Peck, 165 Pa. 571, and s. c. 176 Pa. 170, give us in result the basis of the present action. In the former Mr. Justice Williams, delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201c This judgment was marked satisfied on the record on the 26th day of November, 1892, by Whitesell &amp; &amp; Sons, who were the legal plaintiffs therein, and the attorneys of their assignee, Maul. More than eighteen months afterward this entry of satisfaction was struck off by the court below, at the instance of Maul, who testified on the hearing that he made the application at the suggestion of Whitesell.\u201d It is not surprising, therefore, that the plaintiff in his statement alleged, as one of the grounds upon which he based his right to recover, that \u201c the said Maul at the suggestion and on the advice of said defendant presented to said court his petition, setting forth, inter alia, that he had never authorized or ratified the satisfaction of said judgment so made by his attorney.\u201d The jury found as a fact that the defendant had practiced a deceit upon the plaintiff by his representations as to his authority from the use plaintiff in the judgment, which had been satisfied, to satisfy the same. By this finding the appellant admits himself bound but claims that he is not responsible for and not bound by the act of Maul and that, therefore, he is not liable in damages for any expense to which the plaintiff was put by reason of Maul\u2019s application to have the satisfaction which was entered in the judgment against Peck stricken off and the subsequent proceedings had therein. There would be much force in this contention, if Maul, had acted entirely independent of or in opposition to the wishes of the appellant. The contrary is quite apparent. Although Maul does not testify in this ease distinctly that the appellant suggested the application for striking off the satisfaction of the judgment against Peck et al., the circumstances were, nevertheless, such as to suggest their cooperation in the effort, and this was an element in the ease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>which it was proper for the jury to consider. The defendant\u2019s points were, therefore, properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">As to the measure of damages, the rule was. strictly, if not narrowly, applied \u2014 the plaintiff was eon\u00f1n\u00e9d to actual cash outlays. Of this the appellant cannot with good reason complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The suggestion \u201c that, if there is any liability whatsoever, the liability should have been fixed as costs in these proceedings, and the plaintiff, Stevenson, having failed to have the costs so fixed by the Supreme Court, he it estopped now from recovering the same in an independent action as in this case,\u201d will not bear examination. The proceeding to satisfy was commenced by Maul. Whitesell was not a party to it on the record in such a way as to be properly reached by the court\u2019s decree. Maul was not to be held responsible for Whitesell\u2019s alleged misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">It follows, from what has been said, that the testimony as to the plaintiff\u2019s expenditures in the employment of counsel and . printing of paper-books was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The case was fairly and adequately presented to the jury in a clear and dispassionate charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Upon a careful review of the whole ease, we find no reversible error and the judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
