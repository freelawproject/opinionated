J., dismissed all the exceptions and confirmed the report of the auditor, filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AI2\">Paul Ritter, the testator, and Hannah his wife, were each possessed of an estate; they were well advanced in life, and were childless. The wife\u2019s estate amounted to some $1,200 or $1,400, and has passed into the husband\u2019s hands. On the 80th of January, 1891, she executed and acknowledged an assignment and transfer of her entire estate to her husband, the purpose of the transfer, as expressed in the paper, being \u201c to debar my heirs forever from asserting any right to said sum of money, or of disputing my husband\u2019s right thereto.\u201d The assignment contains this reservation or condition, \u201c but out of said sum my husband\u2019s executor is to pay the Catharine Neff legacy of $1,000, mentioned in my husband\u2019s will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">The will of Paul Ritter referred to in the assignment, bears date January 27, 1891, being three days prior in its execution to the wife\u2019s assignment, and contains the clause, \u201c After Hannah\u2019s death my executor is to sell my real estate and make good deeds for the same, and he is to collect all my personal estate, and turn it into money, and it is to be divided as follows: First, out of the proceeds of my real and personal estate I give to Catharine Neff One thousand Dollars, said legacy to have preference over all other legacies to be first paid. My wife Hannah gave me as a gift her estate and I prefer that said legacy be paid out of said estate so given me by my wife, but should this be consumed, said legacy is to be paid out of my other estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">Shortly after this, the wife, Hannah, died, and on the 25th of October, 1893, her husband, Paul, made another will which has been duly probated as his last will, and in which he revokes all former wills by him at any time made. This last will contains the following bequest to Tennia Neff, who, it is admitted, is identical with the Catharine Neff mentioned in the former will and in- the assignment from the wife to her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\">\u201c4th. I give and bequeath to the said Tennia Neff, wife of George Neff, Five Hundred dollars in money.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-8\">On May 29, 1896, the testator, Paul Ritter, executed his single bill confessing judgment in favor of the same Catharine Neff in the sum of $1,000, which was duly entered to No. 131 of September term, 1896, and became a lien upon the real estate. This single bill contains the following recital:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cWhereas, Paul Ritter of Quincy township, Franklin county, Pennsylvania, on the 30th day of January, A. D., 1891, made his last will and testament, in which among other bequests, he gave and bequeathed to Catharine Neff, of said township, the sum of $1,000, to be paid to her out of his estate. The wife of the said Paul Ritter at the same time executed an instrument of writing, setting over and transferring all her estate to her husband, the said Paul Ritter. Now in order to secure to said Catharine Neff the certainty of the payment of the legacy of $1,000,1 hereby acknowledge myself to owe and stand indebted to said Catharine Neff,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">The discrepancy as to the date assigned to the will, is' without significance, it being admitted that it is the will of January 27, 1891, that is referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">Ritter, the testator, died June 11, 1897. The judgment in favor of Catharine Neff has been paid out of his estate. In addition, Catharine Neff claims the legacy of $500 given her under the last will of October 2,1893. The auditor distributing the estate, has rejected her claim to the legacy, on the ground that it was adeemed by the judgment of $1,000, winch had been paid her. The exceptions filed are directed to this conclusion of the auditor, and present the one issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">The question is one wholly of intention, and the burden is upon those who assert that it was intended by the judgment to pay and satisfy the legacy. The law raises no such presumption in a case of this kind, since the relation of parent and child did not exist between the testator and his legatee. Mrs. Neff was the testator\u2019s housekeeper. In Sprenkle\u2019s Appeal, 15 Atl. Rep. 773, we' have a clear decision that such relation raises no presumption of satisfaction from a subsequent gift.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">Nor does the contention that the judgment was given in fulfillment of this particular legacy derive any support from-the written evidence of the transaction. By the terms of the single bill it appears that it was given as substitutional for a legacy of $1,000, in a will that has been revoked by testator\u2019s own act, and there is nothing whatever in the instrument to suggest that this was not its only purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">It became necessary for the parties contesting to resort to extrinsic evidence, and, under objection, they offered evidence showing the circumstances under which the several wills and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the judgment were executed, and the declarations of the testator as to his own understanding of what the latter was intended to accomplish.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">As to the admissibility of such evidence, there can be no question. It was not offered to explain an ambiguity, for there is none; nor to correct a mistake in the will, nor to alter or vary any of its terms, but simply to discover what purpose was in the mind of Paul Ritter when he executed the judgment note. That purpose, whatever it was, must govern.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">The legacy of $500, given in the last will was, either intended to be additional to the $1,000 legacy in the earlier will, or, it was the same legacy reduced in amount, that is to say, if not the former, it was intended to take the place of the larger legacy and was a substitute for it. It is important to determine which it was, because if intended as an additional legacy, it is manifestly outside of the operation of the judgment note; if, on the other hand, it was intended as a substitute, and the object in giving the judgment note was to fulfil the whole purpose of the original legacy, in such case the later legacy being identical with the earlier, except as changed in amount, would also find its fulfillment in the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\">On a careful consideration of the case we find nothing that leads us to suppose that an additional legacy was intended. On the contrary every circumstance points to the conclusion that testator\u2019s purpose was to reduce the earlier legacy one half. Whether it was honest in him to attempt this, in view of the fact that he had received the larger amount from his wife on condition, or promise on his part, that he would bequeath it to this legatee, or whether he could 'have defeated Mrs. Neff\u2019s claim to it by such act, are questions aside from our present inquiry; we are concerned only with his purpose. Not only is there no suggestion in the last will that additional bounty is intended, but all reference to the money derived from his wife, and the purpose of the wife in connection with the gift, is avoided, and the earlier will which contained a free reference to these matters, and which directed a legacy of $1,000, in fulfillment of the understanding between the testator and his wife, is revoked. We dare not, under such circumstances as these, suppose that the $1,000 legacy was additional. Testator was a German, with little if any knowledge of the English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>language, but no question was ever raised as to his intelligence. He must have known that his last will revoked the earlier one, and that with it fell the legacy of $1,000. He made no reference to it in his last will, nor does he recognize in any way the liability of his estate for it, until he is brought to face the alternative of securing it for Mrs. Neff, or losing her services as housekeeper, and then he gives the judgment note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">If then we are to regard the legacy in the-last will as substitutional and not as supplemental or additional, the purpose in giving the judgment note, it would seem should embrace both legacies, unless there is something expressed in the note to indicate the contrary. Here we are met with the fact that the single bill while clearly expressing a purpose to secure the legacy contained in the earlier will, is silent with respect to the last will, and but for the substitutional character of the later legacy which identifies it with the earlier one, the rule that the express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another, would leave the later legacy unaffected. But in this connection we are to have regard to the situation or circumstances of testator when he gave the single bill. This paper was prepared by a scrivener who was as ignorant of German as the testator was of English, and could only know what testator meant or what he wanted as the testator\u2019s speech was interpreted to him by men who were unskilled in legal requirement. The rule referred to is not to be applied with utmost strictness to a paper drawn and executed under such circumstances. But without relaxing the rule, its effect is fully overcome by the subsequent declarations of the testator with reference to the single bill and his understanding of its effect. The admissibility of these subsequent declarations in evidence can be established by numerous authorities. It is unnecessary to cite more than Zeiter v. Zeiter, 4 Watts, 21. The rule as there laid down has been steadily followed ever since in questions of this character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">The witnesses who testify to these subsequent declarations were neighbors and acquaintances of the testator. The conversations as testified to by them, show unmistakably that it was the testator\u2019s understanding that in giving the judgment he was fulfilling the whole purpose of the earlier legacy, and of the later one as well. To Mr. Middour he said that he has \u201c fixed a paper down at Stoler\u2019s in Waynesboro, that Tennia would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>get |1,000 now in place of the $500, that lie had put in the will.\u201d That they (the Neffs) had found out that he had made a will, and that they were not getting the $1,000, and that they would move away and not stay with him any longer if they did not get the $1,000. When Mr. Middour suggested to him that the Neffs might get both the $1,000 and the $500 legacies, his reply was, \u201cNo, Stoler fixed it for only $1,000.\u201d The other declarations proven were equally as explicit, and show beyond dispute that the single bill does not by its terms express the whole of testator\u2019s purpose in its execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">In view of the facts and circumstances we have referred to, we do not think that Mrs. Neff\u2019s claim to this legacy of $500, can be enforced consistently with equity and good conscience. She has already received payment of h\u00e9r judgment, and we are convinced that to allow her this legacy in addition, would be a pro tanto duplication of payment. We agree with the auditor in his conclusions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">And now, November 19,1898, the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report are overruled, and the report is confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">Exceptions dismissed and report confirmed.

They were found by an auditor and concurred in by the court; but it is said that they were based upon the testimony of a witness whose testimony was not competent and should have been excluded. The appellant argues the admissibility of the testimony of this witness as though an effort were being made to reform or vary the terms of the will and that, therefore, the testimony of two witnesses or what would be at least equivalent thereto is necessary, but this is not the case. There is no effort to reform the will or to vary its terms in any way. The sole question is one of the intention of the testator in giving the judgment note. If the testator had died, without executing the note upon which judgment was entered in favor of the appellant, there is no question as to what the result, so far as appellant\u2019s interests are concerned, would have been. She would have taken under the last will, the provisions of the first will being annulled by the later one. Did the testator, by recounting in the note the provision which had been made for the appellant in his first will, intend thereby to continue the provision made for the appellant in both of his wills, or did he merely intend to assure to the appellant the amount of the legacy named in his first will? We are of the opinion that, from an examination of the papers themselves, the latter statement expressed the intention of the testator; but whatever differences of opinion there may be as to the intention, of the testator, viewed from the papers themselves, there can be little question in regard to it, when the testimony of Stoler, the justice of the peace who prepared the judgment note, and Middour, to whom the plaintiff frequently communicated his intentions, is considered. The appellant and her husband became uneasy, fearing that the testator might in some way have done something to deprive them of the legacy specified in the first will, and proposed to leave his employ. Possibly they may have suspected or become satisfied of the existence of the last will. The suggestion as to a mode of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>providing for the payment of the amount of the legacy mentioned in the first will came from the justice of the peace who prepared the judgment note upon which judgment was entered and which was paid to the appellant by the executor, before, the distribution of the estate; but it is to be borne in mind that the appellant and her husband were insisting upon some provision which would secure it to her. After the execution of this judgment note, the testator frequently expressed himself to the witness Middour, stating that Tennia (meaning the appellant) would get $1,000 now in place of the $500. By making his second will, the testator simply changed his mind as to the amount which should be paid after his death to the appellant, and the execution of the judgment note was equivalent to another change of mind and to an agreement with her that, under no circumstances, should she receive less from his estate than $1,000, but the very terms of it show that it was not intended to secure to her the amount therein mentioned in addition to the testamentary provision for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">There was abundant testimony, entirely competent, upon which to base the auditor\u2019s findings of fact, the distribution made by him was undoubtedly in accordance with the testator\u2019s intentions and they must govern. The execution and delivery of the judgment note was equivalent to an ademption of the legacy and, when it was paid, the appellant\u2019s interest in the testator\u2019s estate was extinguished, except as to the interest thereon from the time of his death, which was allowed by the auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The distribution made by the auditor, as confirmed by the court, was based upon the intention of the testator ascertained properly, upon competent testimony, and the decree of the court, overruling the exceptions to his report, was entirely proper, for the reasons stated in the opinion accompanying the decree. Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
