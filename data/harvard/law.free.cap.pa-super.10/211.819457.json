J., of tbe 44th judicial district, specially presiding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-11\">It appears from the record that this was an action of assumpsit brought by George S. Barker on September 29, 1893, to recover for certain onions sold to the firm of Fairchild, Grace &amp; Co. The firm consisted of several partners, to wit: A. C. Fair-child, Y. W. Grace, George Grace and S. G. Dye. Service was had upon A. C. Fairchild and George Grace. Judgment was originally entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense and appeal was taken to the Supreme Court where the judgment was reversed (see Barker v. Fairchild, 168 Pa. 246). After the return of the record George S. Barker having died, his death was suggested and William Little, administrator, was substituted as plaintiff. Subsequently said administrator obtained leave and amended the statement of claim filed as follows: [Now, February 2, 1897, the plaintiff is permitted to amend his statement of claim in the above case by adding after the words, \u201c on the 31st day of October, A. D. 1891,\u201d the words, or within six years before bringing this suit.\u201d] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-12\">It appears from the evidence that answers to interrogatories, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>taken by depositions under commission, by Andrew Wilson, John T. McEntire and George S. Barker, were permitted to be read to tbe jury under objection of defendants\u2019 counsel, these answers tending to show a sale of the onions, the price of which was sued for, to the firm of which defendants were members and the admission of these answers were the subject of exceptions ' two to eight inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">The following interrogatories and answers are specifically set out: \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">.[4. Did you know George S. Barker in his lifetime, and do you know of his having business transactions with said firm, and how did you acquire such knowledge ? <em>Answer: </em>I knew George S. Barker in his lifetime, and knew of his having business with said defendant firm. I was with him about the first week in October, 1891, when he sold to said firm something over 20,000 pounds of onions. I was also present with both said George S. Barker and members of said firm after the delivery of the onions, on several occasions, when they acknowledged having received said lot of onions, and that they had not paid for them.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">[6. Do you know of George S. Barker having from said defendant any paper or writing, showing the purchase by them from him of any onions; and did you see any member of said firm make said writing or any part thereof, and what part? <em>Answer: </em>I know said George S. Barker had from said defendant firm a paper showing in writing the purchase by them from him of about $190 worth of onions. I was present when said George S. Barker had Mr. <em>W. </em>Grace \u201c O. K.\u201d the same; also when Mr. S..G. Dye wrote the word \u201ccorrect\u201d followed by his initials upon it.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">[T. Can you identify said paper now, and is this paper now shown you, and marked exhibit \u201cA., M. L. J.,\u201d-the one you refer to ? If so, have the commissioner attach same to your depositions. <em>Answer: </em>The paper shown me by the commissioner, marked exhibit \u201c A., M. L. J.,\u201d is exactly like the one I saw in said George S. Barker\u2019s possession, being the one on which I saw S. G. Dye write the word \u201c correct\u201d and his initials. The word \u201c correct \u201d and said initials on the paper now shown me is in Samuel G. Dye\u2019s handwriting, and the rest appears to he in the handwriting of V. W. Grace, and I believe I can safely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>say that this is the identical paper which said George S. Barker received from said firm; being fully satisfied of that fact, I hand said paper to the commissioner to be attached to this deposition.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">[8. Do you know or can you set forth any other matter or thing which may be of benefit or advantage to the parties at issue in this case, or either of them, or that may be material to the subject of this your examination, or the matter in question in this cause ? If so, set forth the same fully and at large in your answer. <em>Answer: </em>I can only say that I heard both V. W. Grace and S. G. Dye repeatedly admit the indebtedness sued on in this case. They also told said George S. Barker and my self on several occasions that the same was an honest debt, and that Mr. A. C. Fairchild of Towanda, Pa., was a member of said firm, and was amply good for it.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">The court admitted in evidence, under objection of defend ant, the paper marked \u201c Exhibit A,\u201d which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-7\">[\u201c G.

G.D.\u201d] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-13\">The court admitted in evidence the answer of John T. Me-Entire to the sixth interrogatory as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-14\">6. Are you familiar with the handwriting of any of said firm; and if so, in whose handwriting is said paper, or any parts thereof ? <em>Answer: </em>Yes, I am familiar with the handwriting of V. W. Grace. All of the handwriting on the slip now shown \u25a0 me by the commissioner, marked exhibit \u201c A., M. L. J.,\u201d is in Y. W, Grace\u2019s handwriting, except the words \u201c Correct, S. G. D.\u201d at the end thereof.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-15\">The court charged the jury, inter alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-16\">[The case you have been sworn to try is that of William Little, administrator of the estate of George S. Barker against A. C. Fairchild, V. W. Grace, George Grace and S. G. Dye, late partners trading as Fairchild, Grace &amp; Co.] [9] ....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-17\">[On the part of the plaintiffs they claim that in the month of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>October or, as it was placed in tbeir first statement, on the 31st day of October, 1891, they delivered to the defendants 23,908 pounds of onions, at the price of eighty cents a hundred. In support of their claim they have introduced the evidence of three different persons, one of whom testifies that he saw Mr. Barker in his lifetime deliver to the defendants over 20,000 pounds of onions.] [10] ....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\">[There is another witness, however, who testifies that he was present when members of the firm of Fairchild, Grace &amp; Co., delivered to Mr. Barker, the original plaintiff in the case, a memorandum of onions that the firm had bought of Mr. Barker, and they have attached to the deposition a memorandum which he swears, in his opinion, is the memorandum that he saw delivered to Mr. Barker by Mr. Grace and by Mr. Dye. . . . And he swears that he believes that to be the paper that was given by these defendants to Mr. Barker as a statement of the onions that they had bought.] [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $250.72. Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (1) in allowing amendment to plaintiff\u2019s statement, reciting same.

(9-11) To portions of the judge\u2019s charge, reciting same. (12) Refusing binding instructions for defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-8\"><em>Rodney A. Mereur, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJe\">This action in assumpsit is and was brought to, recover an alleged debt founded on a \u2022book account, and the plaintiff particularly specified the date of the said account, to wit: \u201c October 31, 1891.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-9\">Justice Fell in rendering the opinion in Barker v. Fairchild, 168 Pa. 246, says, \u201c If the sale was on some other date the defendants were not liable under the statement filed. At a trial no recovery could be had against them without an amendment.\u201d The act of 1887 requires \u201c a concise statement \u201d and the act of 1806 requires \u201c a statement of ... . demand .... particularly specifying the date of the .... book account,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4ig\">Gan it be said that a statement of claim to recover for goods sold and delivered where the date is uncertain and is particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>larly declared to be in the alternative, is \u201ca concise statement? \u201d Fortunately our appellate courts have declared repeatedly that a statement must exhibit a complete cause of action, in such clear, express and unequivocal language, that if the material averments are'not denied by the defendant, a judgment in default may be entered and liquidated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">So it was declared in Byrne v. Hayden, 124 Pa. 170. The next case in point of time is Fritz v. Hathaway, 135 Pa. 274. Both of these cases were followed in Newbold v. Pennoek, 154 Pa. 591, and Winkleblake v. Van Dyke, 161 Pa. 5. Then follows the case of Bank v. Ellis, 161 Pa. 241.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">Fritz v. Hathaway, supra, was followed in Murphy v. Taylor, 173 Pa. 317; Bank v. Ellis, supra, was followed in Peale v. Addicks, 174 Pa. 543; and both the Byrne and Ellis cases were followed in the recent one of Acme Mfg. Co. v. Reed, 181 Pa. 382. This court has expressly followed Fritz v. Hathaway, supra, in several cases, and among them, Hutton v. McLaughlin, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 642, and both are followed in Close v. Hancock, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 207, Byrne v. Hayden, supra, in Clements v. Dempsey, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 52, Bank v. Ellis, supra, in Louchheim v. Maguire, 6 Pa. Superior Ct. 635, and in the recent case of Clark v. Lindsay, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-7\">The plaintiff does not recover on the proofs alone; he recovers secundum allegata et probata.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-8\">In a iong line of cases, commencing with Farmers\u2019 &amp; Mechanics\u2019 Bank v. Israel, 6 S. &amp; R. 293, where it was held \u201c the court will not permit a declaration to be amended by the introduction of a new, and entirely different, cause of action from that originally set forth.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-9\">The learned court erroneously charged the jury (ninth assignment) that the case they were sworn to try was \u201c against A. C. Fairchild, V. W. Grace, George Grace and S. G. Dye, late partners trading as Fairchild, Grace &amp; Co.\u201d This was not the-fact, as the only, defendants the jury were sworn to try the case against were A. C. Fairchild and George Grace. No appearance was ever entered for any one else. No other defendants ever filed pleas. No verdict nor judgment was ever rendered or entered against any others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-10\">This same error permeated the entire case, and the learned court admitted certain answers to interrogatories as competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>testimony, and charged the jury as if all the defendants were actually parties defendant and on trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">The mistaken theoiy upon which this case was tried, was the apparent belief that all that was necessary to be shown was a cause of action. It was immaterial whether it was the one laid in the declaration or not: Clark v. Lindsay, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">It is impossible to tell from all the testimony offered upon the trial of this case whether exhibit \u201c A \u201d was offered to prove the entries in plaintiff\u2019s books, or as a written admission of indebtedness and consequent liability on the part of the. defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">Exhibit \u201c A \u201d is not a book entry. It is not in the handwriting of the plaintiff nor of any one in his employ. The evidence shows it is all in the handwriting of V. W. Grace and S. G. Dye, and not of A. C. Fairchild or George Grace or either of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-8\">If exhibit \u201c A \u201d was offered to prove the book account upon which plaintiff declared, then we contend the allegata and probata do not agree, because the alleged copy of the book entry mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s statement, is not exhibit \u201c A,\u201d as plainly appears by comparison.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-9\">The plaintiff now has a judgment based on a right of action not set forth in his statement (a verdict recovered for goods sold and delivered upon alleged \u201c book entries \u201d which do not exist), and therefore extends beyond it, which is directly contrary to all precedents. This doctrine is expressly recognized by this court in the recent case of Sullivan County v. Middendorf, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 71, where several authorities are cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-10\"><em>S. W. </em>Little, with him <em>Wm. Little, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsqN\">We clearly had the right with permission of the court to file an entirely new declaration, even to have entirely changed the form of action. Why is that right given us by statute ? In the language of the act, so that no \u201c plaintiff shall be nonsuited by reason of any informality in any statement or declaration.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-11\">But beyond the authority given by our statute to grant amendments, every court has a common-law right to grant amendments. Mr. Justice Shabswood in Penna. &amp; N. Y. R. R. Co. v. Bunnell, 81 Pa. 414, says: \u201c The idea that all amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>must depend upon statute is essentially erroneous. Every court of record has at common law a power of amendment,\u201d etc.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ATC\">March 23, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ACr\">William W. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The amendment made of the statement of claim by the permission of the court was certainly broad. It permitted the introduction of proof on the trial which might otherwise have been excluded. The question, however, arises whether advantage can now be taken of the character of the amended statement. The allowance of it was within the power of the court below. The right to amend was with the plaintiff. The amendment did not change the cause of action. The leave given to amend is not such a final order as may be separately appealed from. Nor was attempt made to appeal. The action of the court was excepted to, but was not made the subject of alleged error in this court until the review of a trial held more than six months after amendment made. The form of the amended pleading might have been attacked by demurrer, but no demurrer was filed. The cause went to trial on the statement as amended. This cured the defect in the pleading, if defect existed. We, therefore, do not sustain the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">This action was originally brought against the firm of Fair-child, Grace &amp; Co., but service of the writ was had only on A. C. Fairchild and George Grace. The trial judge said to the jury that they were sworn to try a case \u201c against A. C. Fairchild, Y. W. Grace, George Grace and S. G. Dye, late partners, trading as Fairchild, Grace &amp; Co.\u201d Strictly this was not the fact, since but two of the defendants had been served. But the liability sought to be imposed upon the two defendants was not individual, but growing out of the partnership of which they were members. We do not think any injury was suffered by the defendants by reason of the accidental misstatement of the trial judge. It is therefore not an error for which we can reverse. This disposes of the ninth assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In view of what has been said in regard to the amended statement and the form of action in which the defendants are sought to be charged, we are of opinion that the second and seventh assignments cannot be sustained. The mouths of the immediate parties to the litigation having been sealed by the death of the plaintiff, the evidence supplied by the depositions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>was admissible to charge the members of the partnership with a debt contracted on behalf of the partnership by any of the partners in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The remaining assignments (save the tenth and twelfth) relate to the admission in evidence of a memorandum which was given to Barker in the following form: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cG. S. Barker:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201c 23,908 pounds Onions @ 80, $189.65.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">\u201c10 \u2014 31\u2014S. G. D. This is O. K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">\u201c Correct \u201c V. W. G.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">\u201cS. G. D.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">This was not a hook entry. The character of the document is clear when the initials thereon are explained by testimony to be those of two of the partners of the defendant firm. It was in the nature of an admission of indebtedness, and was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">The statement made by the trial judge (the subject of the tenth assignment) is supported by the testimony. The witness, Wilson, testified that he was with Barker \u201c about the first week in October, 1891, when he sold to said firm something over 20,000 pounds of onions. I was also present with both George S. Barker and members of the said firm after the delivery of the onions, and on several occasions when they acknowledged having received said lot of onions, and that they had not paid for them.\u201d The tenth assignment is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The learned counsel for the appellants has presented his case with earnestness and ability, but he has not convinced us that any reversible error has been committed by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">April 17, 1899. Motion for a reargument refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
