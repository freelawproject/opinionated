To remedy this abrupt break in the sidewalk, the street committee and sidewalk committee of the council with their engineer had a conference on the ground, and after mature deliberation, concluded that the most efficient method to assure the safety of persons using the sidewalk would be a construct a step at the end of the concrete pavement. In accordance with this plan the defendant placed a heavy hemlock plank twelve inches in width midway between the pavement levels so as to make two steps with a rise of between five and six inches each, the length being the width of the pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">From the time the step was placed in the pavement in June until the plaintiff received her injuries in the following November, she had passed over the sidewalk frequently, and was familiar with the location of the step and of its construction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>On the evening of November 21 she passed over it in safety, and on returning in the direction of her home, about 10 o\u2019clock during a storm she fell and was injured. She does not remember whether an electric light, which was located near by, was lighted or not, but testified that even when the light was burning \u201c it flickers and makes it wavy and you can\u2019t see; especially when the wind is blowing you can\u2019t see at all there; \u201d and that on this night \u201c it was very dark there.\u201d The foundation of the action against tbe borough is a neglect of performance of some duty of the authorities. It was the duty of the defendant borough to require the abutting property owners to construct and maintain a reasonably safe sidewalk, and in the exercise of its control over the sidewalk it had the undoubted right to construct and maintain some expedient at the end of the concrete pavement so as to make the sidewalk reasonably safe for persons traveling over it. The borough authorities recognized the necessity for action, and using their best judgment, in good faith they adopted what they believed to be the best plan for relieving the obstruction. It is not contended that the step was inadequate or defective in its original construction. The arrangement was a satisfactory one, as it had been continuously used for six months. The borough is not to be held liable for an error of judgment in devising the remedial structure without further proof than that which is adduced by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Moreover her own evidence fails to disclose the cause of the accident. The most friendly interpretation of it suggests no more than a conjecture that she may have fallen down over the step, or, from the pavement into the street, but there is fully as much warrant for the inference that she slipped on some object lying on the pavement. At most, whatever conclusion is reached as to the cause of the accident it is based upon a presumption unsupported by proven facts which are exclusively applicable to it. Her own knowledge of the accident is so uncertain as to justify her only in saying \u201c I don\u2019t know how it did happen, I fell so quick,\u201d and a jury should not be permitted to supply the additional facts and inferences to be drawn from them. The fifth assignment of error is sustained and the judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
