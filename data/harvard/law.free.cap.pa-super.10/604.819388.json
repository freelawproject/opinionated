That all the interest was paid to August 23, 1897, and appellants were informed and believed that the note would run one year, which would make the demand for payment August 23, 1898, and the appellants averred that the note was not due and payable as claimed by appellee and that the suit in this case was premature and irregular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-5\">Yerdict and judgment for plaintiff for #353.98.

The allegation that the note would run for one year was not admissible under Martin v. Berens, 67 Pa. 459. See also Clark v. Allen, 132 Pa. 40.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-9\">The court below committed no error in discharging the rule on plaintiff to give security for costs. \u201c The court, in its discretion, may refuse to require the plaintiff to give security for costs unless the defendant sets forth in his affidavit a. just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>defense to the action:\u201d Trenton Rubber Company v.

To the same effect are Leith v. Bush, 61 Pa. 395, and Knisely v. Shenberger, 7 Watts, 193.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AykN\">July 28, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AHV\">Orlady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The plaintiff brought suit on a promissory note in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201c \u00a7350.00 Pittsburg, Pa., April 26,1897.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">\u201c On demand after date I promise to pay to the order of John F.

Chessman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">\u201c Mary R. Chessman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">An affidavit of defense was filed in which the defendants deny the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue them jointly; and that any demand for payment was made before the suit was brought, and they allege that all interest due on the note was paid to August 23, 1897, and that one of the defendants was informed and believed that the note would run one year, which would extend the time for payment until August 23, 1898. A judgment was entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. An obligation, which in its terms purports to be that of one person, as \u201c I hereby bind myself,\u201d etc., and is executed by more than one, may be treated as the several obligation of each person who signed it, or the joint obligation of all: Knisely v. Shenberger, 7 W. 193; Leith v. Bush, 61 Pa. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">The parol agreement even if sufficiently alleged with one of the makers is entirely at variance with the promissory note sued on, and cannot avail under the decisions of Martin v. Berens, 67 Pa. 459; Clarke v. Allen, 132 Pa. 40; Ziegler v. McFarland, 147 Pa. 607. See also cases cited in P. &amp; L. Dig of Dec. &amp; Enc. of Pa. Law, 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">As the court below properly entered judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, the defendant was not injured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the refusal to require the plaintiff to give security for costs on account of being a nonresideht of the state: Trenton Rubber Co. v. Small, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
