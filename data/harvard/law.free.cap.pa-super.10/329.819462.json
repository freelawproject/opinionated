Defendant filed an affidavit and supplemental affidavit of defense which alleged that the oranges which he had received, accepted and sold were not \u201c fancy oranges \u201d as ordered by defendant and sold to the defendant at the price of fancy oranges and that as a result he suffered a loss of fifty cents a box amounting to $336 on the entire lot. Defendant admitted in his affidavit of defense that a few of the boxes were in effect fancy oranges but alleged that these good boxes were so arranged about the door of the car that they would be first examined and that the balance of the carload was green, unripe oranges and not fancy oranges and unfit for immediate sale as such. A receipt was filed on account of principal debt and interest in the sum of $513.97.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-13\">The court below refused judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.

Bevan, 3 Rawle, 23.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Arj6\">May 18, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A-sa\">William W. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">The defendant in the case had two opportunities to present a defense by affidavit. Neither the original alone nor as supplemented by the second, sets forth facts which should have prevented the entry of judgment. Independent of the question whether there was a warranty and a breach, the defendant admits that a \u201cfew\u201d of the boxes contained oranges \u201cin accordance with the contract,\u201d He wholly neglects to indicate more ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>plicitly how many. The word \u201c few \u201d is a relative term and of great elasticity of meaning. The defense is set-off. The amount thereof is fixed by calculation of a loss alleged to be fifty cents per box. The set-off must be diminished to the extent of the number of boxes designated as a \u201c few.\u201d The circumstances set out and the form of the defendant\u2019s allegation indicate that he could have made an accurate statement of the number of good boxes and an exact calculation of the loss alleged to have been suffered. Upon the present affidavits it is impossible to liquidate the damages claimed as set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The affidavits are further deficient in that while alleging that the defendant sold the oranges at auction, he does not state under what circumstances the sale was held nor what price the goods brought, but only \u201c that they were worth in the market at least fifty cents per box less than they would have been worth had they been of the kind ordered.\u201d He fails to give the market price of the oranges of the kind he claims to have ordered and contents himself with alleging of the oranges delivered that he \u201c realized in consequence of their kind and character fifty cents per box less than he otherwise would have received \u201d and fixes the gross amount at $836, based on the whole number of boxes being deficient in kind and quality. This is an insufficient statement. The facts are evidently within the defendant\u2019s knowledge. His claim of set-off must be alleged in his affidavit of defense with exactness not only as to source and character but also as to amount: Close v. Hancock, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 207; Slag Works v. Krause, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 622. The importance of the observance of this rule is made the greater since the passage of legislation permitting the plaintiff to take judgment for such part of his claim as is not denied by affidavit of defense, to be due.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The judgment of the court below is reversed and the record is remitted with direction to the court below to enter judgment against the defendant for such sum as to right and justice may belong, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown to the said court why such judgment should not be so entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
