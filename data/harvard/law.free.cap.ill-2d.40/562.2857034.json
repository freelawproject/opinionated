Truschke, Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys, of counsel,) for the People.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b579-6\" pgmap=\"579\">Mr. Justice Underwood</author> <p id=\"Akz\" pgmap=\"579\">delivered the opinion of the court :</p> <p id=\"b579-7\" pgmap=\"579\">On November 3, 1965, Leon Smith was found guilty of armed robbery by a Cook County jury and sentenced to a term of four to eight years imprisonment following a trial in which he was represented by privately retained counsel. On April 27, 1967, Smith filed a pro se post-conviction petition, and the public defender was appointed to represent him.</p> <p id=\"b579-8\" pgmap=\"579\">We agree that the petition was properly dismissed because it failed, to allege facts showing a substantial denial of Smith\u2019s constitutional rights. (See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1967, chap. 38, par. 122\u20141.) Petitioner alleged (1) that \u201cthe identification of the defendant was without doubt too vague\u201d, (2) that \u201cthe trial was merely perfunctory and did not afford the defendant a fair and impartial hearing\u201d, (3) that \u201cmuch was made of the fact that no witnesses appeared to testify in behalf of the defendant, thus creating in the eyes of the jury that defendant was making no effort to prove his innocence\u201d, (4) that he was not granted \u201cethical fairness\u201d, (5) that it was not incumbent upon defendant to prove himself innocent.</p> <p id=\"b579-9\" pgmap=\"579(38) 580(170)\">Even when the allegations of the petition are \u201cliberally construed in favor of the petitioner\u201d they fail to show \u201cimprisonment in violation of the Federal or State constitution.\u201d (People v. Bernatowicz, 413 Ill. 181, 185; People v. Jennings, 411 Ill. 21, 26.) The errors claimed in the post-conviction petition are stated in a vague and conclusionary manner completely devoid of any factual evidence or supporting affidavits to substantiate the general allegations. Such nonfactual and nonspecific assertions which merely amount to conclusions are not sufficient to require a post-conviction hearing (People v. Satterwhite, 38 Ill.2d 138, 140; People v. Evans, 37 Ill.2d 27, 30; People v. Ashley, 34 Ill.2d 402), and the failure to attach supporting affidavits to the petition or adequately explain their absence permits the dismissal of the post-conviction proceeding where the petitioner\u2019s allegations are not \u201csubstantially borne out by matters appearing on the face of the record.\u201d (People v. Reeves, 412 Ill. 555, 559; Ill. Rev. Stat. 1967, chap. 38, par. 122\u20142.) Since petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing of any violation of his constitutional rights, the dismissal by the trial court was proper. People v. Ashley, 34 Ill.2d 402, 410; People v. Reeves, 412 Ill. 555, 560.</p> <p id=\"b580-5\" pgmap=\"580\">While appellate counsel asserts defendant\u2019s representation in the post-conviction hearing was inadequate in that leave to amend the petition should have been sought, no motion for leave to amend was there made nor does there appear any reason to believe the petition could have been successfully amended. People v. Knight, 38 Ill.2d 373; People v. Reed, 36 Ill.2d 358.</p> <p id=\"b580-6\" pgmap=\"580\">This case is distinguished on its facts from People v. Barnes, ante, p. 383, and People v. Craig, ante, p. 466, der cided this term, in that it does not affirmatively appear here that the public defender failed to communicate with the defendant regarding his post-conviction petition; in each of those cases the absence of communication by counsel with defendant was apparent from the record.</p> <p id=\"b580-7\" pgmap=\"580\">The judgment of the circuit court of Cook County is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b580-8\" pgmap=\"580\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b581-4\" pgmap=\"581\">Mr. Justice Ward took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b581-5\" pgmap=\"581\">Mr. Justice Schaefer,</author> <p id=\"AoD\" pgmap=\"581\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b581-6\" pgmap=\"581\">From the transcript of the hearing upon the motion to dismiss the post-conviction petition, at which the assistant public defender who represented the defendant did no more than read portions of the inadequate pro se petition to the trial judge, and made no request for leave to amend, I am satisfied that the defendant\u2019s representation on that hearing was not adequate. In my opinion the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for a hearing at which the defendant is adequately represented.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
