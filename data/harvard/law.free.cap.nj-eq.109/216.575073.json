It would serve no useful purpose to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>review the evidence in detail. Suffice it to say that in my judgment, under the circumstances of this case, the desertion charged by both parties was that of the complaining wife. The right of the husband to choose the marital domicile is unquestionable and under the circumstances of this case his demands were not, in my judgment, unreasonable. Assuming, for argument\u2019s sake, however, that the desertion was that of the defendant husband, his subsequent advances, sincere and <em>bona </em>fide, as I believe they were, and complainant\u2019s refusal to submit to those advances, clearly make her the deserter in the final analysis. And even assuming that his original demand that his wife .move to Mulberry street was unreasonable and unwarranted, his later demands on the occasion of his repeated attempts at a reconciliation cannot be the subject of criticism either by the complainant or by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-5\">\u201cAs to the complainant\u2019s defense of condonation, it was not originally pleaded, was plainly an afterthought, and is not supported by satisfactory or convincing evidence. It is an affirmative defense and the burden of proving it is on the one who asserts it. This burden has not been sustained by the complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-6\">\u201cI will advise a decree dismissing the bill of complaint and awarding a divorce to the defendant on his counter-claim on the ground of desertion.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-7\"><em>Messrs. </em>Lum,, <em>Tamblyn &amp; </em>Golyer, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-8\"><em>Messrs.
