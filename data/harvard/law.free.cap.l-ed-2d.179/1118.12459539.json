The girl\u2019s mother subsequently sued the government officials on the child\u2019s behalf for damages under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that the interview infringed the Fourth Amendment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed, ruling that the officials had violated the Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"AQs3H\">[563 U.S. 698]</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">by failing to obtain a warrant to conduct the interview. But the Court of Appeals further held that qualified immunity shielded the officials from monetary liability because the constitutional right at issue was not clearly established under existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-13\">The two officials sought this Court\u2019s review of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling on the Fourth Amendment. We granted their petitions to examine two questions. First, may government officials who prevail on grounds of qualified immunity obtain our review of a court of appeals\u2019 decision that their conduct violated the Constitution? And second, if we may consider cases in this procedural posture, did the Ninth Circuit correctly determine that this interview breached the Fourth Amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-14\">We conclude that  this Court generally may review a lower court\u2019s constitutional ruling at the behest of a government official granted immunity. But we may not do so in this case for reasons peculiar to it. The case has become moot because the child has grown up and moved across the country, and so will never again be subject to the Oregon in-school interviewing practices whose constitutionality is at issue. We therefore do not reach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>Fourth Amendment question in this case. In line with our normal practice when mootness frustrates a party\u2019s right to appeal, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 39, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36 (1950), we vacate the part of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion that decided the Fourth Amendment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">In February 2003, police arrested Nimrod Greene for suspected sexual abuse of a young boy unrelated to him. During the investigation of that offense, the boy\u2019s parents told police that they suspected Greene of molesting his 9-year-old daughter S. G. The police reported this information to the Oregon Department of Human Services, which assigned petitioner Bob Camreta, a child protective services caseworker, to assess S. G.\u2019s safety. Several days later, Camreta, accompanied</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">[563 U.S. 699]</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">by petitioner James Alford, a Deschutes County deputy sheriff, went to S. G.\u2019s elementary school and interviewed her about the allegations. Camreta and Alford did not have a warrant, nor had they obtained parental consent to conduct the interview. Although S. G. at first denied that her father had molested her, she eventually stated that she had been abused. Greene was indicted and stood trial for sexually abusing S. G., but the jury failed to reach a verdict and the charges were later dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">Respondent Sarah Greene, S. G.\u2019s mother, subsequently sued Camreta and Alford on S. G.\u2019s behalf<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for damages under  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which authorizes suits against state officials for violations of constitutional rights. S. G. alleged that the officials\u2019 in-school interview had breached the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription on unreasonable seizures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-10\">The District Court granted summary judgment to Camreta and Alford, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals first ruled that the interview violated S. G.\u2019s rights because Camreta and Alford had \u201cseize[d] and interrogate[d] S. G. in the absence of a warrant, a court order, exigent circumstances, or parental consent.\u201d 588 F.3d 1011, 1030 (2009) (footnote omitted). But the court further held that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity from damages liability because no clearly established law had warned them of the illegality of their conduct. <em>Id., </em>at 1031-1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-11\">The Ninth Circuit explained why it had chosen to rule on the merits of the constitutional claim, rather than merely hold that the officials were immune from suit. By addressing the legality of the interview, the court said, it could \u201cprovide</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-12\">[563 U.S. 700]</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-13\">guidance to those charged with the difficult task of protecting child welfare within the confines of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1022. That guidance came in no uncertain terms: \u201c[G]overnment officials investigating allegations of child abuse,\u201d the court warned, \u201cshould cease operating on the assumption that a \u2018special need\u2019 automatically justifies dispensing with traditional Fourth Amendment protections in this context.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-15\">Although the judgment entered was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>in their favor, Camreta and Alford petitioned this Court to review the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment. S. G. declined to cross-petition for review of the decision that the officials have immunity. We granted certio-rari. 562 U.S. 960, 131 S. Ct. 456, 178 L. Ed. 2d 285 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">We first consider our ability to act on a petition brought by government officials who have won final judgment on grounds of qualified immunity, but who object to an appellate court\u2019s ruling that they violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights. Camreta and Alford are, without doubt, prevailing parties. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision shielded them from monetary liability, and S. G. chose not to contest that ruling. So whatever else follows, they will not have to pay S. G. the damages she sought. The question we confront is whether we may nonetheless review the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that the officials violated the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">The statute governing this Court\u2019s jurisdiction authorizes us to adjudicate a case in this posture, and S. G. does not contend otherwise. [3] The relevant provision confers unqualified power on this Court to grant certio-rari \u201cupon the petition of <em>any </em>party.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1) (emphasis added). That language covers petitions brought by litigants who have prevailed, as well as those who have lost, in the court below. See E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, &amp;</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">[563 U.S. 701]</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice 87 (9th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Stern &amp; Gressman).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">S. G., however, alleges two impediments to our exercise of statutory authority here, one constitutional and the other prudential. First, she claims that Article III bars review because petitions submitted by immunized officials present no case or controversy. See Brief for Respondent 31-39. Second, she argues that our settled practice of declining to hear appeals by prevailing parties should apply with full force when officials have obtained immunity. See <em>id., </em>at 24-27. We disagree on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-12\">Article III of the Constitution grants this Court authority to adjudicate legal disputes only in the context of \u201cCases\u201d or \u201cControversies.\u201d To enforce this limitation, we demand that litigants demonstrate a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the suit. <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Earth Island Institute, </em>555 U.S. 488, 493, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>United States Parole Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Geraghty, </em>445 U.S. 388, 395-397, 100 S. Ct. 1202, 63 L. Ed. 2d 479 (1980). The party invoking the Court\u2019s authority has such a stake when three conditions are satisfied: The petitioner must show that he has \u201csuffered an injury in fact\u201d that is caused by \u201cthe conduct complained of\u2019 and that \u201cwill be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the opposing party also must have an ongoing interest in the dispute, so that the case features \u201cthat concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues.\u201d <em>Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 101, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). To ensure a case remains \u201cfit for federal-court adjudication,\u201d the parties must have the necessary stake not only at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>the outset of litigation, but throughout its course. <em>Arizonans for Official English </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, 67, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">[563 U.S. 702]</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">We have previously recognized that  an appeal brought by a prevailing party may satisfy Article Ill\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement. See <em>Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Roper, </em>445 U.S. 326, 332-336, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1980). Indeed, we have twice before allowed a party for whom judgment was entered to challenge an unfavorable lower court ruling. See <em>ibid.; Electrical Fittings Corp. </em>v. <em>Thomas &amp; Betts Co., </em>307 U.S. 241, 59 S. Ct. 860, 83 L. Ed. 1263 (1939).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that context as in others, we stated, the critical question under Article III is whether the litigant retains the necessary personal stake in the appeal. <em>Deposit Guaranty, </em>445 U.S., at 334, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427. As we will explain, a court will usually invoke rules of \u201cfederal appellate practice\u201d to decline review of a prevailing party\u2019s challenge even when he has the requisite stake. <em>Id., </em>at 333, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427; see <em>infra, </em>at 703-704, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1131. But in such a case, Article III is not what poses the bar; these rules of practice \u201cd[o] not have [their] source in the jurisdictional limitations\u201d of the Constitution. <em>Deposit Guaranty, </em>445 U.S., at 333-334, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427. So long as the litigants possess the personal stake discussed above, an appeal presents a case or controversy, no matter that the appealing party was the prevailing party below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">This Article III standard often will be met when immunized officials seek to challenge a ruling that their conduct violated the Constitution. That is not because a court has made a retrospective judgment about the lawfulness of the officials\u2019 behavior, for that judgment is unaccompanied by any personal liability. Rather, it is because the judgment may have prospective effect on the parties. The court in such a case says: \u201cAlthough this official is immune from damages</p>\n<p id=\"AMQFN\">[563 U.S. 703]</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">today, what he did violates the Constitution and he or anyone else who does that thing again will be personally liable.\u201d If the official regularly engages in that conduct as part of his job (as Camreta does), he suffers injury caused by the adverse constitutional ruling. So long as it continues in effect, he must either change the way he performs his duties or risk a meritorious damages action. Cf. <em>id., </em>at 337-338, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427 (discussing prevailing party\u2019s stake in a ruling\u2019s prospective effects). Only by overturning the ruling on appeal can the official gain clearance to engage in the conduct in the future. He thus can demonstrate, as we demand, injury, causation, and redress-ability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And conversely, if the person who initially brought the suit may again be subject to the challenged conduct, she has a stake in preserving the court\u2019s holding. See <em>Erie </em>v. <em>Pap\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number><em>A. M., </em>529 U.S. 277, 287-289, 120 S. Ct. 1382, 146 L. Ed. 2d 265 (2000); <em>Honig </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>484 U.S. 305, 318-323, 108 S. Ct. 592, 98 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1988); cf. <em>Lyons, </em>461 U.S., at 111, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (examining whether the plaintiff had shown \u201ca sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way\u201d). Only if the ruling remains good law will she have ongoing protection from the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\">We therefore reject S. G.\u2019s view that Article III bars us from adjudicating any and all challenges brought by government officials who have received immunity below. That the victor has filed the appeal does not deprive us of jurisdiction. The parties in such cases may yet have a sufficient \u201cinterest in the outcome of [a litigated] issue\u201d to present a case or controversy. <em>Deposit Guaranty, </em>445 U.S., at 336, n. 7, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">Article III aside, an important question of judicial policy remains.  As a matter of practice and prudence, we have generally declined to consider cases at the request of a prevailing</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">[563 U.S. 704]</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">party, even when the Constitution allowed us to do so. See, <em>e.g., Gunn </em>v. <em>University Comm. to End War in Viet Nam, </em>399 U.S. 383, 390, n. 5, 90 S. Ct. 2013, 26 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1970); <em>New York Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Maltbie, </em>291 U.S. 645, 646, 54 S. Ct. 443, 78 L. Ed. 1041 (1934) <em>(per curiam); </em>see also <em>Bunting </em>v. <em>Mellen, </em>541 U.S. 1019, 1023, 124 S. Ct. 1750, 158 L. Ed. 2d 636 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (\u201c[0]ur practice reflects a \u2018settled refusal\u2019 to entertain an appeal by a party on an issue as to which he prevailed\u201d (quoting Stern &amp; Gress-man 79 (8th ed. 2002))). Our resources are not well spent superintending each word a lower court utters en route to a final judgment in the petitioning party\u2019s favor. See <em>California </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>483 U.S. 307, 311, 107 S. Ct. 2852, 97 L. Ed. 2d 258 (1987) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\u201c[T]hat the Court of Appeal reached its decision through analysis different than this Court might have used does not make it appropriate ... for the prevailing party to request us to review it\u201d). We therefore have adhered with some rigor to the principle that  \u201c[t]his Court reviews judgments, not statements in opinions.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). On the few occasions when we have departed from that principle, we have pointed to a \u201cpolicy reaso[n] ... of sufficient importance to allow an appeal\u201d by the winner below. <em>Deposit Guaranty, </em>445 U.S., at 336, n. 7, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">We think just such a reason places qualified immunity cases in a special category when it comes to this Court\u2019s review of appeals brought by winners. The constitutional determinations that prevailing parties ask us to consider in these cases are not mere dicta or \u201cstatements in opinions.\u201d Rooney, 483 U.S., at 311, 107 S. Ct. 2852, 97 L. Ed. 2d 258 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Bunting, </em>541 U.S., at 1023, 124 S. Ct. 1750, 158 L. Ed. 2d 636 (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (stating that such a determination is <em>\u201cnot </em>mere dictum in the ordinary sense\u201d). They are rulings that have a significant future effect on the conduct of public officials\u2014both the prevailing parties and their co-workers\u2014 and the policies of the government units to which they belong. See <em>supra, </em>at 702-703, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1130-1131. And more: they are rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>self-consciously designed to produce this effect, by establishing</p>\n<p id=\"ASzU\">[563 U.S. 705]</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">controlling law and preventing invocations of immunity in later cases. And still more: they are rulings designed this way with this Court\u2019s permission, to promote clarity\u2014and observance\u2014of constitutional rules. We describe in more detail below these features of the qualified immunity world and why they came to be. We hold that taken together, they support bending our usual rule to permit consideration of immunized officials\u2019 petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">To begin, then, with the nature of these suits:  Under \u00a7 1983 (invoked in this case) and <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971), a plaintiff may seek money damages from government officials who have violated her constitutional or statutory rights. But to ensure that fear of liability will not \u201cunduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties,\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987), the officials may claim qualified immunity; so long as they have not violated a \u201cclearly established\u201d right, they are shielded from personal liability, <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982). That means a court can often avoid ruling on the plaintiffs claim that a particular right exists. If prior case law has not clearly settled the right, and so given officials fair notice of it, the court can simply dismiss the claim for money damages. The court need never decide whether the plaintiffs claim, even though novel or otherwise unsettled, in fact has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">And indeed, our usual adjudicatory rules suggest that a court <em>should </em>forbear resolving this issue. After all,  a \u201clongstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.\u201d <em>Lyng </em>v. <em>Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn., </em>485 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S. Ct. 1319, 99 L. Ed. 2d 534 (1988); see also <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>TVA, </em>297 U.S. 288, 346-347, 56 S. Ct. 466, 80 L. Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). In this category of qualified immunity cases, a court can enter judgment without ever ruling on the (perhaps difficult) constitutional claim the plaintiff has raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">[563 U.S. 706]</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">Small wonder, then, that a court might leave that issue for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">But we have long recognized that this day may never come\u2014that our regular policy of avoidance sometimes does not fit the qualified immunity situation because it threatens to leave standards of official conduct permanently in limbo. <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 841, n. 5, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998). Consider a plausible but unsettled constitutional claim asserted against a government official in a suit for money damages. The court does not resolve the claim because the official has immunity. He thus persists in the challenged practice; he knows that he can avoid liability in any future damages action, because the law has still not been clearly established. Another plaintiff brings suit, and another court both awards immunity and bypasses the claim. And again, and again, and again. So the moment of decision does not arrive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Courts fail to clarify uncertain questions, fail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>to address novel claims, fail to give guidance to officials about how to comply with legal requirements. See, <em>e.g., ibid.; Wilson </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S. Ct. 1692, 143 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1999). Qualified immunity thus may frustrate \u201cthe development of constitutional precedent\u201d and the promotion of law-abiding behavior. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 237, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\">For this reason,  we have permitted lower courts to avoid avoidance\u2014that is, to determine whether a right exists before examining whether it was clearly established. See, <em>e.g., ibid.; Lewis, </em>523 U.S., at 841, n. 5, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043. Indeed, for some</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">[563 U.S. 707]</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">time we <em>required. </em>courts considering qualified immunity claims to first address the constitutional question, so as to promote \u201cthe law\u2019s elaboration from case to case.\u201d <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001). More recently, we have left this matter to the discretion of lower courts, and indeed detailed a range of circumstances in which courts should address only the immunity question. See <em>Pearson, </em>555 U.S., at 236-242, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565. In general, courts should think hard, and then think hard again, before turning small cases into large ones. But it remains true that following the two-step sequence\u2014defining constitutional rights and only then conferring immunity\u2014is sometimes beneficial to clarify the legal standards governing public officials. <em>Id., </em>at 236, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565; see <em>id., </em>at 236-242, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (discussing factors courts should consider in making this determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">Here, the Court of Appeals followed exactly this two-step process, for exactly the reasons we have said may in select circumstances make it \u201cadvantageous.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 242, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565. The court, as noted earlier, explained that it was \u201caddress [ing] both prongs of the qualified immunity inquiry ... to provide guidance to those charged with the difficult task of protecting child welfare within the confines of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 588 F.3d, at 1022. To that end, the court adopted constitutional standards to govern all in-school interviews of suspected child abuse victims. See <em>id., </em>at 1030. And the court specifically instructed government officials to follow those standards going forward\u2014to \u201ccease operating on the assumption\u201d that warrantless interviews are permitted. See <em>id., </em>at 1033. With the law thus clearly established, officials who conduct this kind of interview will not receive immunity in the Ninth Circuit. And the State of Oregon has done just what we would expect in the wake of the court\u2019s decision: It has provided revised legal advice, consonant with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling, to child protective services workers wishing to interview children in schools. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. The court thus accomplished what it set out to do:</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">[563 U.S. 708]</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">settle a question of constitutional law and thereby guide the conduct of officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>Given its purpose and effect, such a decision is reviewable in this Court at the behest of an immunized official.  No mere dictum, a constitutional ruling preparatory to a grant of immunity creates law that governs the official\u2019s behavior. If our usual rule pertaining to prevailing parties applied, the official would \u201cfac[e] an unenviable choice\u201d: He must either acquiesce in a ruling he had no opportunity to contest in this Court, or \u201cdefy the views of the lower court, adhere to practices that have been declared illegal, and thus invite new suits and potential punitive damages.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>555 U.S., at 240-241, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). And if our usual bar on review applied, it would undermine the very purpose served by the two-step process, \u201cwhich is to clarify constitutional rights without undue delay.\u201d <em>Bunting, </em>541 U.S., at 1024, 124 S. Ct. 1750, 158 L. Ed. 2d 636 (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certio-rari). This Court, needless to say, also plays a role in clarifying rights. Just as that purpose may justify an appellate court in reaching beyond an immunity defense to decide a constitutional issue, so too that purpose may support this Court in reviewing the correctness of the lower court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">We emphasize, however, two limits of today\u2019s holding. First, it addresses only our own authority to review cases in this procedural posture. The Ninth Circuit had no occasion to consider whether it could hear an appeal from an immunized</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">[563 U.S. 709]</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">official: In that court, after all, S. G. appealed the judgment in the officials\u2019 favor. We therefore need not and do not decide if an appellate court, too, can entertain an appeal from a party who has prevailed on immunity grounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, our holding concerns only what this Court <em>may </em>review; what we actually will choose to review is a different matter.  That choice will be governed by the ordinary principles informing our decision whether to grant certiorari\u2014a \u201cpower [we] . . . sparingly exercis[e].\u201d <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>166 U.S. 506, 514, 17 S. Ct. 665, 41 L. Ed. 1095 (1897); see also <em>id., </em>at 514-515, 17 S. Ct. 665, 41 L. Ed. 1095 (this Court grants review \u201conly when the circumstances of the case satisfy us that the importance of the question involved, the necessity of avoiding conflict [in the lower courts], or some matter affecting the interests of this nation . . . demands such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>exercise\u201d); this Court\u2019s Rule 10. Our decision today does no more than exempt one special category of cases from our usual rule against considering prevailing parties\u2019 petitions. Going forward, we will consider these petitions one by one in accord with our usual standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">Although we reject S. G.\u2019s arguments for dismissing this case at the threshold, we find that a separate jurisdictional</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">[563 U.S. 710]</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">problem requires that result: This case, we conclude, is moot.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">As we explained above, <em>supra, </em>at 702-703, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1130-1131, in a dispute of this kind, both the plaintiff and the defendant ordinarily retain a stake in the outcome. That is true of one defendant here: Camreta remains employed as a child protective services worker, so he has an interest in challenging the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling requiring him to obtain a warrant before conducting an in-school interview.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But S. G. can no longer claim the plaintiffs usual stake in preserving the court\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"ALTvc\">[563 U.S. 711]</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">holding because she is no longer in need of any protection from the challenged practice. After we granted certiorari, we discovered that S. G. has \u201cmoved to Florida, and ha[s] no intention of relocating back to Oregon.\u201d Brief for Respondent 13, n. 13. What is more, S. G. is now only months away from her 18th birthday\u2014and, presumably, from her high school graduation. See <em>id., </em>at 31. S. G. therefore cannot be affected by the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling; she faces not the slightest possibility of being seized in a school in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction as part of a child abuse investigation.  When \u201csubsequent events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,\u201d we have no live controversy to review. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc., </em>393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S. Ct. 361, 21 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1968); see, <em>e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number><em>Atherton Mills </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>259 U.S. 13, 15-16, 42 S.

Ed. 814 (1922) (suit contesting the validity of a child labor statute mooted when plaintiff-child was \u201c[no longer] within the ages affected by the act\u201d); <em>DeFunis </em>v. <em>Odegaard, </em>416 U.S. 312, 94 S. Ct. 1704, 40 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1974) <em>(per curiam) </em>(suit challenging law school admissions policy mooted when plaintiff neared graduation). Time and distance combined have stymied our ability to consider this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">Camreta makes only one counterargument: He avers that S. G. has a continuing interest in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s constitutional ruling because it may help her establish a municipal liability claim against Deschutes County. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; <em>id., </em>at 8. S. G.\u2019s initial complaint charged that the county has an official policy of unconstitutionally subjecting schoolchildren to police interrogation. See n. 2, <em>supra. </em>Finding no evidence of such a policy (even assuming that an unlawful seizure had occurred in this case), the District Court granted summary judgment to the county, App. to Pet. for Cert, in No. 09-1454, pp. 66-67, and S. G. did not appeal that ruling, 588 F.3d, at 1020, n. 4. And although S. G. recently sought to reinstate her claim against the county, the District Court denied that motion. 6:05-cv-06047-AA,</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">[563 U.S. 712]</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">Docket Entry No. 139 (D Ore., Jan. 4, 2011). Whatever interest S. G. might have were her municipal liability claim still pending (an issue we need not and do not decide), we do not think S. G.\u2019s <em>dismissed </em>claim against a <em>different </em>defendant involving a <em>separate </em>legal theory can save this case from mootness. See <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Trade of Chicago, </em>701 F.2d 653, 656 (CA7 1983) (Posner, J.) (  \u201c[0]ne can never be certain that findings made in a decision concluding one lawsuit will not some day . . . control the outcome of another suit. But if that were enough to avoid mootness, no case would ever be moot\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">We thus must decide how to dispose of this case.  When a civil suit becomes moot pending appeal, we have the authority to \u201cdirect the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. Our \u201cestablished\u201d (though not exceptionless) practice in this situation is to vacate the judgment below. See <em>Munsingwear, </em>340 U.S., at 39, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36; <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>558 U.S. 87, 94, 130 S. Ct. 576, 175 L. Ed. 2d 447 (2009). \u201cAparty who seeks review of the merits of an adverse ruling, but is frustrated by the vagaries of circumstance,\u201d we have emphasized, \u201cought not in fairness be forced to acquiesce in\u201d that ruling. <em>U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership, </em>513 U.S. 18, 25, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1994). The equitable remedy of vacatur ensures that \u201cthose who have been prevented from obtaining the review to which they are entitled [are] not . . . treated as if there had been a review.\u201d <em>Munsingwear, </em>340 U.S., at 39, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">[563 U.S. 713]</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">S.

Brief for Respondent 41-42; Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. Far from counseling against vacatur, S. G.\u2019s argument reveals the necessity of that procedural course.  The point of vacatur is to prevent an unreviewable decision \u201cfrom spawning any legal consequences,\u201d so that no party is harmed by what we have called a \u201cpreliminary\u201d adjudication. <em>Munsingwear, </em>340 U.S., at 40-41, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36. As we have just explained, a constitutional ruling in a qualified immunity case is a legally consequential decision; that is the very reason we think it appropriate for review even at the behest of a prevailing party. See <em>supra, </em>at 704-708, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1131-1134. When happenstance prevents that review from occurring, the normal rule should apply: Vacatur then rightly \u201cstrips the decision below of its binding effect,\u201d <em>Deakins </em>v. <em>Monaghan, </em>484 U.S. 193, 200, 108 S. Ct. 523, 98 L. Ed. 2d 529 (1988), and \u201cclears the path for future relitigation,\u201d <em>Munsingwear, </em>340 U.S., at 40, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">In this case, the happenstance of S. G.\u2019s moving across country and becoming an adult has deprived Cam-reta of his appeal rights. Mootness has frustrated his ability to challenge the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling that he must obtain a warrant before interviewing a suspected child abuse victim</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">[563 U.S. 714]</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">at school. We therefore vacate the part of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion that addressed that issue, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., Arave </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>552 U.S. 117, 118-119, 128 S.

G. also sued Deschutes County, alleging that it has a policy of unconstitutionally seizing children in public schools. See 588 F.3d 1011, 1020, n. 4 (CA9 2009). The District Court rejected this claim, and S. G. did not appeal that ruling to the Ninth Circuit. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">. The dissent discusses <em>Deposit Guaranty </em>and <em>Electrical Fittings </em>at length in an effort to distinguish them from this suit. See <em>post, </em>at 718-722, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1140-1143 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). But we do not say those cases are foursquare with this one on their facts; we rely on them only for the proposition that this Court has previously identified no special Article III bar on review of appeals brought by parties who obtained a judgment in their favor below. The dissent does not, because it cannot, dispute that simple point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, see <em>post, </em>at 726, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1145, the injury to the official thus occurs independent of any future suit brought by a third party. Indeed, no such suit is likely to arise because the prospect of damages liability will force the official to change his conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1230-12\">. The constitutional issue could arise in a case in which qualified immunity is unavailable\u2014for example, \u201cin a suit to enjoin future conduct, in an action against a municipality, or in litigating a suppression motion in a criminal proceeding.\u2019\u2019 <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S., at 841, n. 5, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>Ed. 2d 1043. A decision in such a case would break the repetitive cycle of qualified immunity defenses described above. But some kinds of constitutional questions do not often come up in these alternative settings. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 236, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009); see <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S., at 841, n. 5, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L.

The dissent complains that our decision \u201callows plaintiffs to obtain binding constitutional determinations on the merits that lie beyond this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review.\u2019\u2019 <em>Post, </em>at 725, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1144. But that is not the case. It is not this decision but our prior precedents that allow lower courts to issue \u201cbinding constitutional determinations\u2019\u2019 in qualified immunity cases even when the plaintiff is not entitled to money damages. And it is not our decision but the dissent that would insulate these rulings from this Court\u2019s power to review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1232-8\">. We note, however, that the considerations persuading us to permit review of petitions in this posture may not have the same force as applied to a district court decision.  \u201cA decision of a federal district court judge is not binding precedent in either a different judicial district, the same judicial district, or even upon the same judge in a different case.\u2019\u2019 18 J. Moore et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 134.02 [1] [d], p. 134-26 (3d ed. 2011). Many Courts of Appeals therefore decline to consider district court precedent when determining if constitutional rights are clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity. See, <em>e.g., Kalka </em>v. <em>Hawk, </em>215 F.3d 90, 100 (CADC 2000) (Tatel, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (collecting cases). Otherwise said, district court decisions\u2014unlike those from the courts of appeals\u2014do not necessarily settle constitutional standards or prevent repeated claims of qualified immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">. Justice Sotomayor maintains that, because this case is moot, \u201c[t]here is no warrant for reaching th[e] question\u201d whether immunized officials may obtain our consideration of an adverse constitutional ruling. <em>Post, </em>at 715, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1138 (opinion concurring in judgment). But  this Court has never held that it may consider only one threshold issue per case. And here, as we will explain, <em>infra, </em>at 712-714, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1136-1137, and n. 10, our discussion of reviewability is critical to our ultimate disposition of this suit. Moreover, that issue was fully litigated in this Court. We granted certiorari to consider whether \u201cthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s constitutional ruling [is] reviewable, notwithstanding that [the Court of Appeals] ruled in [the officials\u2019] favor on qualified immunity grounds.\u201d Pet. for Cert. in No. 09-1454, p. i. And all the parties, as well as the United States as <em>amicus curiae, </em>addressed that question in their briefs and oral arguments.

The same cannot be said for Deputy Sheriff Alford. In their briefs, the parties informed us that Alford no longer works for Deschutes County or in law enforcement. See Brief for Respondent 1, n. 2; Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 09-1478. Because Alford will not again participate in a child abuse investigation, he has lost his interest in the Fourth Amendment ruling. See <em>supra, </em>at 702-703, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1130-1131; cf. <em>Arizonans for Official English </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, 67, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997) (holding that the plaintiffs challenge to a state law affecting the performance of her job duties was mooted when she left state employment). But in light of Camreta\u2019s continuing stake, Alford\u2019s altered circumstances are immaterial to our resolution of this dispute, and we do not decide any questions that would arise if he were the only defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1234-11\">. Our analysis of the proper disposition of this case follows from our conclusion that government officials who secure a favorable judgment on immunity grounds may obtain our review of an adverse constitutional holding. See <em>supra, </em>at 708, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1134. As just noted, <em>Munsingwear </em>justified vacatur to protect a litigant who had the right to appeal but lost that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>opportunity due to happenstance. 340 U.S., at 39, 41, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36.  We have therefore left lower court decisions intact when mootness did not deprive the appealing party of any review to which he was entitled. See, <em>e.g., U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co., </em>513 U.S., at 25, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233 (holding that the appealing party had \u201csurrendered] his claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur\u2019\u2019 by settling the case and thus \u201cvoluntarily forfeit[ing] his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal\u2019\u2019); <em>Karcher </em>v. <em>May, </em>484 U.S. 72, 83, 108 S. Ct. 388, 98 L. Ed. 2d 327 (1987) (holding that vacatur in light of mootness was not warranted when the losing party declined to file an appeal). So if immunized officials could not challenge an appellate decision in this Court, we would choose not to exercise our equitable authority to vacate that decision, even if the case later became moot. But here, as we have just explained, the theory that underlies our prior cases applying <em>Munsingwear </em>is satisfied: Vacatur expunges an adverse decision that would be reviewable had this case not become moot. <em>See Arizonans, </em>520 U.S., at 74, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (finding vacatur proper because, \u201cwhen the mooting event occurred,\u2019\u2019 the Arizona Attorney General was pursuing his \u201cright to present argument on appeal\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">. Our disposition of this case differs slightly from the normal <em>Munsingwear </em>order vacating the lower court\u2019s judgment and remanding the case with instructions to dismiss the relevant claim. We leave untouched the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling on qualified immunity and its corresponding dismissal of S. G.\u2019s claim because S. G. chose not to challenge that ruling. We vacate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling addressing the merits of the Fourth Amendment issue because, as we have explained, <em>supra, </em>at 707-708, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1133, that is the part of the decision that mootness prevents us from reviewing but that has prospective effects on Camreta. See <em>Walling </em>v. <em>James V.

Ed. 2d, at 1146 (dissenting opinion), is to end the extraordinary practice of ruling upon constitutional questions unnecessarily when the defendant possesses qualified immunity. See <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001).

As the exchange</p>\n<p id=\"AnFY\">[563 U.S. 715]</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">between the majority and Justice Kennedy demonstrates, the question whether Camreta, as a prevailing party, can obtain our review of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s constitutional ruling is a difficult one. There is no warrant for reaching this question when there is clearly no longer a genuine case or controversy between the parties before us. See <em>Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. </em>v. <em>Malaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., </em>549 U.S. 422, 436, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L. Ed. 2d 15 (2007) (noting that when a court can \u201creadily\u201d dispose of a case on one threshold ground, it should not reach another one that \u201cis difficult to determine\u201d). Indeed, it is improper for us to do so. Cf. <em>U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership, </em>513 U.S. 18, 21, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1994) (\u201c[A] federal court [may not] decide the merits of a legal question not posed in an Article III case or controversy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-11\">The majority suggests that we must decide whether Camreta has a \u201cright to appeal\u201d in order to vacate the judgment below under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36 (1950). See <em>ante, </em>at 712, n. 10, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1136; see also <em>ante, </em>at 710, n. 8, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1135. But that view does not accord with our past practice. See <em>Arizonans for Official English </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, 66, 70, 74-75, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L.

Nor is it consistent with the principles underlying our mootness jurisprudence. See <em>Walling </em>v. <em>James V. Reuter, Inc., </em>321 U.S. 671, 677, 64 S. Ct. 826, 88 L.

The Court is correct to note the problem presented when, on the one hand, its precedents permit or invite courts to rule on the merits of a constitutional claim even when qualified immunity disposes of the matter; and, on the other hand, jurisdictional principles prevent us from reviewing those invited rulings. It does seem that clarification is required. In my view, however, the correct solution is not to override jurisdictional rules that are basic to the functioning of the Court and to the necessity of avoiding advisory opinions. Dictum, though not precedent, may have its utility; but it ought not to be treated as a judgment standing on its own. So, while acknowledging the problem the Court confronts, my concern with the rule adopted for this case calls for this respectful dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">The Court acknowledges our \u201csettled refusal to entertain an appeal,\u201d including a petition for certio-rari, \u201cby a party on an issue as to which he prevailed.\u201d Ante, at 704, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1131 (internal quotation marks omitted). At the outset, however, it is important to state this rule more fully to show its foundational character. A party that has already obtained the judgment it requested may not seek review to challenge the reasoning of a judicial decision. As we have said on many occasions: \u201cThis Court reviews judgments, not statements in opinions.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>483 U.S. 307, 311, 107 S. Ct. 2852, 97 L. Ed. 2d 258 (1987) <em>(per curiam) </em>(some internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842, and n. 8, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984) (collecting cases). The rule has been</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">[563 U.S. 717]</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">noted and followed since the early years of this Court. \u201cThe question before an appellate Court is, was the <em>judgment </em>correct, not the <em>ground </em>on which the judgment professes to proceed.\u201d <em>McClung </em>v. <em>Silliman, </em>6 Wheat. 598, 603, 5 L. Ed. 340 (1821).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">The rule against hearing appeals or accepting petitions for certiorari by prevailing parties is related to the Article III prohibition against issuing advisory opinions. This principle underlies, for example, the settled rule against hearing cases involving a disputed judgment based on grounds of state law. As Justice Jackson explained for the Court: \u201c[0]ur power is to correct wrong judgments, not to revise opinions. We are not permitted to render an advisory opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered by the state court after we corrected its views of federal laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion.\u201d <em>Herb </em>v. <em>Pitcairn, </em>324 U.S. 117, 125-126, 65 S. Ct. 459, 89 L. Ed. 789 (1945). This point has been repeated with force and clarity. See, <em>e.g., Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1041-1042, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983). The \u201cjudicial Power\u2019 is one to render dispositive judgments,\u201d not advisory opinions. <em>Plaut </em>v. <em>Spendthrift Farm, Inc., </em>514 U.S. 211, 219, 115 S. Ct. 1447, 131 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>The rule against hearing appeals by prevailing parties applies in countless situations, many involving government parties. Deficient performance may not yield prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). A defective warrant may be entitled to good-faith reliance under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984). An unreasonable search may be cured through the inevitable discovery doctrine <em>of Nix </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 104 S. Ct. 2501, 81 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1984). In these and myriad other situations, an error is identified, but that conclusion does not affect the ultimate judgment entered. In all these contexts, it is established that the prevailing party may not appeal. This conclusion holds true even though a statement on the merits can have adverse consequences for the prevailing party. \u201cThe Court of Appeal\u2019s use of analysis that may</p>\n<p id=\"AxEn\">[563 U.S. 718]</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">have been adverse to the State\u2019s long-term interests does not allow the State to claim status as a losing party for purposes of this Court\u2019s review.\u201d <em>Rooney, supra, </em>at 311, 107 S. Ct. 2852, 97 L. Ed. 2d 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">The Court nonetheless holds that defendants who prevail in the courts of appeals based on qualified immunity may still obtain review in this Court. This point is put in perspective by the fact that the Court today, in an altogether unprecedented disposition, says that it vacates not a judgment but rather \u201cpart of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion.\u201d Ante, at 714, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1137. The Court\u2019s conclusion is unsettling in its implications. Even on the Court\u2019s reading of our cases, the almost invariable rule is that prevailing parties are not permitted to obtain a writ of certiorari. Cf. <em>Kalka </em>v. <em>Hawk, </em>215 F.3d 90, 96, n. 9 (CADC 2000) (concluding that the Supreme Court \u201chas apparently never granted the certiorari petition of a party who prevailed in the appellate court\u201d). After today, however, it will be common for prevailing parties to seek certio-rari based on the Court\u2019s newfound exception. And that will be so even though the \u201cadmonition\u201d against reviewing mere statements in opinions \u201chas special force when the statements raise constitutional questions, for it is our settled practice to avoid the unnecessary decision of such issues.\u201d <em>FCC </em>v. <em>Pacifica Foundation, </em>438 U.S. 726, 734, 98 S. Ct. 3026, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1073 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">The Court defends its holding with citations to just two of our cases. <em>Ante, </em>at 702, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1130. Neither provides support for the Court\u2019s result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">The first case is <em>Electrical Fittings Corp. </em>v. <em>Thomas &amp; Betts Co., </em>307 U.S. 241, 59 S. Ct. 860, 83 L. Ed. 1263 (1939). There, a plaintiff alleged the infringement of two patent claims. The District Court found the plaintiffs first claim valid but not infringed and the second claim invalid. Rather than issuing a judgment \u201cdismissing the bill without more,\u201d the District Court instead \u201centered a decree adjudging claim 1 valid\u201d and \u201cdismissing the bill for failure to prove infringement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 241-242, 59 S. Ct. 860, 83 L. Ed. 1263. The District Court thus issued a formal judgment regarding the validity of the first claim. The defendant appealed</p>\n<p id=\"A1x4\">[563 U.S. 719]</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">to dispute that claim\u2019s validity. This Court noted, without qualification, that a party \u201cmay not appeal from a judgment or decree in his favor, for the purpose of obtaining a review of findings he deems erroneous which are not necessary to support the decree.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 242, 59 S. Ct. 860, 83 L. Ed. 1263. \u201cBut,\u201d this Court went on to explain, \u201chere the decree itself purports to adjudge the validity of claim 1, and though the adjudication was immaterial to the disposition of the cause, it stands as an adjudication of one of the issues litigated.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In other words, the District Court had entered an unnecessary legal conclusion into the terms of the judgment itself, making it possible, for example, that the decree would have estoppel effect as to an issue whose resolution was unnecessary to the proper judgment of dismissal. <em>Electrical Fittings </em>therefore concluded that \u201cthe petitioners were entitled to have this portion of the decree eliminated.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The sole relief provided was an order for the \u201creformation of the decree.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That result accords with, indeed flows from, the settled rule that this Court reviews only judgments, not statements in opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">The second case is <em>Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Roper, </em>445 U.S. 326, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1980). In that case plaintiffs attempted to bring a class action against a bank. After the District Court denied class certification, the defendant tendered to the plaintiffs the maximum value that they could recover as individuals. Of course, that offer did not amount to \u201call that ha[d] been requested in the complaint\u201d\u2014 namely, \u201crelief for the class.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 341, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427 (Rehnquist, J., concurring). It is therefore no surprise that the plaintiffs responded with \u201ca counteroffer of judgment in which they attempted to reserve the right to appeal the adverse class certification ruling.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 329, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427 (opinion of the Court). But that proposal was denied. \u201cBased on the bank\u2019s offer, the District Court entered judgment in respondents\u2019 favor, over their objection.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 330, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427. The District Court thus issued a judgment other than the one the plaintiffs had sought. The</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">[563 U.S. 720]</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">would-be class plaintiffs appealed, and this Court later granted certiorari. The Court held that appeal was not barred by the prevailing-party rule: \u201cWe view the denial of class certification as an example of a procedural ruling, collateral to the merits of a litigation, that is appealable after the entry of final judgment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 336, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427. As the Court explained, the plaintiffs had obtained only a judgment in their individual capacities. Yet the plaintiffs had \u201casserted as their personal stake in the appeal their desire to shift to successful class litigants a portion of those fees and expenses that have been incurred in this litigation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 334, n. 6, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427; see also <em>id., </em>at 336, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427. Because the purported prevailing parties were injured by their failure to obtain the class-based judgment they had sought, the Court held there was \u201cjurisdiction to entertain the appeal only to review the asserted procedural error, not for the purpose of passing on the merits.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court was clear that the District Court\u2019s denial of class certification had a direct effect on the judgment: \u201cAs in <em>Electrical Fittings,\u201d </em>the purported prevailing parties \u201cwere entitled to have [a] portion of the District Court\u2019s judgment reviewed.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">Neither <em>Electrical Fittings </em>nor <em>Deposit Guaranty </em>provides support for the rule adopted today. Those decisions instead held that, in the unusual circumstances presented, par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>ticular parties who at first appeared to have prevailed below had in fact failed to obtain the judgments they had sought. This Court therefore had jurisdiction, including of course jurisdiction under Article III, to provide relief for the harm caused by the adverse judgments entered below. The parties seeking appeal in <em>Electrical Fittings </em>and <em>Deposit Guaranty </em>might be compared with plaintiffs who have requested $1,000 in relief but obtained only $500. Such parties have prevailed in part, but have not \u201creceive [d] all that [they] ha[d] sought.\u201d <em>Deposit Guaranty, supra, </em>at 333, 100 S. Ct. 1166, 63 L. Ed. 2d 427. In contrast the Court appears to assume that petitioners in the present action are true prevailing parties. They have obtained</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">[563 U.S. 721]</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">from the Court of Appeals the only formal judgment they requested: denial of respondent\u2019s claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">The Court points to policy concerns as the basis for its willingness to hear appeals by prevailing parties. <em>Ante, </em>at 703-706, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1131-1132. But those concerns are unwarranted. In only one dissenting opinion has it been suggested that certiorari should be granted to reach a merits determination \u201clocked inside\u201d a favorable qualified immunity ruling. <em>Bunting </em>v. <em>Mellen, </em>541 U.S. 1019, 1024, 124 S. Ct. 1750, 158 L. Ed. 2d 636 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). That dissenting opinion was issued in response to the rule that constitutional issues should be decided in every case involving qualified immunity. <em>Id., </em>at 1025, 124 S. Ct. 1750, 158 L. Ed. 2d 636. Yet that mandated rule of decision has now been disapproved, so the dissent\u2019s argument is no longer applicable. See <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009). Indeed, the Court today suggests that it still would not allow review of the merits even in the case that provoked the dissent. Unlike petitioner Camreta, the petitioner in <em>Bunting </em>had left the Government\u2019s employ before filing a petition for cer-tiorari and so lacked standing to obtain review in this Court. Compare 541 U.S., at 1025, 124 S. Ct. 1750, 158 L. Ed. 2d 636, n., with <em>id., </em>at 1021, 124 S. Ct. 1750, 158 L. Ed. 2d 636 (Stevens, J., respecting denial of cer-tiorari), and <em>ante, </em>at 710-711, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1135-1136, and n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">The instant case thus appears to be the first in which the Court\u2019s new exception to the prevailing-party rule might have been applied. And even here that exception is neither necessary nor sufficient for the merits to be adjudicated by this Court. The Fourth Amendment question decided below is bound to arise again in future cases. Indeed, the reasoning of the decision below implicates a number of decisions in other courts of appeals. Cf. 588 F.3d 1011, 1026, n. 11 (CA9 2009) (collecting cases). Yet today\u2019s decision does not supply the Courts of Appeals with guidance as to these merits issues. The Court instead vacates part of the reasoning of the decision below, thereby leaving other decisions intact and unreviewed. The Court thus resolves difficult constitutional</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">[563 U.S. 722]</p>\n<p id=\"AVFqE\">issues and provides an unprecedented answer to \u201can important question of judicial policy,\u201d all to no end. <em>Ante, </em>at 703, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-10\">The Court errs in reading <em>Electrical Fittings </em>and <em>Deposit Guaranty </em>to permit review and, indeed, the provision of relief disconnected from any judgment. The result is an erroneous and unbounded exception to an essential principle of judicial restraint. Parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>who have obtained all requested relief may not seek review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">As today\u2019s decision illustrates, our recent qualified immunity cases tend to produce decisions that are in tension with conventional principles of case-or-controversy adjudication. This Court has given the courts of appeals \u201cpermission\u201d to find constitutional violations when ordering dismissal or summary judgment based on qualified immunity. <em>Ante, </em>at 705, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1132; see <em>Pearson, supra. </em>This invitation, as the Court is correct to note, was intended to produce binding constitutional holdings on the merits. <em>Ante, </em>at 706-707, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1132-1133. The goal was to make dictum precedent, in order to hasten the gradual process of constitutional interpretation and alter the behavior of government defendants. <em>Ibid. </em>The present case brings the difficulties of that objective into perspective. In express reliance on the permission granted in <em>Pearson, </em>the Court of Appeals went out of its way to announce what may be an erroneous interpretation of the Constitution; and, under our case law, the Ninth Circuit must give that dictum legal effect as precedent in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">In this way unnecessary merits decisions in qualified immunity cases could come to resemble declaratory judgments or injunctions. Indeed the United States as <em>amicus curiae </em>contends that the merits decision below \u201chas an effect similar to an injunction or a declaratory judgment against the government as a whole.\u201d Brief for United States 13. Today\u2019s opinion adopts that view, providing as relief the vacatur of \u201cpart of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion\u201d\u2014namely, the part of the</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">[563 U.S. 723]</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">opinion that rules on the constitutional merits. <em>Ante, </em>at 698, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1127. For the first time, <em>obiter dictum </em>is treated not just as precedent for future cases but as a judgment in its own right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">The Court of Appeals in this case did not in fact issue a declaratory judgment or injunction embodying a determination on the merits, and it does not appear that a judgment of that kind could have issued. Plaintiffs must establish standing as to each form of relief they request, yet the plaintiff in this case had no separate interest in obtaining a declaratory judgment. See <em>Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 103-105, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983) (citing <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Mattis, </em>431 U.S. 171, 97 S. Ct. 1739, 52 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1977) <em>(per curiam); Golden </em>v. <em>Zwickler, </em>394 U.S. 103, 89 S. Ct. 956, 22 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1969)); see also <em>MedImmune, Inc. </em>v. <em>Genentech, Inc., </em>549 U.S. 118, 127, 127 S. Ct. 764, 166 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2007). There was no likelihood that S. G., the plaintiffs daughter, would again be subjected to interrogation while at school, much less that she would be interrogated by petitioner-defendant Camreta, so S. G. would seem to have had no greater stake in obtaining a declaratory judgment than the plaintiff in <em>Lyons </em>had in obtaining an injunction. See 461 U.S., at 104, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (noting the \u201cactual controversy that must exist for a declaratory judgment to be entered\u201d). Our qualified immunity cases should not permit plaintiffs in constitutional cases to make an end run around established principles of justiciability. In treating dictum as though it were a declaratory judgment or an injunction, the Court appears to approve the issuance of such judgments outside the bounds of Article III jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>The Court creates an exception to the prevailing-party rule in order to solve the difficulties created by our qualified immunity jurisprudence, but the Court\u2019s solution creates new problems. Sometimes defendants in qualified immunity cases have no particular interest in disputing the constitutional merits. Acknowledging as much, the Court notes that petitioner Alford no longer works for the government and so \u201chas lost his interest in the Fourth Amendment ruling.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 710, n. 9, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1135. In concluding that Alford lacks</p>\n<p id=\"Aohd\">[563 U.S. 724]</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">Article III standing, the Court suggests that it would lack jurisdiction to review and perhaps even to vacate the merits decision of the Court of Appeals if respondent had sued only Alford. <em>Ibid.; </em>cf. <em>Arizonans for Official English </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, 72-73, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997) (discussing standing to obtain review in this Court as well as this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to vacate judgments issued without jurisdiction). That suggestion is disconcerting. Under today\u2019s decision, it appears that the Court\u2019s ability to review merits determinations in qualified immunity cases is contingent on the defendant who has been sued. A defendant who has left the government\u2019s employ or otherwise lacks an interest in disputing the merits will be unable to obtain further review. See <em>ante, </em>at 710, n. 9, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1135 (discussing Article III limits on relief in this Court); <em>ante, </em>at 712, n. 10, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1136 (discussing limitations on this Court\u2019s equitable vacatur authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">The Court today avoids this difficulty by concluding that petitioner Camreta has suffered an Article III injury. <em>Ante, </em>at 703, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1130; cf. <em>ante, </em>at 710, n. 9, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1135 (\u201c[W]e do not decide any questions that would arise if [Alford] were the only defendant\u201d). But the Court can reach that conclusion only because, \u201cas part of his job,\u201d Camreta \u201cregularly engages\u201d in conduct made unlawful by the reasoning of the Court of Appeals. <em>Ante, </em>at 703, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1130. As discussed below, this conclusion is doubtful. See <em>infra, </em>at 725-727, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1144-1146. In any event the Court\u2019s standing analysis will be inapplicable in most qualified immunity cases. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 702, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1130 (asserting that the \u201cArticle III standard often will be met\u201d). When an officer is sued for taking an extraordinary action, such as using excessive force during a high-speed car chase, there is little possibility that a constitutional decision on the merits will again influence that officer\u2019s conduct. The officer, like petitioner Alford or the petitioner in <em>Bunting, </em>would have no interest in litigating the merits in the court of appeals and, under the Court\u2019s rule, would seem unable to obtain review of a merits ruling by petitioning for certiorari. See <em>ante, </em>at 701-703, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1129-1131; <em>ante, </em>at 710,</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">[563 U.S. 725]</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">n. 9, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1135; <em>ante, </em>at 712, n. 10, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1136-1137; see also <em>Lyons, supra, </em>at 103-105, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675. This problem will arise with great frequency in qualified immunity cases. Once again, the decision today allows plaintiffs to obtain binding constitutional determinations on the merits that he beyond this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review. The Court thus fails to solve the problem it identifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">It is most doubtful that Article III permits appeals by any officer to whom the reasoning of a judicial de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>cisi\u00f3n might be applied in a later suit. Yet that appears to be the implication of the Court\u2019s holding. The favorable judgment of the Court of Appeals did not in itself cause petitioner Camreta to suffer an Article III injury entitling him to appeal. Cf. <em>supra, </em>at 716-722, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1139-1143 (discussing <em>Electrical Fittings </em>and <em>Deposit </em>Guaranty); <em>ASARCO Inc. </em>v. <em>Kadish, </em>490 U.S. 605, 619, 109 S. Ct. 2037, 104 L. Ed. 2d 696 (1989) (finding an Article III controversy where petitioner challenged \u201ca final judgment altering tangible legal rights\u201d). On the contrary, Camreta has been injured by the decision below to no greater extent than have hundreds of other government officers who might argue that they too have been affected by the unnecessary statements made by the Court of Appeals. The Court notes as a limit on its authority to entertain appeals from prevailing parties certain statutory directives, directives that can be interpreted or shaped to allow expanded powers of review. <em>Ante, </em>at 700-701, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1129. But even if Congress were to give explicit permission for certio-rari petitions to be filed by \u201cany person\u201d instead of by \u201cany party,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1), the constitutional definition of a case or controversy would still constrain this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\">The Court\u2019s analysis appears to rest on the premise that the reasoning of the decision below in itself causes Camreta injury. Until today, however, precedential reasoning of general applicability divorced from a particular adverse judgment was not thought to yield \u201cstanding to appeal.\u201d <em>Parr </em>v. <em>United States, </em>351 U.S. 513, 516, 517, 76 S. Ct. 912, 100 L. Ed. 1377 (1956) (opinion for</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">[563 U.S. 726]</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">the Court by Harlan, J.). That is why \u201c[o]nly one injured by the judgment sought to be reviewed can appeal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 516, 76 S. Ct. 912, 100 L. Ed. 1377; see also <em>supra, </em>at 716-721, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1139-1141; <em>e.g., Chathas </em>v. <em>Local 134 IBEW, </em>233 F.3d 508, 512 (CA7 2000) (Posner, J.) (\u201cAdverse dicta are not appealable rulings. They can cause harm, but not the sort of harm that the courts . . . deem to create a genuine controversy within the meaning of Article III of the Constitution. Judgments are appealable; opinions are not\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Sea-Land Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Transp., </em>137 F.3d 640, 648 (CADC 1998) (Williams, J.) (\u201c[M]ere prec-edential effect within an agency is not, alone, enough to create Article III standing, no matter how foreseeable the future litigation\u201d (citing <em>Radiofone, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>759 F.2d 936, 938 (CADC 1985) (opinion of Scalia, J.))); <em>id., </em>at 939 (explaining that standing must \u201carise from the particular activity which the agency adjudication has approved . . . and not from the mere precedential effect of the agency\u2019s rationale in later adjudications\u201d); <em>Oxford Shipping Co. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Trading Corp., </em>697 F.2d 1, 7 (CA1 1982) (Breyer, J.) (\u201cSince the judgment appealed from was in [a party\u2019s] favor, and since the statement made was in no sense necessary to that judgment, the statement was dictum. There is no known basis for an appeal from a dictum\u201d). It is revealing that the Court creates an exception to the prevailing-party rule while making clear that the courts of appeals are not to follow suit, in any context. See <em>ante, </em>at 708-709, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1134-1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">The conclusion that precedent of general applicability cannot in itself create standing to sue or appeal flows from basic principles. Camreta\u2019s asserted injury is caused not by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>Court of Appeals or by respondent but rather by \u201cthe independent action of some third party not before the court\u201d\u2014that is, by the still-unidentified private plaintiffs whose lawsuits Camreta hopes to avoid. <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). This circumstance distinguishes the present case from requests for declaratory or injunctive relief</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">[563 U.S. 727]</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">filed against officeholders who threaten legal enforcement. An inert rule of law does not cause particular, concrete injury; only the specific threat of its enforcement can do so. That is why the proper defendant in a suit for prospective relief is the party prepared to enforce the relevant legal rule against the plaintiff. See <em>MedImmune, Inc., </em>549 U.S., at 127, 127 S. Ct. 764, 166 L. Ed. 2d 604 (explaining that declaratory relief requires a controversy \u201cbetween parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Farm Workers, </em>442 U.S. 289, 298-299, 99 S. Ct. 2301, 60 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1979) (\u201cA plaintiff who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute\u2019s operation or enforcement\u201d). Without an adverse judgment from which to appeal, Cam-reta has in effect filed a new declaratory judgment action in this Court against the Court of Appeals. This is no more consistent with Article III than filing a declaratory judgment action against this Court for its issuance of an adverse precedent or against Congress in response to its enactment of an unconstitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">If today\u2019s decision proves to be more than an isolated anomaly, the Court might find it necessary to reconsider its special permission that the courts of appeals may issue unnecessary merits determinations in qualified immunity cases with binding prec-edential effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">Other dynamics permit the law of the Constitution to be elaborated within the conventional framework of a case or controversy. \u201c[T]he development of constitutional law is by no means entirely dependent on cases in which the defendant may seek qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>555 U.S., at 242-243, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565. For example, qualified immunity does not bar Fourth and Fifth Amendment suppression challenges. See, <em>e.g., Kentucky </em>v. <em>King, ante, </em>p. 452, 131 S. Ct. 1849, 179 L. Ed. 2d 865. Nor does it prevent invocation of the Constitution as a defense against criminal prosecution, civil suit, or cruel and unusual punishment. See,</p>\n<p id=\"AuTjA\">[563 U.S. 728]</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\"><em>e.g., Snyder </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>562 U.S. 443, 131 S. Ct. 1207, 179 L. Ed. 2d 172 (2011); <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2010); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003). Nor is qualified immunity available in constitutional suits against municipalities\u2014as this very case illustrates. Ante, at 711-712, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 1136. Our cases make clear, moreover, that \u201cofficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.\u201d <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 741, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 153 L. Ed. 2d 666 (2002). That rule permits clearly established violations to be found when extreme though unheard-of actions violate the Constitution. See, <em>e.g., ibid. </em>Furthermore, constitutional plaintiff's may seek declaratory or injunctive relief pursuant to standard principles of justiciability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>Those plaintiffs do not need <em>Pearson\u2019s </em>special rule. See, <em>e.g., Citizens United </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>558 U.S. 310, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010); <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>561 U.S. 742, 130 S. Ct. 3020, 177 L. Ed. 2d 894 (2010). In any event, some incremental advance in the law occurs even when clearly established violations are found. It is an inevitable aspect of judicial decisionmak-ing that the resolution of one legal question or factual dispute casts light on the next.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\">It would be preferable at least to explore refinements to our qualified immunity jurisprudence before altering basic principles of jurisdiction. For instance, the objectives of qualified immunity might be satisfied if there were no bar to reaching the merits and issuing judgment when requested damages are nominal and substantial attorney\u2019s fees are waived or not allowed. Cf. <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 112-115, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1992) (discussing unavailability of attorney\u2019s fees where nominal damages are only relief); <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>482 U.S. 755, 761-763, 107 S. Ct. 2672, 96 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1987); <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 819, n. 34, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982); <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 266, 98 S. Ct. 1042, 55 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1978) (discussing the propriety of providing nominal damages as relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">The desire to resolve more constitutional questions ought not lead to altering our jurisdictional rules. That is the precise object that our legal tradition tells us we should resist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">[563 U.S. 729]</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">Haste to resolve constitutional issues has never been thought advisable. We instead have encouraged the courts of appeals to follow \u201cthat older, wiser judicial counsel not to pass on questions of constitutionality . . . unless such adjudication is unavoidable.\u201d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 388, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007) (Breyer, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted); see generally <em>Ashwander v. TVA, </em>297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S. Ct. 466, 80 L. Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Experience teaches that there is no persuasive reason to reverse normal principles of judicial review in qualified immunity cases. Compare, <em>e.g., Pearson, supra, </em>at 236, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565, and <em>Siegert </em>v. <em>Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 235, 111 S. Ct. 1789, 114 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201c[I]t seems to reverse the usual ordering of issues to tell the trial and appellate courts that they should resolve the constitutional question first\u201d), with <em>id., </em>at 232, 111 S. Ct. 1789, 114 L. Ed. 2d 277 (opinion of the Court), and <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001). Yet this Court\u2019s \u201cpuzzling misadventure in constitutional dictum\u201d still has not come to an end. Leval, Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta, 81 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1249, 1275 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">There will be instances where courts discuss the merits in qualified immunity cases. It is sometimes a better analytic approach and a preferred allocation of judicial time and resources to dismiss a claim on the merits rather than to dismiss based on qualified immunity. And \u201c [i]t often may be difficult to decide whether a right is clearly established without deciding precisely what the existing constitutional right happens to be.\u201d <em>Pearson, supra, </em>at 236, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court should not superintend the judicial decision-making process in qualified immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>cases under special rules, lest it make the judicial process more complex for civil rights suits than for other litigation. It follows, however, that the Court should provide no special permission to reach the merits. If qualified immunity cases were treated like other cases raising constitutional questions, settled principles of constitutional avoidance would apply. So would conventional rules regarding dictum and</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">[563 U.S. 730]</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">holding. Judicial observations made in the course of explaining a case might give important instruction and be relevant when assessing a later claim of qualified immunity. Cf. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>182 F.3d 89, 112, and n. 3 (CA2 1999) (Calabresi, J., concurring). But as dicta those remarks would not establish law and would not qualify as binding precedent. See <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla. </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>517 U.S. 44, 67, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"pAxFs\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"27\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAXAAAAAbAQAAAABNJum/AAAAjklEQVR4nO2TvQ2AIBBGxdCrtRaOwgAO5gpuQ+kYLKEVgg3303wmNNp43fvyOC4XMLmpqbbK/vWv9ahTCKyf2oDwzuxXu0uIgfS4qh4YSLfeS4jB0PeYbJAUQy4VsioIvJlBTYiB9U0bGMotaezkSgy2nErzIi0w8N6dkxADLTIfsZcBIVB3kyR7gMondgOJMYcXOABmJwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"368\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">The distance our qualified immunity jurisprudence has taken us from foundational principles is made all the more apparent by today\u2019s decision. The Court must construe two of its precedents in so broad a manner that they are taken out of their proper and logical confines. To vacate the reasoning of the decision below, the Court accepts that <em>obiter dictum </em>is not just binding precedent but a judgment susceptible to plenary review. I would dismiss this case and note that our jurisdictional rule against hearing appeals by prevailing parties precludes petitioners\u2019 attempt to obtain review of judicial reasoning disconnected from a judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
