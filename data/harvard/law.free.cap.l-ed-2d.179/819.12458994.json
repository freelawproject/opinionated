He was sentenced to death. At issue here is part of the jury instructions given during the penalty phase of Mitts\u2019s trial. The instructions, in pertinent part, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">\u201c[Y]ou must determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the aggravating circumstances, which [Mitts] was found guilty of committing in the separate counts,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">[563 U.S. 396]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-9\">are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors you find are present in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-10\">\u201cWhen all 12 members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances in each separate count with which [Mitts] has been found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors, if any, then you must return such finding to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-11\">\u201cI instruct you as a matter of law that if you make such a finding, then you must recommend to the Court that the sentence of death be imposed on [Mitts].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAU2T\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"41\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAm8AAAApAQAAAABL0/N9AAAAZUlEQVR4nO3WsQ2AIBSE4YPGtRzNxGUcyB430Ak4+8sjr4HurvxI/hAqCjFxrDNrgHPOOeecc845p7lHNYcvhgoAl57lcA+AJDfKcjhD6Cve7lDNYR8ASTa9eQ5vCL34Q+acc7IfRnila2h7YrEAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"623\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-12\">\u201cOn the other hand, [if] after considering all the relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and testimony received at this hearing and the arguments of counsel, you find that the state of Ohio failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances with which [Mitts] was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 352a-353a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">We considered virtually the same Ohio jury instructions last Term in <em>Smith </em>v. Spisak, 558 U.S. 139, 147, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595 (2010). See <em>Mitts </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>620 F.3d 650, 652 (CA6 2010) (noting that the \u201cinstructions in this case are the same Ohio instructions that were given in\u201d <em>Spisak). </em>That case, like this one, involved review of a federal habeas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  AEDPA provides, as relevant here, that relief may not be granted unless the state court adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">In <em>Spisak, </em>we reversed a Court of Appeals decision that had found these instructions invalid under our decision in</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">[563 U.S. 397]</p>\n<p id=\"b919-17\"><em>Mills </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (1988). See 558 U.S., at 148-149, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595. Up until our decision in <em>Spisak, </em>Mitts had also pressed the claim that the instructions were invalid under <em>Mills. </em>After <em>Spisak </em>rejected that claim, the Court of Appeals in this case determined that the instructions were contrary to our decision in <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1980), and accordingly vacated Mitts\u2019s death sentence. See 620 F.3d, at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">In <em>Beck, </em>we held that the death penalty may not be imposed \u201cwhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.\u201d 447 U.S., at 627, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392 (internal quotation marks omitted). We explained that such a scheme intolerably enhances the \u201crisk of an unwarranted conviction\u201d because it \u201cinteijects irrelevant considerations into the factfind-ing process, diverting the jury\u2019s attention from the central issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a capital crime.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 638, 642, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392. \u201c[F]orcing the jury to choose between conviction on the capital offense and acquittal,\u201d we observed, \u201cmay encourage the jury to convict for an impermissible reason\u2014 its belief that the defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should be punished,\u201d even when there is \u201csome doubt with respect to an element\u201d of the capital offense. <em>Id., </em>at 632, 642, 637, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392. Because the scheme in <em>Beck </em>created a danger that the jury would resolve any doubts in favor of conviction, we concluded that it violated due process. See <em>id., </em>at 638, 643, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">According to the Court of Appeals below, the penalty phase instructions given at Mitts\u2019s trial\u2014and the Supreme Court of Ohio decision upholding their use\u2014were \u201ccontrary to\u201d <em>Beck, </em>because they \u201cinterposed before the jury the same false choice\u201d that our holding in <em>Beck </em>prohibits. 620 F.3d, at 658, 657 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Referring to the instructions as \u201cacquittal-first,\u201d the Court of Appeals stated that they impermissibly required the jury to</p>\n<p id=\"ap5b-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 398]</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">first decide whether to \u201cacquit\u201d Mitts of the death penalty before considering \u201cmercy and some form of life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 656-657. Interpreting <em>Beck </em>to stand for the proposition that \u201ca jury instruction violates due process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sentence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment,\u201d the Court of Appeals concluded that the instructions given during the penalty phase of Mitts\u2019s trial unconstitutionally \u201cdeprived the jury of a meaningful opportunity to consider\u201d a life sentence. 620 F.3d, at 658, 657 (some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">The instructions here are surely not invalid under our decision in <em>Beck. </em>The concern addressed in <em>Beck </em>was \u201cthe risk of an unwarranted <em>conviction\u201d </em>created when the jury is forced to choose between finding the defendant guilty of a capital offense and declaring him innocent of any wrongdoing. 447 U.S., at 637, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392 (emphasis added); <em>id., </em>at 638, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392; see also <em>Spaziano </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>468 U.S. 447, 455, 104 S. Ct. 3154, 82 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1984) (explaining that the \u201cgoal of the <em>Beck </em>rule\u201d is \u201cto eliminate the distortion of the factfinding process that is created when the jury is forced into an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and innocence\u201d); <em>Schad </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>501 U.S. 624, 646, 111 S. Ct. 2491, 115 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1991) (\u201cOur fundamental concern in <em>Beck </em>was that a jury convinced that the defendant had committed some violent crime but not convinced that he was guilty of a capital crime might nonetheless vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to set the defendant free with no punishment at all\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>The question here, however, concerns the penalty phase, not the guilt phase, and we have already concluded that  the logic of <em>Beck </em>is not directly applicable to penalty phase proceedings. In <em>California </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>463 U.S. 992, 103 S. Ct. 3446, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1171 (1983), we rejected an argument that <em>Beck </em>prohibited an instruction to \u201ca capital sentencing jury regarding the Governor\u2019s power to commute a sentence of life without possibility of parole.\u201d 463 U.S., at 994, 1006-1009, 103 S. Ct. 3446, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1171. In so doing, we noted the \u201cfundamental</p>\n<p id=\"AY9o\">[563 U.S. 399]</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">difference between the nature of the guilt/innocence determination at issue in <em>Beck </em>and the nature of the life/death choice at the penalty phase.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1007, 103 S. Ct. 3446, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1171. In light of that critical distinction, we observed that \u201cthe concern of <em>Beck </em>regarding the risk of an unwarranted conviction is simply not directly translatable to the deliberative process in which the capital jury engages in determining the appropriate penalty.\u201d Id., at 1009, 103 S. Ct. 3446, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1171; see also <em>Schad, supra, </em>at 647, 111 S. Ct. 2491, 115 L. Ed. 2d 555 (stating that the \u201ccentral concern of <em>Beck </em>simply is not implicated\u201d when the \u201cjury was not faced with an all-or-nothing choice between the offense of conviction (capital murder) and innocence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The jurors in Mitts\u2019s case could not have plausibly thought that if they declined to recommend the death penalty Mitts would \u201cescape all penalties for his alleged participation in the crime.\u201d <em>Beck, supra, </em>at 629, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392. They had just convicted him on two counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted murder. They were specifically instructed that if they did not find that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors\u2014and therefore did not recommend the death penalty\u2014they would choose from two life sentence options. There is accordingly no reason to believe that the jurors in this case, unlike the jurors in <em>Beck, </em>could have been improperly influenced by a fear that a decision short of death would have resulted in Mitts walking free.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">We all but decided the question presented here in <em>Spisak </em>itself. After rejecting the contention that the Ohio instructions were contrary to <em>Mills, </em>we noted that \u201cthe Court of Appeals found the jury instructions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that the instructions \u2018require [d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives.\u2019 \u201d 558 U.S., at 149, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595 (quoting <em>Spisak </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>465 F.3d 684, 709 (CA6 2006)). That is essentially the <em>Beck </em>claim presented here. See 620 F.3d, at 658 (holding that a \u201cjury instruction violates due process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sentence that can only</p>\n<p id=\"AqDE\">[563 U.S. 400]</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">be avoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment\u201d). We rejected that claim in <em>Spi-sak </em>under AEDPA, noting that \u201c[w]e have not . . . previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this reason.\u201d 558 U.S., at 149, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595. Although neither the parties nor the courts below in <em>Spisak </em>had cited <em>Beck, </em>a separate concurrence in <em>Spisak </em>would have struck down the instructions in reliance on that decision. See 558 U.S., at 158-161, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The Court nonetheless concluded that whatever the merits of that argument on direct review, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>jury instructions at Spisak\u2019s trial were not contrary to \u2018clearly established Federal law\u2019 \u201d under AEDPA. <em>Id., </em>at 149, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595. The same conclusion applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
