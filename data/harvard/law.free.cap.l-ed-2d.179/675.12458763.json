Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908), allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the same State.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act), 114 Stat. 1677, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15001 <em>et seq., </em>offers States federal money to improve community services, such as medical care and job training, for individuals with developmental disabilities. See \u00a7\u00a7 15023(a), 15024. As a condition of that funding, a State must establish a protection and advocacy (P) system \u201cto protect and advocate the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities.\u201d \u00a7 15043(a)(1). The P system receives separate federal funds, paid to it directly. \u00a7 15042(a) and (b). A second federal law, the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act), 100 Stat. 478, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10801 <em>et seq., </em>increases that separate funding and extends the mission of P systems to include the mentally ill. \u00a7\u00a7 10802(2), 10803, 10827. At present, every State accepts funds under these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Under the DD and PAIMI Acts, a P system must have certain powers. The system \u201cshall... have the authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect ... if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.\u201d \u00a7 15043(a)(2)(B); \u00a7 10805(a)(1)(A). Subject to certain statutory requirements, it must be given access to \u201call records\u201d of individuals who</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">[563 U.S. 251]</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">may have been abused, see \u00a7 15043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II); \u00a7 10805(a)(4)(B)(iii), as well as \u201cother records that are relevant to conducting an investigation,\u201d \u00a7 15043(a)(2)(J)(i). The Acts also require that a P system have authority to \u201cpursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to ensure the protection of\u2019 its charges. \u00a7 15043(a)(2)(A)(i); see \u00a7 10805(a)(1)(B). And in addition to pressing its own rights, a P system may \u201cpursue administrative, legal, and other remedies on behalf of\u2019 those it protects. \u00a7 10805(a)(1)(C); see \u00a7 15044(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">A participating State is free to appoint either a state agency or a private nonprofit entity as its P system. \u00a7 15044(a); \u00a7 10805(c)(1)(B). But in either case, the designated entity must have certain structural features that ensure its independence from the State\u2019s government. The DD Act prohibits the Governor from appointing more than one-third of the members of the system\u2019s governing board, \u00a7 15044(a)(2), and restricts the State\u2019s ability to impose hiring freezes or other measures that would impair the system\u2019s ability to carry out its mission, \u00a7 15043(a)(2)(K). Once a State designates an entity as its P system, it may not change its selection without \u201cgood cause.\u201d \u00a7 15043(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">Virginia is one of just eight States that have designated a government entity as their P system.  The Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an \u201cindependent state agency.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 51.5-39.2(A) (Lexis 2009). Its board consists of eleven \u201cnonlegislative citizen mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>bers,\u201d of whom only three are appointed by the Governor. \u00a7 51.5-39.2(B). The remaining eight are appointed by components of the legislature: five by the Speaker of the House of Delegates, and three by the Senate Committee on Rules. <em>Ibid. </em>VOPA itself nominates candidates for consideration, and the statute instructs the appointing officials that they \u201cshall seriously consider the persons nominated and appoint such persons whenever feasible.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Board members serve for fixed terms and are removable only by a court and only for</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">[563 U.S. 252]</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">specified reasons. See \u00a7 51.5-39.2(0 and (F); \u00a724.2-233 and 234 (Lexis 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive-branch oversight. It operates independently of the Attorney General of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who are statutorily authorized to sue on VOPA\u2019s behalf. \u00a7 51.5\u201439.2(A); \u00a72.2-510(5) (Lexis 2008). And Virginia law specifically empowers VOPA to \u201cinitiate any proceedings to secure the rights\u201d of disabled individuals. \u00a7 51.5-39.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">In 2006, VOPA opened an investigation into the deaths of two patients and injuries to a third at state-run mental hospitals. It asked respondents\u2014state officials in charge of those institutions\u2014to produce any records related to risk-management or mortality reviews conducted by the hospitals with respect to those patients. Respondents refused, asserting that the records were protected by a state-law privilege shielding medical peer-review materials from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">VOPA then brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that the DD and PAIMI Acts entitled it to the peer-review records, notwithstanding any state-law privilege that might apply. It sought a declaration that respondents\u2019 refusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI Acts, along with an injunction requiring respondents to provide access to the records and refrain in the future from interfering with VOPA\u2019s right of access to them. Respondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The District Court denied the motion. In its view, the suit was permitted by  the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young, </em>which normally allows federal courts to award prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law. <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Reinhard, </em>2008 WL 2795940, *6 (ED Va., July 18, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">[563 U.S. 253]</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">The Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Reinhard, </em>568 F.3d 110 (CA4 2009). Believing VOPA\u2019s lawsuit to be an \u201cintramural contest\u201d that \u201cencroaches more severely on the dignity and sovereignty of the states than an <em>Ex parte Young </em>action brought by a private plaintiff,\u201d the Court of Appeals concluded it was not authorized by that case. <em>Id., </em>at 119-120 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">We granted certiorari. 561 U.S. 1005, 130 S. Ct. 3493, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1054 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">Sovereign immunity is the privilege of the sovereign not to be sued without its consent. The language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>the Eleventh Amendment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> only eliminates the basis for our judgment in the famous case of <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>2 Dall. 419, 1 L. Ed. 440 (1793), which involved a suit against a State by a noncitizen of the State. Since <em>Hans </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890), however, we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to confirm the structural understanding that States entered the Union with their sovereign immunity intact, unlimited by Article Ill\u2019s jurisdictional grant. <em>Blatchford </em>v. <em>Native Village of Noatak, </em>501 U.S. 775, 779, 111 S. Ct. 2578, 115 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1991); see <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 98, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984). Our cases hold that the States have retained their traditional immunity from suit, \u201cexcept as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional amendments.\u201d <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 713, 119 S. Ct. 2240, 144 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1999). A State may waive its sovereign immunity at its pleasure, <em>College Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., </em>527 U.S. 666, 675-676, 119 S. Ct. 2219, 144 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1999), and in some circumstances Congress</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">[563 U.S. 254]</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">may abrogate it by appropriate legislation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But absent waiver or valid abrogation, federal courts may not entertain a private person\u2019s suit against a State.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714, we established an important limit on the sovereign-immunity principle. That case involved a challenge to a Minnesota law reducing the freight rates that railroads could charge. A railroad shareholder claimed that the new rates were unconstitutionally confiscatory, and obtained a federal injunction against Edward Young, the Attorney General of Minnesota, forbidding him in his official capacity to enforce the state law. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Northern Pacific R. Co., </em>155 F. 445 (CC Minn. 1907). When Young violated the injunction by initiating an enforcement action in state court, the Circuit Court held him in contempt and committed him to federal custody. In his habeas corpus application in this Court, Young challenged his confinement by arguing that Minnesota\u2019s sovereign immunity deprived the federal court of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">We disagreed. We explained that [10] because an unconstitutional legislative enactment is \u201cvoid,\u201d a state official who enforces that law \u201ccomes into conflict with the superior authority of [the] Constitution,\u201d and therefore is \u201cstripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct. The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States.\u201d 209 U.S., at 159-160, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number> This doctrine has existed alongside our sovereign-immunity jurisprudence for more than a century, accepted as</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">[563 U.S. 255]</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">necessary to \u201cpermit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.\u201d <em>Pennhurst, </em>465 U.S., at 105, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67. It rests on the premise\u2014less delicately called a \u201cfiction,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 114, n. 25, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67\u2014that when a federal court commands a state official to do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes. The doctrine is limited to that precise situation, and does not apply \u201cwhen \u2018the state is the real, substantial party in interest,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 101, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (quoting <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Treasury of </em>Ind., 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S. Ct. 347, 89 L. Ed. 389 (1945)), as when the \u201c \u2018judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with public administration,\u2019 \u201d 465 U.S., at 101, n. 11, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (quoting <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Rank, </em>372 U.S. 609, 620, 83 S. Ct. 999, 10 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">This case requires us to decide how to apply the <em>Ex parte Young </em>doctrine to a suit brought by an independent state agency claiming to possess federal rights. Although we have never encountered such a suit before, we are satisfied that entertaining VOPA\u2019s action is consistent with our precedents and does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">In <em>Verizon Md. Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>535 U.S. 635, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871 (2002), we held that  \u201c [i]n determining whether the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young </em>avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a \u2018straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 645, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871 (quoting <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, </em>521 U.S. 261, 296, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1997) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)). There is no doubt VOPA\u2019s suit satisfies that straightforward inquiry. It alleges that respondents\u2019 refusal to produce the requested medical records violates federal law; and it seeks an injunction requiring the production of the records, which would</p>\n<p id=\"AJEN\">[563 U.S. 256]</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">prospectively abate the alleged violation. Respondents concede that were VOPA a private organization rather than a state agency, the doctrine would permit this action to proceed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">We see no reason for a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>result here. Although respondents argue that VOPA\u2019s status as a state agency changes the calculus,  there is no warrant in our cases for making the validity of an <em>Ex parte Young </em>action turn on the identity of the plaintiff. To be sure, we have been willing to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to evade sovereign immunity. To do otherwise \u201cwould be to adhere to an empty formalism.\u201d <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, supra, </em>at 270, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438. But (as the dissent concedes, <em>post, </em>at 273, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 697 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.)) the limits we have recognized reflect the principle that the \u201cgeneral criterion for determining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the <em>effect </em>of the relief sought,\u201d <em>Pennhurst, supra, </em>at 107, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67, not who is bringing the lawsuit. Thus, <em>Ex parte Young </em>cannot be used to obtain an injunction requiring the payment of funds from the State\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"AKZrY\">[563 U.S. 257]</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">treasury, see <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 666, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974); or an order for specific performance of a State\u2019s contract, see <em>id., </em>at 666-667, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662; <em>In re Ayers, </em>123 U.S. 443, 8 S. Ct. 164, 31 L. Ed. 216 (1887).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\"><em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, </em>on which respondents heavily rely, is an application of this principle. There we refused to allow an Indian Tribe to use <em>Ex parte Young </em>to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief establishing its exclusive right to the use and enjoyment of certain submerged lands in Idaho and the invalidity of all state statutes and regulations governing that land. 521 U.S., at 265, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438. We determined that the suit was \u201cthe functional equivalent of\u2019 \u201ca quiet title suit against Idaho,\u201d would \u201cextinguish . . . the State\u2019s control over a vast reach of lands and waters long deemed by the State to be an integral part of its territory,\u201d and thus was barred by sovereign immunity. <em>Id., </em>at 282, 281, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Respondents have advanced no argument that the relief sought in this case threatens any similar invasion of Virginia\u2019s sovereignty. Indeed, they concede that the very injunction VOPA requests could properly be awarded by a federal court at the instance of a private P system.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Respondents and the dissent argue that entertaining VOPA\u2019s lawsuit in a federal forum would nevertheless infringe Virginia\u2019s sovereign interests because it diminishes the dignity of a State for a federal court to adjudicate a dispute between its components. See Brief for Respondents 23-26; <em>post, </em>at 269-273, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 695-697 (arguing that \u201c \u2018special sovereignty interests\u2019 \u201d bar VOPA\u2019s lawsuit (quoting <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, supra, </em>at 281, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438)). We disagree. As an initial matter, we do not understand how a State\u2019s stature could be diminished to any greater degree when <em>its own agency </em>polices its officers\u2019 compliance with their federal obligations, than when <em>a private person </em>hales those officers into federal court for</p>\n<p id=\"AqbK\">[563 U.S. 258]</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">that same purpose\u2014something everyone agrees is proper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And in this case, of course, VOPA\u2019s power to sue state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>officials is a consequence of Virginia\u2019s own decision to establish a public, rather than a private, P system. We fail to perceive what Eleventh Amendment indignity is visited on the Commonwealth when, by operation of its own laws, VOPAis admitted to federal court as a plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">But even if it were true that the State\u2019s dignity were offended in some way by the maintenance of this action in federal court, that would not prove respondents\u2019 case.  Denial of sovereign immunity, to be sure, offends the dignity of a State; but not every offense to the dignity of a State constitutes a denial of sovereign immunity. The specific indignity against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled into court without its consent. That effectively occurs, our cases reasonably conclude, when (for example) the object of the suit against a state officer is to reach funds in the state treasury or acquire state lands; it</p>\n<p id=\"az1g-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 259]</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">does not occur just because the suit happens to be brought by another state agency. Respondents\u2019 asserted dignitary harm is simply unconnected to the sovereign-immunity interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The dissent complains that applying <em>Ex parte Young </em>to this lawsuit divides Virginia against itself, since the opposing parties are both creatures of the Commonwealth. <em>Post, </em>at 271-272, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 696-697. Even if that were a distinctive consequence of letting this suit proceed in federal court, it would have nothing to do with the concern of sovereign immunity\u2014whether the suit is against an unconsenting State, rather than against its officers. But it is <em>not </em>a consequence of the federal nature of the forum. The same result will follow if the federal claim is sued upon in state court, as the dissent would require. There also, \u201c[w]hatever the decision in the litigation, . . . [t]he Commonwealth will win[, a]nd the Commonwealth will lose.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 272, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 697. Nor would sending the matter to state court even avoid the prospect that \u201ca federal judge will resolve which part of the Commonwealth will prevail,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>since the state-court loser could always ask <em>this </em>Court to review the matter by certiorari. (Or is that appeal also to be disallowed on grounds of sovereign immunity? But see <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>6 Wheat. 264, 5 L. Ed. 257 (1821).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And of course precisely the same thing would happen if respondents specifically waived their sovereign-immunity objections <em>in this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>very case. </em>Yet no one would contend that despite the waiver, sovereign immunity forbade the suit. So also here: If, by reason of <em>Ex parte Young, </em>there has been no violation of</p>\n<p id=\"akda-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 260]</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">sovereign immunity, the prospect of a federal judge\u2019s resolving VOPA\u2019s dispute with respondents does not make it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">We do not doubt, of course, that  there are limits on the Federal Government\u2019s power to affect the internal operations of a State. See, <em>e.g., Printz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>521 U.S. 898, 117 S. Ct. 2365, 138 L.

Ed. 853 (1911) (Congress may not dictate a State\u2019s capital). But those limits must be found in some textual provision or structural premise of the Constitution.

Respondents rightly observe that  federal courts have not often encountered lawsuits brought by state agencies against other state officials. That does give us pause. Lack of historical precedent can indicate a constitutional infirmity, see, <em>e.g., Free Enterprise Fund </em>v. <em>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., </em>561 U.S. 477, 505-506, 130 S. Ct. 3138, 177 L. Ed. 2d 706 (2010), and our sovereign-immunity decisions have traditionally warned against \u201c \u2018anomalous and unheard-of proceedings or suits,\u2019 \u201d <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S., at 727, 119 S. Ct. 2240, 144 L. Ed. 2d 636 (quoting <em>Hans, </em>134 U.S., at 18, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">Novelty, however, is often the consequence of past constitutional doubts, but we have no reason to believe that is the case here.  In order to invoke the <em>Ex parte Young </em>exception to sovereign immunity, a state agency needs two things: first, a federal right that it possesses against its parent State; and second, authority to sue other state officials to enforce that</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">[563 U.S. 261]</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">right, free from any internal veto wielded by the state government. These conditions will rarely coincide\u2014and at least the latter of them cannot exist without the consent of the State that created the agency and defined its powers. See <em>post, </em>at 264, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 691-692 (Kennedy, J., concurring). We are unaware that the necessary conditions have ever presented themselves except in connection with the DD and PAIMI Acts, and the parties have referred us to no examples.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Thus, the apparent novelty of this sort of suit does not at all suggest its unconstitutionality.

But we conclude no such encroachment is occasioned by straightforwardly applying <em>Ex parte Young </em>to allow this suit. It was Virginia law that created VOPA and gave it the power to sue state officials. In that circumstance, the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle to VOPA\u2019s ability to invoke federal jurisdiction on the same terms as any other litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\">.

Ed. 2d 662 (1974), for example, the Court applied the exception to an affirmative prospective order but not to equitable restitution, for the latter was too similar to an award of damages against the State. <em>Id., </em>at 668, 94 S.

Ed. 2d 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The \u201cstraightforward inquiry\u201d of <em>Verizon Md, </em>derives from <em>Edelman </em>and <em>Pennhurst, </em>both of which defined important limits on <em>Young </em>in order to respect state sovereignty while still adhering to principles necessary to implement the Supremacy Clause. As a result, <em>Verizon Md. </em>incorporates</p>\n<p id=\"axqf-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 263]</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">the very balancing it might at first seem to reject. <em>Verizon Md. </em>itself was an easy case, for it involved the same kind of preenforcement assertion of a defense that was at issue in <em>Young. </em>But when <em>Young\u2019s </em>application is explored in novel contexts, as in <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, </em>521 U.S. 261, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1997), and also in this case, the inquiry \u201cproves more complex,\u201d <em>Verizon Md., supra, </em>at 648, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">In this case, in my view, the Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) may rely on <em>Young, </em>despite the somewhat striking novelty of permitting a state agency to sue officials of the same State in federal court. In the posture of the case as it comes before the Court, it must be assumed that VOPA has a federal right to the records it seeks, and so the extension of <em>Young </em>would vindicate the Supremacy Clause. To be balanced against this important interest is the need to preserve \u201cthe dignity and respect afforded a State, which the immunity is designed to protect.\u201d <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene, supra, </em>at 268, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438. Permitting a state agency like VOPA to sue officials of the same State does implicate the State\u2019s important sovereign interest in using its own courts to control the distribution of power among its own agents. But the affront to the State\u2019s dignity is diminished to some extent when it is noted that if the State had elected the alternative course of designating a private protection and advocacy system it then would have avoided any risk of internal conflict while still participating in the federal program. The availability of that alternative course does not, in my view, weigh much in favor of the validity of the underlying federal scheme, but the only question here is the reach of the <em>Young </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Virginia\u2019s concern that the holding here upsets the federal balance is further mitigated by the various protections built into the structure of federal litigation to ensure that state officials do not too often call upon the federal courts to resolve their intramural disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">[563 U.S. 264]</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">First, and most important, state law must authorize an agency or official to sue another arm of the State. If States do not wish to see their internal conflicts aired in federal court, they need not empower their officers or agencies to sue one another in a federal forum. And if state officers are not by state law empowered to sue, they may invoke federal jurisdiction only in their personal capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Second, to the extent there is some doubt under state law as to an officer\u2019s or agency\u2019s power to sue, or any other state-law issue that may be dis-positive, federal courts should abstain under <em>Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. </em>v. <em>Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S. Ct. 643, 85 L. Ed. 971 (1941). <em>Pullman </em>recognizes the importance of state sovereignty by limiting federal judicial intervention in state affairs to cases where intervention is necessary. If an open question of state law would resolve a dispute, then federal courts may wait for the resolution of the state-law issue before adjudicating the merits. Likewise, certification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>questions of state law to the state courts may pretermit an otherwise sensitive federal controversy. <em>Lehman Brothers </em>v. <em>Schein, </em>416 U.S. 386, 391, 94 S. Ct. 1741, 40 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1974) (Certification \u201chelps build a cooperative judicial federalism\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Finally, federal law does not often create rights for state officials or agencies to assert against other arms of the State. True, officials may assert that their personal federal rights are violated by unlawful state action, for example where the State engages in discriminatory employment practices. But the statutory framework in the case now before the Court is unusual in that it vests a state agency itself with federal rights against the State. Statutes tend to protect the rights of individuals, not officers or agencies, and the Constitution\u2019s rights-creating Clauses protect persons rather than officers. Because the <em>Young </em>exception is available only to those who assert federal violations, the paucity of federal rights vested in government officials makes the scope of the holding here a narrow one.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">[563 U.S. 265]</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">All this is simply to underscore that the program at issue may present constitutional questions but that the parties do not raise them in this litigation. Virginia does not argue, for example, that Congress exceeded its spending power under Article I, \u00a7 8, by forcing a state that wishes to designate a public agency as its advocacy system to allow intramural suits like the instant one or by requiring that the agency be structured as Congress directs. <em>E.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15043(a)(2)(G) (system must \u201cbe independent of any agency that provides treatment, services, or habilitation to individuals with developmen tal disabilities\u201d); \u00a7 15044(a)(2) (\u201c[N]ot more than 1/3 of the members of the governing board may be appointed by the chief executive officer of the State\u201d). Young\u2014a court-made doctrine based on convenience, fiction, or both\u2014neither implicates nor subsumes these more fundamental concerns regarding the excessive exercise of federal power. The Court should be most cautious before deciding cases that might later lead to a general principle that the National Government can condition receipt of funds on the State\u2019s agreement to make far-reaching changes with respect to its governmental structure or its basic policies of governance in matters within its special competence. Assuming, as the Court must, that the statutes here are constitutional, the narrow question is whether VOPA may rely on <em>Young </em>to avoid the sovereign immunity bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">One might doubt whether the constitutional question may be so severed from the <em>Young </em>analysis. The Court wields <em>Young </em>in the name of the Supremacy Clause only to vindicate important federal rights. Perhaps this Court should not extend the fiction in the name of claims that may rest on unconstitutional foundations. This concern is misplaced. The canon of constitutional avoidance directs courts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that preserves its validity, but the specter of a statute\u2019s unconstitutionality cannot be permitted to distort the antecedent question of jurisdiction. Courts</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">[563 U.S. 266]</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">interpret and evaluate a statute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate the case before them. To decline to adjudicate a federal right for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect to invalidate the right in the quest to save it. The Court should not permit the commission of acts that violate a federal right on the mere suspicion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Congress acted beyond its authority. Because the suit must be assumed to vindicate the Supremacy Clause and poses no serious affront to state sovereignty in light of the options available to the State under the program, it may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">With these observations, I join the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b791-5\">Chief Justice Roberts,</author>\n<p id=\"A08Z\">with whom Justice Alito joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Today the Court holds that a state agency may sue officials acting on behalf of the State in federal court. This has never happened before. In order to reach this unsettling result, the Court extends the fiction of <em>Ex parte </em>Young\u2014what we have called an \u201cempty formalism\u201d\u2014well beyond the circumstances of that case. Because I cannot subscribe to such a substantial and novel expansion of what we have also called \u201ca narrow exception\u201d to a State\u2019s sovereign immunity, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">\u201cThe federal system established by our Constitution preserves the sovereign status of the States.\u201d <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 714, 119 S.

Indeed, the history of our <em>Ex parte Young </em>jurisprudence has largely been focused on ensuring that this narrow exception is \u201cnarrowly construed,\u201d 465 U.S., at 114, n. 25, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67. We have, for example, held that the fiction of <em>Ex parte Young </em>does not extend to suits where the plaintiff seeks retroactive relief, <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 678, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974); where the claimed violations are based on state law, <em>Pennhurst, supra, </em>at 106, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L.

Ed. 2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">We recently stated that when \u201cdetermining whether the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young </em>avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.\u201d <em>Verizon Md. Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>535 U.S. 635, 645, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). But not every plaintiff who complies with these prerequisites will be able to bring suit under <em>Ex parte Young. </em>Indeed, in <em>Verizon </em>itself the Court went beyond its so-called straightforward inquiry in considering whether <em>Ex parte Young </em>applied. After deciding the plaintiffs \u201cclearly satisfie[d]\u201d the \u201cstraightforward inquiry,\u201d the Court went on to examine whether Congress had created a detailed remedial scheme like the one in <em>Seminole Tribe. </em>535 U.S., at 645, 647-648, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871 (internal quotation marks omitted). Only after determining that Congress had not done so did the Court conclude that the suit could go forward under <em>Ex parte Young.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">[563 U.S. 269]</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">If <em>Verizon\u2019s </em>formulation set forth the only requirements for bringing an action under <em>Ex parte Young, </em>two of our recent precedents were wrongly decided. In <em>Seminole Tribe, </em>the Court acknowledged that it had often \u201cfound federal jurisdiction over a suit against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>a state official when that suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order to end a continuing violation of federal law.\u201d 517 U.S., at 73, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held, however, that the \u201csituation presented\u201d there was \u201csufficiently different from that giving rise to the traditional <em>Ex parte Young </em>action so as to preclude the availability of that doctrine.\u201d Ibid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">In <em>Couer d\u2019Alene Tribe, </em>the Court recognized that an \u201callegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the requested relief is prospective is <em>ordinarily </em>sufficient to invoke the <em>Young </em>fiction.\u201d 521 U.S., at 281, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438 (emphasis added). The Court held, however, that the action could not proceed under <em>Ex parte Young </em>because it implicated \u201cspecial sovereignty interests\u201d\u2014in that case, the State\u2019s property rights in certain submerged lands. 521 U.S., at 281-283, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">As we explained in <em>Papasan </em>v. <em>Allain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986), there are \u201ccertain types of cases that formally meet the <em>Young </em>requirements of a state official acting inconsistently with federal law but that stretch that case too far and would upset the balance of federal and state interests that it embodies.\u201d Id<em>., </em>at 277, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209. This is one of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In refusing to extend <em>Ex parte Young </em>to claims that involve \u201cspecial sovereignty interests,\u201d the Court in <em>Coeur</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">[563 U.S. 270]</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\"><em>d\u2019Alene Tribe </em>warned against a rote application of the <em>Ex parte Young </em>fiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">\u201cTo interpret <em>Young </em>to permit a federal-court action to proceed in every case where prospective declaratory and injunctive relief is sought against an officer, named in his individual capacity, would be to adhere to an empty formalism and to undermine the principle . . . that Eleventh Amendment immunity represents a real limitation on a federal court\u2019s federal-question jurisdiction. The real interests served by the Eleventh Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary mechanics of captions and pleading. Application of the <em>Young </em>exception must reflect a proper understanding of its role in our federal system and respect for state courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fiction.\u201d 521 U.S., at 270, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L. Ed. 2d 438.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">It is undisputed that petitioner\u2019s complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law by a state official and seeks only prospective relief. If this were a \u201ctraditional <em>Ex parte Young </em>action,\u201d <em>Seminole Tribe, supra, </em>at 73, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252, petitioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under that case. This, however, is anything but a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>traditional case\u2014and petitioner is anything but a typical <em>Ex parte Young </em>plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Ex parte </em>Young\u2014and, for that matter, unlike any other plaintiff that has ever sought to invoke <em>Ex parte Young </em>before this Court\u2014petitioner is a state agency seeking to sue officials of the same State in federal court. The Court is troubled by this novelty, <em>ante, </em>at 260-261, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 689-690, but not enough. See <em>Free Enterprise Fund </em>v. <em>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., </em>561 U.S. 477, 505, 130 S. Ct. 3138, 177 L. Ed. 2d 706 (2010) (\u201cPerhaps the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional problem ... is the lack of historical precedent\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S., at</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">[563 U.S. 271]</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">743-745, 119 S. Ct. 2240, 144 L. Ed. 2d 636; <em>Printz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>521 U.S. 898, 905-910, 918, 925, 117 S. Ct. 2365, 138 L. Ed. 2d 914 (1997). This is especially true in light of the \u201cpresumption\u201d we articulated more than 120 years ago in <em>Hans </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>that States are immune from suits that would have been \u201canomalous and unheard of when the Constitution was adopted.\u201d 134 U.S., at 18, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842; see also <em>Alden, supra, </em>at 727, 119 S. Ct. 2240, 144 L. Ed. 2d 636 (invoking presumption).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Accordingly, when determining whether to lift the bar of sovereign immunity, we have \u201cattribute [d] great significance\u201d to the absence of analogous suits \u201cat the time of the founding or for many years thereafter.\u201d <em>Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>535 U.S., at 755, 122 S. Ct. 1864, 152 L. Ed. 2d 962. This sort of suit was not only anomalous and unheard of at the time of the founding; it was anomalous and unheard of yesterday. The <em>Hans </em>presumption applies here with full force.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">The Court speculates that these suits have not previously arisen because the necessary conditions\u2014state agencies pursuing a federal right free of internal state veto\u2014are themselves novel. See <em>ante, </em>at 260-261, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 689; see also <em>ante, </em>at 264, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 691-692 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Even if true, that simply highlights the fact that this case is not suitable for mere rote application of <em>Ex parte Young.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">In addition to its novel character, petitioner\u2019s complaint \u201cconflicts directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Pennhurst, </em>465 U.S., at 106, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67. In <em>Alden, </em>we held that state sovereign immunity prohibited Congress from authorizing \u201cprivate suits against nonconsenting States in their own courts.\u201d 527 U.S., at 749, 119 S. Ct. 2240, 144 L. Ed. 2d 636. We explained that such power would permit one branch of state government, the \u201cState\u2019s own courts,\u201d \u201cto coerce the other branches of the State\u201d and \u201cto turn the State against itself.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">Here the Court goes further: This suit features a state agency on one side, and state executive officials on the other. The objection in <em>Alden </em>was that the Federal Government could force the State to defend itself before itself. Here extending</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">[563 U.S. 272]</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\"><em>Young </em>forces the State to defend itself <em>against </em>itself in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">Both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Petitioner claims the title of \u201cThe Commonwealth of Virginia\u201d in its complaint, App. 10; respondents are state officials acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>in an official capacity. Whatever the decision in the litigation, one thing is clear: The Commonwealth will win. And the Commonwealth will lose. Because of today\u2019s holding, a federal judge will resolve which part of the Commonwealth will prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Virginia has not consented to such a suit in federal court; rather, petitioner has unilaterally determined that this intramural dispute should be resolved in that forum. This is precisely what sovereign immunity is supposed to guard against. See <em>ante, </em>at 258, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 688 (\u201cThe specific indignity against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled into court without its consent\u201d). That indignity is compounded when the State is haled into federal court so that a federal judge can decide an internal state dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The Court is wrong to suggest that Virginia has no sovereign interest in determining <em>where </em>such disputes will be resolved. See <em>ante, </em>at 259, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 688-689, and n. 6. It is one thing for a State to decide that its components may sue one another in its own courts (as Virginia did here); it is quite another thing for such a dispute to be resolved in federal court against the State\u2019s wishes. For this reason, the Court\u2019s examples of other suits pitting state entities against one another are inapposite. In each of those hypotheticals, the State consented to having a particular forum resolve its internal conflict. That is not true here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">[563 U.S. 273]</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">In sum, the \u201cspecial sovereignty interests\u201d implicated here make this case \u201csufficiently different from that giving rise to the traditional <em>Ex parte Young </em>action so as to preclude the availability of that doctrine.\u201d <em>Seminole Tribe, </em>517 U.S., at 73, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252. I would cling to reality and not extend the fiction of <em>Ex parte Young </em>to cover petitioner\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">The Court offers several justifications for its expansion of <em>Ex parte Young. </em>None is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">The Court first contends that whether the <em>Ex parte Young </em>fiction should be applied turns only on the \u201crelief sought\u201d in a case. <em>Ante, </em>at 256, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 686-687 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court is correct that several of our prior cases have focused on the nature of the relief requested. See, <em>e.g., Edelman, </em>415 U.S., at 664-671, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662. That may well be because \u201cthe difference between the type of relief barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted under <em>Ex parte Young </em>will not in many instances be that between day and night.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 667, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Court is wrong to draw a negative implication from those cases and categorically conclude that there can be no other basis for determining whether to extend <em>Ex parte Young\u2019s </em>fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The thrust of the Court\u2019s argument appears to be that, because the relief sought here is no different from that which could be sought in a suit by a private protection and advocacy system, the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young </em>should also apply to a suit brought by a state system. <em>Ante, </em>at 255-257, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 686-687. But private entities are different from public ones: They are private. When private litigants are involved, the State is not turned against itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">[563 U.S. 274]</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, see <em>ante, </em>at 257-258, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 687, there is indeed a real difference between a suit against the State brought by a private party and one brought by a state agency. It is the difference between eating and cannibalism; between murder and patricide. While the ultimate results may be the same\u2014a full stomach and a dead body\u2014it is the means of getting there that attracts notice. I would think it more an affront to someone\u2019s dignity to be sued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger. While neither may be welcomed, that does not mean they would be equally received.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The Court also contends that petitioner\u2019s ability to sue state officials in federal court \u201cis a consequence of Virginia\u2019s own decision to establish a public [protection and advocacy] system.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 258, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 687. This cannot mean that Virginia has consented to an infringement on its sovereignty. That argument was rejected below, and petitioner did not seek certiorari on that issue. See <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Reinhard, </em>568 F.3d 110, 116-118 (CA4 2009); Pet. for Cert. i.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Instead the Court claims that \u2018Virginia has only itself to blame\u201d\u2014if it wanted to avoid its current predicament, it could have chosen to establish a private entity instead. <em>Ante, </em>at 258, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 687-688, and n. 5; see also <em>ante, </em>at 262, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 691 (Kennedy, J., concurring). But I am aware of no doctrine to the effect that an unconstitutional establishment is insulated from challenge simply because a constitutional alternative is available. And here the public and private systems are not interchangeable alternatives in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">The Court\u2019s analysis is also circular; it wrongly assumes Virginia knew in advance the answer to the question presented in this case. Only <em>after </em>concluding that <em>Ex parte Young </em>applies to this arrangement\u2014that for the first time in history a state agency may sue an unwilling State in federal court\u2014can the Court suggest that Virginia knowingly exposed its officers to suit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">In a similar vein, the Court asserts that because Virginia law authorizes petitioner to exercise independent litigating</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">[563 U.S. 275]</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">authority, petitioner should be treated the same \u201cas any other litigant.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 261, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 690. But petitioner is not like any other litigant. While it is true petitioner enjoys some independence from the Commonwealth\u2019s executive branch, that does not mean petitioner is independent <em>from the Commonwealth. </em>As noted, petitioner certainly views itself as \u201cThe Commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d App. 10, and would presumably invoke sovereign immunity itself if sued. As a matter of sovereign immunity law, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>should make no difference how a State chooses to allocate its governmental powers among different state agencies or officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">The Court is wrong to suggest that simply because petitioner possesses independent litigating authority, it may sue state officials in federal court. See <em>ante, </em>at 261, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 690 (\u201cthe Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle\u201d since it \u201cwas Virginia law that created [petitioner] and gave it the power to sue state officials\u201d). There is more to this case than merely whether petitioner needs the approval of the attorney general to sue, and the Virginia Code provisions cited by the Court say nothing about actions against the Commonwealth in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">If independent litigating authority is all that it takes, then scores of state entities now \u201csuddenly possess the authority to pursue <em>Ex parte Young </em>actions against other state officials\u201d in federal court. <em>Reinhard, supra, </em>at 124. There would be no Eleventh Amendment impediment to such suits. Given the number of state agencies across the country that enjoy independent litigating authority, see, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for State of Indiana et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>11-13, the Court\u2019s decision today could potentially lead to all sorts of litigation in federal courts addressing internal state government disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">And there is also no reason to think that the Court\u2019s holding is limited to state <em>agency </em>plaintiffs. According to the Court\u2019s basic rationale, state officials who enjoy some level of independence could as a matter of federal law bring suit against other state officials in federal court. Disputes that</p>\n<p id=\"aops-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 276]</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">were formerly resolved in state cabinet rooms may now appear on the dockets of federal courts,</p>\n<p id=\"AZLV\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">No one questions the continued vitality or importance of the doctrine announced in <em>Ex parte Young. </em>But <em>Ex parte Young </em>was about affording relief to a private party against unconstitutional state action. It was not about resolving a dispute between two different state actors. That is a matter for the Commonwealth to sort out, not a federal judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Our decision in <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>2 Dall. 419, 1 L. Ed. 440 (1793)\u2014permitting States to be sued by private parties in federal court\u2014 \u201ccreated such a shock of surprise\u201d throughout the country \u201cthat the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted.\u201d <em>Principality of Monaco </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>292 U.S. 313, 325, 54 S. Ct. 745, 78 L. Ed. 1282 (1934). It is fair to say that today\u2019s decision will probably not trigger a similar response. But however much their practical functions and prominence may have changed in the past 218 years, the States remain a vital element of our political structure. Sovereign immunity ensures that States retain a stature commensurate with their role under the Constitution. Allowing one part of the State to sue another in federal court, so that a federal judge decides an important dispute between state officials, undermines state sovereignty in an unprecedented and direct way. The fiction of <em>Ex parte Young </em>should not be extended to permit so real an intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Because I believe the Court\u2019s novel expansion of <em>Ex parte Young </em>is inconsistent with the federal system established by our Constitution, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\">. <em>Ex parte Young </em>also rests on the \u201cwell-recognized irony that an official\u2019s unconstitutional conduct constitutes state action under the Fourteenth Amendment but not the Eleventh Amendment.\u2019\u2019 <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 105, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-13\">. While I agree that in <em>Seminole Tribe </em>\u201cwe refused to permit suit to proceed\u2019\u2019 under <em>Ex parte Young </em>because Congress \u201chad foreclosed recourse to the doctrine,\u2019\u2019 <em>ante, </em>at 256, n. 3, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 686, that simply confirms my point that the availability of <em>Young </em>depends on more than just whether <em>Verizon's </em>prescribed inquiry is satisfied. In short, <em>Seminole Tribe </em>makes clear that a plaintiff who files a \u201ccomplaint alleg[ing] an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective,\u2019\u2019 <em>Verizon, </em>535 U.S., at 645, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871 (internal quotation marks omitted), may nonetheless be barred from pursuing an action under <em>Young.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b795-12\">. Sovereign immunity principles would of course not prohibit this Court from reviewing the federal questions presented by this suit if it had been filed in state court. See <em>ante, </em>at 259, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 688. We have held that \u201cit is inherent in the constitutional plan that when a state court takes cognizance of a case, the State assents to appellate review by this Court of the federal issues raised in the case whoever may be the parties to the original suit, whether private persons, or the state itself.\u2019\u2019 <em>McKesson Corp. </em>v. <em>Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla.

By contrast, there is nothing \u201cinherent in the constitutional plan\u2019\u2019 that warrants lower federal courts handling intrastate disputes absent a State\u2019s consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
