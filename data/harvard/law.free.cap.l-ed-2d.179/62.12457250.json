The question presented: Does California\u2019s timeliness requirement qualify as an independent state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">California does not employ fixed statutory deadlines to determine the timeliness of a state prisoner\u2019s petition for habeas corpus. Instead, California directs petitioners to file known claims \u201cas promptly as the circumstances allow.\u201d <em>In re Clark, </em>5 Cal. 4th 750, 765, n. 5, 855 P.2d 729, 738, n. 5 (1993). Petitioners are further instructed to state when they first learned of the asserted claims and to explain why they did not seek post-conviction relief sooner. <em>In re Robbins, </em>18 Cal. 4th 770, 780, 959 P.2d 311, 317-318 (1998). Claims substantially delayed without justification may be denied as untimely. <em>Ibid.; Clark, </em>5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P.2d, at 738, n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">California courts signal that a habeas petition is denied as untimely by citing the controlling decisions, <em>i.e., Clark </em>and <em>Robbins. </em>A spare order denying a petition without explanation or citation ordinarily ranks as a disposition on the merits. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; see <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Richter, ante, </em>at 99, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. California courts may elect to preter-mit the question whether a petition is timely and simply deny the petition, thereby signaling that the petition lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">Petitioner below, respondent here, Charles W. Martin, presented the claims at issue\u2014all alleging ineffective assistance of counsel\u2014in a ha-beas petition filed in the California Supreme Court nearly five years after his conviction became final. He stated no reason for the long delay. Citing <em>Clark </em>and <em>Robbins, </em>the court denied Martin\u2019s petition. In turn, the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of California dismissed Martin\u2019s federal habeas petition raising the same ineffective-assistance claims. Denial of Martin\u2019s state-court petition as un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>timely, the District Court held, rested on an</p>\n<p id=\"AdM\">[562 U.S. 311]</p>\n<p id=\"AzU\">adequate and independent state ground, <em>i.e., </em>Martin\u2019s failure to seek relief in state court \u201cwithout substantial delay.\u201d See <em>Robbins, </em>18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P.2d, at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court\u2019s decision. Contrasting the precision of \u201cfixed statutory deadlines\u201d with California\u2019s proscription of \u201csubstantial delay,\u201d the appeals court held that California\u2019s standard lacked the clarity and certainty necessary to constitute an adequate state bar. 357 Fed. Appx. 793, 794 (2009) (relying on <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>562 F.3d 1200 (CA9 2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"AZPr\">In a recent decision, <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Kindler, </em>558 U.S. 53, 130 S. Ct. 612, 175 L. Ed. 2d 417 (2009), this Court clarified that  a state procedural bar may count as an adequate and independent ground for denying a federal habeas petition even if the state court had discretion to reach the merits despite the default. Guided by that decision, we hold that California is not put to the choice of imposing a specific deadline for habeas petitions (which would almost certainly rule out Martin\u2019s nearly five-year delay) or preserving the flexibility of current practice, \u201cbut only at the cost of undermining the finality of state court judgments.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 61, 130 S. Ct. 612, 175 L. Ed. 2d 417. In so ruling, we stress that Martin has not alleged that California\u2019s time bar, either by design or in operation, discriminates against federal claims or claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">I</p>\n<p id=\"an-dedup-0\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AdH\">While most States set determinate time limits for collateral relief applications, in California, neither statute nor rule of court does so. Instead, California courts \u201cappl[y] a general \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard\u201d to judge whether a habeas petition is timely filed. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 222, 122 S. Ct. 2134, 153 L. Ed. 2d 260 (2002). The basic instruction provided by the California Supreme Court is simply that \u201ca [habeas] petition should be filed as promptly as the circumstances allow . . . .\u201d <em>Clark, </em>5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P.2d, at 738, n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"A4X\">[562 U.S. 312]</p>\n<p id=\"AiXA\">Three leading decisions describe California\u2019s timeliness requirement: <em>Robbins, Clark, </em>and <em>In re Gallego, </em>18 Cal. 4th 825, 959 P.2d 290 (1998).  A prisoner must seek habeas relief without \u201csubstantial delay,\u201d <em>Robbins, </em>18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P.2d, at 317; <em>Gallego, </em>18 Cal. 4th, at 833, 959 P.2d, at 296; <em>Clark, </em>5 Cal. 4th, at 783, 855 P.2d, at 750, as \u201cmeasured from the time the petitioner or counsel knew, or reasonably should have known, of the information offered in support of the claim and the legal basis for the claim,\u201d <em>Robbins, </em>18 Cal. 4th, at 787, 959 P.2d, at 322. Petitioners in non-capital cases have \u201cthe burden of establishing (i) absence of substantial delay, (ii) good cause for the delay, or (iii) that the claim falls within an exception to the bar of untimeliness.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 780, 959 P.2d, at 317.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AV4\">California\u2019s collateral review regime differs from that of other States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>in a second notable respect:  All California courts \u201chave original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings,\u201d Cal. Const., Art. VI, \u00a7 10, thus \u201cno appeal lies from the denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus,\u201d <em>Clark, </em>5 Cal. 4th, at 767, n. 7, 855 P.2d, at 740, n. 7. \u201c[A] prisoner whose petition has been denied by the superior court can obtain review of his claims only by the filing of a new petition in the Court of Appeal.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The new petition, however, must be confined to claims raised in the initial petition. See <em>In re Martinez, </em>46 Cal. 4th 945, 956, 209 P.3d 908, 915 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Because a habeas petitioner may skip over the lower courts and file directly in the California Supreme Court, <em>In re Kler, </em>188 Cal. App. 4th 1399, 1403, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 889, 891-892 (2010), that court rules on a staggering number</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">[562 U.S. 313]</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">of habeas petitions each year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court issues generally unelaborated \u201csummary denials\u201d of petitions that \u201cd[o] not state a prima facie case for relief\u2019 or that contain \u201cclaims [that] are all procedurally barred.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>8 Cal. 4th 728, 737, 883 P.2d 388, 391 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). A summary denial citing <em>Clark </em>and <em>Robbins </em>means that the petition is rejected as untimely. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for Habeas Corpus Resource Center as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20, and n. 23. California courts have discretion, however, to bypass a timeliness issue and, instead, summarily reject the petition for want of merit. See <em>Robbins, </em>18 Cal. 4th, at 778, n. 1, 959 P.2d, at 316, n. 1. See also <em>Saffold, </em>536 U.S., at 225-226, 122 S. Ct. 2134, 153 L. Ed. 2d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">In December 1986, Charles Martin participated in a robbery and murder in California. Martin fled the State, but eight years later he was extradited to California to stand trial. Convicted in state court of murder and robbery, Martin was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In 1997, the California Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction and sentence, and the California Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Martin initiated his first round of state habeas proceedings in 1998, and the next year, the California Supreme Court denied his petition. He then filed a habeas petition in the appropriate U. S. District Court. Finding that Martin\u2019s federal petition included ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">[562 U.S. 314]</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">he had not aired in state court, the District Court stayed the federal proceedings pending Martin\u2019s return to state court to exhaust his remedies there.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">In March 2002, Martin filed his second habeas petition in the California Supreme Court, raising the federal ineffective-assistance claims his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>earlier filing omitted. He gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36, 39. In September 2002, the California Supreme Court denied Martin\u2019s petition in an order typical of that court\u2019s summary dispositions for failure to file \u201cas promptly as the circumstances allow.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>5 Cal. 4th, at 765, n. 5, 855 P.2d, at 738, n. 5. The order read in its entirety: \u201cPetition for writ of habeas corpus is DENIED. (See <em>In re Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal. 4th 750, <em>In re Robbins </em>(1998) 18 Cal. 4th 770, 780.).\u201d See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Having exhausted state postconviction remedies, Martin returned to federal court and filed an amended petition. Based upon the California Supreme Court\u2019s time-bar disposition, the District Court dismissed Martin\u2019s belatedly asserted claims as procedurally precluded. <em>Id., </em>at 27, 57. The Ninth Circuit vacated the dismissal order and remanded the case, directing the District Court to determine the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the State\u2019s time bar. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>192 Fed. Appx. 616, 618 (2006). The District Court again rejected Martin\u2019s petition, stating that \u201c[t]he California timeliness bar as set forth in ... <em>Clark/Robbins </em>is clearly defined, well established and consistently applied.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">[562 U.S. 315]</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Ninth Circuit again disagreed. Controlled by its prior decision in <em>Townsend, </em>562 F.3d, at 1207-1208, the Court of Appeals held that California\u2019s time bar \u201chas yet to be firmly defined\u201d and was not shown by the State to be \u201cconsistently applied.\u201d 357 Fed. Appx., at 794. The remand order directed the District Court to determine the merits of the claims Martin asserted in his second petition to the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">We granted certiorari, 561 U.S. 1005, 130 S. Ct. 3464, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1054 (2010), to determine the \u201cadequacy\u201d of California\u2019s practice under which a prisoner may be barred from collaterally attacking his conviction when he has \u201csubstantially delayed\u201d filing his habeas petition. Martin does not here dispute that the time limitation is an \u201cindependent\u201d state ground. See Brief in Opposition 5-6. See also <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Mueller, </em>322 F.3d 573, 582-583 (CA9 2003). Nor does he contend that he established \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>cause for the delay in asserting his claims and actual prejudice resulting from the State\u2019s alleged violation of his constitutional rights. See <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 87-91, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">\u201cA federal habeas court will not review a claim rejected by a state court \u2018if the decision of [the state] court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kindler, </em>558 U.S., at 55, 130 S. Ct. 612, 175 L. Ed. 2d 417 (quoting <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991)). The state-law ground may be a substantive rule dispositive of the case, or a procedural barrier to adjudication of the claim on the merits. See <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S., at 81-82, 90, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">Ordinarily, a state prisoner seeking federal habeas relief must first \u201cexhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts of the State,\u201d 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A), thereby affording those courts \u201cthe first opportunity to address and correct</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">[562 U.S. 316]</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">alleged violations of [the] prisoner\u2019s federal rights,\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S., at 731, 111 S.

The adequate and independent state ground doctrine furthers that objective, for without it, \u201chabeas petitioners would be able to avoid the exhaustion requirement by defaulting their federal claims in state court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 732, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640. Accordingly,  absent showings of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice,\u201d see <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S., at 84-85, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L.

A \u201crule can be \u2018firmly established\u2019 and \u2018regularly followed,\u2019 \u201d <em>Kindler </em>observed, \u201ceven if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not others.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 60, 130 S.

Ed. 2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">[562 U.S. 317]</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">California\u2019s time rule, although discretionary, meets the \u201cfirmly established\u201d criterion, as <em>Kindler </em>comprehended that requirement. The California Supreme Court, as earlier noted, framed the timeliness requirement for habeas petitioners in a trilogy of cases. See <em>supra, </em>at 312, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 68.  Those decisions instruct habeas petitioners to \u201cal-leg[e] with specificity\u201d the absence of substantial delay, good cause for delay, or eligibility for one of four exceptions to the time bar. <em>Gallego, </em>18 Cal. 4th, at 838, 959 P.2d, at 299; see <em>Robbins, </em>18 Cal. 4th, at 780, 959 P.2d, at 317.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And California\u2019s case law made it altogether plain that Martin\u2019s delay of nearly five years ranked as \u201csubstantial.\u201d See <em>Gallego, </em>18 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>4th, at 829-831, 838, and n. 13, 959 P.2d, at 293-294, 299, and n. 13 (delay of four years barred claim); <em>In re Tsaturyan, </em>No. B156012, 2002 WL 1614107, *3 (Cal.

We disagree. Indeterminate language is typical of discretionary rules. Application of those rules in particular circumstances, however, can supply the requisite clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">[562 U.S. 318]</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Congressional statutes and this Court\u2019s decisions, we note, have employed time limitations that are not stated in precise, numerical terms. Former Federal Habeas Corpus Rule 9(a), for example, set no fixed time limit on submission of habeas petitions. The Rule permitted dismissal of a state prisoner\u2019s petition when it appeared that delay in commencing litigation \u201cprejudiced [the State] in its ability to respond.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 Rule 9(a) (1994 ed.). To stave off dismissal, the petitioner had to show that he could not earlier have known, \u201cby the exercise of reasonable diligence,\u201d the grounds on which he based the petition. <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Rhines </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>544 U.S. 269, 125 S. Ct. 1528, 161 L. Ed. 2d 440 (2005), we instructed district courts, when employing stay and abeyance procedure, see <em>supra, </em>at 314, n. 3, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 69, to \u201cplace reasonable time limits on a petitioner\u2019s trip to state court and back,\u201d 544 U.S., at 278, 125 S. Ct. 1528, 161 L. Ed. 2d 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Current federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for filing a petition to one year. The clock runs from \u201cthe date on which the [supporting] facts . . . could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(4) (2006 ed., Supp. Ill) (applicable to federal prisoners); see \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) (2006 ed.) (similar provision applicable to state prisoners). \u201c[D]ue diligence,\u201d we have observed, \u201cis an inexact measure of how much delay is too much.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. 295, 309, n. 7, 125 S. Ct. 1571, 161 L. Ed. 2d 542 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). But \u201cuse of an imprecise standard,\u201d we immediately added, \u201cis no justification for depriving [a rule\u2019s] language of any meaning.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[I]t would seem particularly strange to disregard state procedural rules that are substantially similar to those to which we give full force in our own courts.\u201d <em>Kindler, </em>558 U.S., at 62, 130 S. Ct. 612, 175 L. Ed. 2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Nor is California\u2019s time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed. Each year, the California Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas petitions by citing <em>Clark </em>and <em>Robbins. </em>Brief for Appellant in</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">[562 U.S. 319]</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">No. 08-15752 (CA9), pp. 31-32. On the same day the court denied Martin\u2019s petition, it issued 21 other <em>Clark/Robbins </em>summary denials. See Brief for Habeas Corpus Resource Center as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20. In reasoned opinions, too, California courts regularly invoke <em>Clark, Rob</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>bins, </em>and <em>Gallego </em>to determine whether a habeas petition is time barred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Martin argued below that California\u2019s time bar is not regularly followed in this sense: Use of summary denials makes it \u201cimpossible to tell\u201d why the California Supreme Court \u201cdecides some delayed petitions on the merits and rejects others as untimely\u201d Brief for Appellant in No. 08-15752 (CA9), pp. 37-38. We see no reason to reject California\u2019s time bar simply because a court may opt to bypass the <em>Clark/Robbins </em>assessment and summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path. See, <em>e.g., Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 697, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984) (\u201c[A] court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient . . . [i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice . . . .\u201d); cf. <em>Ruhrgas AG </em>v. <em>Marathon Oil Co., </em>526 U.S. 574, 585, 119 S. Ct. 1563, 143 L. Ed. 2d 760 (1999) (\u201cIt is hardly novel for a federal court to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Ninth Circuit concluded that California\u2019s time bar is not consistently applied because outcomes under the rule vary from case to case. See 357 Fed. Appx., at 794. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>No. C047810, 2006 WL 950267, *2-*3 (Cal. App., Apr. 11, 2006), a one-year delay was found substantial, while in <em>In re Little, </em>No. D047468, 2008 WL 142832, *4, n. 6 (Cal. App., Jan. 16, 2008), a delay of 14 months was determined to be insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">[562 U.S. 320]</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">A discretionary rule ought not be disregarded automatically upon a showing of seeming inconsistencies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Discretion enables a court to home in on case-specific considerations and to avoid the harsh results that sometimes attend consistent application of an unyielding rule. See <em>Prihoda </em>v. <em>McCaughtry, </em>910 F.2d 1379, 1385 (CA7 1990) (\u201cUncertainty is not enough to disqualify a state\u2019s procedural ground as one \u2018adequate\u2019 under federal law. If it were, states would be induced to make their rules draconian . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">A state ground, no doubt, may be found inadequate when \u201cdiscretion has been exercised to impose novel and unforeseeable requirements without fair or substantial support in prior state law . . . .\u201d 16B C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4026, p. 386 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller); see <em>Prihoda, </em>910 F.2d, at 1383 (state ground \u201capplied infrequently, unexpectedly, or freakishly\u201d may \u201cdiscriminate] against the federal rights as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>serted\u201d and therefore rank as \u201cinadequate\u201d). Martin does not contend, however, that in his case, the California Supreme Court exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u201c[S]ound procedure often requires discretion to exact or excuse compliance with strict rules,\u201d 16B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 4028, p. 403, and we have no cause to discourage standards allowing courts to exercise such discretion. As this Court</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">[562 U.S. 321]</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">observed in Kindler, if forced to choose between mandatory rules certain to be found \u201cadequate,\u201d or more supple prescriptions that federal courts may disregard as \u201cinadequate,\u201d \u201cmany States [might] opt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs that come with plenary federal review.\u201d 558 U.S., at 61, 130 S. Ct. 612, 175 L. Ed. 2d 417. \u201cTh[at] result would be particularly unfortunate for [habeas petitioners], who would lose the opportunity to argue that a procedural default should be excused through the exercise of judicial discretion.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Today\u2019s decision, trained on California\u2019s timeliness rule for habeas petitions, leaves unaltered this Court\u2019s repeated recognition that  federal courts must carefully examine state procedural requirements to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against claims of federal rights. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Western R. Co. of Ala., </em>338 U.S. 294, 298-299, 70 S. Ct. 105, 94 L. Ed. 100 (1949); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Wechsler, </em>263 U.S. 22, 24-25, 44 S. Ct. 13, 68 L.

See also <em>Kindler, </em>558 U.S., at 65, 130 S. Ct. 612, 175 L. Ed. 2d 417 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (a state procedural ground would be inadequate if the challenger shows a \u201cpurpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees\u201d). On the record before us, however, there is no basis for concluding that California\u2019s timeliness rule operates to the particular disadvantage of petitioners asserting federal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"pAUF\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"32\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQEAAAAgAQAAAAA6EPB3AAAAkElEQVR4nOXTMQ7CMBAEwPUqFQXKg5DCzzAfoeIRfIcUqUNHgVjKLFoLmjSI6+Z057POchE+x5FfCoC/q3jbWYLAs1oyscY9IO1uWiJQCY1enyDKPC/JBghcJutrQLoPNjpQCXR7a0sQmDyZIHDuLNmAtL3a6EAl1Pe2ggRRThtbQQPS42AHB+oab1t+5le+AKE2nl4Br/TEAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"257\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">For the reasons stated, we find no inadequacy in California\u2019s timeliness rule generally or as applied in Martin\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">[562 U.S. 322]</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A_N\">.

In <em>Lee, </em>for example, the defendant unsuccessfully moved for a continuance when, for reasons unknown to him, his alibi witnesses left the courthouse the day they were scheduled to testify. This Court held inadequate to bar federal review a state court\u2019s persnickety application of a rule detailing formal requirements for continuance motions. The defendant had substantially complied with the rule\u2019s key requirement and flawless compliance would have been unavailing given the trial court\u2019s reason for denying the motion. See <em>id., </em>at 381-382, 122 S. Ct. 877, 151 L. Ed. 2d 820.
