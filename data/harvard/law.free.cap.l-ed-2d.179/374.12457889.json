Jackson raised a <em>Batson </em>claim, asserting that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to exclude black prospective jurors on the basis of their race. See <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986). Two of three black jurors had been struck; the third served on the jury. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-27\">[562 U.S. 595]</p>\n<p id=\"b473-28\">Jackson\u2019s counsel did not object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>when the prosecutor struck the first of the black jurors, Juror S. Counsel later explained that he did not make a \u201cmotion at that time\u201d because he thought the excusal of Juror S \u201cwas a close call.\u201d After the prosecutor sought to dismiss the second juror, Juror J, Jackson\u2019s counsel made the <em>Batson </em>motion challenging both strikes. Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB (ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 7, pp. 76-77 (hereinafter Document 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for striking each juror: Juror S had stated that from the ages of 16 to 30 years old, he was frequently stopped by California police officers because\u2014in his view\u2014of his race and age. As the prosecutor put it, \u201cWhether or not he still harbors any animosity is not something I wanted to roll the dice with.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 78; Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB (ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 10, pp. 57-58, 98-100 (hereinafter Document 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The prosecutor stated that he struck Juror J because she had a master\u2019s degree in social work, and had interned at the county jail, \u201cprobably in the psych unit as a sociologist of some sort.\u201d The prosecutor explained that he dismissed her \u201cbased on her educational background,\u201d stating that he does not \u201clike to keep social workers.\u201d Document 7, at 78-79; Document 10, at 188-189; App. to Pet. for Cert. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Jackson\u2019s counsel expressly disagreed only with the prosecutor\u2019s explanation for the strike of Juror J, see <em>id., </em>at 22-23, 47, arguing that removing her on the basis of her educational background was \u201c \u2018itself invidious discrimination.\u2019 \u201d The prosecutor responded that he was not aware that social workers were a \u201cprotected class.\u201d As for Juror S, Jackson\u2019s counsel explained that he \u201clet [Juror S] slide\u201d because he anticipated the prosecutor\u2019s response and, in any event, he \u201conly need[ed] one to establish the grounds for\u201d a <em>Batson </em>motion. After listening to each side\u2019s arguments, the trial court denied Jackson\u2019s motion. Document 7, at 78-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">[562 U.S. 596]</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Jackson renewed his <em>Batson </em>claim on direct appeal, arguing that a comparative juror analysis revealed that the prosecutor\u2019s explanations were pretextual. With respect to Juror S, Jackson argued that a nonblack juror\u2014Juror 8\u2014also had negative experiences with law enforcement but remained on the jury. App. to Pet. for Cert. 47-48. Juror 8 stated during jury selection that he had been stopped while driving in Illinois several years earlier as part of what he believed to be a \u201cscam\u201d by Illinois police targeting drivers with California license plates. Juror 8 also complained that he had been disappointed by the failure of law enforcement officers to investigate the burglary of his car. Document 10, at 26-27, 56-57, 95-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">With respect to Juror J, Jackson claimed that the prosecutor asked follow-up questions of several white jurors when he was concerned about their educational backgrounds, but struck Juror J without asking her any questions about her degree in social work. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">The California Court of Appeal upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the <em>Batson </em>motion and affirmed Jackson\u2019s convictions. The appellate court explained that \u201c [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>on this issue is reviewed for substantial evidence,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (internal quotation marks omitted), which the California courts have characterized as equivalent to the \u201cclear error\u201d standard employed by federal courts, see, <em>e.g., People </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>14 Cal. 4th 155, 196, 926 P.2d 365, 389 (1996). With respect to whether the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were pretextual, the court explained that it \u201cgive[s] great deference to the trial court\u2019s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">After comparing Juror S to Juror 8, the court concluded that \u201cJuror 8\u2019s negative experience out of state and the car burglary is not comparable to [Juror S\u2019s] 14 years of perceived harassment by law enforcement based in part on race.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 48. As for Juror J, the court recognized that the prosecutor\u2019s dismissal was based on her social services</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">[562 U.S. 597]</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">background\u2014\u201ca proper race-neutral reason\u201d\u2014and that this explained his different treatment of jurors with \u201cbackgrounds in law, bio-chemistry or environmental engineering.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 49. The court also noted that the \u201cprosecutor focused on [Juror J\u2019s] internship experience\u201d at the county jail. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">After the California Supreme Court denied Jackson\u2019s petition for review, Jackson sought federal habeas relief. The Federal District Court properly recognized that review of Jackson\u2019s claim was governed by  the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). That law provides, in pertinent part, that federal habeas relief may not be granted unless the state-court adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). After considering the State Court of Appeal decision and reviewing the record evidence, the District Court held that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s findings were not unreasonable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. The District Court therefore denied Jackson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in a three-paragraph unpublished memorandum opinion. 389 Fed. Appx. 640 (2010). In so doing, the court did not discuss any specific facts or mention the reasoning of the other three courts that had rejected Jackson\u2019s claim. Instead, after setting forth the basic background legal principles in the first two paragraphs, the Court of Appeals offered a one-sentence conclusory explanation for its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s proffered race-neutral bases for peremptorily striking the two African-American jurors were not sufficient to counter the evidence of purposeful discrimination in light of the fact that two out of three prospective African-American jurors were stricken, and the record reflected different treatment of comparably situated jurors.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 641.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">[562 U.S. 598]</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">That decision is as inexplicable as it is unexplained. It is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">The <em>Batson </em>issue before us turns largely on an \u201cevaluation of credibility.\u201d 476 U.S., at 98, n. 21, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69.  The trial court\u2019s determination is entitled to \u201cgreat deference,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and \u201cmust be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous,\u201d <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>552 U.S. 472, 477, 128 S. Ct. 1203, 170 L. Ed. 2d 175 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>That is the standard on direct review.  On federal habeas review, AEDPA \u201cimposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings\u201d and \u201cdemands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Renico </em>v. <em>Lett, </em>559 U.S. 766, 773, 130 S. Ct. 1855, 176 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here the trial court credited the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations, and the California Court of Appeal carefully reviewed the record at some length in upholding the trial court\u2019s findings. The state appellate court\u2019s decision was plainly not unreasonable. There was simply no basis for the Ninth Circuit to reach the opposite conclusion, particularly in such a dismissive manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
