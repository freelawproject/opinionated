Montana alleges that Wyoming has breached Article V( A) of the Compact by allowing its pre-1950 water appropriators to increase their net water consumption by improving the efficiency of their irrigation systems. The new systems, Montana alleges, employ sprinklers that reduce the amount of wastewater returned to the river, thus depriving Montana\u2019s downstream pre-1950 appropriators of water to which they are entitled. The Special Master has filed a First Interim Report determining, as relevant here, that Montana\u2019s allegation fails to state a claim because more efficient irrigation systems are permissible under the Compact so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate the same acreage watered in 1950. We agree with the Special Master and overrule Montana\u2019s exception to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">From its headwaters in Wyoming, the Yellowstone River flows nearly 700 miles northeast into Montana and then North Dakota, where it joins the Missouri River. Several of its tributaries, including the Clarks Fork, Tongue, Powder, and Bighorn Rivers, also begin in Wyoming and cross into Montana before joining the main stem of the Yellowstone</p>\n<p id=\"AXc1\">[563 U.S. 372]</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">River. This river system\u2019s monthly and annual flows, which are dictated largely by snow melt, vary widely. In 1964, for example, the flow in the Tongue and Powder Rivers was nearly 10 times the 1961 flow. App. 936. As the rivers came into heavy use for irrigation, it became expedient to build water storage facilities for preserving the heaviest flows. See First Interim Report of Special Master 6 (hereinafter Report).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">Before funding new water storage facilities, Congress sought agreement as to the allocation of the Yellowstone River system among Wyoming, Montana, and North Dakota. In 1932, Congress granted the States permission to negotiate a compact. See Act of June 14, 1932, ch. 253, 47 Stat. 306. Draft compacts were produced in 1935, 1942, and 1944, but none was fully agreed upon. Finally, in 1951 Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota ratified the Yellowstone River Compact, and Congress consented to it. Act of Oct. 30, 1951, 65 Stat. 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">The Yellowstone River Compact divides water into three tiers of priority. First, Article V(A) provides: \u201cAppro-priative rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellow-stone River System existing in each signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be enjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 666. Second, Article V(B) allocates to each State the \u201cquantity of that water as shall be necessary to provide supplemental water supplies\u201d for the pre-1950 uses protected by Article V(A). <em>Ibid. </em>Third, \u201cthe remainder of the unused and unappropriated water\u201d of each tributary is divided by percentage: Wyoming receives 60% of the remaining water in the Clarks Fork River, 80% in the Bighorn River, 40% in the Tongue River, and 42% in the Powder River; the rest goes to Montana. <em>Id., </em>at 666-667.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-15\">In February 2008, we granted Mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>tana leave to file a bill of complaint against Wyoming for breach of the Compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">[563 U.S. 373]</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">552 U.S. 1175, 128 S. Ct. 1332, 170 L. Ed. 2d 56. Montana alleged that Wyoming had breached the Compact by consuming more than its share of the Tongue and Powder Rivers. Bill of Complaint 3, \u00b68. Specifically, Montana claimed that Wyoming was appropriating water for a number of new, post-1950 uses: irrigating new acreage; building new storage facilities; conducting new groundwater pumping; and increasing consumption on existing agricultural acreage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 3-4, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12. According to Montana\u2019s complaint, the Compact did not permit Wyoming to use water for any of these practices as long as Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users\u2019 rights remained unfulfilled. <em>Id., </em>at 3, \u00b68.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">In response, Wyoming filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. We appointed a Special Master and referred the motion to him. 555 U.S. 968, 129 S. Ct. 480, 172 L. Ed. 2d 325 (2008). After briefing and argument, the Special Master recommended that we deny Wyoming\u2019s motion, because at least some of Montana\u2019s allegations state a claim for relief. The Special Master found that \u201cArticle V of the Compact protects pre-1950 appropriations in Montana from new surface and groundwater diversions in Wyoming, whether for direct use or for storage, that prevent adequate water from reaching Montana to satisfy those pre-1950 appropriations.\u201d Report 14-15. But the Special Master agreed with Wyoming that Montana\u2019s allegations regarding \u201cefficiency improvements by pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming\u201d do not state a claim for relief. <em>Id., </em>at 15. The States did not object to most of the Special Master\u2019s findings, and we have issued orders accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">[563 U.S. 374]</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">See 562 U.S. 958, 131 S. Ct. 497, 178 L. Ed. 2d 284 (2010); 562 U.S. 979, 131 S. Ct. 442, 178 L. Ed. 2d 319 (2010). Montana has filed an exception to the Special Master\u2019s rejection of its increased-efficiency allegation. It is this exception that is before us.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Article V(A) of the Compact states that \u201c[ajppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of [water] . . . existing in each signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be enjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d Montana claims that its pre-1950 appropriators\u2019 rights are not \u201ccontinu[ing] to be enjoyed\u201d because upstream pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming have increased their consumption by switching from flood to sprinkler irrigation. Montana alleges that sprinkler systems increase crop consumption of water and decrease the volume of runoff and seepage that returns to the Tongue and Powder rivers by 25% <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>or more.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Montana\u2019s Exception and Brief 3 (hereinafter Brief for Montana). As a result, even if Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water users divert the same quantity of water as before, less water reaches Montana. According to Montana, Article V(A) prohibits Wyoming from allowing this practice when it deprives Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users of their full water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The question, therefore, is whether Article V(A) allows Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water users\u2014diverting the same quantity of water for the same irrigation purpose and acreage as before 1950\u2014to increase their consumption of water by</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">[563 U.S. 375]</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">improving their irrigation systems even if it reduces the flow of water to Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users. Montana makes two basic arguments: that background principles of appropriation law, to the extent they are incorporated into the Compact, do not allow such an increase in consumption; and that even if they do, the terms of the Compact amended those principles in Montana\u2019s favor. The Special Master rejected these arguments, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Because Article V(A) of the Compact protects \u201c[alppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of [water]\u201d as of 1950 \u201cin accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation,\u201d we begin with an overview of appropriation doctrine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the Special Master explained, if \u201c[a]p-propriation law clearly proscribe [s] increases in consumption on existing acreage to the detriment of downstream appropriators, the Compact arguably would prohibit Wyoming from allowing its appropriators to make such increases to the detriment of Montana\u2019s pre-1950 uses.\u201d Report 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">As is typical west of the 100th meridian, the doctrine of appropriation has governed water rights in Montana and Wyoming since the 1800\u2019s. See, <em>e.g., Basey </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>20 Wall. 670, 683, 22 L. Ed. 452 (1875). As relevant here,  the doctrine provides that rights to water for irrigation are perfected and enforced in order of seniority, starting with the first person</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">[563 U.S. 376]</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">to divert water from a natural stream and apply it to a beneficial use (or to begin such a project, if diligently completed). See <em>Hinderlider </em>v. <em>La Plata River &amp; Cherry Creek Ditch Co., </em>304 U.S. 92, 98, 58 S. Ct. 803, 82 L. Ed. 1202 (1938); <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>298 U.S. 558, 565-566, 56 S. Ct. 848, 80 L. Ed. 1331 (1936); Wyo. Const., Art. 8, \u00a7 3 (\u201cPriority of appropriation for beneficial uses shall give the better right\u201d). The scope of the right is limited by the concept of \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d That concept restricts a farmer \u201cto the amount of water that is necessary to irrigate his land by making a reasonable use of the water.\u201d 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>C. Kinney, Law of Irrigation and Water Rights \u00a7 586, pp. 1007-1008 (2d ed. 1912) (hereinafter Kinney) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Tintinger, </em>45 Mont. 154, 176-178, 122 P. 575, 583 (1912); <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>John Whitaker Ranch Co., </em>54 Wyo. 367, 376-380, 92 P.2d 568, 570-571 (1939). Once such a water right is perfected, it is senior to any later appropriators\u2019 rights and may be fulfilled entirely before those junior appropriators get any water at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">For our purposes, Montana\u2019s pre-1950 water users are similar to junior appropriators. As between the States, the Compact assigned the same seniority level to all pre-1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. See Brief for Montana 23; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>12. But as Montana concedes, precisely because of this equal seniority, its downstream pre-1950 users cannot stop Wyoming\u2019s upstream pre-1950 users from fully exercising their water rights. Thus, when the rivers are low, Montana\u2019s downstream pre-1950 users might get no water at all because the equally senior users upstream in Wyoming may lawfully consume all of the water. Tr. of Oral Arg. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Junior appropriators are not completely without rights, however.  As they come online, appropriators acquire rights to the stream basically as it exists when they find it. See 2 Kinney \u00a7 803, at 1403-1404. Accordingly, subject to the fulfillment of all senior users\u2019 existing rights, under the no-injury</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">[563 U.S. 377]</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">rule junior users can prevent senior users from enlarging their rights to the junior users\u2019 detriment. 1 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 573 (1971) (hereinafter Hutchins).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users can therefore \u201cinsist that [Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users] coniine themselves strictly within the rights which the law gives them, that is, to the amount of water within the extent of their appropriation which they actually apply to some beneficial use.\u201d 2 Kinney \u00a7 784, at 1366. That general proposition is undisputed; the dispute here is in its application. Is a switch to more efficient irrigation with less return flow within the extent of Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users\u2019 existing appropriative rights, or is it an improper enlargement of that right to the detriment of Montana\u2019s pre-1950 water users?</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">As the Special Master observed, the law of return flows is an unclear area of appropriation doctrine. Report 65 (citing Trelease, Reclamation Water Rights, 32 Rocky Mt. L. Rev. 464, 469 (1960)). The States have not directed us to any case on all fours with this one. Indeed, \u201c[n]o western state court appears to have conclusively answered the question.\u201d Report 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Despite the lack of clarity, the Special Master found several reasons to conclude that Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users may switch to sprinkler irrigation. He found that the scope of the original appropriative right includes such a change so long as no additional water is diverted from the stream and the conserved water is used on the same acreage for the same agricultural purpose as before. We agree with the Special Master.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">[563 U.S. 378]</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">First, although the no-injury rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>prevents appropriators from making certain water-right changes that would harm other appropriators, a change in irrigation methods does not appear to run afoul of that rule in Montana and Wyoming. See <em>id., </em>at 69.  Because each new appropriator is entitled to the stream as it exists when he finds it, the general rule is that \u201cif a change in these conditions is made by [a senior] appropriator, which interferes with the flow of the water to the material injury of [the junior appropriator\u2019s] rights, he may justly complain.\u201d 2 Kinney \u00a7 803, at 1404.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">But the no-injury rule is not absolute; it generally concerns changes in the location of the diversion and the place or purpose of use. <em>Quigley </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>110 Mont. 495, 505, 103 P.2d 1067, 1072 (1940) (\u201c[P]lace of diversion, or place or purpose of use, may be changed only if others are not thereby injured\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also 1 S. Wiel, Water Rights in the Western States \u00a7 498, p. 532 (3d ed. 1911) (hereinafter Wiel); Mont. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 89-803 (1947); Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a741-3-104 (1977). Accordingly,  certain types of changes can occur even though they may harm downstream appropriators. See D. Getches,</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">[563 U.S. 379]</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Water Law in a Nutshell 175 (4th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Getches). For instance, an appropriator may increase his consumption by changing to a more water-intensive crop so long as he makes no change in acreage irrigated or amount of water diverted. See <em>id., </em>at 183; <em>East Bench Irrig. Co. </em>v. <em>Deseret Irrig. Co., </em>2 Utah 2d 170, 179, 271 P.2d 449, 455 (1954) (assuming that farmers may \u201clegally increase the quantity of water consumed in irrigating their lands by changing to more water consuming crops\u201d and adding that \u201cit would be difficult to prevent . . . such increased consumptive use\u201d). Ordinary, day-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not violate the no-injury rule. See, <em>e.g., </em>1 Wiel \u00a7 56, at 51 (\u201cWould the fact that my pump has for years dripped water onto a neighbor\u2019s ground give him a right to say that my pump must go on leaking?\u201d). Consumption can even be increased by adding farm acreage, so long as that was part of the plan from the start, and diligently pursued through the years. See <em>Van Tassel Real Estate &amp; Livestock Co. </em>v. <em>Cheyenne, </em>49 Wyo. 333, 357-359, 54 P.2d 906, 913 (1936) <em>(per curiam); </em>1 Hutchins 377-378; <em>St. Onge </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>76 Mont. 1, 22-24, 245 P. 532, 539 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Improvements to irrigation systems seem to be the sort of changes that fall outside the no-injury rule as it exists in Montana and Wyoming. Those changes are not to the \u201cplace of diversion, or place or purpose of use,\u201d <em>Quigley, supra, </em>at 505, 103 P.2d, at 1072, and thus seem to be excluded, much like crop changes or day-to-day irriga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>tion adjustments or repairs. This is also consistent with the fact that by 1950 both States had statutes regulating certain changes to water rights, but neither required farmers to take official action before adjusting irrigation methods.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See Report 69-70, 87; <em>id., </em>at 69 (they \u201cdo not generally have procedures for overseeing</p>\n<p id=\"aqnm-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 380]</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">changes in water efficiencies stemming from crop shifts or irrigation improvements where there are no formal changes in the underlying water rights\u201d). Like the Special Master, we find this to be persuasive evidence that the States considered such changes permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Montana argues that, regardless of the statutes, private lawsuits could be brought to challenge such efficiency changes. But it has not provided a single example from either State. Instead, Montana and Wyoming cases typically describe the no-injury rule as applying to changes in point of diversion, purpose of use, and place of use. See, <em>e.g., Maclay </em>v. <em>Missoula Irrig. Dist., </em>90 Mont. 344, 355-357, 3 P.2d 286, 291 (1931); <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Rawlins, </em>594 P.2d 951, 955 (Wyo. 1979). The abundance of litigation over such changes\u2014and the absence of any litigation over the sort of change at issue here\u2014strongly implies that irrigation efficiency improvements do not violate the no-injury rule and were considered within the scope of the original appropriative right.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The doctrine of recapture also supports treating improvements in irrigation efficiency as within the original appropriative right.  Under this doctrine, an appropriator who has diverted water for irrigation purposes has the right to recapture and reuse his own runoff and seepage water before it escapes his control or his property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An appropriator is entitled to the \u201cexclusive control [of his appropriated water] so long as he is able and willing to apply it to beneficial uses, and such right extends to what is commonly known as wastage from surface run-off and deep percolation, necessarily incident to practical irrigation.\u201d <em>Ide </em>v. <em>United States, </em>263 U.S. 497, 506, 44 S. Ct. 182, 68 L. Ed. 407 (1924) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Long, </em>160 Ariz. 429, 437-438,</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">[563 U.S. 381]</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">773 P.2d 988, 996-997 (1989) (\u201cNo appropriator can compel any other appropriator to continue the waste of water which benefits the former. If the senior appropriator, through scientific and technical advances, can utilize his water so that none is wasted, no other appropriator can complain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">Montana contends that this rule does not apply when the runoff or seepage water would, if not recaptured, return to the same stream from which it was originally drawn. There is some support for Montana\u2019s position\u2014that a beneficial user may not reuse water at all, even while it is still on his property, if it otherwise would flow back to the same stream\u2014especially in Utah and Colorado cases. See <em>Deseret Irrig. Co., supra, </em>at 180-182, 271 P.2d, at 456-457; <em>Estate of Steed </em>v. <em>New Escalante Irrig. Co., </em>846 P.2d 1223, 1226 (Utah 1992); <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Ramsay, </em>55 Colo. 244, 252-258, 133 P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>1107, 1110-1111 (1913).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But other authorities draw no such exception based on where the runoff or seepage is heading. See 2 Hutchins 580-582 (asserting that, even in Utah, \u201cwhere the original appropriator retains possession and control of the waste and seepage water from irrigation of his lands, he is entitled to reuse these waters for his own benefit and need not return them <em>to the channel from which they were diverted\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); Getches 139-145; <em>Woolman </em>v. <em>Garringer, </em>1 Mont. 535 (1872). And Montana cites no case from either State here in which a court has recognized, much less found controlling, the idea that a water user may not reuse his own wastewater while it is still on his property simply because it otherwise would return to the original stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">[563 U.S. 382]</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In fact, Montana and Wyoming appear to apply, without qualification, the basic doctrine that the original appropriator may freely recapture his used water while it remains on his property and reuse it for the same purpose on the same land. For example, in <em>Binning </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>55 Wyo. 451, 102 P.2d 54 (1940), a man was diverting water from a creek fed largely by irrigation runoff and seepage from Binning\u2019s property. Although the court found that the man had a right to that water once Binning\u2019s runoff and seepage had become a natural stream, it noted that his right remained subject to Binning\u2019s right \u201cto use the water above mentioned for beneficial purposes upon the land for which the seepage water was [originally] appropriated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 477, 102 P.2d, at 63. In a later case, the court explained that the man could not \u201csecure a permanent right to continue to receive the water\u201d because Binning \u201cmight find better ways of utilizing the water on the same land so that less waste and seepage would occur.\u201d <em>Bower </em>v. <em>Big Horn Canal Assn., </em>77 Wyo. 80, 101, 307 P.2d 593, 601 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Similarly, in <em>Bower </em>v. <em>Big Horn Canal Assn., </em>the court held that Bower could appropriate water as it seeped across his property from the Big Horn Canal toward a nearby river. <em>Id., </em>at 102-104, 307 P.2d, at 602. The court added, however, that Bower\u2019s right was subject always to the Big Horn Canal\u2019s right: \u201cNo appropriator can compel any other appropriator to continue the waste of water which benefits the former.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 101, 307 P.2d, at 601. Importantly, the court noted that \u201c [i]f the senior appropriator by a different method of irrigation can so utilize his water that it is all consumed in transpiration and consumptive use and no waste water returns by seepage or percolation to the river, no other appropriator can complain.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Finally, in <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>610 P.2d 17 (Wyo. 1980), water was seeping from Fuss\u2019 property and into a pit in a public right of way. Franks was the first to appropriate the water</p>\n<p id=\"ahme-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 383]</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">from the pit. The court upheld Franks\u2019 appropriation right because the water had already escaped from Fuss\u2019 property. The court said that the \u201cowner of land upon which seepage or waste water rises has the right to use and reuse\u2014 capture and recapture\u2014such waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>waters,\u201d but only before the water escapes his land, and \u201cfor use only upon the land for which the water forming the seepage was originally appropriated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted). Fuss thus had no superior right to the water that had left his property, and especially not for reuse on other lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">The law in Montana is similar. The Montana Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe general rule ... is that the owner of the right to use the water\u2014his private property while in his possession,\u2014may collect it, recapture it, before it leaves his possession.\u201d <em>Rock Creek Ditch &amp; Flume Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>93 Mont. 248, 268, 17 P.2d 1074, 1080 (1933); see also A. Stone, Montana Water Law 66 (1994) (noting that, according to the \u201cearly cases,\u201d while \u201cthe water is still seeping and running off one\u2019s own land, the landowner is free to recapture and further use it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The right of recapture discussed in these authorities is broad. As the Special Master recognized, the \u201clanguage of the Wyoming Supreme Court . . . was expansive\u201d in <em>Binning, Bower, </em>and <em>Fuss, </em>and \u201call appear to hold that an appropriator in Wyoming can increase his water use efficiency by recovering runoff on his property or through other means so long as the increased consumption is on the same land to which the appropriative right attaches.\u201d Report 81; see also <em>id., </em>at 78-85; Thompson, Case Note, Water Law\u2014Reusing Irrigation Waste Water on Different Lands: A Warning To Get a New Permit, Fuss v. Franks, 610 P.2d 17 (Wyo. 1980), 16 Land &amp; Water L. Rev. 71, 76 (1981) (concluding that in Wyoming, \u201ca prior appropriator can at anytime, utilize irrigation methods that are totally consumptive, such as pumping the collected waste water back to the top of the</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">[563 U.S. 384]</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">field or installing a sprinkler system, thereby eliminating all waste of water\u201d); Jones, Note, Rights of the Original Appropriator To Recapture Water Used In Irrigation, 11 Wyo. L. J. 39 (1956); Wille, Note, The Right to Use Waste Water Before It Reenters the Stream, 12 Wyo. L. J. 47, 48 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">The Wyoming and Montana doctrine of recapture strongly suggests that improvements in irrigation efficiency are within the original appro-priative right of Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water users. By using sprinklers rather than flood irrigation, those water users effectively recapture water. The sprinklers, by reducing loss due to seepage and runoff, operate much like, if more efficiently than, cruder recapture systems involving ditches or pits. They are simply different mechanisms for increasing the volume of water available to the crops without changing the amount of diversion. <em>Binning, Bower, </em>and <em>Fuss </em>expressly acknowledged that in such situations, lower appropriators who have perfected their own appropria-tive rights are nonetheless at the mercy of the property owners from which their water flows. See 55 Wyo., at 474-477, 102 P.2d, at 63; 77 Wyo., at 100-104, 307 P.2d, at 601-602; 610 P.2d, at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Our conclusion is consistent with that of water law scholars who have considered the specific question presented in this case. One scholar asserted: \u201c[0]f course, increasing efficiency at one site may reduce the amount of water available to downstream users who may rely on return flows from other users. [Wyoming] law, however, does not preclude more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>efficient uses merely because a downstream user may be injured.\u201d Squil-lace, A Critical Look at Wyoming Water Law, 24 Land &amp; Water L. Rev. 307, 331 (1989); see <em>ibid., </em>n. 156 (\u201cFor example, a farmer who traditionally consumes only 50% of the water applied to his land is free to change his crop or method of applying water so as to increase his consumption to 60%\u201d); see also Thompson, <em>supra, </em>at 76 (\u201c[A]</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">[563 U.S. 385]</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">prior appropriator can at anytime . . . instal[i] a sprinkler system, thereby eliminating all waste of water\u201d). And a national hornbook on water law has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-6\">\u201cThe rule allowing recapture and reuse of salvaged water on the original land can result in more water being consumed. For instance, if a water user is consuming less than the permitted amount of water and plants a more water-intensive crop or puts in a more efficient irrigation system, most or all of the water that had previously been returned to the stream might be consumed. This can deprive other appropriators of water on which they depend but it is allowed since it is technically within the terms of the original appropriation.\u201d Getches 143-144.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Montana has not identified any scholars who have reached the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">For all of these reasons, we hold that the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and Montana allows appropriators to improve their irrigation systems, even to the detriment of downstream appropriators. We readily acknowledge that this area of law is far from clear. See <em>supra, </em>at 377, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 807. But the apparent scope of the no-injury rule in Wyoming and Montana, the doctrine of recapture and its broad reach in Wyoming and Montana case law, and the specific conclusions of water law scholars all point in the same direction, which also comports with the Special Master\u2019s exhaustive discussion and findings. Accordingly, if Article V(A) simply incorporates background principles of appropriation law, it allows Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water users to improve their irrigation efficiency, even to the detriment of Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Montana, however, takes another tack. It argues that even if background principles of appropriation law do not support its position, Article V(A) of the Compact does not</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">[563 U.S. 386]</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">protect the full scope of ordinary appropria-tive rights. Montana claims that the Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cbeneficial use\u201d restricts the scope of protected pre-1950 appropriative rights to the net volume of water that was actually being consumed in 1950. We agree with the Special Master that this argument also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">Article V(A) protects \u201c[a]ppropria-tive rights to the beneficial uses of. . . water.\u201d \u201cBeneficial use,\u201d in turn, is defined in Article II(H) as \u201cthat use by which the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully employed by the activities of man.\u201d 65 Stat. 665. Montana contends that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d is thus defined as the <em>amount of </em>depletion. According to Montana, any activity that increases pre-1950 water users\u2019 depletions in Wyoming beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds the scope of the appropriative rights that Article V(A) protects. See Brief for Montana 25-28. On this basis, Montana asserts that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>pact requires (subject to river conditions) that the same quantity of water that was reaching Montana as of January 1, 1950, continue to do so. <em>Id., </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We acknowledge that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d refers to a type of use that involves some depletion, as all irrigation does. See Report 61. The part of the Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cbeneficial use\u201d that refers to depletion\u2014\u201cthat use by which the water supply ... is depleted\u201d\u2014is fairly clear. It begins with \u201cthat use,\u201d and the words that follow merely explain that \u201cthat use\u201d must be a use that \u201cdeplete [s]\u201d the \u201cwater supply.\u201d Nothing in the language suggests that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d means a measure of the <em>amount </em>of water depleted. A \u201cbeneficial use\u201d within the meaning of the Compact, therefore, is a <em>type </em>of use that depletes the water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">This plain reading makes sense in light of the circumstances existing in the signatory States when the Compact was drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory preference</p>\n<p id=\"AOaO\">[563 U.S. 387]</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">for irrigation, a type of depletive use, over power generation, a nondepletive use. Wyo. Comp. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 71-402 (1945). It makes sense that the Compact would have been written to protect the irrigation uses that were legislatively favored and represented the predominant use of the Yellowstone River system. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-47; 65 Stat. 663 (Compact Preamble) (noting that the Compact recognizes \u201cthe great importance of water for irrigation in the signatory States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Montana\u2019s reading of the Compact, by contrast, does not follow from the text and would drastically redefine the term \u201cbeneficial use\u201d from its longstanding meaning. The amount of water put to \u201cbeneficial use\u201d has never been defined by net water consumption. The quantity of water \u201cbeneficially used\u201d in irrigation, for example, has always included some measure of necessary loss such as runoff, evaporation, deep percolation, leakage, and seepage (regardless of whether any of it returns to the stream). So,  water put to \u201c[b]enefi-cial use is not what is actually consumed but what is actually necessary in good faith.\u201d 1 Wiel \u00a7 481, at 509; see also Trelease, The Concept of Reasonable Beneficial Use in the Law of Surface Streams, 12 Wyo. L. J. 1, 10 (1957) (listing irrigation as a beneficial use and noting that \u201cthe method of application, by flooding, channeling, or sprinkling, is immaterial\u201d); J. Sax, B. Thompson, J. Leshy, &amp; R. Abrams, Legal Control of Water Resources 131 (4th ed. 2006) (discussing normal irrigation practices and observing that the amount of water put to beneficial use \u201cis often considerably more than the quantum actually consumed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">If the Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cbeneficial use\u201d were meant to drastically redefine the term into shorthand for net water consumption, we would expect far more clarity. For example, the Compact could have stated that it would protect \u201conly \u2018the amount of water <em>consumed </em>for a beneficial use in each signatory state as of January 1, 1950.\u2019 \u201d Report 60. Or it could have defined \u201cbeneficial use\u201d as the <em>\u201cvolume </em>by</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">[563 U.S. 388]</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">which the water supply ... is depleted.\u201d Moreover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of ordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A), which expressly states that \u201cthe laws governing the acquisition and use of water under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>the doctrine of appropriation\u201d control, would make little sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">We agree with the Special Master that the definition of beneficial use in the Compact is unremarkable. Article V(A) does not change the scope of the pre-1950 appropriative rights that it protects in both States.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Finally, if Article V(A) were intended to guarantee Montana a set quantity of water, it could have done so as plainly as other compacts that do just that. By 1950, Wyoming itself had entered into at least one compact that defined water rights in terms of depletion. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 apportioned 7,500,000 acre-feet of water per year for \u201cthe exclusive beneficial consumptive use\u201d of several upstream States, including Wyoming. National Resources Planning Bd., Water Resources Comm., Interstate Water Compacts, 1785-1941, p. 7 (1942). That compact specifically added that \u201c[t]he States of the Upper Division will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to be depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre feet for any period of ten consecutive years . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 8. See also Republican River Compact (1943), Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 82a-518 (1997) (allocating water by the acre-foot for beneficial consumptive use in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado). And, even here in the Yellowstone River Compact, Article V(B) unambiguously apportions the third tier of Yellowstone River system water by percentage. 65 Stat. 666. The notion that Article V(A) accomplishes essentially the same sort of depletive allocation with language that has a different and longstanding meaning is simply unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">[563 U.S. 389]</p>\n<p id=\"pAfqe\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"29\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAPIAAAAdAQAAAAC4AQxeAAAAhElEQVR4nO3RsRHDIAwFUKGjjp3aLjIKA3gwr+Bt5C5jsIILdwSls3T8O1K4jbr3BTp0kB7qqoUw9etn/8NvE4LL6k4jOIpYhAg6x2xZi500+5VaCNPTPxfAtPkIUafBJgIk1tdiNxBcUnIrA0I9y3hF2mLnUC0hxO3/o4cn4P78f79XX37JgQmiNQSzAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"242\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">We conclude that the plain terms of the Compact protect ordinary \u201c[a]p-propriative rights to the beneficial uses of [water] . . . existing in each signatory State as of January 1, 1950.\u201d Art. V(A), <em>ibid. </em>And the best evidence we have shows that the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and Montana allows appropriators to improve the efficiency of their irrigation systems, even to the detriment of downstream appropriators. Montana\u2019s allegation that Wyoming has breached Article V(A) of the Compact by allowing its pre-1950 water users to increase their irrigation efficiency thus fails to state a claim. Accordingly, Montana\u2019s first exception to the Special Master\u2019s First Interim Report is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-12\">. Montana has since clarified that increased consumption on existing acreage refers to the use of more efficient irrigation systems. The \u201cefficiency\u201d of irrigation for our purposes refers to the amount of wastewater that is lost, for example, to evaporation, seepage, runoff, or deep percolation. Some of the lost water returns to the river and is later available for downstream users. A more efficient irrigation system loses less water; thus, though it may draw the same volume of water from the river, <em>net </em>water consumption is increased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b903-13\">. Montana also raised an exception to the Special Master\u2019s finding that if Montana can remedy the shortage of water to its pre-1950 users by curtailing its post-1950 uses without \u201cprejudicfing] Montana\u2019s other rights under the Compact,\u201d then an intrastate remedy is \u201cthe appropriate solution.\u201d Report 15. We recommitted this exception to the Special Master. 562 U.S. 958, 131 S. Ct. 497, 178 L. Ed. 2d 284 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b904-13\">. For purposes of resolving Wyoming\u2019s motion to dismiss, we take as true Montana\u2019s allegation that the new sprinkler systems actually reduce return flow to the rivers.

As with all contracts, we interpret the Compact according to the intent of the parties, here the signatory States. We thus look primarily to the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and Montana, but, like the States, we also look to Western water law more generally and authorities from before and after 1950. The States appear to have assumed that the doctrine has not changed in a way directly relevant here. We therefore do not decide whether Article V(A) intended to freeze appropriation law as it stood in 1949, or whether it incorporates the evolution of the doctrine over time, allowing Compact-protected rights to grow or shrink accordingly. We resolve the matter of Montana\u2019s exception without prejudice to that issue. See Report 39-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b905-15\">. The lack of clarity in this area of water law highlights the sensitive nature of our inquiry and counsels caution. Our original jurisdiction over cases between States brings us this dispute between Montana and Wyoming about the meaning of their congressionally approved Yellowstone River Compact. See U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 2; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a). Yet, because the Compact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>references and the parties direct us to principles of appropriation doctrine, we find ourselves immersed in state water law. See n. 4, <em>supra. </em>Our assessment of the scope of these water rights is merely a federal court\u2019s description of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">The highest court of each State, of course, remains \u201cthe final arbiter of what is state law.\u2019\u2019 <em>West </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>311 U.S. 223, 236, 61 S.

For purposes of the Compact, Wyoming may lay claim only to its beneficial users\u2019 net consumption of water, that is, the volume of water diverted from the river minus the volume that flows (or seeps) back into the river\u2019s channel.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">This interpretation, and only this interpretation, gives meaning to the definition\u2019s use of the word \u201cdepleted.\u201d I cannot write off as an accident the choice of this word rather than the word consistently used elsewhere in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the Compact: \u201cdiverted.\u201d See <em>Sosa </em>v. <em>Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 711, n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 2739, 159 L. Ed. 2d 718 (2004). The Compact\u2019s authors knew how to use \u201cdiverted\u201d and \u201cdiversion\u201d when they wanted to. Those two words appear repeatedly in other provisions of the Compact, see Arts. II(G); V(B), (C); VII(A), (C), (D), 65 Stat. 665-668; and the Compact defines them in the sentence immediately preceding the definition of \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d See Art. IKG), <em>id., </em>at 665. But the Compact\u2019s authors chose to define beneficial use in terms of <em>deple</em>tion\u2014the first and only time the Compact uses any derivative of the word \u201cdeplete.\u201d It is in my view a clear indication that the Compact intends to break from the common law\u2019s focus on diversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The Court reduces the Compact\u2019s deliberate use of \u201cdepleted\u201d to an inconsequential slip of the pen. According to today\u2019s majority, Article II(H) speaks only to the types of uses that confer appropriative rights. \u201cNothing in the language,\u201d it says, \u201csuggests that \u2018beneficial use\u2019 means a measure of the <em>amount </em>of water depleted.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 386, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 813. This is incomprehensible. On the Court\u2019s <em>own </em>interpretation \u201cbeneficial use\u201d not only defines the types of uses that confer appropriative rights, but also determines the volume of water to which the rights attach\u2014viz., <em>only </em>that volume put to one of the specified types of uses. The only question before us is whether \u201cbeneficial use\u201d measures the volume <em>diverted, </em>or the volume depleted\u2014and the language of the Compact makes that clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">[563 U.S. 392]</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The Court provides no plausible explanation for use of the word \u201cdepleted\u201d instead of \u201cdiverted.\u201d Its best effort is the suggestion that the word was used to ensure that hydroelectric power generation and other disfavored, nondepletive uses do not confer appropriative rights. See <em>ibid. </em>That is highly unlikely, for two reasons. First, relying on a subtle distinction between depletion and diversion would be one of the clumsiest ways imaginable to accomplish that simple goal, if it was not already accomplished by other provisions of the Compact. One would instead have expected the Compact simply to exclude the disfavored uses from the \u201cusefu[l] . . . activities of man,\u201d Art. II(H), 65 Stat. 665, which confer appropriative rights. Cf. Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 85-2-102(4) (2009) (listing types of beneficial uses). Second, and even more conclusively, hydroelectric generation, water wheels, and mill races\u2014the allegedly disfavored uses Wyoming and the United States offer up to explain the word \u201cdepleted\u201d\u2014are already excluded from appropriative rights (and probably from any need for appropria-tive rights) by the Compact\u2019s definition of diversion: \u201cthe taking or removing of water from the Yellowstone River or any tributary thereof when the water so taken or removed is not returned directly into the channel of the Yellowstone River or of the tributary from which it is taken.\u201d Art. IKG), 65 Stat. 665. The modifying clause seems specifically designed to exclude hydroelectric dams, water wheels, and mill races, which, when they divert water from the Yellowstone or its tributaries, \u201cretur[n it] directly into the channel . . . from which it is taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">The Court objects to my interpretation because the word \u201cdepleted\u201d lacks the \u201cclarity\u201d necessary to \u201cdrastically redefine the term \u2018beneficial use\u2019 from its longstanding meaning,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 387, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 813. According to the Court, \u201c[t]he amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>of water put to \u2018beneficial use\u2019 has never been defined by net water consumption.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Before making this statement, the Court has spent some nine pages, <em>ante, </em>at 377-385, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 807-812, conducting a</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">[563 U.S. 393]</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">\u201csensitive . . . inquiry [that] counsels caution\u201d; into a field (state water law) where the answer of this Court is not conclusive and hence not <em>ipso facto </em>correct (\u201cit is not this Court\u2019s role to guide\u201d); resulting in the Court\u2019s best guess concerning \u201can unclear area of appropriation doctrine\u201d; answering a question which \u201c \u2018[n]o western state court [not even a lower court] appears to have conclusively answered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 377, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 807, and n. 5. The Court calls that hitherto unanswered question \u201cthe law of return flows,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 377, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 807, but it can more accurately be described as the question whether the volume of water to which an appropriator acquires rights is the entire volume diverted for a beneficial use, or rather only the volume depleted by the beneficial use. Which is to say that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d has never had the \u201clongstanding meaning\u201d the Court posits. If it has in the past been assumed to refer to all water diverted from the stream rather than all water depleted from the stream, that is only because the issue of which of the two it means has never arisen. I find it quite extraordinary that the Court should expend such heroic efforts (imagine how many cases had to be read!) answering a state water-law question that <em>no </em>court of <em>any </em>Western State has <em>ever </em>answered\u2014a question that would cross a Rabbi\u2019s eyes\u2014 when the text in front of us provides the clear answer insofar as this Compact is concerned: \u201cdepleted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The Court suggests that if the Compact\u2019s authors wanted to break from (what it considers) the common law, they should have defined beneficial use as the <em>\u201cvolume </em>by which the water supply ... is depleted.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 387-388, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 813 (internal quotation marks omitted). That objection seems to me to have little force when the Court cannot explain what work \u201cdepleted\u201d is supposed to do other than indicate precisely the same concept more concisely. And the Court\u2019s helpful drafting tip proves that speaking with greater clarity is not so easy. Following the Court\u2019s advice would make nonsense of Article V(B) of the Compact. That provision allocates a</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">[563 U.S. 394]</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">fixed percentage \u201cof the unused and unappropriated water\u201d of various tributaries to each State for post-1950 \u201cstorage or direct diversions for beneficial use on new lands or for other purposes.\u201d 65 Stat. 666. But if \u201cbeneficial use\u201d in this last phrase means <em>\u201cthe volume of water </em>by which . . . the water supply is depleted,\u201d the provision makes no sense. It would allocate a fixed percentage of unused and unappropriated water for \u201ca volume of water by which the water supply is depleted.\u201d It makes perfect sense, of course, if \u201cbeneficial use\u201d means all uses that deplete the stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The Court also wonders why, \u201cif Article V(A) were intended to guarantee Montana a set quantity of water,\u201d it did not \u201cd[o] so as plainly as other\u201d interstate water compacts \u201cthat do just that.\u201d Ante, at 388, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 814. This is a straw man. Montana does <em>not </em>demand a precise volume of water each year; nor does it insist that its pre-1950 water users always receive enough water to satisfy their pre-1950 needs. It merely asks that its pre-1950 water users occupy the same position relative to Wyoming\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>pre-1950 users in 2011 as they did in 1950\u2014that whatever would have flowed back into the Yellowstone after Wyoming appropriators\u2019 beneficial uses in 1950 if the river then had this year\u2019s flow, will also flow back this year. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13, 16, 24. In dry years, that may mean some Montanans will have to make do with less or go without.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Because I think the Court\u2019s disposition disregards the text of the Compact, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-13\"> The dictionary-approved term is \u201cWyomingite,\u201d which is also the name of a type of lava, see Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2961 (2d ed. 1954).
