To do so, the veteran must file a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court within 120 days after the date when the Board\u2019s final decision is properly mailed. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a). This case presents the question whether a veteran\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal within the 120-day period should be regarded as having \u201cjurisdictional\u201d consequences. We hold that it should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers the federal program that provides benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities. The VA has a two-step process for the adjudication of these claims. First, a VA regional office receives and processes veterans\u2019 claims and makes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny benefits. Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the regional office\u2019s decision, the veteran may obtain <em>de novo </em>review by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. The Board is a body within the VA that makes the agency\u2019s final decision in cases appealed to it. \u00a7\u00a7 7101, 7104(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">The VA\u2019s adjudicatory \u201cprocess is designed to function throughout with a high degree of informality and solicitude for the claimant.\u201d <em>Walters </em>v. <em>National Assn. of Radiation Survivors, </em>473 U.S. 305, 311, 105 S. Ct. 3180, 87 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1985). A veteran faces no time limit for filing a claim, and once a claim is filed, the VA\u2019s process for adjudicating it at the regional office and the Board is <em>ex parte </em>and nonadversarial, 38 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 3.103(a), 20.700(c) (2010). The VA has a statutory duty to assist veterans</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">[562 U.S. 432]</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">in developing the evidence necessary to substantiate their claims. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5103(a) (2006 ed., Supp. Ill), 5103A (2006 ed.). And when evaluating claims, the VA must give veterans the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d whenever positive and negative evidence on a material issue is roughly equal. \u00a7 5107(b). If a regional office denies a claim, the veteran has a generous 1-year time limit to initiate an appeal to the Board. \u00a7 7105(b)(1); 38 CFR \u00a7 20.302(a). A veteran may also reopen a previously denied claim at any time by presenting \u201cnew and material evidence,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108, and decisions by a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>gional office or the Board are subject to challenge at any time based on \u201cclear and unmistakable error,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 5109A, 7111.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Before 1988, a veteran whose claim was rejected by the VAwas generally unable to obtain further review. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) (1988 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the Veterans\u2019 Judicial Review Act (VJRA), 102 Stat. 4105 (codified, as amended, in various sections of 38 U.S.C. (2006 ed. and Supp. Ill)), created the Veterans Court, an Article I tribunal, and authorized that court to review Board decisions adverse to veterans.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 7251, 7252(a) (2006 ed.). While proceedings before the Veterans Court are adversarial, see \u00a7 7263, veterans have a remarkable record of success before that tribunal. Statistics compiled by the Veterans Court show that in the last decade, the court ordered some form of relief in around 79 percent of its \u201cmerits decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">[562 U.S. 433]</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Review of Veterans Court decisions on certain issues of law is available in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. \u00a7 7292. Federal Circuit decisions may in turn be reviewed by this Court by writ of certio-rari.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">David Henderson served in the military during the Korean War. In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100-percent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and in 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based on his need for in-home care. After a VA regional office and the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days. See \u00a7 7266(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson\u2019s appeal as untimely. It concluded that Henderson was not entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline because he had not shown that his illness had caused his tardy filing. Later, the court granted Henderson\u2019s motion for reconsideration, revoked the dismissal, and set the case for argument. While Henderson\u2019s appeal was pending, however, we decided <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007).  In <em>Bowles, </em>we held that the statutory limitation on the length of an extension of the time to file a notice of appeal in an ordinary civil case, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) (2006 ed., Supp. Ill), is \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and we therefore held that a party\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal within that period could not be excused based on equitable factors, or on the opposing party\u2019s forfeiture or waiver of any objection to the late filing. <em>Bowles, supra, </em>at 213-214, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">After we announced our decision in <em>Bowles, </em>the Veterans Court directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the parties to brief that decision\u2019s effect on prior Federal Circuit precedent that allowed the equitable tolling of the 120-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court. A divided panel of the Veterans Court concluded that <em>Bowles </em>compelled jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day deadline and dismissed Henderson\u2019s untimely appeal</p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">[562 U.S. 434]</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Peake, </em>22 Vet. App. 217 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Henderson then appealed to the Federal Circuit, and a divided en banc court affirmed. 589 F.3d 1201 (2009). We granted certiorari. 561 U.S. 1024, 130 S. Ct. 3502, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">In this case, as in others that have come before us in recent years, we must decide whether a procedural rule is \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d See <em>Reed Elsevier, Inc. </em>v. <em>Muchnick, </em>559 U.S. 154, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2010); <em>Union Pacific R. Co. </em>v. <em>Locomotive Engineers, </em>558 U.S. 67, 130 S. Ct. 584, 175 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2009); <em>Bowles, supra; Arbaugh </em>v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006); <em>Eberhart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 126 S. Ct. 403, 163 L. Ed. 2d 14 (2005) <em>(per curiam); Scarborough </em>v. <em>Principi, </em>541 U.S. 401, 124 S. Ct. 1856, 158 L. Ed. 2d 674 (2004); <em>Kontrick </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2004). This question is not merely semantic but one of considerable practical importance for judges and litigants. Branding a rule as going to a court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system. Under that system,  courts are generally limited to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the parties. See <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>548 U.S. 331, 356-357, 126 S. Ct. 2669, 165 L. Ed. 2d 557 (2006). Courts do not usually raise claims or arguments on their own. But federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press. See <em>Arbaugh, supra, </em>at 514, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants. For purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is replete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised at particular times. See <em>Sanchez-Llamas, supra, </em>at 356-357, 126 S. Ct. 2669, 165 L. Ed. 2d 557.  Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however, may be raised at any time. Thus, a party, after losing at trial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court lacked</p>\n<p id=\"aqd-dedup-0\">[562 U.S. 435]</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S., at 508, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097. Indeed, a party may raise such an objection even if the party had previously acknowledged the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Ibid. </em>And if the trial court lacked jurisdiction, many months of work on the part of the attorneys and the court may be wasted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term. We have urged that  a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court\u2019s adjudicatory capacity, that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction. <em>Reed Elsevier, supra, </em>at 161, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>130 S. Ct. 1237, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18; <em>Kontrick, supra, </em>at 455, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867. Other rules, even if important and mandatory, we have said, should not be given the jurisdictional brand. See <em>Union Pacific, </em>558 U.S., at 81, 130 S. Ct. 584, 175 L. Ed. 2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Among the types of rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are what we have called \u201cclaim-processing rules.\u201d These are rules that seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times. <em>Id., </em>at 83-84, 130 S. Ct. 584, 175 L. Ed. 2d 428; <em>Eberhart, supra, </em>at 19, 126 S. Ct. 403, 163 L. Ed. 2d 14; <em>Scarborough, supra, </em>at 413-414, 124 S. Ct. 1856, 158 L. Ed. 2d 674; <em>Kontrick, supra, </em>at 455-456, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867. Filing deadlines, such as the 120-day filing deadline at issue here, are quintessential claim-processing rules. Accordingly, if we were simply to apply the strict definition of jurisdiction that we have recommended in our recent cases, we would reverse the decision of the Federal Circuit, and this opinion could end at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that simple because Congress is free to attach the conditions that go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we would prefer to call a claim-processing rule. See <em>Bowles, supra, </em>at 212-213, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96. The question here, therefore, is whether Congress mandated that the 120-day deadline be \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d In <em>Arbaugh, </em>we applied a \u201creadily administrable bright line\u201d rule for deciding such questions. 546 U.S., at 515-516, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097.  Under <em>Arbaugh,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">[562 U.S. 436]</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">we look to see if there is any \u201cclear\u201d indication that Congress wanted the rule to be \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This approach is suited to capture Congress\u2019 likely intent and also provides helpful guidance for courts and litigants, who will be \u201cduly instructed\u201d regarding a rule\u2019s nature. See <em>id., </em>at 514-515, and n. 11, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Congress, of course, need not use magic words in order to speak clearly on this point. \u201c[CJontext, including this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant.\u201d Re<em>ed Elsevier, supra, </em>at 168, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18. When \u201ca long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left undisturbed by Congress,\u201d <em>Union Pacific, supra, </em>at 82, 130 S. Ct. 584, 175 L. Ed. 2d 428, has treated a similar requirement as \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d we will presume that Congress intended to follow that course. See <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 130, 133-134, 139, 128 S. Ct. 750, 169 L. Ed. 2d 591 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">With these principles in mind, we consider whether Congress clearly prescribed that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court should be \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Contending that the 120-day filing deadline was meant to be jurisdictional, the Government maintains that <em>Bowles </em>is controlling. The Government reads <em>Bowles </em>to mean that all statutory deadlines for taking appeals in civil cases are jurisdictional. Since \u00a7 7266(a) establishes a statutory deadline for taking an appeal in a civil case, the Government reasons, that deadline is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">We reject the major premise of this syllogism. <em>Bowles </em>did not hold cat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>egorically that every deadline for seeking judicial review in civil litigation is jurisdictional. Instead, <em>Bowles </em>concerned an appeal from one court to another court. The \u201ccentury\u2019s worth of precedent and practice in American courts\u201d on which <em>Bowles </em>relied involved appeals of that type. See 551 U.S., at 209-210, and n. 2, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">[562 U.S. 437]</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Contending that <em>Bowles\u2019 </em>reasoning extends to the judicial review of administrative decisions, the Government relies on <em>Stone </em>v. <em>INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S. Ct. 1537, 131 L. Ed. 2d 465 (1995). There, without elaboration, we described as \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional\u2019 \u201d the deadline for seeking review in the courts of appeals of final removal orders of the Board of Immigration Appeals. <em>Id., </em>at 405, 115 S. Ct. 1537, 131 L. Ed. 2d 465 (quoting <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>495 U.S. 33, 45, 110 S. Ct. 1651, 109 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1990)). The Government also notes that lower court decisions have uniformly held that the Hobbs Act\u2019s 60-day time limit for filing a petition for review of certain final agency decisions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344, is jurisdictional. Brief for Respondent 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Petitioner correctly observes, however, that Veterans Court review of a VA decision denying benefits differs in many respects from court of appeals review of an agency decision under the Hobbs Act. Cf. <em>Shinseki </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>556 U.S. 396, 412, 129 S. Ct. 1696, 173 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2009) (\u201cCongress has made clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency\u201d). And there is force to petitioner\u2019s argument that a more appropriate analog is judicial review of an administrative decision denying Social Security disability benefits. The Social Security disability benefits program, like the veterans benefits program, is \u201cunusually protective\u201d of claimants, <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Day, </em>467 U.S. 104, 106-107, 104 S. Ct. 2249, 81 L. Ed. 2d 88 (1984). See also <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Apfel, </em>530 U.S. 103, 110-112, 120 S. Ct. 2080, 147 L. Ed. 2d 80 (2000) (plurality opinion). Indeed, the Government acknowledges that \u201cthe Social Security and veterans-benefit review mechanisms share significant common attributes.\u201d Brief for Respondent 16. And long before Congress enacted the VJRA, we held that  the deadline for obtaining review of Social Security benefits decisions in district court, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), is not jurisdictional. <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>476 U.S. 467, 478, and n. 10, 106 S. Ct. 2022, 90 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1986); <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 328, n. 9, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976); <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 763-764, 95 S. Ct. 2457, 45 L. Ed. 2d 522 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">In the end, however, none of the precedents cited by the parties controls our decision here. All of those cases involved review by Article III courts. This case, by contrast,</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">[562 U.S. 438]</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">involves review by an Article I tribunal as part of a unique administrative scheme. Instead of applying a categorical rule regarding review of administrative decisions, we attempt to ascertain Congress\u2019 intent regarding the particular type of review at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Several factors convince us that the 120-day deadline for seeking Veterans Court review was not meant to have jurisdictional attributes.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">The terms of the provision setting that deadline, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a), do not suggest, much less provide clear evidence, that the provision was meant to carry jurisdictional consequences. Section 7266(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cIn order to obtain review by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims of a final decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, a person adversely affected by such decision shall file a notice of appeal with the Court within 120 days after the date on which notice of the decision is mailed pursuant to section 7104(e) of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">This provision \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans Court],\u201d <em>Zipes </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 394, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982). If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to be treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provision in language like that in the provision of the VJRA that governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the Veterans Court. This latter provision states that Federal Circuit review must be obtained \u201cwithin the time and in the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts of appeals from United States district courts.\u201d \u00a7 7292(a). Because the time for taking an appeal from a district court to a court of appeals in a civil case has long been understood to be jurisdictional, see <em>Bowles, supra, </em>at 209-210, and n. 2, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96, this language clearly</p>\n<p id=\"A6Q5\">[562 U.S. 439]</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">signals an intent to impose the same restrictions on appeals from the Veterans Court to the Federal Circuit. But the 120-day limit at issue in this case is not framed in comparable terms. It is true that \u00a7 7266 is cast in mandatory language,  but we have rejected the notion that \u201call mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Union Pacific, </em>558 U.S., at 81, 130 S. Ct. 584, 175 L. Ed. 2d 428 (quoting <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S., at 510, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097; internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the language of \u00a7 7266 provides no clear indication that Congress wanted that provision to be treated as having jurisdictional attributes.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Nor does \u00a7 7266\u2019s placement within the VJRA provide such an indication. Congress placed \u00a7 7266, numbered \u00a7 4066 in the enacting legislation, in a subchapter entitled \u201cProcedure.\u201d See VJRA \u00a7 301, 102 Stat. 4113, 4115-4116. That placement suggests Congress regarded the 120-day limit as a claim-processing rule. Cf. <em>INS </em>v. <em>National Center for Immigrants\u2019 Rights, Inc., </em>502 U.S. 183, 189, 112 S. Ct. 551, 116 L. Ed. 2d 546 (1991) (  \u201c[T]he title of a statute or section can aid in resolving an ambiguity in the legislation\u2019s text\u201d). Congress elected not to place the 120-day limit in the VJRA subchapter entitled \u201cOrganization and Jurisdiction.\u201d See 102 Stat. 4113-4115.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Within that subchapter, a separate provision, captioned \u201cJurisdiction; finality of decisions,\u201d prescribes the jurisdiction of the Veterans Court. <em>Id., </em>at 4113-4114. Subsection (a) of that provision, numbered \u00a7 4052 in the enacting legislation, grants the Veterans Court \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals\u201d and the \u201cpower to affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of the Board or to remand the matter, as appropriate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 4113. It also prohibits the court from hearing appeals by the VA Secretary. Subsection (b) limits the court\u2019s review to \u201cthe record of proceedings before the [VA],\u201d specifies the scope of that review, and precludes review of the VA\u2019s disability ratings schedule. <em>Ibid. </em>Nothing in this provision or in the</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">[562 U.S. 440]</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\u201cOrganization and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Jurisdiction\u201d subchapter addresses the time for seeking Veterans Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">While the terms and placement of \u00a7 7266 provide some indication of Congress\u2019 intent, what is most telling here are the singular characteristics of the review scheme that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans\u2019 benefits claims. \u201cThe solicitude of Congress for veterans is of long standing.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>366 U.S. 643, 647, 81 S. Ct. 1278, 6 L. Ed. 2d 575 (1961); see also <em>Sanders, </em>556 U.S., at 412, 129 S. Ct. 1696, 173 L. Ed. 2d 532. And that solicitude is plainly reflected in the VJRA, as well as in subsequent laws that \u201cplace a thumb on the scale in the veteran\u2019s favor in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA decisions,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 416, 129 S. Ct. 1696, 173 L. Ed. 2d 532 (Souter, J., dissenting). See, e. <em>g., </em>Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 2096; Act of Nov. 21, 1997, 111 Stat. 2271; VJRA \u00a7 103, 102 Stat. 4106-4107.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The contrast between ordinary civil litigation\u2014which provided the context of our decision in Bowles\u2014and the system that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans\u2019 benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic. In ordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally commence their suits within the time specified in a statute of limitations, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658, and the litigation is adversarial. Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that supports their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion. Both parties may appeal an adverse trial-court decision, see \u00a7 1291, and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an initial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset of disability or separation from service. When a claim is filed, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonadversarial. The VA is charged with the responsibility of assisting veterans in developing evidence that supports their claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must give the veteran the benefit of any doubt. If a veteran is unsuccessful</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">[562 U.S. 441]</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">before a regional office, the veteran may obtain <em>de novo </em>review before the Board, and if the veteran loses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further review in the Veterans Court. A Board decision in the veteran\u2019s favor, on the other hand, is final. And even if a veteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of administrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting \u201cnew and material evidence.\u201d Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash sharply with this scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">We have long applied \u201cthe canon that  provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries\u2019 favor.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, </em>502 U.S. 215, 220-221, n. 9, 112 S. Ct. 570, 116 L. Ed. 2d 578 (1991); see also <em>Coffy </em>v. <em>Republic Steel Corp., </em>447 U.S. 191, 196, 100 S. Ct. 2100, 65 L. Ed. 2d 53 (1980); <em>Fishgold </em>v. <em>Sullivan Drydock &amp; Repair Corp., </em>328 U.S. 275, 285, 66 S. Ct. 1105, 90 L. Ed. 1230 (1946). Particularly in light of this canon, we do not find any clear indication that the 120-day limit was intended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany the jurisdiction tag.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">The Government argues that there is no reason to think that jurisdiction-ally time-limited review is inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>tent with a pro-veteran administrative scheme because, prior to the enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were not subject to any further review at all. Brief for Respondent 29. The provision at issue here, however, was enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans. Accordingly, the review opportunities available to veterans before the VJRA was enacted are of little help in interpreting 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We hold that  the deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court does not have jurisdictional attributes. The 120-day limit is nevertheless an important procedural</p>\n<p id=\"A6p\">[562 U.S. 442]</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">rule.
