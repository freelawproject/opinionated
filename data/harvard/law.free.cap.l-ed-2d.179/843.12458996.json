Previously, the plan provided a retiring employee with a defined benefit in the form of an annuity calculated on the basis of his preretirement salary and length of service. The new plan provided most retiring employees with a (lump sum) cash balance calculated on the basis of a defined annual contribution from CIGNA as increased by compound interest. Because many employees had already earned at least some old-plan benefits, the new plan translated already-earned benefits into an opening amount in the employee\u2019s cash balance account.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Respondents, acting on behalf of approximately 25,000 beneficiaries of the CIGNA Pension Plan (which is also a petitioner here), challenged CIGNA\u2019s adoption of the new plan. They claimed in part that CIGNA had failed to give them proper notice of changes to their benefits, particularly because the new plan in certain respects provided them with less generous benefits. See Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), \u00a7\u00a7 102(a), 104(b), 88 Stat. 841,</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">[563 U.S. 425]</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">848, as amended, \u00a7 204(h), as added, 100 Stat. 243, and as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1022(a), 1024(b), 1054(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">The District Court agreed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>disclosures made by CIGNA violated its obligations under ERISA. In determining relief, the court found that CIGNA\u2019s notice failures had caused the employees \u201clikely harm.\u201d The court then reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits accordingly. It found legal authority for doing so in ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) (authorizing a plan \u201cparticipant or beneficiary\u201d to bring a \u201ccivil action\u201d to \u201crecover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">We agreed to decide whether the District Court applied the correct legal standard, namely, a \u201clikely harm\u201d standard, in determining that CIG-NA\u2019s notice violations caused its employees sufficient injury to warrant legal relief. To reach that question, we must first consider a more general matter\u2014whether the ERISA section just mentioned (ERISA\u2019s recovery-of-benefits-due provision, \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B)) authorizes entry of the relief the District Court provided. We conclude that it does not authorize this relief. Nonetheless, we find that a different equity-related ERISA provision, to which the District Court also referred, authorizes forms of relief similar to those that the court entered. \u00a7 502(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Section 502(a)(3) authorizes \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u2019 for violations of ERISA. Accordingly, the relevant standard of harm will depend upon the equitable theory by which the District Court provides relief. We leave it to the District Court to conduct that analysis in the first instance, but we identify equitable principles that the court might apply on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Because our decision rests in important part upon the circumstances present here, we shall describe those circumstances in some detail. We still simplify in doing so. But</p>\n<p id=\"AjKO\">[563 U.S. 426]</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">the interested reader can find a more thorough description in two District Court opinions, which set forth that court\u2019s findings reached after a lengthy trial. See 559 F. Supp. 2d 192 (Conn. 2008); 534 F. Supp. 2d 288 (Conn. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Under CIGNA\u2019s pre-1998 defined-benefit retirement plan, an employee with at least five years\u2019 service would receive an annuity annually paying an amount that depended upon the employee\u2019s salary and length of service. Depending on when the employee had joined CIGNA, the annuity would equal either (1)2 percent of the employee\u2019s average salary over his final three years with CIGNA, multiplied by the number of years worked (up to 30); or (2) 1 \u215c percent of the employee\u2019s average salary over his final five years with CIGNA, multiplied by the number of years worked (up to 35). Calculated either way, the annuity would approach 60 percent of a longtime employee\u2019s final salary. A well-paid longtime employee, earning, say, $160,000 per year, could receive a retirement annuity paying the employee about $96,000 per year until his death. The plan offered many employees at least one other benefit: They could retire early, at age 55, and receive an only-somewhat-reduced annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">In November 1997, CIGNA sent its employees a newsletter announcing that it intended to put in place a new pension plan. The new plan would substitute an \u201caccount balance plan\u201d for CIGNA\u2019s pre-existing defined-benefit system. App. 991a (emphasis deleted). The newsletter added that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>the old plan would end on December 31, 1997, that CIGNA would introduce (and describe) the new plan sometime during 1998, and that the new plan would apply retroactively to January 1, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">Eleven months later CIGNA filled in the details. Its new plan created an individual retirement account for each employee. (The account consisted of a bookkeeping entry backed by a CIGNA-funded trust.) Each year CIGNA</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">[563 U.S. 427]</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">would contribute to the employee\u2019s individual account an amount equal to between 3 percent and 8.5 percent of the employee\u2019s salary, depending upon age, length of service, and certain other factors. The account balance would earn compound interest at a rate equal to the return on 5-year treasury bills plus one-quarter percent (but no less than 4.5 percent and no greater than 9 percent). Upon retirement the employee would receive the amount then in his or her individual account\u2014in the form of either a lump sum or whatever annuity the lump sum then would buy. As promised, CIGNA would open the accounts and begin to make contributions as of January 1, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">But what about the retirement benefits that employees had already earned prior to January 1, 1998? CIGNA promised to make an initial contribution to the individual\u2019s account equal to the value of that employee\u2019s already-earned benefits. And the new plan set forth a method for calculating that initial contribution. The method consisted of calculating the amount as of the employee\u2019s (future) retirement date of the annuity to which the employee\u2019s salary and length of service already <em>(i.e., </em>as of December 31, 1997) entitled him and then discounting that sum to its present <em>(i.e., </em>January 1, 1998) value.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">An example will help: Imagine an employee born on January 1, 1966, who joined CIGNA in January 1991 on his 25th birthday, and who (during the five years preceding the plan changeover) earned an average salary of $100,000 per year. As of January 1, 1998, the old plan would have entitled that employee to an annuity equal to $100,000 times 7 (years then worked) times 1\u215d percent, or $11,667 per year\u2014when he retired in 2031 at age 65. The 2031 price of an annuity paying $11,667 per year until death depends upon interest rates and mortality assumptions at that time. If we assume the annuity would pay 7 percent until the holder\u2019s death (and we use the mortality assumptions used by the plan, see App. 407a (incorporating the mortality table prescribed by Rev.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">[563 U.S. 428]</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Rul. 95-6, 1995-1 Cum. Bull. 80)), then the 2031 price of such an annuity would be about $120,500. And CIGNA should initially deposit in this individual\u2019s account on January 1, 1998, an amount that will grow to become $120,500, 33 years later, in 2031, when the individual retires. If we assume a 5 percent average interest rate, then that amount presently <em>(i.e., </em>as of January 1, 1998) equals about $24,000. And (with one further mortality-related adjustment that we shall describe <em>infra, </em>at 429-430, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 850-851) that is the amount, more or less, that the new plan\u2019s transition rules would have required CIGNA initially to deposit. Then CIGNA would make further annual deposits, and all the deposited amounts would earn compound interest. When the employee retired, he would receive the resulting lump sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>The new plan also provided employees a guarantee: An employee would receive upon retirement either (1) the amount to which he or she had become entitled as of January 1, 1998, or (2) the amount then in his or her individual account, whichever was greater. Thus, the employee in our example would receive (in 2031) no less than an annuity paying $11,667 per year for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">The District Court found that CIG-NA\u2019s initial descriptions of its new plan were significantly incomplete and misled its employees. In November 1997, for example, CIGNA sent the employees a newsletter that said the new plan would \u201csignificantly enhance\u201d its \u201cretirement program,\u201d would produce \u201can overall improvement in . . . retirement benefits,\u201d and would provide \u201cthe same benefit security\u201d with \u201csteadier benefit growth.\u201d App. 990a, 991a, 993a. CIGNA also told its employees that they would \u201csee the growth in [their] total retirement benefits from CIGNA every year,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 952a, that its initial deposit \u201crepresented] the full value of the benefit [they] earned for service before 1998,\u201d Record E-503</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">[563 U.S. 429]</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">(Exh. 98), and that \u201c[o]ne advantage the company <em>will not </em>get from the retirement program changes is cost savings,\u201d App. 993a.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">In fact, the new plan saved the company $10 million annually (though CIGNA later said it devoted the savings to other employee benefits). Its initial deposit did not \u201crep-resen [t] the full value of the benefit\u201d that employees had \u201cearned for service before 1998.\u201d And the plan made a significant number of employees worse off in at least the following specific ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">First, the initial deposit calculation ignored the fact that the old plan offered many CIGNA employees the right to retire early (beginning at age 55) with only-somewhat-reduced benefits. This right was valuable. For example, as of January 1, 1998, respondent Janice Amara had earned vested age-55 retirement benefits of $1,833 per month, but CIGNA\u2019s initial deposit in her new-plan individual retirement account (ignoring this benefit) would have allowed her at age 55 to buy an annuity benefit of only $900 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Second, as we previously indicated but did not explain, <em>supra, </em>at 428, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 850, the new plan adjusted CIGNA\u2019s initial deposit downward to account for the fact that, unlike the old plan\u2019s lifetime annuity, an employee\u2019s survivors would receive the new plan\u2019s benefits (namely, the amount in the employee\u2019s individual account) even if the employee died before retiring. The downward adjustment consisted of multiplying the otherwise-required deposit by the probability that the employee would live until retirement\u2014a 90 percent probability in the example of our 32-year-old, <em>supra, </em>at 427-428, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 849-850. And that meant that CIGNA\u2019s initial deposit in our example\u2014the amount that was supposed to grow to $120,500 by 2031\u2014 would be less than $22,000, not $24,000 (the number we computed). The employee, of course, would receive a benefit in return\u2014namely, a form of life insurance. But at least some employees might have preferred the retirement</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">[563 U.S. 430]</p>\n<p id=\"b948-16\">benefit and consequently could reasonably have thought it important to know that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>new plan traded away one-tenth of their already-earned benefits for a life insurance policy that they might not have wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">Third, the new plan shifted the risk of a fall in interest rates from CIGNA to its employees. Under the old plan, CIGNA had to buy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specified sum irrespective of whether falling interest rates made it more expensive for CIGNA to pay for that annuity. And falling interest rates also meant that any sum CIGNA set aside to buy that annuity would grow more slowly over time, thereby requiring CIGNA to set aside more money to make any specific sum available at retirement. Under the new plan CIGNA did not have to buy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specific sum. The employee would simply receive whatever sum his account contained. And falling interest rates meant that the account\u2019s lump sum would earn less money each year after the employee retired. Annuities, for example, would become more expensive (any fixed purchase price paying for less annual income). At the same time falling interest meant that the individual account would grow more slowly over time, leaving the employee with less money at retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Of course, interest rates might rise instead of fall, leaving CIGNA\u2019s employees better off under the new plan. But the latter advantage does not cancel out the former disadvantage, for most individuals are risk averse. And that means that most of CIGNA\u2019s employees would have preferred that CIGNA, rather than they, bear these risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The amounts likely involved are significant. If, in our example, interest rates between 1998 and 2031 averaged 4 percent rather than the 5 percent we assumed, and if in 2031 annuities paid 6 percent rather than the 7 percent we assumed, then CIGNA would have had to make an initial deposit of $35,500 (not $24,000) to assure that employee the</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">[563 U.S. 431]</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">$11,667 annual annuity payment to which he had already become entitled. Indeed, that $24,000 that CIGNA would have contributed (leaving aside the life-insurance problem) would have provided enough money to buy (in 2031) an annuity that assured the employee an annual payment of only about $8,000 (rather than $11,667).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">We recognize that the employee in our example (like others) might have continued to work for CIGNA after January 1, 1998; and he would thereby eventually have earned a pension that, by the time of his retirement, was worth far more than $11,667. But that is so because CIGNA made an <em>additional </em>contribution for each year worked <em>after </em>January 1, 1998. If interest rates fell (as they did), it would take the employee several additional years of work simply to catch up (under the new plan) to where he had already been (under the old plan) as of January 1, 1998\u2014a phenomenon known in pension jargon as \u201cwear away,\u201d see 534 F. Supp. 2d, at 303-304 (referring to respondents\u2019 requiring 6 to 10 years to catch up).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">The District Court found that CIGNA told its employees nothing about any of these features of the new plan\u2014which individually and together made clear that CIGNA\u2019s descriptions of the plan were incomplete and inaccurate. The District Court also found that CIGNA intentionally misled its employees. A focus group and many employees asked CIGNA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>for example, to \u201c \u2018[d]isclose details\u2019 \u201d about the plan, to provide \u201c \u2018individual comparisons,\u2019 \u201d or to show \u201c \u2018[a]n actual projection for retirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 342. But CIGNA did not do so. Instead (in the words of one internal document), it \u201c \u2018focus[ed] on NOT providing employees before and after samples of the Pension Plan changes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The District Court concluded, as a matter of law, that CIGNA\u2019s representations (and omissions) about the plan, made between November 1997 (when it announced the plan) and December 1998 (when it put the plan into effect) violated:</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">[563 U.S. 432]</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">(1) ERISA \u00a7 204(h), implemented by Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.411(d)-6, 26 CFR \u00a7 1.411(d)-6 (2000), which (as it existed at the relevant time) forbade an amendment of a pension plan that would \u201cprovide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual\u201d unless the plan administrator also sent a \u201cwritten notice\u201d that provided either the text of the amendment or summarized its likely effects, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(h) (2000 ed.) (amended 2001); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.411(d)-6, Q&amp;A-10, 63 Fed. Reg. 68682 (1998); and</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">(2) ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and 104(b), which require a plan administrator to provide beneficiaries with summary plan descriptions and with summaries of material modifications, \u201cwritten in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,\u201d that are \u201csufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1022(a), 1024(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. III).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">The District Court then turned to the remedy. First, the court agreed with CIGNA that only employees whom CIGNA\u2019s disclosure failures had harmed could obtain relief. But it did not require each individual member of the relevant CIGNA employee class to show individual injury. Rather, it found (1) that the evidence presented had raised a presumption of \u201clikely harm\u201d suffered by the members of the relevant employee class, and (2) that CIGNA, though free to offer contrary evidence in respect to some or all of those employees, had failed to rebut that presumption. It concluded that this unrebutted showing was sufficient to warrant class-applicable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">Second, the court noted that \u00a7 204(h) had been interpreted by the Second Circuit to permit the invalidation of plan amendments not preceded by a proper notice, prior to the 2001 amendment that made this power explicit. 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 207 (citing <em>Frommert </em>v. <em>Conkright,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">[563 U.S. 433]</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">433 F.3d 254, 263 (2006)); see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(h)(6) (2006 ed.) (entitling participants to benefits \u201cwithout regard to [the] amendment\u201d in case of an \u201cegregious failure\u201d). But the court also thought that granting this relief here would harm, not help, the injured employees. That is because the notice failures all concerned the new plan that took effect in December 1998. The court thought that the notices in respect to the freezing of old-plan benefits, effective December 31, 1997, were valid. To strike the new plan while leaving in effect the frozen old plan would not help CIGNA\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">The court considered treating the November 1997 notice as a sham or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>treating that notice and the later 1998 notices as part and parcel of a single set of related events. But it pointed out that respondents \u201cha[d] argued none of these things.\u201d 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 208. And it said that the court would \u201cnot make these arguments now on [respondents\u2019] behalf.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">Third, the court reformed the terms of the new plan\u2019s guarantee. It erased the portion that assured participants who retired the greater of \u201cA\u201d (that which they had already earned as of December 31, 1997, under the old plan, $11,667 in our example) <em>or </em>\u201cB\u201d (that which they would earn via CIG-NA\u2019s annual deposits under the new plan, <em>including </em>CIGNA\u2019s initial deposit). And it substituted a provision that would guarantee each employee \u201cA\u201d (that which they had already earned, as of December 31, 1997, under the old plan) <em>plus </em>\u201cB\u201d (that which they would earn via CIGNA\u2019s annual deposits under the new plan, <em>excluding </em>CIGNA\u2019s initial deposit). In our example, the District Court\u2019s remedy would no longer force our employee to choose upon retirement <em>either </em>an $11,667 annuity <em>or </em>his new-plan benefits (including both CIGNA\u2019s annual deposits and CIGNA\u2019s initial deposit). It would give him an $11,667 annuity <em>plus </em>his new-plan benefits (with CIG-NA\u2019s annual deposits but without CIGNA\u2019s initial deposit).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">[563 U.S. 434]</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Fourth, the court \u201corder [ed] and enjoin[ed] the CIGNA Plan to reform its records to reflect that all class members . . . now receive [the just described] \u2018A + B\u2019 benefits,\u201d and that it pay appropriate benefits to those class members who had already retired. <em>Id., </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Fifth, the court held that ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) provided the legal authority to enter this relief. That provision states that a \u201ccivil action may be brought\u201d by a plan \u201cparticipant or beneficiary ... to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).

Supp. 2d, at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">At the same time the court considered whether ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) also provided legal authority to enter this relief.

Ct. 1065, 134 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1996); and (2) the Supreme Court has \u201cissued several opinions . . . that have severely curtailed the kinds of relief that are available under \u00a7 502(a)(3),\u201d 559 F.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a brief</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">[563 U.S. 435]</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">summary order, rejecting all their claims, and affirming \u201cthe judgment of the district court for substantially the reasons stated\u201d in the District Court\u2019s \u201cwell-reasoned and scholarly opinions.\u201d 348 Fed. Appx. 627 (2009). The parties filed cross-petitions for writs of certiorari in this Court. We granted the request in CIGNA\u2019s petition to consider whether a showing of \u201clikely harm\u201d is sufficient to entitle plan participants to recover benefits based on faulty disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">CIGNA in the merits briefing raises a preliminary question. Brief for Petitioners 13-20. It argues first and foremost that the statutory provision upon which the District Court rested its orders, namely, the provision for recovery of plan benefits, \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), does not in fact authorize the District Court to enter the kind of relief it entered here. And for that reason, CIGNA argues, whether the District Court did or did not use a proper standard for determining harm is beside the point. We believe that this preliminary question is closely enough related to the question presented that we shall consider it at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">The District Court ordered relief in two steps. Step 1: It ordered the terms of the plan reformed (so that they provided an \u201cA plus B,\u201d rather than a \u201cgreater of A or B\u201d guarantee). Step 2: It ordered the plan administrator (which it found to be CIGNA) to enforce the plan as reformed. One can fairly describe step 2 as consistent with \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), for that provision grants a participant the right to bring a civil action to \u201crecover benefits due . . . under the terms of his plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). And step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by the \u201cterms of [the] plan\u201d <em>as reformed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">But what about step 1? Where does \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) grant a court the power to <em>change </em>the terms of the plan as they</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">[563 U.S. 436]</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">previously existed? The statutory language speaks of <em>\u201cenforcfingF </em>the \u201cterms of the plan,\u201d not of <em>changing </em>them. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). The provision allows a court to look outside the plan\u2019s written language in deciding what those terms are, <em>i.e., </em>what the language means. See <em>UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>526 U.S. 358, 377-379, 119 S. Ct. 1380, 143 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1999) (permitting the insurance terms of an ERISA-governed plan to be interpreted in light of state insurance rules). But we have found nothing suggesting that the provision authorizes a court to alter those terms, at least not in present circumstances, where that change, akin to the reform of a contract, seems less like the simple enforcement of a contract as written and more like an equitable remedy. See <em>infra, </em>at 441, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">Nor can we accept the Solicitor General\u2019s alternative rationale seeking to justify the use of this provision. The Solicitor General says that the District Court did enforce the plan\u2019s terms as written, adding that the \u201cplan\u201d includes the disclosures that constituted the summary plan descriptions. In other words, in the view of the Solicitor General, the terms of the summaries are terms of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-15\">Even if the District Court had viewed the summaries as plan \u201cterms\u201d (which it did not, see <em>supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>433, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 853), however, we cannot agree that the terms of statutorily required plan summaries (or summaries of plan modifications) necessarily may be enforced (under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B)) as the terms of the plan itself. For one thing, it is difficult to square the Solicitor General\u2019s reading of the statute with ERISA \u00a7 102(a), the provision that obliges plan administrators to furnish summary plan descriptions. The syntax of that provision, requiring that participants and beneficiaries be advised of their rights and obligations \u201cunder the plan,\u201d suggests that the information <em>about </em>the plan provided by those disclosures is not itself <em>part of </em>the plan. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1022(a). Nothing in \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) (or, as far as we can tell, anywhere else) suggests the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">[563 U.S. 437]</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Nor do we find it easy to square the Solicitor General\u2019s reading with the statute\u2019s division of authority between a plan\u2019s sponsor and the plan\u2019s administrator. The plan\u2019s sponsor <em>(e.g., </em>the employer), like a trust\u2019s set-tlor, creates the basic terms and conditions of the plan, executes a written instrument containing those terms and conditions, and provides in that instrument \u201ca procedure\u201d for making amendments. \u00a7 402, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102. The plan\u2019s administrator, a trustee-like fiduciary, manages the plan, follows its terms in doing so, and provides participants with the summary documents that describe the plan (and modifications) in readily understandable form. \u00a7\u00a7 3(21)(A), 101(a), 102, 104, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002(21)(A), 1021(a), 1022, 1024 (2006 ed. and Supp. III). Here, the District Court found that the same entity, CIGNA, filled both roles. See 534 F. Supp. 2d, at 331. But that is not always the case. Regardless, we have found that ERISA carefully distinguishes these roles. See, <em>e.g., Varity Corp., </em>516 U.S., at 498, 116 S. Ct. 1065, 134 L. Ed. 2d 130. And we have no reason to believe that the statute intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly by including them in the summary plan descriptions. See <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp. </em>v. <em>Schoonejongen, </em>514 U.S. 73, 81-85, 115 S. Ct. 1223, 131 L. Ed. 2d 94 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Finally, we find it difficult to reconcile the Solicitor General\u2019s interpretation with the basic summary plan description objective: clear, simple communication. See \u00a7\u00a7 2(a), 102(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a), 1022(a) (2006 ed.). To make the language of a plan summary legally binding could well lead plan administrators to sacrifice simplicity and comprehensibility in order to describe plan terms in the language of lawyers. Consider the difference between a will and the summary of a will or between a property deed and its summary. Consider, too, the length of Part I of this opinion, and then consider how much longer Part I would have to be if we had to include all the qualifications and nuances that a plan drafter</p>\n<p id=\"axtg-dedup-1\">[563 U.S. 438]</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">might have found important and feared to omit lest they lose all legal significance. The District Court\u2019s opinions take up 109 pages of the Federal Supplement. None of this is to say that plan administrators can avoid providing complete and accurate summaries of plan terms in the manner required by ERISA and its implementing regulations. But we fear that the Solicitor General\u2019s rule might bring about complexity that would defeat the fundamental purpose of the summaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">For these reasons taken together we conclude that the summary documents, important as they are, provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>communication with beneficiaries <em>about </em>the plan, but that their statements do not themselves constitute the <em>terms </em>of the plan for purposes of \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). We also conclude that the District Court could not find authority in that section to reform CIG-NA\u2019s plan as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">If \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) does not authorize entry of the relief here at issue, what about nearby \u00a7 502(a)(3)?  That provision allows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary \u201cto obtain other <em>appropriate equitable relief </em>to redress violations of (here relevant) parts of ERISA \u201cor the terms of the plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3) (emphasis added). The District Court strongly implied, but did not directly hold, that it would base its relief upon this subsection were it not for (1) the fact that the preceding \u201cplan benefits due\u201d provision, \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), provided sufficient authority; and (2) certain cases from this Court that narrowed the application of the term \u201cappropriate equitable relief,\u201d see, <em>e.g., Mertens, </em>508 U.S. 248, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 124 L. Ed. 2d 161; <em>Great-West, </em>534 U.S. 204, 122 S. Ct. 708, 151 L. Ed. 2d 635. Our holding in Part II-A, <em>supra, </em>removes the District Court\u2019s first obstacle. And given the likelihood that, on remand, the District Court will turn to and rely upon this alternative subsection, we consider the court\u2019s second concern. We find that concern misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">[563 U.S. 439]</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">We have interpreted  the term \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u2019 in \u00a7 502(a)(3) as referring to \u201c \u2018those categories of relief\u2019 \u201d that, traditionally speaking <em>(i.e., </em>prior to the merger of law and equity), \u201c \u2018were <em>typically </em>available in equity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sereboff, </em>547 U.S., at 361, 126 S. Ct. 1869, 164 L. Ed. 2d 612 (quoting <em>Mertens, </em>508 U.S., at 256, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 124 L. Ed. 2d 161). In <em>Mertens, </em>we applied this principle to a claim seeking money damages brought by a beneficiary against a private firm that provided a trustee with actuarial services. We found that the plaintiff sought \u201cnothing other than compensatory damages\u201d against a nonfidu-ciary. <em>Id., </em>at 253, 255, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 124 L. Ed. 2d 161 (emphasis deleted). And we held that such a claim, traditionally speaking, was legal, not equitable, in nature. <em>Id., </em>at 255, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 124 L. Ed. 2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">In <em>Great-West, </em>we considered a claim brought by a fiduciary against a tort-award-winning beneficiary seeking monetary reimbursement for medical outlays that the plan had previously made on the beneficiary\u2019s behalf. We noted that the fiduciary sought to obtain a hen attaching to (or a constructive trust imposed upon) money that the beneficiary had received from the tort-case defendant. But we noted that the money in question was not the \u201cparticular\u201d money that the tort defendant had paid. And, traditionally speaking, relief that sought a lien or a constructive trust was legal relief, not equitable relief, unless the funds in question were <em>\u201cparticular </em>funds or property in the defendant\u2019s possession.\u201d 534 U.S., at 213, 122 S. Ct. 708, 151 L. Ed. 2d 635 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">The case before us concerns a suit by a beneficiary against a plan fiduciary (whom ERISA typically treats as a trustee) about the terms of a plan (which ERISA typically treats as a trust). See <em>LaRue </em>v. <em>DeWolff, Boberg &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 248, 253, n. 4, 128 S. Ct. 1020, 169 L. Ed. 2d 847 (2008); <em>Varity Corp., supra, </em>at 496-497, 116 S. Ct. 1065, 134 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>130. It is the kind of lawsuit that, before the merger of law and equity, respondents could have brought only in a court of equity, not a court of law. 4 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, &amp; M. Ascher, Trusts \u00a724.1, p. 1654 (5th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Scott &amp; Ascher) (\u201cTrusts are, and always have been, the bailiwick</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">[563 U.S. 440]</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">of the courts of equity\u201d); <em>Duvall </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>2 Wheat. 45, 56, 4 L. Ed. 180 (1817) (a trustee was \u201conly suable in equity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">With the exception of the relief now provided by \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7\u00a7 198GM2) (1957) (hereinafter Second Restatement); 4 Scott &amp; Ascher \u00a7 24.2.1, the remedies available to those courts of equity were traditionally considered equitable remedies, see Second Restatement \u00a7 199; J. Adams, Doctrine of Equity: A Commentary on the Law as Administered by the Court of Chancery 61 (7th Am. ed. 1881) (hereinafter Adams); 4 Scott &amp; Ascher \u00a7 24.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">The District Court\u2019s affirmative and negative injunctions obviously fall within this category. <em>Mertens, supra, </em>at 256, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 124 L. Ed. 2d 161 (identifying injunctions, mandamus, and restitution as equitable relief ). And other relief ordered by the District Court resembles forms of traditional equitable relief. That is because equity chancellors developed a host of other \u201cdistinctively equitable\u201d remedies\u2014remedies that were \u201cfitted to the nature of the primary right\u201d they were intended to protect. 1 S. Symons, Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 108, pp. 139-140 (5th ed. 1941) (hereinafter Pomeroy). See generally 1 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 692 (12th ed. 1877) (hereinafter Story). Indeed,  a maxim of equity states that \u201c[e]quity suffers not a right to be without a remedy.\u201d R. Francis, Maxims of Equity 29 (1st Am. ed. 1823). And the relief entered here, insofar as it does not consist of injunctive relief, closely resembles three other traditional equitable remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">First, what the District Court did here may be regarded as the reformation of the terms of the plan, in order to remedy the false or misleading information CIGNA provided. The power to reform contracts (as contrasted with the power to enforce contracts as written) is a traditional power of an equity court, not a court of law, and was used to prevent fraud. See <em>Baltzer </em>v. <em>Raleigh &amp; Augusta R. Co., </em>115 U.S. 634, 645, 6 S. Ct. 216, 29 L. Ed. 505 (1885) (\u201c[I]t is well settled that equity would reform</p>\n<p id=\"AVJv\">[563 U.S. 441]</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">the contract, and enforce it, as reformed, if the mistake or fraud were shown\u201d); <em>Hearne </em>v. <em>Marine Ins. Co., </em>20 Wall. 488, 490, 22 L. Ed. 395 (1874) (\u201cThe reformation of written contracts for fraud or mistake is an ordinary head of equity jurisdiction\u201d); <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Union Bank of Tenn., </em>13 How. 57, 66, 14 L. Ed. 49 (1852); J. Eaton, Handbook of Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 306, p. 618 (1901) (hereinafter Eaton) (courts of common law could only void or enforce, but not reform, a contract); 4 Pomeroy \u00a7 1375, at 1000 (reformation \u201cchiefly occasioned by fraud or mistake,\u201d which were themselves concerns of equity courts); 1 Story \u00a7\u00a7 152-154; see also 4 Pomeroy \u00a7 1375, at 999 (equity often considered reformation a \u201cpreparatory step\u201d that \u201cestablishes the real contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Second, the District Court\u2019s remedy essentially held CIGNA to what it had promised, namely, that the new plan would not take from its employees benefits they had already accrued. This aspect of the remedy resembles estoppel, a traditional equitable rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>edy. See, <em>e.g., </em>E. Merwin, Principles of Equity and Equity Pleading \u00a7 910 (H. Merwin ed. 1895); 3 Pomeroy \u00a7 804.  Equitable estoppel \u201coperates to place the person entitled to its benefit in the same position he would have been in had the representations been true.\u201d Eaton \u00a7 62, at 176. And, as Justice Story long ago pointed out, equitable estoppel \u201cforms a very essential element in . . . fair dealing, and rebuke of all fraudulent misrepresentation, which it is the boast of courts of equity constantly to promote.\u201d 2 Story \u00a7 1533, at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Third, the District Court injunctions require the plan administrator to pay to already retired beneficiaries money owed them under the plan as reformed. But the fact that this relief takes the form of a money payment does not remove it from the category of traditionally equitable relief. Equity courts possessed the power to provide relief in the form of monetary \u201ccompensation\u201d for a loss resulting from a trustee\u2019s breach of duty, or to prevent the trustee\u2019s unjust enrichment. Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 95, and Comment</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">[563 U.S. 442]</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\"><em>a </em>(Tent. Draft No. 5, Mar. 2, 2009) (hereinafter Third Restatement); Eaton \u00a7\u00a7 211-212, at 440. Indeed, prior to the merger of law and equity this kind of monetary remedy against a trustee, sometimes called a \u201csurcharge,\u201d was \u201cexclusively equitable.\u201d <em>Princess Lida of Thurn and Taxis </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>305 U.S. 456, 464, 59 S. Ct. 275, 83 L. Ed. 285 (1939); Third Restatement \u00a7 95, and Comment <em>a; </em>G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 862 (rev. 2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Bogert); 4 Scott &amp; Ascher \u00a7\u00a7 24.2, 24.9, at 1659-1660, 1686; Second Restatement \u00a7 197; see also <em>Manhattan Bank of Memphis </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>130 U.S. 267, 271, 9 S. Ct. 519, 32 L. Ed. 959 (1889) (\u201cThe suit is plainly one of equitable cognizance, the bill being filed to charge the defendant, as a trustee, for a breach of trust\u201d); 1 J. Perry, A Treatise on the Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 17, p. 13 (2d ed. 1874) (common-law attempts \u201cto punish trustees for a breach of trust in damages, . . . w[ere] soon abandoned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust committed by a fiduciary encompassing any violation of a duty imposed upon that fiduciary. See Second Restatement \u00a7 201; Adams 59; 4 Pomeroy \u00a7 1079; 2 Story \u00a7\u00a7 1261, 1268. Thus, insofar as an award of make-whole relief is concerned, the fact that the defendant in this case, unlike the defendant in <em>Mertens, </em>is analogous to a trustee makes a critical difference. See 508 U.S., at 262-263, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 124 L. Ed. 2d 161. In sum, contrary to the District Court\u2019s fears, the types of remedies the court entered here fall within the scope of the term \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u2019 in \u00a7 502(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Section 502(a)(3) invokes the equitable powers of the District Court. We cannot know with certainty which remedy the District Court understood itself to be imposing, nor whether the District Court will find it appropriate to exercise its discretion under \u00a7 502(a)(3) to impose that remedy on remand. We need not decide which remedies are appropriate on the facts of this case in order to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute as to the appropriate legal standard in determining</p>\n<p id=\"alts-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 443]</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">whether members of the relevant employee class were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">The relevant substantive provisions of ERISA do not set forth any particular standard for determining harm. They simply require the plan admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>istrator to write and to distribute written notices that are \u201csufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise\u201d plan participants and beneficiaries of \u201ctheir rights and obligations under the plan.\u201d \u00a7 102(a); see also \u00a7\u00a7 104(b), 204(h). Nor can we find a definite standard in the ERISA provision, \u00a7 502(a)(3) (which authorizes the court to enter \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u2019 to redress ERISA \u201cviolations\u201d). Hence any requirement of harm must come from the law of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">Looking to the law of equity, there is no general principle that \u201cdetrimental reliance\u201d must be proved before a remedy is decreed. To the extent any such requirement arises, it is because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes such a requirement. Thus, as CIGNA points out, when equity courts used the remedy of <em>estoppel, </em>they insisted upon a showing akin to detrimental reliance, <em>i.e., </em>that the defendant\u2019s statement \u201cin truth, influenced the conduct of\u2019 the plaintiff, causing \u201cprejudic[e].\u201d Eaton \u00a7 61, at 175; see 3 Pomeroy \u00a7 805. Accordingly, when a court exercises its authority under \u00a7 502(a)(3) to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a showing of detrimental reliance must be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">But this showing is not always necessary for other equitable remedies. Equity courts, for example, would reform contracts to reflect the mutual understanding of the contracting parties where \u201cfraudulent suppression [s], omission [s], or insertion [s],\u201d 1 Story \u00a7 154, at 149, \u201cmaterial[ly] . . . affect[ed]\u201d the \u201csubstance\u201d of the contract, even if the \u201ccomplaining part[y]\u201d was negligent in not realizing its mistake, as long as its negligence did not fall below a standard of \u201creasonable prudence\u201d and violate a legal duty, 3 Pomeroy \u00a7\u00a7 856, 856b, at 334, 340-341. See <em>Baltzer, </em>115 U.S., at 645, 6 S. Ct. 216, 29 L. Ed. 505; Eaton \u00a7 307(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">[563 U.S. 444]</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">Nor did equity courts insist upon a showing of detrimental reliance in cases where they ordered \u201csurcharge.\u201d Rather, they simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made whole following a trustee\u2019s breach of trust. In such instances equity courts would \u201cmold the relief to protect the rights of the beneficiary according to the situation involved.\u201d Bogert \u00a7 861, at 4. This flexible approach belies a strict requirement of \u201cdetrimental reliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">To be sure, just as a court of equity would not surcharge a trustee for a nonexistent harm, 4 Scott &amp; Ascher \u00a7 24.9, a fiduciary can be surcharged under \u00a7 502(a)(3) only upon a showing of actual harm\u2014proved (under the default rule for civil cases) by a preponderance of the evidence. That actual harm may sometimes consist of detrimental reliance, but it might also come from the loss of a right protected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents. In the present case, it is not difficult to imagine how the failure to provide proper summary information, in violation of the statute, injured employees even if they did not themselves act in reliance on summary documents\u2014which they might not themselves have seen\u2014for they may have thought fellow employees, or informal workplace discussion, would have let them know if, say, plan changes would likely prove harmful. We doubt that Congress would have wanted to bar those employees from relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">The upshot is that we can agree with CIGNA only to a limited extent. We believe that, to obtain relief by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>surcharge for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and 104(b), a plan participant or beneficiary must show that the violation injured him or her. But to do so, he or she need only show harm and causation. Although it is not always necessary to meet the more rigorous standard implicit in the words \u201cdetrimental reliance,\u201d actual harm must be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\">We are not asked to reassess the evidence. And we are not asked about the other prerequisites for relief. We are asked about the standard of prejudice. And we conclude</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">[563 U.S. 445]</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">that the standard of prejudice must be borrowed from equitable principles, as modified by the obligations and injuries identified by ERISA itself. Information-related circumstances, violations, and injuries are potentially too various in nature to insist that harm must always meet that more vigorous \u201cdetrimental harm\u201d standard when equity imposed no such strict requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b958-15\">We have premised our discussion in Part III on the need for the District Court to revisit its determination of an appropriate remedy for the violations of ERISA it identified. Whether or not the general principles we have discussed above are properly applicable in this case is for it or the Court of Appeals to determine in the first instance. Because the District Court has not determined if an appropriate remedy may be imposed under \u00a7 502(a)(3), we must vacate the judgment below and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b958-6\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b958-7\">Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"ag_y-dedup-0\">with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">I agree with the Court that \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), does not authorize relief for misrepresentations in a summary plan description (SPD). I do not join the Court\u2019s opinion because I see no need and no justification for saying anything more than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA states that a plan participant or beneficiary may bring a civil action \u201cto recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">[563 U.S. 446]</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">future benefits under the terms of the plan.\u201d ERISA defines the word \u201cplan\u201d as \u201can employee welfare benefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or a plan which is both,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(3), and it requires that a \u201cplan\u201d \u201cbe established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,\u201d \u00a7 1102(a)(1). An SPD, in contrast, is a disclosure meant \u201cto reasonably apprise [plan] participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.\u201d \u00a7 1022(a). It would be peculiar for a document meant to \u201capprise\u201d participants of their rights <em>\u201cunder the plan\u201d </em>to be itself part of the \u201cplan.\u201d Any doubt that it is not is eliminated by ERISA\u2019s repeated differentiation of SPDs from the \u201cwritten instruments\u201d that constitute a plan, see, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1029(c), 1024(b)(2), and ERISA\u2019s assignment to different entities of responsibility for drafting and amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>ing SPDs on the one hand and plans on the other, see \u00a7\u00a7 1002(1), (2)(A); 1021(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. III), 1024(b)(1) (2006 ed.); <em>Beck </em>v. <em>PACE Int\u2019l Union, </em>551 U.S. 96, 101, 127 S. Ct. 2310, 168 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2007). An SPD, moreover, would not fulfill its purpose of providing an easily accessible summary of the plan if it were an authoritative part of the plan itself; the minor omissions appropriate for a summary would risk revising the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">Nothing else needs to be said to dispose of this case. The District Court based the relief it awarded upon ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), and that provision alone. It thought that the \u201cbenefits\u201d due \u201cunder the terms of the plan,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), could derive from an SPD, either because the SPD is part of the plan or because it is capable of somehow modifying the plan. Under either justification, that conclusion is wrong. An SPD is separate from a plan, and cannot amend a plan unless the plan so provides. See <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp. </em>v. <em>Schoonejongen, </em>514 U.S. 73, 79, 85, 115 S. Ct. 1223, 131 L. Ed. 2d 94 (1995). I would go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The Court, however, ventures on to address a different question: whether respondents may recover under \u00a7 502(a)(3) of ERISA, which allows plan participants \u201cto obtain other</p>\n<p id=\"af3l-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 447]</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">appropriate equitable relief.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3). The District Court expressly declined to answer this question, stating that it \u201cneed not consider whether any relief ordered under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) would also be available under \u00a7 502(a)(3).\u201d 559 F. Supp. 2d 192, 205 (Conn. 2008). It did note that \u00a7 502(a)(3) might not help respondents because that provision authorizes only relief that was \u201c <em>\u2018typically </em>available in equity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Knudson, </em>534 U.S. 204, 210, 122 S. Ct. 708, 151 L. Ed. 2d 635 (2002); some internal quotation marks omitted). But it described this question as \u201cparticularly complicated,\u201d 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205, and said that \u201cin view of these knotty issues . . . the Court need not, and does not, decide whether Plaintiffs could obtain relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3),\u201d <em>id., </em>at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">It is assuredly not our normal practice to decide issues that a lower court \u201cneed not, and does not, decide,\u201d see <em>Cooper Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aviall Services, Inc., </em>543 U.S. 157, 168-169, 125 S. Ct. 577, 160 L. Ed. 2d 548 (2004), and this case presents no exceptional reason to do so. To the contrary, it presents additional reasons not to do so. <em>Mertens </em>v. <em>Hewitt Associates, </em>508 U.S. 248, 113 S. Ct. 2063, 124 L. Ed. 2d 161 (1993), the case the District Court feared had \u201cseverely curtailed the kinds of relief. . . available under \u00a7 502(a)(3),\u201d 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205, is cited exactly one time in the parties\u2019 briefs\u2014by the CIGNA petitioners for the utterly unrelated proposition that ERISA contains a \u201c \u2018carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioners 2. And there is no discussion whatsoever of contract reformation or surcharge in the briefs of the parties or even <em>amici.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">The opinion for the Court states that the District Court \u201cstrongly implied . . . that it would base its relief upon [\u00a7 502(a)(3)] were it not for (1) the fact that ... \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) . . . provided sufficient authority; and (2) certain cases from</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">[563 U.S. 448]</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">this Court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>narrowed the application of the term \u2018appropriate equitable relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 438, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 856. I find no such implication whatever\u2014not even a weak one. The District Court simply said that \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) provided relief, and that under our cases \u00a7 502(a)(3) might not do so. While some Members of this Court have sought to divine what legislators would have prescribed beyond what they did prescribe, none to my knowledge has hitherto sought to guess what district judges would have decided beyond what they did decide. And this, bear in mind, is not just a guess as to what the District Court would have done if it had known that its \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) relief was (as we today hold) improper. The apparent answer to that is that it would have denied relief, since it thought itself constrained by \u201ccertain cases from this Court that [have] narrowed [\u00a7 502(a)(3)],\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 438, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 856. No, the course the Court guesses about is what the District Court would have done if it had known <em>both </em>that \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) denies relief <em>and </em>that \u00a7 502(a)(3) provides it. This speculation upon speculation hardly renders our discussion of \u00a7 502(a)(3) relevant to the decision below; it is utterly irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Why the Court embarks on this peculiar path is beyond me. It cannot even be explained by an eagerness to demonstrate\u2014by blatant dictum, if necessary\u2014that, by George, plan members misled by an SPD will be compensated. That they will normally be compensated is not in doubt. As the opinion for the Court notes, <em>ante, </em>at 432-433, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 852, the Second Circuit has interpreted ERISA as permitting the invalidation of plan amendments not preceded by proper notice, by reason of \u00a7 204(h), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-6\">\u201cAn applicable pension plan may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each applicable individual . . . .\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(h)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">[563 U.S. 449]</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">This provision appears a natural fit to respondents\u2019 claim, which is not that CIGNA was prohibited from changing its plan, but that CIGNA \u201cfailed to give them proper notice of changes to their benefits.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 424, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 847. It was inapplicable here only because of the peculiar facts of this case and the manner in which respondents chose to argue the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">Rather than attempting to read the District Judge\u2019s palm, I would simply remand. If the District Court dismisses the case based on an incorrect reading of <em>Mertens, </em>the Second Circuit can correct its error, and if the Second Circuit does not do so this Court can grant certiorari. The Court\u2019s discussion of the relief available under \u00a7 502(a)(3) and <em>Mertens </em>is purely dicta, binding upon neither us nor the District Court. The District Court need not read any of it\u2014and, indeed, if it takes our suggestions to heart, we may very well reverse. Even if we adhere to our dicta that contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>reformation, estoppel, and surcharge are \u201c \u2018distinctively equitable\u2019 remedies,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 440, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 857, it is far from clear that they are available remedies in this case. The opinion for the Court does not say (much less hold) that they are and disclaims the implication, see <em>ante, </em>at 442-443, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">Contract reformation is a standard remedy for altering the terms of a writing that fails to express the agreement of the parties \u201cowing to the fraud of one of the parties and mistake of the other.\u201d 27 R. Lord, Willis-ton on Contracts \u00a7 69:55, p. 160 (4th ed. 2003). But here, the Court would be employing that doctrine to alter the terms of a contract in response to a third party\u2019s misrepresentations\u2014 not those of a party</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">[563 U.S. 450]</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">to the contract. The SPD is not part of the ERISA plan, and it was not written by the plan\u2019s sponsor. Although in this case CIGNA wrote both the plan and the SPD, it did so in different capacities: as sponsor when writing the plan, and as administrator when preparing the SPD. ERISA \u201ccarefully distinguishes these roles,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 437, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 855; see also <em>Beck, </em>551 U.S., at 101, 127 S. Ct. 2310, 168 L. Ed. 2d 1, and nothing the Court cites suggests that they blend together when performed by the same entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Admittedly, reformation might be available if the third party was an agent of a contracting party and its misrepresentations could thus be attributed to it under agency law. But such a relationship has not been alleged and is unlikely here. An ERISA administrator\u2019s duty to provide employees with an SPD arises by statute, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1024(b)(1) (2006 ed.), and not by reason of its relationship to the sponsor. The administrator is a legally distinct entity. Moreover, it is incoherent to think of the administrator as agent and the sponsor as principal. Were this the case, and were the administrator contracting with employees as an agent of the sponsor in producing the SPD, then the SPD would be part of the plan or would amend it\u2014exactly what the opinion for the Court rejects in Part II-A, <em>ante. </em>And, in any event, SPDs may be furnished months after an employee accepts a pension or benefit plan. \u00a7 1024(b)(1). Reformation is meant to effectuate mutual intent at the time of contracting, and that intent is not retroactively revised by subsequent misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Equitable estoppel and surcharge are perhaps better suited to the facts of this case. CIGNA admits that respondents might be able to recover under \u00a7 502(a)(3) pursuant to an equitable estoppel theory, but it presumably makes this concession only because questions of reliance would be individualized and potentially inappropriate for class-action treatment. Surcharge (which CIGNA does not concede and which is not briefed) may encounter the same problem. The amount for which an administrator may be surcharged is, as</p>\n<p id=\"AuRo\">[563 U.S. 451]</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">the opinion for the Court notes, the \u201cactual harm\u201d suffered by an employee, <em>ante, </em>at 444, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 859\u2014that is, harm stemming from reliance on the SPD or the lost opportunity to contest or react to the switch. Cf. 3 A. Scott &amp; W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts \u00a7 205, pp. 237-243 (4th ed. 1988). A remedy relating only to that harm would of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>course be far different from what the District Court imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAN9C\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"44\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASAAAAAsAQAAAADtTVjiAAAAuklEQVR4nO3UMQrCQBAF0L9DerUQhBQJHsLGwngqLe0UK69k5zGsxcJGDTLut3MHJ2CKlJnuff6ymyVsIP6PtOj0pb7UfUltUnsIADxsfvXo9kxvOaXglR0cBIDuzKrnsAEkdb7ld+rVwAEkmRcpj7OFA0jyTDNHDwGAkf2UaQNIcm8Xjz1AMubmrDorHARALNdpA13eHDIAWlUprzcTh0CAd003GC91+QsBEKK5ZdHSobu/IPRvZqvSB0+nysyVZ9x8AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"288\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">I agree with the Court that an SPD is not part of an ERISA plan, and that, as a result, a plan participant or beneficiary may not recover for misrepresentations in an SPD under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).
