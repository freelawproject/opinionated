In August 2003, Kirk resigned from Schindler in response to what he saw as Schindler\u2019s efforts to force him out.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">In March 2005, Kirk filed this action against Schindler under  the FCA, which imposes civil penalties and treble damages on persons who submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a). The FCA authorizes both civil actions by the Attorney General and private <em>qui tam </em>actions to enforce its provisions. \u00a7 3730. When, as here, the Government chooses not to intervene in a <em>qui tam </em>action, the private relator stands to receive between 25% and 30% of the proceeds of the action. \u00a7 3730(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">In an amended complaint filed in June 2007, Kirk alleged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false claims for payment under its Government contracts. According to Kirk, Schindler had violated VEVRAA\u2019s reporting requirements by failing to file certain required VETS-100 reports and including false information in those it did file. The company\u2019s claims for payment were false, Kirk alleged, because</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">[563 U.S. 406]</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Schindler had falsely certified its compliance with VEVRAA. Kirk did not specify the amount of damages he sought on behalf of the United States, but he asserted that the value of Schindler\u2019s VEVRAA-covered contracts exceeded $100 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information his wife, Linda Kirk, received from the Department of Labor (DOL) in response to three FOIA requests. Mrs. Kirk had sought all VETS-100 reports filed by Schindler for the years 1998 through 2006. The DOL responded by letter or e-mail to each request with information about the records found for each year, including years for which no responsive records were located. The DOL informed Mrs. Kirk that it found no VETS-100 reports filed by Schindler in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, or 2003. For the other years, the DOL provided Mrs. Kirk with copies of the reports filed by Schindler, 99 in all.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">Schindler moved to dismiss on a number of grounds, including that the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar deprived the District Court of jurisdiction. See \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A). The District Court granted the motion, concluding that most of Kirk\u2019s allegations failed to state a claim and that the remainder were based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>administrative \u201creport\u201d or \u201cinvestigation.\u201d 606 F. Supp. 2d 448 (SDNY 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated and remanded. 601 F.3d 94 (2010). The court effectively held that an agency\u2019s response to a FOIA request is neither a \u201creport\u201d nor an \u201cinvestigation\u201d within the meaning of the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar. See <em>id., </em>at 103-111 (agreeing with <em>United States ex rel. Haight </em>v. <em>Catholic Healthcare West, </em>445 F.3d 1147 (CA9 2006), and disagreeing with <em>United States ex rel. Mistick PBT </em>v. <em>Housing Auth. of Pittsburgh, </em>186 F.3d 376 (CA3 1999)). We granted certiorari, 561 U.S. 1057, 131 S. Ct. 63, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1152 (2010), and now reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">[563 U.S. 407]</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Schindler argues that \u201creport\u201d in the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar carries its ordinary meaning and that the DOL\u2019s written responses to Mrs. Kirk\u2019s FOIA requests are therefore \u201creports.\u201d We agree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Adopted in 1986, the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-11\">\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">Because the statute does not define \u201creport,\u201d we look first to the word\u2019s ordinary meaning. See <em>Gross </em>v. <em>FBL Financial Services, Inc., </em>557 U.S. 167, 175, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009) (  \u201cStatutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Asgrow Seed Co. </em>v. <em>Winterboer, </em>513 U.S. 179, 187, 115 S. Ct. 788, 130 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1995) (\u201cWhen terms used in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary meaning\u201d).  A \u201creport\u201d is \u201csomething that gives information\u201d or a \u201cnotification,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1925</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">[563 U.S. 408]</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">(1986), or \u201c[a]n official or formal statement of facts or proceedings,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1300 (6th ed. 1990). See also 13 Oxford English Dictionary 650 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[a]n account brought by one person to another\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary 1103 (1981) (\u201c[a]n account or announcement that is prepared, presented, or delivered, usually in formal or organized form\u201d); Random House Dictionary 1634 (2d ed. 1987) (\u201can account or statement describing in detail an event, situation, or the like\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-18\">This broad ordinary meaning of \u201creport\u201d is consistent with the generally broad scope of the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar. As we explained last Term, to determine the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>one word in the public disclosure bar, we must consider the provision\u2019s \u201centire text,\u201d read as an \u201cintegrated whole.\u201d <em>Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Wilson, </em>559 U.S. 280, 290, 293, n. 12, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2010); see also <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 662, 121 S. Ct. 2478, 150 L. Ed. 2d 632 (2001) (\u201cWe do not . . . construe the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum\u201d). The other sources of public disclosure in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A), especially \u201cnews media,\u201d suggest that the public disclosure bar provides \u201ca broa[d] sweep.\u201d <em>Graham County, supra, </em>at 290, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225. The statute also mentions \u201cadministrative hearings\u201d twice, reflecting intent to avoid underinclusiveness even at the risk of redundancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">The phrase \u201callegations or transactions\u201d in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) additionally suggests a wide-reaching public disclosure bar. Congress covered not only the disclosure of \u201callegations\u201d but also \u201ctransactions,\u201d a term that courts have recognized as having a broad meaning. See, <em>e.g., Moore </em>v. <em>New York Cotton Exchange, </em>270 U.S. 593, 610, 46 S. Ct. 367, 70 L. Ed. 750 (1926) (\u201c\u2018Transaction\u2019 is a word of flexible meaning\u201d); <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>United Healthcare of La., Inc., </em>310 F.3d 385, 391 (CA5 2002) (\u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of the term \u2018transaction\u2019 is a broad reference to many different types of business dealings between parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">[563 U.S. 409]</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower definition of \u201creport.\u201d The Court of Appeals, in holding that FOIA responses were not \u201creports,\u201d looked to the words \u201chearing, audit, or investigation,\u201d and the phrase \u201ccriminal, civil, [and] administrative hearing[s].\u201d It concluded that all of these sources \u201cconnote the synthesis of information in an investigatory context\u201d to \u201cserve some end of the government.\u201d 601 F.3d, at 107; cf. Brief for Respondent 30, n. 15 (\u201cEach is part of the government\u2019s ongoing effort to fight fraud\u201d). Applying the <em>noscitur a sociis </em>canon, the Court of Appeals then determined that these \u201c \u2018neighboring words\u2019 \u201d mandated a narrower meaning for \u201creport\u201d than its ordinary meaning. 601 F.3d, at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">The Court of Appeals committed the very error we reversed in <em>Graham County. </em>Like the Fourth Circuit in that case, the Second Circuit here applied the <em>noscitur a sociis </em>canon only to the immediately surrounding words, to the exclusion of the rest of the statute. See 601 F.3d, at 107, n. 6. We emphasized in <em>Graham County </em>that  <em>\u201call </em>of the sources [of public disclosure] listed in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive guidance.\u201d 559 U.S., at 289 , 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225. When all of the sources are considered, the reference to \u201cnews media\u201d\u2014which the Court of Appeals did not consider\u2014suggests a much broader scope. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">The Government similarly errs by focusing only on the adjectives \u201ccongressional, administrative, or [GAO] ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which precede \u201creport.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>18. It contends that these adjectives suggest that the public disclosure bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>applies only to agency reports \u201canalogous to those that Congress and the GAO would issue or</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">[563 U.S. 410]</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As we explained in <em>Graham County, </em>however,  those three adjectives tell us nothing more than that a \u201creport\u201d must be governmental. See 559 U.S., at 289, n. 7, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225. The governmental nature of the FOIA responses at issue is not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Finally, applying the ordinary meaning of \u201creport\u201d does not render superfluous the other sources of public disclosure in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A). Kirk argues that reading \u201creport\u201d to mean \u201csomething that gives information\u201d would subsume the other words in the phrase \u201creport, hearing, audit, or investigation.\u201d Brief for Respondent 23. But Kirk admits that hearings, audits, and investigations are processes \u201cto <em>obtain </em>information.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). Those processes are thus clearly different from \u201csomething that <em>gives </em>information.\u201d Moreover, the statute contemplates some redundancy: An \u201caudit,\u201d for example, will often be a type of \u201cinvestigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">We are not persuaded that we should adopt a \u201cdifferent, somewhat special meaning\u201d of \u201creport\u201d over the word\u2019s \u201cprimary meaning.\u201d <em>Muscarello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 130, 128, 118 S. Ct. 1911, 141 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1998). Indeed,  we have cautioned recently against interpreting the public disclosure bar in a way inconsistent with a plain reading of its text. In <em>Graham County, </em>we rejected several arguments for construing the statute narrowly, twice emphasizing that the sole \u201ctouchstone\u201d in the statutory text is \u201cpublic disclosure.\u201d 559 U.S., at 292, 301, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225. We chose in that case simply to give the text its \u201cmost natura[l] reading],\u201d <em>id., </em>at 287, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225, and we do so again here.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">A written agency response to a FOIA request falls within the ordinary meaning of \u201creport.\u201d FOIA requires each agency receiving a request to \u201cnotify the person making such request of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i). When an agency denies a request in whole or in part, it must additionally \u201cset forth the names</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">[563 U.S. 411]</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial,\u201d \u201cmake a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of any [denied] matter,\u201d and \u201cprovide any such estimate to the person making the request.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i), (F).  The DOL has adopted more detailed regulations implementing FOIA and mandating a response in writing. See 29 CFR \u00a7 70.21(a) (2009) (requiring written notice of the grant of a FOIA request and a description of the manner in which records will be disclosed); \u00a7\u00a7 70.21(b)\u2014(c) (requiring a \u201cbrief statement of the reason or reasons for [a] denial,\u201d as well as written notification if a record \u201ccannot be located or has been destroyed\u201d (emphasis deleted)). So, too, have other federal agencies. See, <em>e.g., </em>28 CFR \u00a7 16.6 (2010) (Dept. of Justice); 43 CFR \u00a7 2.21 (2009) (Dept. of Interior); 7 CFR \u00a7 1.7 (2010) (Dept. of Agriculture). Such an agency response plainly is \u201csomething that gives information,\u201d a \u201cnotification,\u201d and an \u201cofficial or formal statement of facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">Any records the agency produces along with its written FOIA response are part of that response, \u201cjust as if they had been reproduced as an appendix to a printed report.\u201d <em>Mistick, </em>186 F.3d, at 384, n. 5. Noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>ing in the public disclosure bar suggests that a document and its attachments must be disaggregated and evaluated individually. If an allegation or transaction is disclosed in a record attached to a FOIA response, it is disclosed \u201cin\u201d that FOIA response and, therefore, disclosed \u201cin\u201d a report for the purposes of the public disclosure bar.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">The DOL\u2019s three written FOIA responses to Mrs. Kirk, along with their attached records, are thus reports within the meaning of the public disclosure bar. Each response was an \u201cofficial or formal statement\u201d that \u201c[gave] information\u201d and \u201cnotifiied]\u201d Mrs. Kirk of the agency\u2019s resolution of her FOIA request.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">[563 U.S. 412]</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">In interpreting a statute, \u201c[o]ur inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous,\u201d as we have found, and \u201c \u2018the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 240, 109 S. Ct. 1026, 103 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1989)). We are not persuaded by assertions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written FOIA responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">The drafting history of the public disclosure bar does not contradict our holding. As originally enacted in 1863, the FCA placed no restriction on the sources from which a <em>qui tam </em>relator could acquire information on which to base a lawsuit. See <em>Graham County, supra, </em>at 293-294, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225. Accordingly, this Court upheld the recovery of a relator, even though the Government claimed that he had discovered the basis for his lawsuit by reading a federal criminal indictment. See <em>United States ex rel. Marcus </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443 (1943). In response, Congress amended the statute to preclude such \u201cparasitic\u201d <em>qui tam </em>actions based on \u201cevidence or information in the possession of the United States ... at the time such suit was brought.\u201d 559 U.S., at 294, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225 (internal quotation marks omitted). Then, in 1986, Congress replaced the so-called Government knowledge bar with the narrower public disclosure bar. <em>Id., </em>at 294-295, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">The Court of Appeals concluded that it would be inconsistent with this drafting history to hold that written FOIA responses are reports. The court reasoned that doing so would \u201cessentially resurrect, in a significant subset of cases, the government possession standard . . . repudiated in 1986.\u201d 601 F.3d, at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">We disagree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion. As a threshold matter, \u201cthe drafting history of the public disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">[563 U.S. 413]</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">bar raises more questions than it answers.\u201d <em>Graham County, </em>559 U.S., at 296, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225. In any event, it is hardly inconsistent with the drafting history to read the public disclosure bar as operating similarly to the Government knowledge bar in a \u201csubset of cases.\u201d 601 F.3d, at 109. As we have observed, \u201c[r]ather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>simply repeal the Government knowledge bar,\u201d the public disclosure bar was \u201can effort to strike <em>a balance </em>between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits.\u201d 559 U.S., at 294-295, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">If anything, the drafting history supports our holding. The sort of case that Kirk has brought seems to us a classic example of the \u201copportunistic\u201d litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to discourage. <em>Id., </em>at 294, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although Kirk alleges that he became suspicious from his own experiences as a veteran working at Schindler, anyone could have filed the same FOIA requests and then filed the same suit. Similarly, anyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he discovers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially reap a windfall in a <em>qui tam </em>action under the FCA. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>20 (\u201cGovernment contractors . . . are required to submit certifications related to everything from how they dispose of hazardous materials to their affirmative action plans\u201d (citing 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142 and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 793)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">[563 U.S. 414]</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written FOIA responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences.  FOIA requires agencies to release some records even absent a request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(1), (2). Kirk argues that it would be strange that two relators could obtain copies of the same document but that only the relator who got the document in response to a FOIA request would find his case barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">This argument assumes that records released under FOIA, but not attached to a written FOIA response, do not fall within the public disclosure bar. We do not decide that question. But even assuming, as Kirk does, that such records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, we are not troubled by the different treatment.  By its plain terms, the public disclosure bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to others. See <em>Graham County, supra, </em>at 285, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225 (\u201c[T]he FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar . .. deprives courts of jurisdiction over <em>qui tam </em>suits when the relevant information has already entered the public domain through <em>certain channels\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). It would not be anomalous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the scope of the public disclosure bar and some did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">We also are not concerned that potential defendants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA request for incriminating documents. This argument assumes that the public disclosure of information in a written FOIA response forever taints that information for purposes of the public disclosure bar. But it may be that a relator who comes by that information from a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>source has a legitimate argument that his lawsuit is not \u201cbased upon\u201d the initial public disclosure. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A). That question has divided the Courts of Appeals, and we do not resolve it here. See <em>Glaser </em>v. <em>Wound Care Consultants,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">[563 U.S. 415]</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\"><em>Inc., </em>570 F.3d 907, 915 (CA7 2009) (describing the split in authority). It may also be that such a relator qualifies for the \u201coriginal source\u201d exception.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">In any event, the notion that potential defendants will make FOIA requests to insulate themselves from liability is pure speculation. Cf. <em>Graham County, supra, </em>at 300, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225 (rejecting as \u201cstrained speculation\u201d an argument that local governments will manipulate the public disclosure bar to escape liability). There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that have long held that FOIA responses are \u201creports\u201d within the meaning of the public disclosure bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Even if we accepted these extratex-tual arguments, Kirk and his <em>amici </em>have provided no principled way to define \u201creport\u201d to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documents that are indisputably reports. The Government, for example, struggled to settle on a single definition. Compare Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>19 (\u201creport\u201d must be read to \u201creflect a focus on situations in which the government is conducting, or has completed, some focused inquiry or analysis concerning the relevant facts\u201d) with <em>id., </em>at 21 (\u201cA FOIA response is not a \u2018report\u2019 . . . because the federal agency is not charged with uncovering the truth of any matter\u201d), and Tr. of Oral Arg. 33 (\u201c[T]he way to think about it is whether or not the agency ... is engaging in a</p>\n<p id=\"AkjF\">[563 U.S. 416]</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">substantive inquiry into and a substantive analysis of information\u201d). It is difficult to see how the Department of Justice\u2019s \u201cAnnual Report\u201d of FOIA statistics\u2014something that is indisputably a Government report\u2014would qualify under the latter two definitions. See Dept, of Justice, Freedom of Information Act Annual Report, Fiscal Year 2010, http://www.justice.gov/oip/ annual_report/2010/cover.htm (as visited May 12, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 19 (Kirk conceding that the DOJ annual report is a report). And even if the first definition arguably encompasses that report, it would seem also to include FOIA responses, which convey the results of a Government agency\u2019s \u201cfocused inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">Kirk also was unable to articulate a workable definition. His various proposed definitions suffer the same deficiencies as the Government\u2019s. Compare Brief for Respondent 27 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 17-18 with Brief for Respondent 34-39 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. Kirk\u2019s first suggestion would exclude \u201ca lot of things that are labeled . . . report,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 22, and the second\u2014the definition advanced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Court of Appeals\u2014would seem to include written FOIA responses, <em>id., </em>at 28-29. In the end, it appears that the \u201conly argument is that FOIA is a different kind of mission\u201d\u2014\u201ca special case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 31. We see no basis for that distinction and adhere to the principle that undefined statutory terms carry their ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"pA5SN\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"35\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARsAAAAiAQAAAABHVEBdAAAAu0lEQVR4nO2TIQ7CQBREX38gIRg4AXAQEnoQLoHDgeQUVRwCicCTcAJAoCGYioZBIPbTL2oqEIx7k5lkdrObiUZdrDkDbYfWzvkaqRTS3vmvdYD2NiFJxVJJ00cdzgaw8KVrBANYlsnP7vcABjB/uvbuFkGSqrGbUc7q8NlkE1fu5AEM4OlDtzyAAZz8bW07AQzgMHD+ZhTAADa9ZGs4DGAAx27ys6IfQZJe/tTVqg7n9l5B9rO/5R9q0htF/Yrbb83RQwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"282\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\">The DOL\u2019s three written FOIA responses in this case, along with the accompanying records produced to Mrs. Kirk, are reports within the meaning of the public disclosure bar.

The OFCCP investigated Schindler\u2019s compliance with VEVRAA and found insufficient evidence to support Kirk\u2019s claim.

Although the statute refers to the \u201cGovernment Accounting Office,\u2019\u2019 it is undisputed that Congress meant the General Accounting Office, also known as GAO and now renamed the Government Accountability Office.

Some Courts of Appeals have narrowly construed the exception to limit \u201coriginal sources\u2019\u2019 to those who were the cause of the public disclosure, while others have been more generous.

Respondent Daniel A. Kirk, a Vietnam War veteran and a former employee of petitioner Schindler Elevator Corporation (Schindler), had cause to believe, based on his own experience and observations, that Schindler failed to meet VEVRAA\u2019s annual information-reporting requirements. To confirm and support his on-the-job observations, Kirk obtained, through several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Department of Labor (DOL), copies of Schindler\u2019s VEVRAA filings. The DOL responses revealed that, in some years, Schindler filed no information, while in some other years, the corporation filed false information. Armed with DOL\u2019s confirmation of his own impressions, Kirk commenced suit against Schindler under the federal False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">In a carefully developed, highly persuasive opinion, the Second Circuit explained why a federal agency\u2019s response to a FOIA request should not automatically qualify as a \u201creport, hearing, audit, or investigation\u201d pre-clusive of a whistleblower\u2019s lawsuit under the public disclosure bar of the FCA, \u00a7 3730(e)(4). I would affirm the Second Circuit\u2019s judgment</p>\n<p id=\"AHyR\">[563 U.S. 418]</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">as faithful to the text, context, purpose, and history of the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">The Court finds no \u201ctextual basis\u201d for the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language. <em>Ante, </em>at 409, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 835. But the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion considered text as well as context. Leaving aside the term \u201creport,\u201d the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-19\">\u201cAll of the other terms in [\u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s] list of enumerated sources connote the synthesis of information in an investigatory context. \u2018[C]riminal, civil, [and] administrative hearings,\u2019 for instance, all entail a government inquiry into a given subject, here into an alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>case of fraud. Similarly, government \u2018hearing[s and] audit[s]\u2019 are processes by which information is compiled with the concerted aim of deepening a government entity\u2019s knowledge of a given subject or, often, determining whether a party is in compliance with applicable law. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-4\">\u201cIn this context, the term \u2018report\u2019 most readily bears a narrower meaning than simply \u2018something that gives information.\u2019 Rather, it connotes the compilation or analysis of information with the aim of synthesizing that information in order to serve some end of the government, as in a \u2018hearing\u2019 or \u2018audit.\u2019 It does not naturally extend to cover the mechanistic production of documents in response to a FOIA request made by a member of the public.\u201d 601 F.3d 94, 107 (2010) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Focusing on the FOIA requests in this case, the Court of Appeals observed that DOL\u2019s responses did not \u201csynthesize the documents or their contents with the aim of itself gleaning any insight or information, as ... it necessarily would in conducting a \u2018hearing\u2019 or \u2018audit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 108. Far from \u201ccompil[ing] or synthesizing] information to serve its own investigative or analytic ends,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 111, DOL merely assembled and duplicated records, or noted the absence of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">[563 U.S. 419]</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Contrary to the Court\u2019s assertion, moreover, the Second Circuit was mindful of the \u201cerror we reversed in <em>Graham County [Soil and Water Conservation Dist. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Wilson, </em>559 U.S. 280, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2010)],\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 409, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 835; the Court of Appeals used the <em>noscitur a sociis </em>canon only \u201cas a guide in sifting through the common understandings of \u2018report\u2019 and \u2018investigation\u2019 to discover their intended meaning within the FCA.\u201d 601 F.3d, at 108, n. 6. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-9\">\u201cWe . . . have not used the canon to impose commonality on terms that \u2018do not share any . . . core of meaning,\u2019 <em>Graham County, </em>[559 U.S., at 289, n. 7, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225]. To the contrary, the terms \u2018hearing,\u2019 \u2018report,\u2019 \u2018audit,\u2019 and \u2018investigation\u2019 all refer to processes of uncovering and analyzing information or to the products of those processes. Our interpretation focuses on their shared \u2018core of meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">The Court faults the Court of Appeals for not considering \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s \u201creference to \u2018news media,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 409, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 835, suggesting that this omission overlooked <em>Graham County\u2019s </em>observation that <em>\u201call </em>of the sources [of public disclosure] listed in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive guidance,\u201d 559 U.S. 280, 289, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 176 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2010). Schindler did not make this argument below. In any event, the point would have been unavailing. Disclosures \u201cof allegations or transactions . . . from the <em>news </em>media,\u201d \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (emphasis added), share a common core of meaning with disclosures in other sources that involve \u201cprocesses of uncovering and analyzing information or . . . the products of those processes.\u201d 601 F.3d, at 108, n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">The Court regards the case Kirk has brought as \u201ca classic example of the \u2018opportunistic\u2019 litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to discourage.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 413, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 838. But as the Second Circuit observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>\u201c[T]he facts of this case belie the assertion that individuals who are not original sources and who obtain information</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-4\">[563 U.S. 420]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-5\">through FOIA requests will generally not be persons with firsthand knowledge of fraud but rather will be opportunistic litigators. The facts also illustrate how an overbroad reading of the jurisdictional bar would prevent an individual with independent but partial knowledge of a possible fraud would be barred from bringing a lawsuit that is neither parasitic nor frivolous.\u201d 601 F.3d, at 110 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">By ranking DOL\u2019s ministerial response an \u201cadministrative . . . report,\u201d akin to a \u201cGovernment Accounting Office report,\u201d \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted), the Court weakens the force of the FCA as a weapon against fraud on the part of Government contractors. Why should a whistleblower attentive to the heightened pleading standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) be barred from court if he seeks corroboration for his allegations, as Kirk did, through a FOIA request simply for copies of a contractor\u2019s filings? After today\u2019s decision, which severely limits whistleblowers\u2019 ability to substantiate their allegations before commencing suit, that question is worthy of Congress\u2019 attention.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
