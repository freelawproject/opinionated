The question in this case is whether a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law tolls the limitation period, thereby rendering respondent Khalil Kholi\u2019s federal habeas petition timely. We hold that the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d in \u00a7 2244(d)(2) means judicial review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review. Because the parties agree that a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>not part of the direct review process, we hold that respondent\u2019s motion tolled the AEDPA limitation</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">[562 U.S. 548]</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">period and that his federal habeas petition was therefore timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">In 1993, respondent was convicted in Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts of first-degree sexual assault, and he was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment. Respondent raised various challenges to his conviction on direct appeal, but the Supreme Court of Rhode Island affirmed his conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kholi, </em>672 A.2d 429, 431 (1996). The parties agree that respondent\u2019s conviction became final on direct review when his time expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court. Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 4; Brief for Respondent 3, n. 1; 582 F.3d 147, 150 (CA1 2009); see generally <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Quarterman, </em>555 U.S. 113, 119, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475 (2009). That date was May 29, 1996. See this Court\u2019s Rules 13.1, 13.3, 30.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">In addition to taking a direct appeal, respondent filed two state motions that are relevant to our decision. The first, filed on May 16, 1996, was a motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> App. 8. In that motion, respondent asked</p>\n<p id=\"AAg\">[562 U.S. 549]</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">the trial court to \u201creconsider its prior determination\u201d and \u201corder that his life sentences run concurrently.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kholi, </em>706 A.2d 1326 (R. I. 1998) (order). Concluding that \u201cthe sentence imposed was appropriate,\u201d the hearing justice denied the Rule 35 motion. <em>Ibid. </em>On January 16, 1998, the State Supreme Court affirmed and observed that the facts clearly justified the sentence. <em>Id., </em>at 1326-1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">On May 23, 1997, while the Rule 35 motion was pending, respondent also filed an application for state postcon-viction relief, see R. I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 10-9.1-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Lexis 1997) (titled \u201cPost Conviction Remedy\u201d), which challenged his conviction. The trial court denied this motion as well, and the State Supreme Court affirmed that decision on December 14, 2006. <em>Kholi </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>911 A.2d 262, 263-264 (R. I. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">Respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the District of Rhode Island on September 5, 2007. App. 3. By that time, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.  AEDPA generally requires a federal habeas petition to be filed within one year of the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). But the 1-year limitation period is tolled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>during the pendency of \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">There is no dispute that respondent\u2019s application for postconviction relief tolled the limitation period for over nine years\u2014from May 23, 1997, through December 14, 2006. 582 F.3d, at 151. Even after subtracting that stretch of time from the 11-year period, however, the period between the conclusion of direct review and the filing of the federal habeas petition still exceeds one year. Thus, in order for respondent\u2019s petition to be timely, the Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence must also trigger the tolling provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">[562 U.S. 550]</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Respondent\u2019s federal habeas petition was referred to a Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation, and the Magistrate Judge concluded that the Rule 35 motion was not a \u201c \u2018properly filed application for post-conviction or other collateral review\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) because it was \u201ca \u2018plea of leniency,\u2019 and not a motion challenging the legal sufficiency of his sentence.\u201d No. CA 07-346S, 2008 WL 60194, *4 (D RI, Jan. 3, 2008). The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation and therefore dismissed the federal habeas petition as untimely. See <em>id., </em>at *1. On appeal, the First Circuit reversed. 582 F.3d 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The Courts of Appeals are divided over the question whether a motion to reduce sentence tolls the period of limitation under \u00a7 2244(d)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted certiorari to answer this question with respect to a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law. 560 U.S. 903, 130 S. Ct. 3274, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1181 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">AEDPA establishes a 1-year period of limitation for a state prisoner to file a federal application for a writ of habeas corpus. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). This period runs \u201cfrom the latest of\u2019 four specified dates, including \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); see also <em>Jimenez, supra, </em>at 119, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475 (explaining when \u201cthe conclusion of direct review occurs\u201d). The limitation period is tolled, however, during the pendency of \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">[562 U.S. 551]</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">or claim.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The question in this case is whether a motion for reduction of sentence under Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 is an \u201capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">The parties agree that the answer to this question turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201ccollateral review,\u201d see Brief for Petitioner 19; Brief for Respondent 12-13, but they disagree about the definition of that term. Rhode Island argues that \u201ccollateral review\u201d includes only \u201clegal\u201d challenges to a conviction or sentence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>thus excludes motions seeking a discretionary sentence reduction. Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that \u201ccollateral review\u201d is \u201creview other than review of a judgment in the direct appeal process\u201d and thus includes motions to reduce sentence. Brief for Respondent 17. We agree with respondent\u2019s understanding of \u201ccollateral review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u201cCollateral review\u201d is not defined in AEDPA, and we have never provided a comprehensive definition of that term. See <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 175-178, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2001). We therefore begin by considering the ordinary understanding of the phrase \u201ccollateral review.\u201d See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 431, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000) (  \u201cWe give the words of a statute their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to bear some different import\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 219, 122 S. Ct. 2134, 153 L. Ed. 2d 260 (2002) (considering the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cpending\u201d in \u00a7 2244(d)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The term \u201ccollateral,\u201d in its \u201ccustomary and preferred sense,\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>at 431, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435, means \u201c[l]ying aside from the main subject, line of action, issue, purpose, etc.; . . . subordinate, indirect,\u201d 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473 (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter OED); see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 444 (1993) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s) (\u201caccompanying as . . . secondary,\u201d \u201cindirect,\u201d or \u201cancillary\u201d). By definition, something that is \u201ccollateral\u201d is \u201cindirect,\u201d not</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">[562 U.S. 552]</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">direct. 3 OED 473. This suggests that \u201ccollateral\u201d review is review that is \u201c[l]ying aside from the main\u201d review, <em>i.e., </em>that is not part of direct review. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The definition of the related phrase \u201ccollateral attack\u201d points in the same direction. A \u201ccollateral attack\u201d is \u201c[a]n attack on a judgment in a proceeding <em>other than a direct appeal.\u201d </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added); cf. Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 10.73.090(2) (2008) (defining \u201ccollateral attack\u201d as \u201cany form of postcon-viction relief other than a direct appeal\u201d). This usage buttresses the conclusion that  \u201ccollateral review\u201d means a form of review that is not part of the direct appeal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Our prior usage of the term \u201ccollateral\u201d also supports this understanding. We have previously described a variety of proceedings as \u201ccollateral,\u201d and all of these proceedings share the characteristic that we have identified, <em>i.e., </em>they stand apart from the process of direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">For example, our cases make it clear that habeas corpus is a form of collateral review. We have used the terms habeas corpus and \u201ccollateral review\u201d interchangeably, see, <em>e.g., Murray </em>v. <em>Carrier, 477 </em>U.S. 478, 482-483, 106 S. Ct. 2639, 91 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1986), and it is well accepted that state petitions for habeas corpus toll the limitation period, <em>e.g., Rhines </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>544 U.S. 269, 272, 125 S. Ct. 1528, 161 L. Ed. 2d 440 (2005) (\u201c[T]he 1-year statute of limitations . . . was tolled while Rhines\u2019 state habeas corpus petition was pending\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">We have also described <em>coram nobis </em>as a means of \u201ccollateral attack,\u201d see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 510-511, 74 S. Ct. 247, 98 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>248 (1954) (internal quotation marks omitted), and we have used the term \u201ccollateral\u201d to describe proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and a prior version of Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1960), we distinguished between the process of direct appeal and \u201ca number of collateral remedies,\u201d including Federal Rule 35 motions, \u00a7 2255 motions, and</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">[562 U.S. 553]</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><em>coram nobis. Id., </em>at 230, n. 14, 80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259. Similarly, in <em>Bartone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>375 U.S. 52, 84 S. Ct. 21, 11 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1963) <em>(per curiam), </em>we drew a distinction between a \u201c[d]irect attack\u201d on a criminal judgment and \u201ccollateral proceedings,\u201d such as Rule 35, habeas corpus, and \u00a7 2255 proceedings. <em>Id., </em>at 53-54, 84 S. Ct. 21, 11 L. Ed. 2d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">All of the proceedings identified in these prior opinions as \u201ccollateral\u201d are separate from the direct review process, and thus our prior usage of the term \u201ccollateral\u201d buttresses the conclusion that \u201ccollateral review\u201d means a form of review that is not direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Of course,  to trigger the tolling provision, a \u201ccollateral\u201d proceeding must also involve a form of \u201creview,\u201d but the meaning of that term seems clear. \u201cReview\u201d is best understood as an \u201cact of inspecting or examining\u201d or a \u201cjudicial reexamination.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1944; see also Black\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 1434 (\u201c[c]onsideration, inspection, or reexamination of a subject or thing\u201d); 13 OED 831 (\u201c[t]o submit (a decree, act, etc.) to examination or revision\u201d). We thus agree with the First Circuit that \u201c \u2018review\u2019 commonly denotes \u2018a looking over or examination with a view to amendment or improvement.\u2019 \u201d 582 F.3d, at 153 (quoting Webster\u2019s 1944 (2002)). Viewed as a whole, then, \u201ccollateral review\u201d of a judgment or claim means a judicial reexamination of a judgment or claim in a proceeding outside of the direct review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">We now apply this definition of \u201ccollateral review\u201d to a Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Rules of Criminal Procedure is much like the version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 that was in force prior to the enactment of the federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the promulgation of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Byrnes, </em>456</p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">[562 U.S. 554]</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">A.2d 742, 744 (R. I. 1983) <em>(per curiam); </em>Reporter\u2019s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., p. 620 (Lexis 2010). Under the Rhode Island Rules, a Rule 35 motion permits a court to provide relief from a sentence in three ways: A court \u201cmay\u201d \u201ccorrect an illegal sentence,\u201d \u201ccorrect a sentence imposed in an illegal manner,\u201d and \u201creduce any sentence.\u201d R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a); see n. 1, <em>supra. </em>In this case, respondent filed a motion to reduce his sentence, which permits a trial justice to decide \u201c \u2018 \u201con reflection or on the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence originally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruffner, </em>5 A.3d 864, 867 (R. I. 2010) (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Mendoza, </em>958 A.2d 1159, 1161 (R. I. 2008)); see also Reporter\u2019s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., at 620-621. Rhode Island courts have, at times, referred to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>a motion as a \u201c \u2018plea for leniency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruffner, supra, </em>at 867 (quoting <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>at 1161).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">A Rule 35 motion is made in the Superior Court, and it is generally heard by the same trial justice who sentenced the defendant. <em>Byrnes, supra, </em>at 745. The Rhode Island Supreme Court has explained that a motion to reduce sentence is \u201c \u2018addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice\u2019 \u201d and that appellate review of the trial justice\u2019s decision is limited. <em>Ruffner, supra, </em>at 867 (quoting <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>at 1161). An appellate court may nevertheless disturb the trial justice\u2019s decision \u201cwhen the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.\u201d <em>Ruffner, supra, </em>at 867 (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>984 A.2d 650, 654 (R. I. 2009); internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Ruffner, supra, </em>at 867 (asking whether trial justice \u201cabuse[d] his discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">With these principles in mind, we consider whether Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is an application for \u201ccollateral review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">[562 U.S. 555]</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The first\u2014and the critical\u2014question is whether a Rhode Island Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is \u201ccollateral.\u201d Respondent and Rhode Island agree that such a motion is not part of the direct review process. Moreover, we have previously referred to a motion to reduce sentence under old Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as invoking a \u201ccollateral\u201d remedy, see <em>Robinson, </em>361 U.S., at 230, n. 14, and Rhode Island\u2019s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to former Federal Rule 35, <em>Byrnes, supra, </em>at 744. Lower courts have also referred to Federal Rule 35 sentence reduction motions as \u201ccollateral.\u201d See, <em>e.g., Fernandez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1492 (CA11 1991) (\u201cFernandez initiated a collateral attack on his sentence with a Rule 35(b) motion to reduce his sentence\u201d under the old Federal Rule). We thus have little difficulty concluding that  a Rhode Island sentence reduction proceeding is \u201ccollateral.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Not only is a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law \u201ccollateral,\u201d but it also undoubtedly calls for \u201creview\u201d of the sentence. The decision to reduce a sentence,</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">[562 U.S. 556]</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">while largely within the discretion of the trial justice, involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine whether a more lenient sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>is proper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When ruling on such a motion, a trial justice is guided by several factors, including \u201c(1) the severity of the crime, (2) the defendant\u2019s personal, educational, and employment background, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the element of societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness of the punishment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mollicone, </em>746 A.2d 135, 138 (R. I. 2000) <em>(per curiam) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Ruffner, supra, </em>at 867; <em>Coleman, supra, </em>at 655. On appeal from a trial justice\u2019s decision on a motion to reduce sentence, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island evaluates the trial justice\u2019s justifications in light of the relevant sentencing factors to determine whether a sentence is \u201cwithout justification\u201d and \u201cgrossly disparate from other sentences.\u201d <em>Ruffner, supra, </em>at 867 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This process surely qualifies as \u201creview\u201d of a sentence within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">We thus hold that  a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is an application for \u201ccollateral review\u201d that triggers AEDPA\u2019s tolling provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">[562 U.S. 557]</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In resisting this interpretation, Rhode Island advances several arguments that we find unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The first of these arguments begins by observing that, whenever our opinions have used the precise phrase \u201ccollateral review,\u201d the proceeding in question was one challenging the \u201clawfulness\u201d of a prior judgment, Brief for Petitioner 21-22, such as a \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2255 action, see <em>id., </em>at 25. Rhode Island argues that Congress, in enacting AEDPA, must be presumed to have been aware of this usage and must have intended the phrase to carry this narrow meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">This argument reads far too much into these prior references to \u201ccollateral review.\u201d  While our opinions have used the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d to refer to proceedings that challenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, we have never suggested that the phrase may properly be used to describe only proceedings of this type. In addition, Rhode Island overlooks opinions describing a motion to reduce sentence as \u201ccollateral.\u201d <em>E.g., Robinson, supra, </em>at 230, n. 14, 80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259; <em>Fernandez, supra, </em>at 1492; see also 1 D. Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook \u00a7\u00a7 1:2, 1:7, pp. 2, 15 (2010) (hereinafter Postconviction Remedies) (characterizing a motion to reduce sentence as a \u201ccollateral\u201d or \u201cpostconviction\u201d remedy).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">In a related argument, Rhode Island notes that several other AEDPA provisions use the term \u201ccollateral review\u201d to refer to proceedings that involve a challenge to the lawfulness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of a state-court judgment, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A), (d)(1)(C), 2254(e)(2)(A)(i),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Rhode Island reasons that the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d in \u00a7 2244(d)(2) should be limited to proceedings of this nature. This argument has the same flaw as the argument just discussed.  Just because the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d encompasses proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">[562 U.S. 558]</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">that challenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, it does not follow that other proceedings may not also be described as involving \u201ccollateral review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Finally, Rhode Island contends that the purpose of the tolling provision is to allow a state prisoner to exhaust state remedies and that this purpose is not served when a prisoner\u2019s state application merely seeks sentencing leniency, a matter that cannot be raised in a federal habeas petition. This argument is based on an excessively narrow understanding of \u00a7 2244(d)(2)\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">It is certainly true that <em>a </em>purpose\u2014and perhaps the chief purpose\u2014of tolling under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) is to permit the exhaustion of state remedies, see <em>Duncan, </em>533 U.S., at 178-179, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, but that is not \u00a7 2244(d)(2)\u2019s only role. The tolling provision \u201cprovides a powerful incentive for litigants to exhaust <em>all </em>available state remedies before proceeding in the lower federal courts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 180, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251 (emphasis added). Tolling the limitation period for all \u201ccollateral review\u201d motions provides both litigants and States with an opportunity to resolve objections at the state level, potentially obviating the need for a litigant to resort to federal court. If, for example, a litigant obtains relief on state-law grounds, there may be no need for federal ha-beas. The same dynamic may be present to a degree with respect to motions that do not challenge the lawfulness of a judgment. If a defendant receives relief in state court, the need for federal habeas review may be narrowed or even obviated, and this furthers principles of \u201ccomity, finality, and federalism.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S., at 436, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Rhode Island\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) would also greatly complicate the work of federal habeas courts. Rhode Island would require those courts to separate motions for a reduced sentence into two categories: those that challenge a sentence on legal grounds and those that merely ask for leniency. But this taxonomy is problematic.  Even if a jurisdiction allows sentencing judges to exercise a high degree of discretion in selecting a sentence from within a prescribed</p>\n<p id=\"asg-dedup-1\">[562 U.S. 559]</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">range, it does not necessarily follow that the judge\u2019s choice is insulated from challenge on legal grounds. \u201c[D]iscretionary choices are not left to a court\u2019s \u2018inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Albemarle Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 416, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1975) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>25 F. Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.)). If the law of a jurisdiction provides criteria to guide a trial judge\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion, a motion to reduce sentence may argue that a sentence is inconsistent with those criteria. In that sense, the motion argues that the sentence is contrary to sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>law. See, <em>e.g., Ruffner, </em>5 A.3d, at 867 (\u201cAtrial justice considers a number of factors when determining a fair sentence [,] including the defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation. The defendant asserts that the trial justice did not consider defendant\u2019s participation in rehabilitative programs\u201d (citations omitted)). We do not think that \u00a7 2244(d)(2) was meant to require federal habeas courts to draw the sort of difficult distinction that Rhode Island\u2019s interpretation would demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">We also reject the argument that the meaning of the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d should turn on whether the motion or application that triggers that review is captioned as a part of the criminal case or as a separate proceeding. See <em>Walkowiak </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>272 F.3d 234, 237 (CA4 2001). This interpretation of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) would produce confusion and inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">For one thing, some \u201ccollateral\u201d proceedings are often regarded as part of the criminal case. We have said, for example, that a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>\u201cis a step in the criminal case and not <em>... a </em>separate case and record, the beginning of a separate civil proceeding.\u201d <em>Morgan, </em>346 U.S., at 505, n. 4, 74 S. Ct. 247, 98 L. Ed. 248; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Denedo, </em>556 U.S. 904, 913, 129 S. Ct. 2213, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1235 (2009) (\u201c[A]n application for the writ is properly viewed as a belated extension of the original proceeding during which the error allegedly transpired\u201d). But we have nonetheless suggested</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">[562 U.S. 560]</p>\n<p id=\"Adlfa\">that <em>coram nobis </em>is a means of \u201ccollateral attack.\u201d <em>Morgan, supra, </em>at 510-511 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Robinson, </em>361 U.S., at 230, n. 14, 80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259. Similarly, a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2006 ed., Supp. Ill) is entered on the docket of the original criminal case and is typically referred to the judge who originally presided over the challenged proceedings, see \u00a7 2255 Rules 3(b), 4(a), but there is no dispute that \u00a7 2255 proceedings are \u201ccollateral,\u201d see, <em>e.g., Massaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S. Ct. 1690, 155 L. Ed. 2d 714 (2003) (describing \u00a7 2255 proceedings as \u201ccollateral\u201d); <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 379, 121 S. Ct. 1578, 149 L. Ed. 2d 590 (2001) (same).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Moreover, the methods of filing for postconviction or collateral review vary among the States. In the District of Columbia and 14 States, the principal postconviction remedy is part of the original case; in other States, it is not. Postconviction Remedies \u00a7 1:3, at 6-7. Given the States\u2019\u201cdifferent forms of collateral review,\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>533 U.S., at 177, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, the application of AED-PA\u2019s tolling provision should not turn on such formalities. See <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cCongress may have refrained from exclusive reliance on the term \u2018post-conviction\u2019 so as to leave no doubt that the tolling provision applies to all types of state collateral review available after a conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">We thus define \u201ccollateral review\u201d according to its ordinary meaning: It refers to judicial review that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>occurs in a proceeding outside of the direct review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"afh-dedup-0\">For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Az9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-17\">. This Rule provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-18\">\u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.

We can imagine an argument that a Rhode Island Rule 35 proceeding is in fact part of direct review under \u00a7 2244(d)(1) because, according to the parties, defendants in Rhode Island cannot raise any challenge to their sentences on direct appeal; instead, they must bring a Rule 35 motion. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>925 A.2d 962, 985 (R. I. 2007) (\u201cIt is well settled in this jurisdiction that a challenge to a criminal sentence must begin with the filing of a [Rule 35] motion .... [W]e will not consider the validity or legality of a sentence on direct appeal unless extraordinary circumstances exist\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>State </em>v. <em>McManus, </em>990 A.2d 1229, 1238 (R. I. 2010) (refusing to consider Eighth Amendment challenge on direct review because \u201c[t]o challenge a criminal sentence, the defendant must first file a motion to reduce in accordance with Rule 35\u2019\u2019); see also <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Quarterman, </em>555 U.S. 113, 120, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475 (2009). That issue has not been briefed or argued by the parties, however, and we express no opinion as to the merit of such an argument. Even if we were to assume that a Rhode Island Rule 35 motion is part of direct review, our disposition of this case would not change: Respondent\u2019s habeas petition still would be timely, because the limitation period would not have begun to run until after the Rule 35 proceedings concluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b362-12\">.
