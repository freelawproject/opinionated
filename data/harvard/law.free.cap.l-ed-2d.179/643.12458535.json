Petition for writ of certiorari denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-23\">Statement of</p>\n<author id=\"avof-dedup-1\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<judges id=\"A2_D\">with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, respecting the denial of certiorari.</judges>\n<p id=\"b741-24\">Our cases recognize a limited exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement for searches of businesses in \u201cclosely regulated industries.\u201d See, <em>e.g., New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. 691, 699-703, 107 S. Ct. 2636, 96 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). The thinking is that, other things being equal, the \u201cexpectation of privacy in commercial premises\u201d is significantly less than the \u201cexpectation in an individual\u2019s home.\u201d Id., at 700, 107 S. Ct. 2636, 96 L. Ed. 2d 601. And where a business operates in an industry with a \u201clong tradition of close government supervision\u201d\u2014liquor dealers and pawnbrokers are classic examples\u2014the expectation of privacy becomes \u201cparticularly attenuated.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-25\">In this case, a New Jersey appellate court applied this doctrine to uphold a warrantless search by a state environmental official of Robert and Michelle Huber\u2019s backyard. No. A-5874-07T3, 2010 WL 173533, *9-*10 (Super. Ct. N.J., App. Div., Jan. 20, 2010) <em>(per curiam). </em>The Hubers\u2019 residential property contains wetlands protected by a New Jersey environmental statute. See N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13:9B-1 <em>et seq. </em>(West 2003 and Supp. 2010). According to the court below, the presence of these wetlands brought the Hubers\u2019 yard \u201cdirectly under the regulatory arm\u201d of the State \u201cjust as much\u201d as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the yard had been involved in a \u201cregulated industry.\u201d 2010 WL 173533, *10.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">This Court has not suggested that a State, by imposing heavy regulations on the use of privately owned residential property, may escape the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. But because this case comes to us on review of a decision by a state intermediate appellate court, I agree that today\u2019s denial of certio-rari is appropriate. See this Court\u2019s Rule 10. It does bear mentioning, however, that \u201cdenial of certiorari does not constitute an expression of any opinion on the merits.\u201d <em>Boumediene </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>549 U.S. 1328, 1329, 127 S. Ct. 1478, 167 L. Ed. 2d 578 (2007) (Stevens and Kennedy, JJ., statement respecting denial of certiorari).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
