A jury convicted Bryant of, <em>inter alia, </em>second-degree murder. 483 Mich. 132, 137, 768 N.W.2d 65, 67-68 (2009). On appeal, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, as explained in our decisions in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), and <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (2006), rendered Covington\u2019s statements inadmissible testimonial hearsay, and the court reversed Bryant\u2019s conviction. 483 Mich., at 157, 768 N.W.2d, at 79. We granted</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">[562 U.S. 349]</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider whether the Confrontation Clause barred the admission at trial of Covington\u2019s statements to the police. We hold that the circumstances of the interaction between Covington and the police objectively indicate that the \u201cprimary purpose of the interrogation\u201d was \u201cto enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. Therefore, Covington\u2019s identification and description of the shooter and the location of the shooting were not testimonial statements, and their admission at Bryant\u2019s trial did not violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the Confrontation Clause. We vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Around 3:25 a.m. on April 29, 2001, Detroit, Michigan, police officers responded to a radio dispatch indicating that a man had been shot. At the scene, they found the victim, Anthony Covington, lying on the ground next to his car in a gas station parking lot. Covington had a gunshot wound to his abdomen, appeared to be in great pain, and spoke with difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The police asked him \u201cwhat had happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting had occurred.\u201d 483 Mich., at 143, 768 N.W.2d, at 71. Covington stated that \u201cRick\u201d shot him at around 3 a.m. <em>Id., </em>at 136, and n. 1, 768 N.W.2d, at 67, and n. 1. He also indicated that he had a conversation with Bryant, whom he recognized based on his voice, through the back door of Bryant\u2019s house. Covington explained that when he turned to leave, he was shot through the door and then drove to the gas station, where police found him.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Covington\u2019s conversation with the police ended within 5 to 10 minutes when emergency medical services arrived. Covington was transported to a hospital and died within hours. The police left the gas station after speaking with Covington, called for backup, and traveled to Bryant\u2019s house. They</p>\n<p id=\"AMy\">[562 U.S. 350]</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">did not find Bryant there but did find blood and a bullet on the back porch and an apparent bullet hole in the back door. Police also found Coving-ton\u2019s wallet and identification outside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">At trial, which occurred prior to our decisions in <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177, and <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224, the police officers who spoke with Covington at the gas station testified about what Covington had told them. The jury returned a guilty verdict on charges of second-degree murder, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Bryant appealed, and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. No. 247039, 2004 WL 1882661 (Aug. 24, 2004) <em>(per curiam). </em>Bryant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Michigan, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting Covington\u2019s statements to the police. The Supreme Court of Michigan eventually remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of our 2006 decision in <em>Davis. 477 </em>Mich. 902, 722 N.W.2d 797 (2006). On remand, the Court of Appeals again affirmed, holding that Covington\u2019s statements were properly admitted because they were not testimonial. No. 247039, 2007 WL 675471 (Mar. 6, 2007) <em>(per curiam). </em>Bryant again appealed to the Supreme Court of Michigan, which reversed his conviction. 483 Mich. 132, 768 N.W.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Before the Supreme Court of Michigan, Bryant argued that Covington\u2019s statements to the police were testimonial under <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>and were therefore inadmissible. The State, on the other hand, argued that the statements were admissible as \u201cexcited utterances\u201d under the Michigan Rules of Evidence. 483 Mich., at 142, and n. 6, 768 N.W.2d, at 70, and n. 6. There was no dispute that Cov-ington was unavailable at trial and Bryant had no prior opportunity to cross-examine him. The court therefore assessed whether Covington\u2019s statements to the police identifying and describing</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">[562 U.S. 351]</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">the shooter and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>time and location of the shooting were testimonial hearsay for purposes of the Confrontation Clause. The court concluded that the circumstances \u201cclearly indicate that the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 of the questioning was to establish the facts of an event that had <em>already </em>occurred; the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 was not to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 143, 768 N.W.2d, at 71. The court explained that, in its view, Covington was describing past events and as such, his \u201cprimary purpose in making these statements to the police . . . was ... to tell the police who had committed the crime against him, where the crime had been committed, and where the police could find the criminal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 144, 768 N.W.2d, at 71. Noting that the officers\u2019 actions did not suggest that they perceived an ongoing emergency at the gas station, the court held that there was in fact no ongoing emergency. <em>Id., </em>at 145-147, 768 N.W.2d, at 71-73. The court distinguished the facts of this case from those in <em>Davis, </em>where we held a declarant\u2019s statements in a 911 call to be nontestimonial. It instead analogized this case to <em>Hammon </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>which we decided jointly with <em>Davis </em>and in which we found testimonial a declarant\u2019s statements to police just after an assault. See 547 U.S., at 829-832, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. Based on this analysis, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the admission of Covington\u2019s statements constituted prejudicial plain error warranting reversal and ordered a new trial. 483 Mich., at 151-153, 768 N.W.2d, at 75-76. The court did not address whether, absent a Confrontation Clause bar, the statements\u2019 admission would have been otherwise consistent with Michigan\u2019s hearsay rules or due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">[562 U.S. 352]</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The majority\u2019s opinion provoked two dissents, both of which would have held Covington\u2019s statements admissible because they were made in circumstances indicating that their \u201cprimary purpose\u201d was to assist police in addressing an ongoing emergency. <em>Id., </em>at 157, 768 N.W.2d, at 79 (opinion of Weaver, J.); <em>id,, </em>at 157-159, 768 N.W.2d, at 79 (opinion of Corrigan, J.). Justice Corrigan\u2019s dissent explained that the time and space between \u201cthe onset of an emergency and statements about that emergency clearly must be considered in context.\u201d Id<em>., </em>at 161, 768 N.W.2d, at 80. Justice Corrigan concluded that the objective circumstances of Coving-ton\u2019s interaction with police rendered this case more similar to the nontes-timonial statements in <em>Davis </em>than to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the testimonial statements in <em>Crawford. </em>483 Mich., at 164, 768 N.W.2d, at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We granted certiorari to determine whether the Confrontation Clause barred admission of Covington\u2019s statements. 559 U.S. 970, 130 S. Ct. 1685, 176 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment states:  \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d  The Fourteenth Amendment renders the Clause binding on the States. <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965). In</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">[562 U.S. 353]</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\"><em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980), we explained that  the confrontation right does not bar admission of statements of an unavailable witness if the statements \u201cbea[r] adequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d We held that reliability can be established if \u201cthe evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\u201d or if it does not fall within such an exception, then if it bears \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Nearly a quarter century later, we decided <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Petitioner Michael Crawford was prosecuted for stabbing a man who had allegedly attempted to rape his wife, Sylvia. Sylvia witnessed the stabbing, and later that night, after she and her husband were both arrested, police interrogated her about the incident. At trial, Sylvia Crawford claimed spousal privilege and did not testify, but the State introduced a tape recording of Sylvia\u2019s statement to the police in an effort to prove that the stabbing was not in self-defense, as Michael Crawford claimed. The Washington Supreme Court affirmed Crawford\u2019s conviction because it found Sylvia\u2019s statement to be reliable, as required under <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts. </em>We reversed, overruling <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts. </em>541 U.S., at 60-68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177; see also <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 825, n. 4, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\"><em>Crawford </em>examined the common-law history of the confrontation right and explained that \u201cthe principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused.\u201d 541 U.S., at 50, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. We noted that in England, pretrial examinations of suspects and witnesses by government officials \u201cwere sometimes read in court in lieu of live testimony.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 43, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. In light of this history, we emphasized the word \u201cwitnesses\u201d in the Sixth Amendment, defining it as \u201cthose who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 51, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)). We defined \u201ctestimony\u201d as \u201c \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">[562 U.S. 354]</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d 541 U.S., at 51, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (quoting Webster). We noted that \u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em> We therefore limited the Confrontation Clause\u2019s reach to testimonial statements and held that in order for testimonial evidence to be admissible, the Sixth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ment \u201cdemands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Although \u201cleaving] for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford </em>noted that \u201cat a minimum\u201d it includes \u201cprior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and . . . police interrogations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Under this reasoning, we held that Sylvia Crawford\u2019s statements in the course of police questioning were testimonial and that their admission when Michael Crawford \u201chad no opportunity to cross-examine her\u201d due to spousal privilege was \u201csufficient to make out a violation of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">In 2006, the Court in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington </em>and <em>Hammon </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224, took a further step to \u201cdetermine more precisely which police interrogations produce testimony\u201d and therefore implicate a Confrontation Clause bar. <em>Id., </em>at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. We explained that when <em>Crawford, </em>said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201c \u2018interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within [the] class\u2019 of testimonial hearsay, we had immediately in mind (for that was the case before us) interrogations solely directed at establishing the facts of a past crime, in order to identify (or provide evidence to convict) the perpetrator. The product of such interrogation, whether reduced to a writing signed by the declarant or embedded in the memory (and perhaps notes) of the interrogating officer, is testimonial.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 826, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">[562 U.S. 355]</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We thus made clear in <em>Davis </em>that  not all those questioned by the police are witnesses and not all \u201cinterrogations by law enforcement officers,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S., at 53, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177, are subject to the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\"><em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>were both domestic violence cases. In <em>Davis, </em>Michelle McCottry made the statements at issue to a 911 operator during a domestic disturbance with Adrian Davis, her former boyfriend. McCottry told the operator, \u201c \u2018He\u2019s here jumpin\u2019 on me again,\u2019 \u201d and, \u201c \u2018He\u2019s usin\u2019 his fists.\u2019 \u201d 547 U.S., at 817, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. The operator then asked McCottry for Davis\u2019 first and last names and middle initial, and at that point in the conversation McCottry reported that Davis had fled in a car. <em>Id., </em>at 818, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. McCottry did not appear at Davis\u2019 trial, and the State introduced the recording of her conversation with the 911 operator. <em>Id., </em>at 819, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">In <em>Hammon, </em>decided along with <em>Davis, </em>police responded to a domestic disturbance call at the home of Amy and Hershel Hammon, where they found Amy alone on the front porch. <em>Ibid. </em>She appeared \u201c \u2018somewhat frightened,\u2019 \u201d but told them \u201c \u2018nothing was the matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. (quoting Hammon </em>v. <em>State, </em>829 N.E.2d 444, 446-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>447 (Ind. 2005)). She gave the police permission to enter the house, where they saw a gas heating unit with the glass front shattered on the floor. One officer remained in the kitchen with Hershel, while another officer talked to Amy in the living room about what had happened. Hershel tried several times to participate in Amy\u2019s conversation with the police and became angry when the police required him to stay separated from Amy. 547 U.S., at 819-820, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. The police asked Amy to fill out and sign a battery affidavit. She wrote: \u201c \u2018Broke our Furnace &amp;</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">[562 U.S. 356]</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">shoved me down on the floor into the broken glass. Hit me in the chest and threw me down. Broke our lamps &amp; phone. Tore up my van where I couldn\u2019t leave the house. Attacked my daughter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 820, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. Amy did not appear at Hershel\u2019s trial, so the police officers who spoke with her testified as to her statements and authenticated the affidavit. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial court admitted the affidavit as a present sense impression and admitted the oral statements as excited utterances under state hearsay rules. <em>Ibid. </em>The Indiana Supreme Court affirmed Hammon\u2019s conviction, holding that Amy\u2019s oral statements were not testimonial and that the admission of the affidavit, although erroneous because the affidavit was testimonial, was harmless. <em>Hammon </em>v. <em>State, </em>829 N.E.2d, at 458-459.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">To address the facts of both cases, we expanded upon the meaning of \u201ctestimonial\u201d that we first employed in <em>Crawford </em>and discussed the concept of an ongoing emergency. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Examining the <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>statements in light of those definitions, we held that the statements at issue in <em>Davis </em>were nontestimonial and the statements in <em>Hammon </em>were testimonial. We distinguished the statements in <em>Davis </em>from the testimonial statements in <em>Crawford, </em>on several grounds, including that the victim in <em>Davis </em>was \u201cspeaking about events <em>as they were actually happening, </em>rather</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">[562 U.S. 357]</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">than \u2018describing] past events,\u2019 \u201d that there was an ongoing emergency, that the \u201celicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency,\u201d and that the statements were not formal. 547 U.S., at 827, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. In <em>Hammon, </em>on the other hand, we held that, \u201c [i]t is entirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 829, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. There was \u201cno emergency in progress.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The officer questioning Amy \u201cwas not seeking to determine . . . \u2018what is happening,\u2019 but rather \u2018what happened.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 830, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. It was \u201cformal enough\u201d that the police interrogated Amy in a room separate from her husband where, \u201csome time after the events described were over,\u201d she \u201cde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>liberately recounted, in response to police questioning, how potentially criminal past events began and progressed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because her statements \u201cwere neither a cry for help nor the provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 832, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224, we held that they were testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><em>Davis </em>did not \u201cattemp[t] to produce an exhaustive classification of all conceivable statements\u2014or even all conceivable statements in response to police interrogation\u2014as either testimonial or nontestimonial.\u201d Id., at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L.

Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Thus,  the most important instances in which the Clause restricts the introduction of out-of-court statements are those in which state actors are involved in a formal, out-of-court interrogation of a witness to obtain evidence for trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>id., </em>at 43-44, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Even where such an interrogation is conducted with all good faith, introduction of the resulting statements at trial can be unfair to the accused if they are untested by cross-examination. Whether formal or informal, out-of-court statements can evade the basic objective of the Confrontation Clause, which is to prevent the accused from being deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant about statements taken for use at trial. When, as in <em>Davis, </em>the primary purpose of an interrogation is to respond to an \u201congoing emergency,\u201d its purpose is not to create a record for trial and thus is not within the scope of the Clause. But there may be <em>other </em>circumstances, aside from ongoing emergencies, when a statement is not procured with a primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony. In making the primary purpose determination, standard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some statements</p>\n<p id=\"A6f\">[562 U.S. 359]</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">as reliable, will be relevant. Where no such primary purpose exists, the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>missibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Deciding this case also requires further explanation of the \u201congoing emergency\u201d circumstance addressed in <em>Davis. </em>Because <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>arose in the domestic violence context, that was the situation \u201cwe had immediately in mind (for that was the case before us).\u201d 547 U.S., at 826, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. We now face a new context: a nondomestic dispute, involving a victim found in a public location, suffering from a fatal gunshot wound, and a perpetrator whose location was unknown at the time the police located the victim. Thus, we confront for the first time circumstances in which the \u201congoing emergency\u201d discussed in <em>Davis </em>extends beyond an initial victim to a potential threat to the responding police and the public at large. This new context requires us to provide additional clarification with regard to what <em>Davis </em>meant by \u201cthe primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 822, 126 S.

See 547 U.S., at 822, 826-828, 830-831, and n. 5, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224; see, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 826, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (\u201cThe question before us in <em>Davis, </em>then, is whether, objectively considered, the interrogation that took place in the course of the 911 call produced testimonial statements\u201d). \u201cObjectively\u201d also appears in the definitions of both testimonial and nontestimo-nial statements that <em>Davis </em>established. <em>Id., </em>at 822, 126 S.

The statements and actions of the parties must also be objectively evaluated. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals\u2019 statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">[562 U.S. 361]</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">As our recent Confrontation Clause cases have explained, the existence of an \u201congoing emergency\u201d at the time of an encounter between an individual and the police is among the most important circumstances informing the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an interrogation. See <em>id., </em>at 828-830, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224; <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S., at 65, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. The existence of an ongoing emergency is relevant to determining the primary purpose of the interrogation because an emergency focuses the participants on something other than \u201cprov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. Rather, it focuses them on \u201cend[ing] a threatening situation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 832, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. Implicit in <em>Davis </em>is the idea that because the prospect of fabrication in statements given for the primary purpose of resolving that emergency is presumably significantly diminished, the Confrontation Clause does not require such statements to be subject to the crucible of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">This logic is not unlike that justifying the excited utterance exception in hearsay law. Statements \u201crelating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition,\u201d Fed. Rule Evid. 803(2); see also Mich. Rule Evid. 803(2) (2010), are considered reliable because the declarant, in the excitement, presumably cannot form a falsehood.

But in doing so, the court construed <em>Davis </em>to have decided more than it did and thus employed an unduly narrow understanding of \u201congoing emergency\u201d that <em>Davis </em>does not require.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">[562 U.S. 363]</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">First, the Michigan Supreme Court repeatedly and incorrectly asserted that <em>Davis </em>\u201cdefined\u201d \u201c \u2018ongoing emergency.\u2019 \u201d 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N.W.2d, at 73; see also <em>id., </em>at 144, 768 N.W.2d, at 71-72. In fact, <em>Davis </em>did not even define the extent of the emergency in that case. The Michigan Supreme Court erroneously read <em>Davis </em>as deciding that \u201cthe statements made after the defendant stopped assaulting the victim and left the premises did <em>not </em>occur during an \u2018ongoing emergency.\u2019 \u201d 483 Mich., at 150, n. 15, 768 N.W.2d, at 75, n. 15. We explicitly explained in <em>Davis, </em>however, that we were asked to review only the testimonial nature of Michelle McCottry\u2019s initial statements during the 911 call; we therefore merely <em>assumed </em>the correctness of the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s holding that admission of her other statements was harmless, without deciding whether those subsequent statements were also made for the primary purpose of resolving an ongoing emergency. 547 U.S., at 829, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Second, by assuming that <em>Davis </em>defined the outer bounds of \u201congoing emergency,\u201d the Michigan Supreme Court failed to appreciate that whether an emergency exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20. <em>Davis </em>and <em>Ham-mon </em>involved domestic violence, a known and identified perpetrator, and, in <em>Hammon, </em>a neutralized threat. Because <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>were domestic violence cases, we focused only on the threat to the victims and assessed the ongoing emergency from the perspective of whether there was a continuing threat <em>to them. </em>547 U.S., at 827, 829-830, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Domestic violence cases like <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>often have a narrower zone of potential victims than cases involving threats to public safety. An assessment of whether an emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>that threatens the police and public is ongoing cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat solely to the first victim has been neutralized because the threat to the first responders and public may continue. See 483 Mich., at</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">[562 U.S. 364]</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">164, 768 N.W.2d, at 82 (Corrigan, J., dissenting) (examining the threat to the victim, police, and the public); Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>19-20 (\u201cAn emergency posed by an unknown shooter who remains at large does not automatically abate just because the police can provide security to his first victim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The Michigan Supreme Court also did not appreciate that the duration and scope of an emergency may depend in part on the type of weapon employed. The court relied on <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon, </em>in which the assailants used their fists, as controlling the scope of the emergency here, which involved the use of a gun. The problem with that reasoning is clear when considered in light of the assault on Amy Hammon. Hershel Hammon was armed only with his fists when he attacked his wife, so removing Amy to a separate room was sufficient to end the emergency. 547 U.S., at 830-832, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. If Hershel had been reported to be armed with a gun, however, separation by a single household wall might not have been sufficient to end the emergency. <em>Id., </em>at 819, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s failure to focus on the context-dependent nature of our <em>Davis </em>decision also led it to conclude that the medical condition of a declarant is irrelevant. 483 Mich., at 149, 768 N.W.2d, at 74 (\u201cThe Court said nothing at all that would remotely suggest that whether the victim was in need of medical attention was in any way relevant to whether there was an \u2018ongoing emergency\u2019 \u201d). But <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>did not present medical emergencies, despite some injuries to the victims. 547 U.S., at 818, 820, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. Thus, we have not previously considered, much less ruled out, the relevance of a victim\u2019s severe injuries to the primary purpose inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\"> Taking into account the victim\u2019s medical state does not, as the Michigan Supreme Court below thought, \u201crende [r] non-testimonial\u201d \u201call statements made while the police are questioning a seriously injured complainant.\u201d 483 Mich., at 149, 768 N.W.2d, at 74. The medical condition of the victim is</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">[562 U.S. 365]</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">important to the primary purpose inquiry to the extent that it sheds light on the ability of the victim to have any purpose at all in responding to police questions and on the likelihood that any purpose formed would necessarily be a testimonial one. The victim\u2019s medical state also provides important context for first responders to judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing threat to the victim, themselves, and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">As the Solicitor General\u2019s brief observes, Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20, and contrary to the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s claims, 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N.W.2d, at 73, none of this suggests that an emergency is ongoing in every place or even just surrounding the victim for the entire time that the perpetrator of a violent crime is on the loose. As we recognized in <em>Davis, </em> \u201ca conversation which begins as an interrogation to determine the need for emergency assistance\u201d can \u201cevolve into testimonial statements.\u201d 547 U.S., at 828, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (internal quotation marks omitted). This evolution may occur if, for ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ample, a declarant provides police with information that makes clear that what appeared to be an emergency is not or is no longer an emergency or that what appeared to be a public threat is actually a private dispute. It could also occur if a perpetrator is disarmed, surrenders, is apprehended, or, as in <em>Davis, </em>flees with little prospect of posing a threat to the public. Trial courts can determine in the first instance when any transition from nontestimonial to testimonial occurs,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and exclude \u201cthe portions of any statement</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">[562 U.S. 366]</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">that have become testimonial, as they do, for example, with unduly prejudicial portions of otherwise admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 829, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Finally, our discussion of the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s misunderstanding of what <em>Davis </em>meant by \u201congoing emergency\u201d should not be taken to imply that the existence <em>vel non </em>of an ongoing emergency is dispositive of the testimonial inquiry. As <em>Davis </em>made clear,  whether an ongoing emergency exists is simply one factor\u2014albeit an important factor\u2014that informs the ultimate inquiry regarding the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an interrogation. Another factor the Michigan Supreme Court did not sufficiently account for is the importance of <em>informality </em>in an encounter between a victim and police. Formality is not the sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry because, although formality suggests the absence of an emergency and therefore an increased likelihood that the purpose of the interrogation is to \u201cestablish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224, informality does not necessarily indicate the presence of an emergency or the lack of testimonial intent. Cf. <em>id., </em>at 826, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (explaining that Confrontation Clause requirements cannot \u201creadily be evaded\u201d by the parties deliberately keeping the written product of an interrogation informal \u201cinstead of having the declarant sign a deposition\u201d). The court below, however, too readily dismissed the informality of the circumstances in this case in a single brief footnote and in fact seems to have suggested that the encounter in this case was formal. 483 Mich., at 150, n. 16, 768 N.W.2d, at 75, n. 16. As we explain further below, the questioning in this case occurred in an exposed, public area, prior to the arrival of emergency medical services, and in a disorganized fashion. All of those facts make this case distinguishable from the formal station-house interrogation in <em>Crawford. See Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 827, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">[562 U.S. 367]</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">In addition to the circumstances in which an encounter occurs, the statements and actions of both the declarant and interrogators provide objective evidence of the primary purpose of the interrogation. See, <em>e.g., ibid. </em>\u201c[T]he nature of what was <em>asked </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>and. answered </em>in <em>Davis, </em>again viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in <em>Crawford) </em>what had happened in the past\u201d (first emphasis added)). The Michigan Supreme Court did, at least briefly, conduct this inquiry. 483 Mich., at 144-147, 768 N.W.2d, at 71-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly recognized, <em>id., </em>at 140, n. 5, 768 N.W.2d, at 69, n. 5, <em>Davis </em>requires a combined inquiry that accounts for both the declarant and the interrogator.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In many instances, the primary purpose of</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">[562 U.S. 368]</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">the interrogation will be most accurately ascertained by looking to the contents of both the questions and the answers. To give an extreme example, if the police say to a victim, \u201cTell us who did this to you so that we can arrest and prosecute them,\u201d the victim\u2019s response that \u201cRick did it\u201d appears purely accusatory because by virtue of the phrasing of the question, the victim necessarily has prosecution in mind when she answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The combined approach also ameliorates problems that could arise from looking solely to one participant. Predominant among these is the problem of mixed motives on the part of both interrogators and declarants. Police officers in our society function as both first responders and criminal investigators. Their dual responsibilities may mean that they act with different motives simultaneously or in quick succession. See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 656, 104 S. Ct. 2626, 81 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1984) (\u201cUndoubtedly most police officers [deciding whether to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a possible emergency situation] would act out of a host of different, instinctive, and largely unverifiable motives\u2014their own safety, the safety of others, and perhaps as well the desire to obtain incriminating evidence from the suspect\u201d); see also <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 839, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cIn many, if not most, cases where police respond to a report of a crime, whether pursuant to a 911 call from the victim or otherwise, the purposes of an interrogation, viewed from the perspective of the police, are <em>both </em>to respond to the emergency situation <em>and. </em>to gather evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Victims are also likely to have mixed motives when they make statements to the police. During an ongoing emergency, a victim is most likely to want the threat to her and to other potential victims to end, but that does not necessarily mean that the victim wants or envisions prosecution of the assailant. A victim may want the attacker to be incapacitated temporarily or rehabilitated. Alternatively, a severely injured victim may have no purpose at all in answering</p>\n<p id=\"ALs\">[562 U.S. 369]</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">questions posed; the answers may be simply reflexive. The victim\u2019s injuries could be so debilitating as to prevent her from thinking sufficiently clearly to understand whether her statements are for the purpose of addressing an ongoing emergency or for the purpose of future prosecution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Taking into account a victim\u2019s injuries does not transform this objective inquiry into a subjective one. The inquiry is still objective because it focuses on the understanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in the circumstances of the actual victim\u2014circumstances that prominently include the victim\u2019s physical state.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The dissent suggests, <em>post, </em>at 381-382, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 121-122, that we intend to give controlling weight to the \u201cintentions of the police,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 382, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 122. That is a misreading of our opinion.  At trial, the declarant\u2019s statements, not the interrogator\u2019s questions, will be introduced to \u201cestablis[h] the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S., at 60, n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177, and must therefore pass the Sixth Amendment test. See n. 11, <em>supra. </em>In determining whether a declarant\u2019s statements are testimonial, courts should look to all of the relevant circumstances. Even Justice Scalia concedes that the interrogator is relevant to this evaluation, <em>post, </em>at 382, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 122, and we agree that \u201c[t]he identity of an interrogator, and the content and tenor of his questions,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>can illuminate the \u201cprimary purpose of the interrogation.\u201d The dissent, see <em>post, </em>at 382-384, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 122-123, criticizes the complexity of our approach, but we, at least, are unwilling to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity. Simpler is not always better, and courts making a \u201cprimary purpose\u201d assessment</p>\n<p id=\"AlJ\">[562 U.S. 370]</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">should not be unjustifiably restrained from consulting all relevant information, including the statements and actions of interrogators.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of the interrogation by examining the statements and actions of all participants is also the approach most consistent with our past holdings. <em>E.g., Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 822-823, n. 1, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (noting that \u201cvolunteered testimony\u201d is still testimony and remains subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">As we suggested in <em>Davis, </em> when a court must determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Confrontation Clause bars the admission of a statement at trial, it should determine the \u201cprimary purpose of the interrogation\u201d by objectively evaluating the statements and actions of the parties to the encounter, in light of the circumstances in which the interrogation occurs. The existence of an emergency or the parties\u2019 perception that an emergency is ongoing is among the most important circumstances that courts must take into account in determining whether an interrogation is testimonial because statements made to assist police in addressing an ongoing emergency presumably lack the testimonial purpose that would subject them to the requirement of confrontation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As the context of this case brings into sharp relief, the existence and duration</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">[562 U.S. 371]</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">of an emergency depend on the type and scope of danger posed to the victim, the police, and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Applying this analysis to the facts of this case is more difficult than in <em>Davis </em>because we do not have the luxury of reviewing a transcript of the conversation between the victim and the police officers. Further complicating our task is the fact that the trial in this case occurred before our decisions in <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis. </em>We therefore review a record that was not developed to ascertain the \u201cprimary purpose of the interrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">We first examine the circumstances in which the interrogation occurred. The parties disagree over whether there was an emergency when the police arrived at the gas station. Bryant argues, and the Michigan Supreme Court accepted, 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N.W.2d, at 73, that there was no ongoing emergency because \u201cthere ... was no criminal conduct occurring. No shots were being fired, no one was seen in possession of a firearm, nor were any witnesses seen cowering in fear or running from the scene.\u201d Brief for Respondent 27. Bryant, while conceding that \u201ca serious or life-threatening injury creates a medical emergency for a victim,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 30, further argues that a declarant\u2019s medical emergency is not relevant to the ongoing emergency determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In contrast, Michigan and the Solicitor General explain that when the police responded to the call that a man had been shot and found Coving-ton bleeding on the gas station parking lot, \u201cthey did not know who Cov-ington was, whether the shooting had occurred at the gas station or at a different location, who the assailant was, or whether the assailant posed a continuing threat to Covington or others.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>15; Brief for Petitioner 16; see also <em>id., </em>at 15 (\u201c[W]hen an officer arrives on the scene and does not know where the perpetrator is, whether he is armed, whether he might have other targets, and whether the violence might continue at the scene or elsewhere, interroga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tion</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">[562 U.S. 372]</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">that has the primary purpose of establishing those facts to assess the situation is designed to meet the ongoing emergency and is nontestimo-nial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The Michigan Supreme Court stated that the police asked Coving-ton, \u201cwhat had happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting had occurred.\u201d 483 Mich., at 143, 768 N.W.2d, at 71. The joint appendix contains the transcripts of the preliminary examination, suppression hearing, and trial testimony of five officers who responded to the scene and found Covington. The officers\u2019 testimony is essentially consistent but, at the same time, not specific. The officers basically agree on what information they learned from Covington, but not on the order in which they learned it or on whether Covington\u2019s statements were in response to general or detailed questions. They all agree that the first question was \u201cwhat happened?\u201d The answer was either \u201cI was shot\u201d or \u201cRick shot \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">As explained above, the scope of an emergency in terms of its threat to individuals other than the initial assailant and victim will often depend on the type of dispute involved. Nothing Covington said to the police indicated that the cause of the shooting was a purely private dispute or that the threat from the shooter had ended. The record reveals little about the motive for the shooting. The police officers who spoke with Covington at the gas station testified that Coving-ton did not tell them what words Covington and Rick had</p>\n<p id=\"AR9\">[562 U.S. 373]</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">exchanged prior to the shooting.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> What Coving-ton did tell the officers was that he fled Bryant\u2019s back porch, indicating that he perceived an ongoing threat.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The police did not know, and Coving-ton did not tell them, whether the threat was limited to him. The potential scope of the dispute and therefore the emergency in this case thus stretches more broadly than those at issue in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>and encompasses a threat potentially to the police and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>This is also the first of our post-<em>Crawford </em>Confrontation Clause cases to involve a gun. The physical separation that was sufficient to end the emergency in <em>Hammon </em>was not necessarily sufficient to end the threat in this case; Covington was shot through the back door of Bryant\u2019s house. Bryant\u2019s argument that there was no ongoing emergency because \u201c[n]o shots were being fired,\u201d Brief for Respondent 27, surely construes ongoing emergency too narrowly. An emergency does not last only for the time between when the assailant pulls the trigger and the bullet hits the victim. If an out-of-sight sniper pauses between shots, no one would</p>\n<p id=\"A7v\">[562 U.S. 374]</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">say that the emergency ceases during the pause. That is an extreme example and not the situation here, but it serves to highlight the implausibility, at least as to certain weapons, of construing the emergency to last only precisely as long as the violent act itself, as some have construed our opinion in <em>Davis. </em>See Brief for Respondent 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">At no point during the questioning did either Covington or the police know the location of the shooter. In fact, Bryant was not at home by the time the police searched his house at approximately 5:30 a.m. 483 Mich., at 136, 768 N.W.2d, at 67. At some point between 3 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., Bryant left his house. At bottom, there was an ongoing emergency here where an armed shooter, whose motive for and location after the shooting were unknown, had mortally wounded Cov-ington within a few blocks and a few minutes of the location where the police found Covington.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">This is not to suggest that the emergency continued until Bryant was arrested in California a year after the shooting. <em>Id., </em>at 137, 768 N.W.2d, at 67. We need not decide precisely when the emergency ended because Coving-ton\u2019s encounter with the police and all of the statements he made during that interaction occurred within the first few minutes of the police officers\u2019 arrival and well before they secured the scene of the shooting\u2014the shooter\u2019s last known location.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">We reiterate, moreover, that the existence <em>vel non </em>of an ongoing emergency is not the touchstone of the testimonial inquiry; rather, the ultimate inquiry is whether the \u201cprimary purpose of the interrogation [was] to enable police assistance to meet [the] ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. We turn now to that inquiry, as informed by the circumstances of the ongoing emergency just described. The circumstances of the encounter provide important context for</p>\n<p id=\"ABm\">[562 U.S. 375]</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">understanding Covington\u2019s statements to the police. When the police arrived at Covington\u2019s side, their first question to him was \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Cov-ington\u2019s response was either \u201cRick shot me\u201d or \u201cI was shot,\u201d followed very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>quickly by an identification of \u201cRick\u201d as the shooter. App. 76. In response to further questions, Covington explained that the shooting occurred through the back door of Bryant\u2019s house and provided a physical description of the shooter. When he made the statements, Covington was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding from a mortal gunshot wound to his abdomen. His answers to the police officers\u2019 questions were punctuated with questions about when emergency medical services would arrive. <em>Id., </em>at 56-57 (suppression hearing testimony of Officer Brown). He was obviously in considerable pain and had difficulty breathing and talking. <em>Id., </em>at 75, 83-84 (testimony of Officer McCallister); <em>id., </em>at 101, 110-111 (testimony of Sgt. Wenturine); <em>id., </em>at 126, 137 (testimony of Officer Stuglin). From this description of his condition and report of his statements, we cannot say that a person in Covington\u2019s situation would have had a \u201cprimary purpose\u201d \u201cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">For their part, the police responded to a call that a man had been shot. As discussed above, they did not know why,</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">[562 U.S. 376]</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">where, or when the shooting had occurred. Nor did they know the location of the shooter or anything else about the circumstances in which the crime occurred.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The questions they asked\u2014\u201cwhat had happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting had occurred,\u201d 483 Mich., at 143, 768 N.W.2d, at 71\u2014were the exact type of questions necessary to allow the police to \u201c \u2018assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim\u2019 \u201d and to the public, <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 832, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (quoting <em>Hiibel </em>v. <em>Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty., </em>542 U.S. 177, 186, 124 S. Ct. 2451, 159 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2004)), including to allow them to ascertain \u201cwhether they would be encountering a violent felon,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 827, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. In other words, they solicited the information necessary to enable them \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">[562 U.S. 377]</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Nothing in Covington\u2019s responses indicated to the police that, contrary to their expectation upon responding to a call reporting a shooting, there was no emergency or that a prior emergency had ended. Covington did indicate that he had been shot at another location about 25 minutes earlier, but he did not know the location of the shooter at the time the police arrived and, as far as we can tell from the record, he gave no indication that the shooter, having shot at him twice, would be satisfied that Covington was only wounded. In fact, Covington did not indicate any possible motive for the shooting, and thereby gave no reason to think that the shooter would not shoot again if he arrived on the scene. As we noted in <em>Davis, </em>\u201cinitial inquiries\u201d may <em>\u201coften . . </em>. produce nontestimonial statements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 832, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. The initial inquiries in this case resulted in the type of nontestimonial statements we contemplated in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Finally, we consider the informality of the situation and the interrogation. This situation is more similar, though not identical, to the informal, harried 911 call in <em>Davis </em>than to the structured, station-house interview in <em>Crawford. </em>As the officers\u2019 trial testimony reflects, the situation was fluid and somewhat confused: The officers arrived at different times; apparently each, upon arrival, asked Covington \u201cwhat happened?\u201d; and, contrary to the dissent\u2019s portrayal, <em>post, </em>at 386-387, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 125, they did not conduct a structured interrogation. App. 84 (testimony of Officer McCallister) (explaining duplicate questioning, especially as to \u201cwhat happened?\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 101-102 (testimony of Sgt. Wenturine) (same); <em>id., </em>at 126-127 (testimony of Officer Stug-lin) (same). The informality suggests that the interrogators\u2019 primary purpose was simply to address what they perceived to be an ongoing emergency, and the circumstances lacked any formality that would have alerted Cov-ington to or focused him on the possible future prosecutorial use of his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Because the circumstances of the encounter as well as the statements and actions of Covington and the police objectively</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">[562 U.S. 378]</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">indicate that the \u201cprimary purpose of the interrogation\u201d was \u201cto enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224, Covington\u2019s identification and description of the shooter and the location of the shooting were not testimonial hearsay. The Confrontation Clause did not bar their admission at Bryant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Covington\u2019s statements were not testimonial and that their admission at Bryant\u2019s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause. We leave for the Michigan courts to decide on remand whether the statements\u2019 admission was otherwise permitted by state hearsay rules. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">. The Supreme Court of Michigan held that the question whether the victim\u2019s statements would have been admissible as \u201cdying declarations\u2019\u2019 was not properly before it because at the preliminary examination, the prosecution, after first invoking both the dying declaration and excited utterance hearsay exceptions, established the factual foundation only for admission of the statements as excited utterances. The trial court ruled that the statements were admissible as excited utterances and did not address their admissibility as dying declarations. 483 Mich., at 153-154, 768 N.W.2d, at 76-77. This occurred prior to our 2004 decision in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177, where we first suggested that dying declarations, even if testimonial, might be admissible as a historical exception to the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id., </em>at 56, n. 6, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177; see also <em>Giles </em>v. <em>California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 358-359, 128 S. Ct. 2678, 171 L. Ed. 2d 488 (2008). We noted in <em>Crawford </em>that we \u201cneed not decide in this case whether the Sixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying declarations.\u2019\u2019 541 U.S., at 56, n. 6, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Because of the State\u2019s failure to preserve its argument with regard to dying declarations, we similarly need not decide that question here.

Some portions of <em>Davis, </em>however, have caused confusion about whether the inquiry prescribes examination of one participant to the exclusion of the other. <em>Davis' </em>language indicating that a statement\u2019s testimonial or nontestimonial nature derives from \u201cthe primary purpose <em>of the interrogation,\" </em>547 U.S., at 822, 126 S.

In contrast, footnote 1 in <em>Davis </em>explains, \u201cit is in the final analysis the declarant\u2019s statements, not the interrogator\u2019s questions, that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 822-823, n. 1, 126 S.

The police questioning was not \u201ca formalized dialogue,\u201d did not result in \u201cformalized testimonial materials\u201d such as a deposition or affidavit, and bore no \u201cindicia of solemnity.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 840, 837, 126 S.

But reaching</p>\n<p id=\"Au1\">[562 U.S. 380]</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">a patently incorrect conclusion on the facts is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>relatively benign judicial mischief; it affects, after all, only the case at hand. In its vain attempt to make the incredible plausible, however\u2014or perhaps as an intended second goal\u2014 today\u2019s opinion distorts our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence and leaves it in a shambles. Instead of clarifying the law, the Court makes itself the obfuscator of last resort. Because I continue to adhere to the Confrontation Clause that the People adopted, as described in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, made binding on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965), provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d In <em>Crawford, </em>we held that this provision guarantees a defendant his common-law right to confront those \u201cwho \u2018bear testimony\u2019 \u201d against him. 541 U.S., at 51, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. A witness must deliver his testimony against the defendant in person, or the prosecution must prove that the witness is unavailable to appear at trial and that the defendant has had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Id., </em>at 53-54, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Not all hearsay falls within the Confrontation Clause\u2019s grasp. At trial a witness \u201cbears testimony\u201d by providing \u201c \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation ... for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 51, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)). The Confrontation Clause protects defendants only from hearsay statements that do the same. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 823-824, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (2006). In <em>Davis, </em>we explained how to identify testimonial hearsay prompted by police questioning in the field. A statement is testimonial \u201cwhen the circumstances objectively indicate . . . that the</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">[562 U.S. 381]</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. When, however, the circumstances objectively indicate that the declarant\u2019s statements were \u201ca cry for help [o]r the provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 832, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224, they bear little resemblance to in-court testimony. \u201cNo \u2018witness\u2019 goes into court to proclaim an emergency and seek help.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 828, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\"><em>Crawford, </em>and <em>Davis </em>did not address whose perspective matters\u2014the declarant\u2019s, the interrogator\u2019s, or both\u2014when assessing \u201cthe primary purpose of [an] interrogation.\u201d In those cases the statements were testimonial from any perspective. I think the same is true here, but because the Court picks a perspective so will I: The declarant\u2019s intent is what counts. In-court testimony is more than a narrative of past events; it is a solemn declaration made in the course of a criminal trial. For an out-of-court statement to qualify as testimonial, the declarant must intend the statement to be a solemn declaration rather than an unconsidered or off<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>hand remark; and he must make the statement with the understanding that it may be used to invoke the coercive machinery of the State against the accused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Friedman, Grappling With the Meaning of \u201cTestimonial,\u201d 71 Brooklyn L. Rev. 241, 259 (2005). That is what distinguishes a narrative told to a friend over dinner from a statement to the police. See <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 51, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. The hidden purpose of an interrogator cannot substitute for the declarant\u2019s intentional solemnity or his understanding of how his words may be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">A declarant-focused inquiry is also the only inquiry that would work in every fact pattern implicating the Confrontation Clause. The Clause applies to volunteered testimony</p>\n<p id=\"AKb\">[562 U.S. 382]</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">as well as statements solicited through police interrogation. See <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 822-823, n. 1, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. An inquiry into an officer\u2019s purposes would make no sense when a declarant blurts out \u201cRick shot me\u201d as soon as the officer arrives on the scene. I see no reason to adopt a different test\u2014one that accounts for an officer\u2019s intent\u2014when the officer asks \u201cwhat happened\u201d before the declarant makes his accusation. (This does not mean the interrogator is irrelevant. The identity of an interrogator, and the content and tenor of his questions, can bear upon whether a declarant intends to make a solemn statement, and envisions its use at a criminal trial. But none of this means that the interrogator\u2019s purpose matters.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In an unsuccessful attempt to make its finding of emergency plausible, the Court instead adopts a test that looks to the purposes of both the police and the declarant. It claims that this is demanded by necessity, fretting that a domestic-violence victim may want her abuser briefly arrested\u2014presumably to teach him a lesson\u2014but not desire prosecution. See <em>ante, </em>at 368, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 113-114. I do not need to probe the purposes of the police to solve that problem. Even if a victim speaks to the police \u201cto establish or prove past events\u201d solely for the purpose of getting her abuser arrested, she surely knows her account is \u201cpotentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\u201d should one ensue. <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The Court also wrings its hands over the possibility that \u201ca severely injured victim\u201d may lack the capacity to form a purpose, and instead answer questions \u201creflexive[ly].\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 368-369, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 114. How to assess whether a declarant with diminished capacity bore testimony is a difficult question, and one I do not need to answer today. But the Court\u2019s proposed answer\u2014to substitute the intentions of the police for the missing intentions of the declarant\u2014cannot be the correct one. When the declar-ant has diminished capacity, focusing on the interrogators make less sense, not more. The inquiry under <em>Crawford </em>turns in part on the actions and statements of a declarant\u2019s audience only because they shape</p>\n<p id=\"A_m\">[562 U.S. 383]</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">the declar-ant\u2019s perception of why his audience is listening and therefore influence <em>his purpose </em>in making the declaration. See 541 U.S., at 51, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. But a person who cannot perceive his own purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>certainly cannot perceive why a listener might be interested in what he has to say. As far as I can tell, the Court\u2019s substituted-intent theory \u201chas nothing to be said for it except that it can sometimes make our job easier,\u201d <em>Jerman </em>v. <em>Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer &amp; Ulrich, L. P. A., </em>559 U.S. 573, 607, 130 S. Ct. 1605, 176 L. Ed. 2d 519 (2010) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The Court claims one affirmative virtue for its focus on the purposes of both the declarant and the police: It \u201cameliorates problems that. . . arise\u201d when declarants have \u201cmixed motives.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 368, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 113. I am at a loss to know how. Sorting out the primary purpose of a declarant with mixed motives is sometimes difficult. But adding in the mixed motives of the police only compounds the problem. Now courts will have to sort through two sets of mixed motives to determine the primary purpose of an interrogation. And the Court\u2019s solution creates a mixed-motive problem where (under the proper theory) it does not exist\u2014viz., where the police and the declarant each have one motive, but those motives conflict. The Court does not provide an answer to this glaringly obvious problem, probably because it does not have one.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The only virtue of the Court\u2019s approach (if it can be misnamed a virtue) is that it leaves judges free to reach the \u201cfairest\u201d result under the totality of the circumstances. If the dastardly police trick a declarant into giving an incriminating statement against a sympathetic defendant, a court can focus on the police\u2019s intent and declare the statement testimonial. If the defendant \u201cdeserves\u201d to go to jail, then a court can focus on whatever perspective is necessary to declare damning hearsay nontestimo-nial. And when all else fails, a court can mix and match perspectives to reach its desired outcome. Unfortunately, under this malleable</p>\n<p id=\"A3e\">[562 U.S. 384]</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">approach \u201cthe guarantee of confrontation is no guarantee at all.\u201d <em>Giles </em>v. <em>California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 375, 128 S. Ct. 2678, 171 L. Ed. 2d 488 (2008) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Looking to the declarant\u2019s purpose (as we should), this is an absurdly easy case. Roughly 25 minutes after Anthony Covington had been shot, Detroit police responded to a 911 call reporting that a gunshot victim had appeared at a neighborhood gas station. They quickly arrived at the scene, and in less than 10 minutes five different Detroit police officers questioned Covington about the shooting. Each asked him a similar battery of questions: \u201cwhat happened\u201d and when, App. 39, 126, \u201cwho shot\u201d the victim,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 22, and \u201cwhere\u201d did the shooting take place, <em>id., </em>at 132. See also <em>id., </em>at 113. After Covington would answer, they would ask followup questions, such as \u201chow tall is\u201d the shooter, <em>id., </em>at 134, \u201c[h]ow much does he weigh,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>what is the exact address or physical description of the house where the shooting took place, and what chain of events led to the shooting. The battery relented when the paramedics arrived and began tending to Covington\u2019s wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">From Covington\u2019s perspective, his statements had little value except to ensure the arrest and eventual prosecution of Richard Bryant. He knew the \u201cthreatening situation,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 832, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224, had ended six blocks away and 25 minutes earlier when he fled from Bryant\u2019s back porch. See 483 Mich. 132, 135-136, 768 N.W.2d 65, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>67 (2009); App. 105. Bryant had not confronted him face to face before he was mortally wounded, instead shooting him through a door. See 483 Mich., at 136-137, 768 N.W.2d, at 67. Even if Bryant had pursued him (unlikely), and after seeing that Coving-ton had ended up at the gas station was unable to confront him there before the police arrived (doubly unlikely), it was entirely beyond imagination that Bryant would again open fire while Covington was surrounded by five armed police officers. And Cov-ington knew the shooting was the work of</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">[562 U.S. 385]</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">a drug dealer, not a spree killer who might randomly threaten others. <em>Id., </em>at 135, 137, 768 N.W.2d, at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Covington\u2019s knowledge that he had nothing to fear differs significantly from Michelle McCottry\u2019s state of mind during her \u201cfrantic\u201d statements to a 911 operator at issue in <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 827, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. Her \u201ccall was plainly a call for help against a bona fide physical threat\u201d describing \u201cevents <em>as they were actually happening.\u201d Ibid. </em>She did not have the luxuries of police protection and of time and space separating her from immediate danger that Covington enjoyed when he made his statements. See <em>id., </em>at 831, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Covington\u2019s pressing medical needs do not suggest that he was responding to an emergency, but to the contrary reinforce the testimonial character of his statements. He understood the police were focused on investigating a past crime, not his medical needs. None of the officers asked Covington how he was doing, attempted more than superficially to assess the severity of his wounds, or attempted to administer first aid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They instead primarily asked questions with little, if any, relevance to Covington\u2019s dire situation. Police, paramedics, and doctors do not need to know the address where a shooting took place, the name of the shooter, or the shooter\u2019s height and weight to provide proper medical care. Underscoring that Cov-ington understood the officers\u2019 investigative role, he interrupted their interrogation to ask \u201cwhen is EMS coming?\u201d App. 57. When, in other words, would the focus shift to his medical needs rather than Bryant\u2019s crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">[562 U.S. 386]</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Neither Covington\u2019s statements nor the colloquy between him and the officers would have been out of place at a trial; it would have been a routine direct examination. See <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 830, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. Like a 6witness, Covington recounted in detail how a past criminal event began and progressed, and like a prosecutor, the police elicited that account through structured questioning. Preventing the admission of \u201cweaker substitute [s] for live testimony at trial\u201d such as this, <em>id., </em>at 828, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (internal quotation marks omitted), is precisely what motivated the Framers to adopt the Confrontation Clause and what motivated our decisions in <em>Crawford, </em>and in <em>Hammon </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>decided with <em>Davis. Ex parte </em>examinations raise the same constitutional concerns whether they take place in a gas-station parking lot or in a police interrogation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Worse still for the repute of today\u2019s opinion, this is an absurdly easy case even if one (erroneously) takes the interrogating officers\u2019 purpose into account. The five officers interrogated Covington primarily to investigate past criminal events. None\u2014absolutely none\u2014of their actions indicated that they perceived an imminent threat. They did not draw their weapons, and indeed did not immediately search the gas station for potential shooters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To the contrary, all five testified that they questioned Coving-ton <em>before conducting any investigation at the scene. </em>Would this have made any sense if they feared the presence of a shooter? Most tellingly, none of the officers started his interrogation by asking</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">[562 U.S. 387]</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">what would have been the obvious first question if any hint of such a fear existed: Where is the shooter?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">But do not rely solely on my word about the officers\u2019 primary purpose. Listen to Sergeant Wenturine, who candidly admitted that he interrogated Covington because he \u201cha[d] a man here that [he] believe [d] [was] dying [so he was] gonna find out who did this, period.\u201d App. 112. In short, he needed to interrogate Covington to solve a crime. Wenturine never mentioned an interest in ending an ongoing emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">At the very least, the officers\u2019 intentions <em>turned </em>investigative during their 10-minute encounter with Covington, and the conversation \u201cevolve [d] into testimonial statements.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 828, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (internal quotation marks omitted). The fifth officer to arrive at the scene did not need to run straight to Covington and ask a battery of questions \u201cto determine the need for emergency assistance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>He could have asked his fellow officers, who presumably had a better sense of that than Covington\u2014 and a better sense of what he could do to assist. No, the value of asking the same battery of questions a fifth time was to ensure that Covington told a consistent story and to see if any new details helpful to the investigation and eventual prosecution would emerge. Having the testimony of five officers to recount Covington\u2019s consistent story undoubtedly helped obtain Bryant\u2019s conviction. (Which came, I may note, after the first jury could not reach a verdict. See 483 Mich., at 137, 768 N.W.2d, at 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">A final word about the Court\u2019s active imagination. The Court invents a world where an ongoing emergency exists whenever \u201can armed shooter, whose motive for and location after the shooting [are] unknown, . . . mortally wound[s]\u201d one individual \u201cwithin a few blocks and [25] minutes of the location where the police\u201d ultimately find that victim. <em>Ante, </em>at 374, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 117. Breathlessly, it worries that a shooter could leave the scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>armed and ready to pull the trigger again. See <em>ante,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">[562 U.S. 388]</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">at 364-365, 373-374, 377, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 111-112, 116-117, 119. Nothing suggests the five officers in this case shared the Court\u2019s dystopian<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> view of Detroit, where drug dealers hunt their shooting victim down and fire into a crowd of police officers to finish him off, see <em>ante, </em>at 377, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 119, or where spree killers shoot through a door and then roam the streets leaving a trail of bodies behind. Because almost 90 percent of murders involve a single victim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is much more likely\u2014indeed, I think it certain\u2014 that the officers viewed their encounter with Covington for what it was: an investigation into a past crime with no ongoing or immediate consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The Court\u2019s distorted view creates an expansive exception to the Confrontation Clause for violent crimes. Because Bryant posed a continuing threat to public safety in the Court\u2019s imagination, the emergency persisted for confrontation purposes at least until the police learned his \u201cmotive for and location after the shooting.\u201d Ante, at 374, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 117. It may have persisted in this case until the police \u201csecured the scene of the shooting\u201d 2\u00bd hours later. <em>Ibid. </em>(The relevance of securing the scene is unclear so long as the killer is still at large\u2014especially if, as the Court speculates, he may be a spree killer.) This is a dangerous definition of emergency. Many individuals who testify against a defendant at trial first offer their accounts to police in the hours after a violent act. If the police can plausibly claim that a \u201cpotential threat to . . . the public\u201d persisted through those first few hours, <em>ante, </em>at 359, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 108 (and if the claim is plausible here it is always plausible), a defendant will have no constitutionally protected</p>\n<p id=\"AaF\">[562 U.S. 389]</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">right to exclude the uncross-examined testimony of such witnesses. His conviction could rest (as perhaps it did here) solely on the officers\u2019 recollection at trial of the witnesses\u2019 accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The Framers could not have envisioned such a hollow constitutional guarantee. No framing-era confrontation case that I know of, neither here nor in England, took such an enfeebled view of the right to confrontation. For example, <em>King </em>v. <em>Brasier, </em>1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng. Rep. 202, 202-203 (K. B. 1779), held inadmissible a mother\u2019s account of her young daughter\u2019s statements \u201cimmediately on her coming home\u201d after being sexually assaulted. The daughter needed to testify herself. But today\u2019s majority presumably would hold the daughter\u2019s account to her mother a nontes-timonial statement made during an ongoing emergency. She could not have known whether her attacker might reappear to attack again or attempt to silence the lone witness against him. Her mother likely listened to the account to assess the threat to her own safety and to decide whether the rapist posed a threat to the community that required the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>mediate intervention of the local authorities. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 375-376, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 118-119. Utter nonsense.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The 16th- and 17th-century English treason trials that helped inspire the Confrontation Clause show that today\u2019s decision is a mistake. The Court\u2019s expansive definition of an \u201congoing emergency\u201d and its willingness to consider the perspective of the interrogator and the declarant cast a more favorable light on those trials than history or our past decisions suggest they deserve. Royal officials conducted many of the <em>ex parte </em>examinations introduced against Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir John Fenwick while investigating alleged treasonous conspiracies of unknown scope, aimed at killing or overthrowing the King. See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>21-22, and n. 11. Social stability in 16th- and 17th-century England depended mainly on the continuity of the ruling monarch,</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">[562 U.S. 390]</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">cf. 1 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 354 (1883), so such a conspiracy posed the most pressing emergency imaginable. Presumably, the royal officials investigating it would have understood the gravity of the situation and would have focused their interrogations primarily on ending the threat, not on generating testimony for trial. I therefore doubt that under the Court\u2019s test English officials acted improperly by denying Raleigh and Fenwick the opportunity to confront their accusers \u201cface to face,\u201d <em>id.., </em>at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Under my approach, in contrast, those English trials remain unquestionably infamous. Lord Cobham did not speak with royal officials to end an ongoing emergency. He was a traitor! He spoke, as Raleigh correctly observed, to establish Raleigh\u2019s guilt and to save his own life. See 1 D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832). Cobham\u2019s statements, when assessed from his perspective, had only a testimonial purpose. The same is true of Covington\u2019s statements here.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">But today\u2019s decision is not only a gross distortion of the facts. It is a gross distortion of the law\u2014a revisionist narrative in which reliability continues to guide our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, at least where emergencies and faux emergencies are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">According to today\u2019s opinion, the <em>Davis </em>inquiry into whether a declar-ant spoke to end an ongoing emergency or rather to \u201cprove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,\u201d 547 U.S., at 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224, is <em>not </em>aimed at answering whether the de-clarant acted as a witness. Instead, the <em>Davis </em>inquiry probes the <em>reliability </em>of a declarant\u2019s statements, \u201c[i]m-plicit[ly]\u201d importing the excited-utterances hearsay exception into the Constitution. Ante, at 361-362, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 109-110. A statement during an ongoing emergency is sufficiently reliable, the Court says, \u201cbecause the prospect of fabrication ... is presumably significantly diminished,\u201d so it \u201cdoes not [need]</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">[562 U.S. 391]</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">to be subject to the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d Ante, at 361, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">Compare that with the holding of <em>Crawford: </em>\u201cWhere testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\u201d 541 U.S., at 68-69, 124 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Today\u2019s opinion adopts, for emergencies and faux emergencies at least, the discredited logic of <em>White </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 355-356, and n. 8, 112 S. Ct. 736, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1992), and <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 819-820, 110 S. Ct. 3139, 111 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1990). <em>White </em>is, of course, the decision that both <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>found most incompatible with the text and history of the Confrontation Clause. See <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 825, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224; <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 58, n. 8, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. (This is not to say that \u201creliability\u201d logic can actually justify today\u2019s result: Twenty-five minutes is plenty of time for a shooting victim to reflect and fabricate a false story.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The Court announces that in future cases it will look to \u201cstandard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some statements as reliable,\u201d when deciding whether a statement is testimonial. <em>Ante, </em>at 358-359, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 107-108. <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980), said something remarkably similar: An out-of-court statement is admissible if it \u201cfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or otherwise \u201cbears adequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 <em>\u201dId., </em>at 66, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597. We tried that approach to the Confrontation Clause for nearly 25 years before <em>Crawford rejected </em>it as an unworkable standard unmoored from the text and the historical roots of the Confrontation Clause. See 541 U.S., at 54, 60, 63-65, 67-68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. The arguments in Raleigh\u2019s infamous 17th-century treason trial contained full debate about the reliability of Lord Cobham\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>accusations, see <em>Raleigh\u2019s Case, </em>2 How. St. Tr. 1, 14, 17, 19-20, 22-23, 29 (1603); that case remains the canonical example of a Confrontation Clause violation, not because Raleigh should have won the debate but because he should have been allowed cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">[562 U.S. 392]</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The Court attempts to fit its resurrected interest in reliability into the <em>Crawford, </em>framework, but the result is incoherent. Reliability, the Court tells us, is a good indicator of whether \u201ca statement is ... an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 358, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 107. That is patently false. Reliability tells us <em>nothing </em>about whether a statement is testimonial. Testimonial and nontes-timonial statements alike come in varying degrees of reliability. An eyewitness\u2019s statements to the police after a fender-bender, for example, are both reliable and testimonial. Statements to the police from one driver attempting to blame the other would be similarly testimonial but rarely reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The Court suggests otherwise because it \u201cmisunderstands the relationship\u201d between qualification for one of the standard hearsay exceptions and exemption from the confrontation requirement. <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 324, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (2009). That relationship is not a causal one. Hearsay law exempts business records, for example, because businesses have a financial incentive to keep reliable records. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6). The Sixth Amendment also generally admits business records into evidence, but not because the records are reliable or because hearsay law says so. It admits them \u201cbecause\u2014having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>establishing or proving some fact at trial\u2014they are not\u201d weaker substitutes for live testimony. <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 324, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314. Moreover, the scope of the exemption from confrontation and that of the hearsay exceptions also are not always coextensive. The reliability logic of the business-record exception would extend to records maintained by neutral parties providing litigation-support services, such as evidence testing. The Confrontation Clause is not so forgiving. Business records prepared specifically for use at a criminal trial are testimonial and require confrontation. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Is it possible that the Court does not recognize the contradiction between its focus on reliable statements and <em>Crawford\u2019s</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">[562 U.S. 393]</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">focus on testimonial ones? Does it not realize that the two cannot coexist? Or does it intend, by following today\u2019s illogical roadmap, to resurrect <em>Roberts </em>by a thousand unprincipled distinctions without ever explicitly overruling <em>Crawford? </em>After ah, honestly overruling <em>Crawford. </em>would destroy the illusion of judicial minimalism and restraint. And it would force the Court to explain how the Justices\u2019 preference comports with the meaning of the Confrontation Clause that the People adopted\u2014or to confess that only the Justices\u2019 preference really matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The Court recedes from <em>Crawford. </em>in a second significant way. It requires judges to conduct \u201copen-ended balancing tests\u201d and \u201camorphous, if not entirely subjective,\u201d inquiries into the totality of the circumstances bearing upon reliability. 541 U.S., at 63, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Where the prosecution cries \u201cemergency,\u201d the admissibility of a statement now turns on \u201ca highly context-dependent inquiry,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 363, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 110, into the type of weapon the defendant wielded, see <em>ante, </em>at 364, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 111; the type of crime the defendant committed, see <em>ante, </em>at 359, 364, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 108, 111; the medical condition of the declarant, see <em>ante, </em>at 364-365, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 111-112; if the de-clarant is injured, whether paramedics have arrived on the scene, see <em>ante, </em>at 366, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 112; whether the encounter takes place in an \u201cexposed, public area,\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>whether the encounter appears disorganized, see <em>ibid.; </em>whether the declar-ant is capable of forming a purpose, see <em>ante, </em>at 368-369, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 113-114; whether the police have secured the scene of the crime, see <em>ante, </em>at 374, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 117; the formality of the statement, see <em>ante, </em>at 366, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 112; and finally, whether the statement strikes us as reliable, see <em>ante, </em>at 358-359, 361-362, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 107-108, 109-110. This is no better than the nine-factor balancing test we rejected in <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S., at 63, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. I do not look forward to resolving conflicts in the future over whether knives and poison are more like guns or fists for Confrontation Clause purposes, or whether rape and armed robbery are more like murder or domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">[562 U.S. 394]</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">It can be said, of course, that under <em>Crawford </em>analysis of whether a statement is testimonial requires consideration of ah the circumstances, and so is also something of a multifactor balancing test. But the \u201creliability\u201d test does not replace that analysis; it supplements it. As I understand the Court\u2019s opinion, even when it is deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>mined that no emergency exists (or perhaps before that determination is made) the statement would be found admissible as far as the Confrontation Clause is concerned if it is not testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In any case, we did not disavow multifactor balancing for reliability in <em>Crawford </em>out of a preference for rules over standards. We did so because it \u201cd[id] violence to\u201d the Framers\u2019 design. <em>Id., </em>at 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. It was judges\u2019open-ended determination of what was reliable that violated the trial rights of Englishmen in the political trials of the 16th and 17th centuries. See, <em>e.g., Throckmorton\u2019s Case, </em>1 How. St. Tr. 869, 875-876 (1554); <em>Raleigh\u2019s Case, </em>2 How. St. Tr., at 15-16, 24. The Framers placed the Confrontation Clause in the Bill of Rights to ensure that those abuses (and the abuses by the Admiralty courts in colonial America) would not be repeated in this country. Not even the least dangerous branch can be trusted to assess the reliability of uncross-examined testimony in politically charged trials or trials implicating threats to national security. See <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 67-68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177; cf. <em>Hamdi </em>v. <em>Rumsfeld, </em>542 U.S. 507, 576-578, 124 S. Ct. 2633, 159 L.

Officer Stuglin\u2019s testimony does not undermine my assessment of the officers\u2019 behavior, although the Court suggests otherwise. See <em>ante, </em>at 375, n. 18, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 117-118. Officer Stuglin first testified that he \u201casked something like what happened or are you okay, something to that line.\u2019\u2019 App. 131. When pressed on whether he asked \u201chow are you doing,\u2019\u2019 he responded, \u201cWell, basically . . . what\u2019s wrong.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ibid. </em>Other officers were not so equivocal: They admitted they had no need to \u201cask him how he was doing. ... It was very obvious how he was doing.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 110; see also <em>id., </em>at 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-12\">. The Court cites Officer Stuglin\u2019s testimony that \u201cI think [Officers Brown and Pellerito] did a little bit of both\u201d joining the interrogation and helping to secure the scene. <em>Id., </em>at 135-136. But the point is not whether they did both; it is whether they moved to secure the area <em>first. </em>No officer\u2019s testimony suggests this. Pellerito testified that he, Stuglin, and Brown arrived at the scene at roughly the same time and all three immediately went to Covington. See <em>id., </em>at 17-18. The testimony of Brown and McCallister corroborate that account. See <em>id., </em>at 34-36, 79-82.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\">. The opposite of utopian. The word was coined by John Stuart Mill as a caustic description of British policy. See 190 Hansard\u2019s Parliamentary Debates, Third Series 1517 (1868); 5 Oxford English Dictionary 13 (2d ed. 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\">.

Ed. 2d, at 121 (dissenting opinion). Even if the interrogators\u2019 intent were what counts, I further agree, Coving-ton\u2019s statements would still be testimonial. <em>Ante, </em>at 386, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 124-125. It is most likely that \u201cthe officers viewed their encounter with Covington [as] an investigation into a past crime with no ongoing or immediate consequences.\u201d Ante, at 388, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 126. Today\u2019s decision, Justice Scalia rightly notes, \u201ccreates an expansive exception to the Confrontation Clause for violent crimes.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In so doing, the decision confounds our recent Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, <em>ante, </em>at 390-391, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 127-128, which made it plain that \u201c [r] eliability tells us nothing about whether a statement is testimonial,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 392, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 128 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">I would add, however, this observation. In <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 56, n. 6, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), this Court noted that, in the law we inherited from England, there was a well-established exception to the confrontation requirement: The cloak protecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>accused against admission of out-of-court testimonial statements was removed for dying declarations. This historic exception, we recalled in <em>Giles </em>v. <em>California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 358, 128 S. Ct. 2678, 171 L. Ed. 2d 488 (2008); see <em>id., </em>at 361-362, 368, 128 S. Ct. 2678, 171 L. Ed. 2d 488, applied to statements made by a person about to die and aware that death was imminent. Were the issue properly tendered here, I would take up the question whether the exception for dying declarations survives our recent Confrontation</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">[562 U.S. 396]</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Clause decisions. The Michigan Supreme Court, however, held, as a matter of state law, that the prosecutor had abandoned the issue. See 483 Mich. 132, 156-157, 768 N.W.2d 65, 78 (2009). The matter, therefore, is not one the Court can address in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
