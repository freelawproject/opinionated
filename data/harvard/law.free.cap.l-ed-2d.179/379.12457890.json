We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">The petitioner, Kevin Kasten, brought this antiretaliation lawsuit against his former employer, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation. Kasten says that Saint-Gobain located its timeclocks between the area where Kasten and</p>\n<p id=\"AcpV\">[563 U.S. 5]</p>\n<p id=\"b482-19\">other workers put on (and take off) their work-related protective gear and the area where they carry out their assigned tasks. That location prevented workers from receiving credit for the time they spent putting on and taking off their work clothes\u2014contrary to the Act\u2019s requirements. In a related suit the District Court agreed with Kas-ten, finding that Saint-Gobain\u2019s \u201cpractice of not compensating . . . for time spent donning and doffing certain required protective gear and walking to work areas\u201d violated the Act. <em>Kasten </em>v. <em>Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., </em>556 F. Supp. 2d 941, 954 (WD Wis. 2008). In this suit Kasten claims unlawful retaliation. He says that Saint-Gobain discharged him because he orally complained to Saint-Gobain officials about the timeclocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-20\">In particular, Kasten says that he repeatedly called the unlawful timeclock location to Saint-Gobain\u2019s attention\u2014in accordance with Saint-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Gobain\u2019s internal grievance-resolution procedure. See Brief for Petitioner 4 (quoting Saint-Gobain\u2019s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct as imposing upon every employee \u201cthe responsibility to report . . . suspected violations of. . . any applicable law of which he or she becomes aware\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 4-5 (quoting Saint-Gobain\u2019s Employee Policy Handbook as instructing employees with \u201cquestions, complaints, and problems\u201d to \u201c[c]ontact\u201d their \u201csupervisor^] immediately\u201d and if necessary \u201ctake the issue to the next level of management,\u201d then to the \u201clocal Human Resources Manager,\u201d then to \u201cHuman Resources\u201d personnel at the \u201cRegional\u201d or \u201cHeadquarters\u201d level).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Hasten adds that he \u201craised a concern\u201d with his shift supervisor that \u201cit was illegal for the time clocks to be where they were\u201d because of Saint-Gobain\u2019s exclusion of \u201cthe time you come in and start doing stuff\u2019; he told a human resources employee that \u201cif they were to get challenged on\u201d the location in court, \u201cthey would lose\u201d; he told his lead operator that the location was illegal and that he \u201cwas thinking about starting a lawsuit about the placement of the time clocks\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">[563 U.S. 6]</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">and he told the human resources manager and the operations manager that he thought the location was illegal and that the company would \u201close\u201d in court. Record in No. 3:07-cv-00686-bbc (WD Wis.), Doc. 87-3, pp. 31-34 (deposition of Kevin Hasten). This activity, Hasten concludes, led the company to discipline him and, in December 2006, to dismiss him.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Saint-Gobain presents a different version of events. It denies that Hasten made any significant complaint about the timeclock location. And it says that it dismissed Hasten simply because Hasten, after being repeatedly warned, failed to record his comings and goings on the timeclock.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">For present purposes we accept Kasten\u2019s version of these contested events as valid. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). That is because the District Court entered summary judgment in Saint-Gobain\u2019s favor. 619 F. Supp. 2d 608, 610 (WD Wis. 2008). And it did so, not because it doubted Kasten\u2019s ability to prove the facts he alleged, but because it thought the Act did not protect <em>oral </em>complaints. <em>Id., </em>at 611-613. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that the Act\u2019s anti-retaliation provision does not cover oral complaints. 570 F.3d 834, 838-840 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Hasten sought certiorari. And in light of conflict among the Circuits as to whether an oral complaint is protected, we granted Kasten\u2019s petition. Compare <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>Echostar Satellite, L. L. C., </em>529 F.3d 617, 625-626 (CA5 2008) (antiretaliation provision covers oral complaints); <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Ackerley, </em>180 F.3d 997, 1007 (CA9 1999) (en banc) (same), with <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Genesee Hospital, </em>10 F.3d 46, 55-56 (CA2 1993) (antiretaliation provision does not cover informal complaints to supervisors).

The Act protects employees who have \u201cfiled any complaint,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3), and interpretation of this phrase \u201cdepends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis,\u201d <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Postal Service, </em>546 U.S. 481, 486, 126 S. Ct. 1252, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1079 (2006). This analysis leads us to conclude that the language of the provision, considered in isolation, may be open to competing interpretations. But considering the provision in conjunction with the purpose and context leads us to conclude that only one interpretation is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We begin with the text of the statute. The word \u201cfiled\u201d has different relevant meanings in different contexts. Some dictionary definitions of the word contemplate a writing. See, <em>e.g., </em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 945 (2d ed. 1934) (def. 4(a)) (to file is to \u201cdeliver <em>(a paper or instrument) </em>to the proper officer so that it is received by him to be kept on file, or among the records of his office\u201d (emphasis added)); Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 462 (1983) (def. 2(a)) (one definition of \u201cfile\u201d is \u201cto place among official records as prescribed by law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">But other dictionaries provide different definitions that permit the use of the word \u201cfile\u201d in conjunction with oral material. One can, for example, file an oral statement that enters a matter \u201cinto the order of business.\u201d 1 Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (def. 2) (to file is to \u201cpresent in the regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body, so that it shall go</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">[563 U.S. 8]</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">upon the records or into the order of business\u201d). This possibility is significant because it means that dictionary meanings, even if considered alone, do not <em>necessarily </em>limit the scope of the statutory phrase to written complaints. Cf. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson Cty., </em>555 U.S. 271, 277, 129 S. Ct. 846, 172 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2009) (looking for the \u201climits\u201d of a linguistic phrase rather than what \u201cexemplifiies]\u201d its application).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">In addition to the dictionary definitions, we have found that legislators, administrators, and judges have all sometimes used the word \u201cfile\u201d in conjunction with oral statements. Thus state statutes sometimes contemplate oral filings. See, <em>e.g., </em>Alaska Stat. \u00a7 47.32.090(a) (2008) (\u201cfile a verbal or written complaint\u201d); Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 17055(a) (West 2006) (\u201cfile an administrative complaint orally or in writing\u201d); D. C.

Code \u00a7\u00a790.64.030(3), (5) (2008)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">[563 U.S. 9]</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">(\u201ccomplaints have been filed ... as the result of either an oral or a written complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Regulations promulgated by various federal agencies sometimes permit complaints to be filed orally. See, <em>e.g., </em>32 CFR \u00a7 842.20 (2010) (\u201c[fliling a claim\u201d may proceed \u201corally or in writing\u201d); 42 CFR \u00a7 422.564(d)(1) (2009) (\u201cfile a grievance . . . either orally or in writing\u201d); \u00a7 423.564(d)(1) (same); \u00a7 438.402(b)(3)(i) (\u201cfile a grievance either orally or in writing\u201d); \u00a7 494.180(e) (\u201cfile an oral or written grievance\u201d); 49 CFR \u00a7 1503.629(c) (2009) (\u201c[fliling of motions . . . must be in writing or orally on the record\u201d (emphasis deleted)); 42 CFR \u00a7 438.402(b)(3)(ii) (2009) (\u201cfile an appeal either orally or in writing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">And a review of contemporaneous judicial usage, cf. <em>Utah </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>536 U.S. 452, 475, 122 S. Ct. 2191, 153 L. Ed. 2d 453 (2002), shows that oral filings were a known phenomenon when the Act was passed. See, <em>e.g., Reed Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>169 Ark. 309, 312, 275 S.W. 333, 334 (1925) (\u201cappel-lee filed ... an oral complaint\u201d); <em>Tingler </em>v. <em>Lahti, 87 </em>W. Va. 499, 503, 105 S.E. 810, 812 (1921) (\u201ccomplaint subsequently filed, either oral or written\u201d); <em>Ex parte Mosgrove, </em>47 Okla. Cr. 40, 287 P. 795 (1930) (only \u201ccomplaint . . . filed against him\u201d was \u201coral complaint of the town marshal\u201d); <em>Indian Fred </em>v. <em>State, </em>36 Ariz. 48, 52-53, 282 P. 930, 932 (1929) (\u201cfiled an oral motion to quash\u201d); <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>State, </em>60 Okla. Cr. 201, 203, 63 P.2d 772, 773 (1936) (\u201cfiled an oral demurrer\u201d); <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>58 Ga. App. 677, 199 S.E. 782 (1938) (\u201cfiled an oral motion\u201d demurring); <em>Brock </em>v. <em>Cullum Bros., </em>263 S.W. 335 (Tex. Civ. App. 1924) (\u201cfiled an oral motion to quash\u201d); <em>Fike </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>269 S.W. 179, 180 (Tex. Civ. App. 1925) (\u201cfiled oral pleadings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Filings may more often be made in writing. See, <em>e.g., Ritter </em>v. <em>United States, </em>28 F.2d 265, 267 (CA3 1928) (finding words \u201cfile a claim for refund\u201d to require a written request in context of Tax Code). But we are interested in the filing of <em>\u201cany </em>complaint.\u201d So even if the word \u201cfiled,\u201d considered alone, might suggest a narrow interpretation limited to writings,</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">[563 U.S. 10]</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">the phrase <em>\u201cany </em>complaint\u201d suggests a broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint. See, <em>e.g., Republic of Iraq </em>v. <em>Beaty, </em>556 U.S. 848, 856, 129 S. Ct. 2183, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1193 (2009). The upshot is that the three-word phrase, taken by itself, cannot answer the interpretive question.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">We can look further to other appearances of the word \u201cfiled\u201d in the Act. See <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. </em>v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>512 U.S. 218, 226, 114 S. Ct. 2223, 129 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1994) (examining \u201ccontextual indications\u201d of the meaning of a term). That word (or a variant) appears in numerous other provisions. But its appearance elsewhere in the Act does not resolve the linguistic question before us. Some of those other provisions (1) involve filed material that, unlike a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>complaint, is of a kind that is virtually always in writing. See, <em>e.g., </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>203(l) </em>(employers must \u201chave on file <em>an unexpired certificate\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); \u00a7 210(a) (Secretary must \u201cfile in the court <em>the record of the industry committee\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>ibid, </em>(industry committee must \u201cfile\u201d its findings and recommendations). Others (2) specifically require a writing, see, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 214(c)(5)(A) (requiring employee\u2019s \u201cconsent <em>in writing\u201d </em>to join collective action to be \u201cfiled\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7 216(b) (same). And the remainder (3) leave the oral/written question unresolved\u2014just as does the provision before us. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 210(b) (prohibiting a stay unless movant \u201cfile [s] in court an <em>undertaking\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); \u00a7 214(c)(5)(A) (employee \u201cmay file ... a <em>petition\u201d </em>for review of a special wage rate (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Looking beyond the Act, we find other statutes that contain antiretali-ation provisions. Those statutes, however, use somewhat different language. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 158(a)(4) (protecting an employee who has \u201cfiled charges or given testimony\u201d); \u00a7 623(d) (protecting those who <em>\u201copposed </em>any [unlawful] practice\u201d (emphasis added)); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-3(a), 12203(a) (same); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(2) (similar). See also, <em>e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2087(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. Ill) <em>(\u201cprovided </em>... to the employer . . . <em>information </em>relating to any violation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">[563 U.S. 11]</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">(emphasis added)); \u00a7 2651(a) (2006 ed.) (similar); 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 815(c)(1) (\u201cfiled <em>or made </em>a complaint\u201d (emphasis added)); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851(a)(1)(A) <em>(\u201cnotified </em>his employer\u201d (emphasis added)); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(a)(1) <em>(\u201cprovided . . . </em>information\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7 60129(a)(1) (same). Some of this language is broader than the phrase before us, but, given the fact that the phrase before us lends itself linguistically to the broader, \u201coral\u201d interpretation, the use of broader language elsewhere <em>may </em>mean (1) that Congress wanted to limit the scope of the phrase before us to writings, or (2) that Congress did not believe the different phraseology made a significant difference in this respect. The language alone does not tell us whether Congress, if intending to protect orally expressed grievances elsewhere, did or did not intend to leave those oral grievances unprotected here.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The bottom line is that the text, taken alone, cannot provide a conclusive answer to our interpretive question. The phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d might, or might not, encompass oral complaints. We must look further.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Several functional considerations indicate that Congress intended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral, as well as written, \u201ccomplaint[s].\u201d First, an interpretation that limited the provision\u2019s coverage to written complaints would undermine the Act\u2019s basic objectives. The Act seeks to prohibit \u201clabor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(a). It does so in part by setting forth substantive wage, hour, and overtime standards. It relies for enforcement of these standards, not upon \u201ccontinuing detailed federal supervision or inspection of payrolls,\u201d but upon \u201cinformation and complaints received from employees seeking to vindicate rights claimed to have been denied.\u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Robert DeMario</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">[563 U.S. 12]</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\"><em>Jewelry, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>361 U.S. 288, 292, 80 S.

And its antiretali-ation provision makes this enforcement scheme effective by preventing \u201cfear of economic retaliation\u201d from inducing workers \u201cquietly to accept substandard conditions.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Why would Congress want to limit the enforcement scheme\u2019s effectiveness by inhibiting use of the Act\u2019s complaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their complaints to writing, particularly illiterate, less educated, or overworked workers? President Franklin Roosevelt pointed out at the time that these were the workers most in need of the Act\u2019s help. See Message to Congress, May 24, 1937, H. R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (seeking a bill to help the poorest of \u201cthose who toil in factory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In the years prior to the passage of the Act, illiteracy rates were particularly high among the poor. See E. Gordon &amp; E. Gordon, Literacy in America 273 (2003) (one-quarter of World War I conscripts were illiterate); Dept, of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Sixteenth Census of the United States, 1940, Population: The Labor Force (Sample Statistics): Occupational Characteristics 60 (1943) (20.8% of manufacturing laborers in 1940 had less than five years of schooling). Those rates remained high in certain industries for many years after the Act\u2019s passage. In 1948, for example, the National War Labor Board wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cIn many plants where there is a high degree of illiteracy, the writing of grievances by employees works a substantial hardship. In other plants where there is considerable dirt and special clothes must be worn, it is often not practicable to write up grievances during work hours.\u201d 1 The Termination Report of the National War Labor Board, p. 122.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">To limit the scope of the antiretali-ation provision to the filing of written complaints would also take needed flexibility from those charged with the Act\u2019s enforcement. It could</p>\n<p id=\"apsb-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 13]</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">prevent Government agencies from using hotlines, interviews, and other oral methods of receiving complaints. And insofar as the antiretaliation provision covers complaints made to employers (a matter we need not decide, see <em>infra, </em>at 14-15), it would discourage the use of desirable informal workplace grievance procedures to secure compliance with the Act. Cf. <em>Burlington Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 764, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998) (reading Title VII to encourage the development of effective grievance procedures to deter misconduct); D. McPherson, C. Gates, &amp; K. Rogers, Resolving Grievances: A Practical Approach 38-40 (1983) (describing the significant benefits of unwritten complaints).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Given the need for effective enforcement of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), this Court has broadly interpreted the language of the NLRA\u2019s antiretaliation provision\u2014\u201cfiled charges or given testimony,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(4)\u2014as protecting workers who <em>neither </em>filed charges <em>nor </em>were \u201ccalled <em>formally </em>to testify\u201d but simply \u201cparticipate [d] in a [National Labor Relations] Board investigation.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Scrivener, </em>405 U.S. 117, 123, 92 S. Ct. 798, 31 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1972) (emphasis added). The similar enforcement needs of this related statute argue for an interpretation of the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d that would provide \u201cbroad rather than narrow protection to the employee,\u201d <em>id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>at 122, 92 S. Ct. 798, 31 L. Ed. 2d 79 (and would do so here without pressing statutory language to its limit). See also <em>Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co. </em>v. <em>Muscoda Local No. 123, </em>321 U.S. 590, 597, 64 S. Ct. 698, 88 L. Ed. 949 (1944) (the Act\u2019s \u201cremedial and humanitarian . . . purpose\u201d cautions against \u201cnarrow, grudging\u201d interpretations of its language).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Saint-Gobain replies that worker protection is not the only relevant statutory objective. The Act also seeks to establish an enforcement system that is fair to employers. To do so, the employer must have fair notice that an employee is making a complaint that could subject the employer to a later claim of retaliation. If oral complaints suffice, Saint-Gobain adds, employers too often will be left in a state of uncertainty</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">[563 U.S. 14]</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">about whether an employee (particularly an employee who seems unusually angry at the moment) is in fact making a complaint about an Act violation or just letting off steam.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">We agree with Saint-Gobain that  the statute requires fair notice. Although the dictionary definitions, statutes, regulations, and judicial opinions we considered, see <em>supra, </em>at 7-10, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 386-388, do not distinguish between writings and oral statements, they do suggest that a \u201cfiling\u201d is a serious occasion, rather than a triviality. As such, the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d contemplates some degree of formality, certainly to the point where the recipient has been given fair notice that a grievance has been lodged and does, or should, reasonably understand the matter as part of its business concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Moreover,  the statute prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee <em>\u201cbecause </em>such employee has filed any complaint.\u201d \u00a7 215(a)(3) (emphasis added). And it is difficult to see how an employer who does not (or should not) know an employee has made a complaint could discriminate <em>because </em>of that complaint. But we also believe that a fair notice requirement does not necessarily mean that notice must be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">At oral argument, the Government said that  a complaint is \u201cfiled\u201d when \u201ca reasonable, objective person would have understood the employee\u201d to have \u201cput the employer on notice that [the] employee is asserting statutory rights under the [Act].\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26. We agree. To fall within the scope of the antiretaliation provision, a complaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a reasonable employer to understand it, in light of both content and context, as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection. This standard can be met, however, by oral complaints, as well as by written ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">Second, given Congress\u2019 delegation of enforcement powers to federal administrative agencies, we also give a degree of</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">[563 U.S. 15]</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">weight to their views about the meaning of this enforcement language. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(c) (vesting enforcement power in Secretary of Labor); Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, 5 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1, p. 664 (transferring to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforcement of this antiretaliation provision as part of its Equal Pay Act enforcement responsibilities); <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944) (giving weight to a persuasive articulation of views within an agency\u2019s area of expertise).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The Secretary of Labor has consistently held the view that the words \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d cover oral, as well as written, complaints. The Department of Labor articulated that view in an enforcement action filed many years ago, <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Zenger, </em>43 CCH LC \u00b631,155, pp. 40,985, 40,986 (D Utah 1961). It has subsequently reaffirmed that view in briefs. See, <em>eg., </em>Brief for Secretary of Labor <em>as Amicus Curiae </em>Supporting Petition for Rehearing With Suggestion for Rehearing <em>En Banc </em>in <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Ackerley, </em>No. 96-36017 etc. (CA9), pp. 6-7. And more recently it has acted in accordance with that view by creating a hotline to receive oral complaints, see Dept, of Labor, Compliance Assistance by Law\u2014The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), http://www.dol.gov/ compliance/laws/comp-flsa.htm (as visited Mar. 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (directing participants who wish to \u201cfile a complaint\u201d to contact a local office \u201cor call the Department\u2019s Toll-Free Wage and Hour Help Line at 1-866-4-US-WAGE\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The EEOC has set forth a similar view in its Compliance Manual, Vol. 2, \u00a7 8-IKBK1), p. 8-3, and n. 12 (1998), and in multiple briefs, see, <em>eg., </em>Brief for EEOC as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in Support of Petition for Rehearing With Suggestion for Rehearing <em>En Banc </em>in <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Ackerley, </em>No. 96-36017 etc. (CA9), pp. 8-13; Brief for Appellee in <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>White &amp; Son Enterprises, Inc., </em>No. 88-7658 (CA11), pp. 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">These agency views are reasonable. They are consistent with the Act. The length of time the agencies have held</p>\n<p id=\"AIqQ\">[563 U.S. 16]</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">them suggests that they reflect careful consideration, not <em>\u201cpost hoc </em>ratio-nalizatio[n].\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 50, 103 S. Ct. 2856, 77 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1983). And they consequently add force to our conclusion. <em>Skidmore, supra, </em>at 140, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 229, 234-235, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2001) (Court sometimes finds judicial deference intended even in absence of rulemaking authority); <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., </em>515 U.S. 687, 703-704, and n. 18, 115 S. Ct. 2407, 132 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1995) (agency views, where the law counsels deference, can clarify otherwise ambiguous statutory provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Finally, we note that Saint-Gobain invokes the \u201crule of lenity\u201d in support of its \u201cwritten complaint\u201d interpretation.  That rule applies primarily to the interpretation of criminal statutes. It leads us to favor a more lenient interpretation of a criminal statute \u201cwhen, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shabani, </em>513 U.S. 10, 17, 115 S. Ct. 382, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1994). We agree with Saint-Gobain that  those who violate the antiretaliation provision before us are subject to criminal sanction, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(a). And we have said that the rule of lenity can apply when a statute with criminal sanctions is applied in a noncriminal context. See <em>Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 11, n. 8, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2004). But after engaging in traditional methods of statutory interpretation, we cannot find that the statute remains sufficiently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of lenity here.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Alternatively, Saint-Gobain claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>that it should prevail because Hasten complained to a private employer, not to the Government; and, in Saint-Gobain\u2019s view, the antiretaliation provision applies only to complaints filed with the Government. Saint-Gobain advanced this claim in the lower courts,</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">[563 U.S. 17]</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">which held to the contrary. 570 F.3d, at 837-838; 619 F. Supp. 2d, at 613. But Saint-Gobain said nothing about it in response to Kasten\u2019s petition for certiorari. Indeed, it did not mention the claim in this Court until it filed its brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We do not normally consider a separate legal question not raised in the certiorari briefs. See this Court\u2019s Rule 15.2; <em>Caterpillar Inc. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>519 U.S. 61, 75, n. 13, 117 S. Ct. 467, 136 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1996). We see no reason to make an exception here. Resolution of the Government/private employer question is not a \u201c \u2018 \u201cpredicate to an intelligent resolution\u201d \u2019 \u201d of the oral/written question that we granted certiorari to decide. See <em>ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 38, 117 S. Ct. 417, 136 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1996)). That is to say, we can decide the oral/written question separately\u2014on its own. And we have done so. Thus, we state no view on the merits of Saint-Gobain\u2019s alternative claim. Cf. <em>post, </em>at 18-21, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 393-394 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"pAVx_\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"35\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARoAAAAjAQAAAABjyvjGAAAAkElEQVR4nO3TsQnCUBSF4T8HhHSOYNZwF5dIl9LSMRwlir3gKmksAtfSUxxI8woLb/f93EDyeOmKzblpewcaL529BAio2XJC23e6Hi0kCBj9qQQB09t6goDTYj2iqtZDfSdgFqDBvyRAwOI9QcDLDytBwGNvPUHApbeeIOC5s54gYLhbT2h3C7pf/Vv+S22WPquZRvVbqcQOAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"282\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">We conclude that the Seventh Circuit erred in determining that oral complaints cannot fall within the scope of the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d in the Act\u2019s antiretaliation provision. We leave it to the lower courts to decide whether Hasten will be able to satisfy the Act\u2019s notice requirement. We vacate the Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b490-8\">Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"ADNS\">with whom Justice Thomas joins as to all but footnote 6, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The Seventh Circuit found for the employer because it held that the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3), covers only written complaints to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">[563 U.S. 18]</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">I would affirm the judgment on the ground that \u00a7 215(a)(3) does not cover complaints to the employer at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">The FLSA\u2019s retaliation provision states that it shall be unlawful</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-14\">\u201cto discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter, or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding, or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee.\u201d <em>Ibid..</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-21\">The phrase central to the outcome here is \u201cfiled any complaint.\u201d In the courts below, Hasten asserted a claim for retaliation based solely on allegations that he \u201cfiled\u201d oral \u201ccomplaints\u201d with his employer; Saint-Gobain argued that the retaliation provision protects only complaints that are (1) in writing, and (2) made to judicial or administrative bodies. I agree with at least the second part of Saint-Gobain\u2019s contention. The plain mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ing of the critical phrase and the context in which it appears make clear that the retaliation provision contemplates an official grievance filed with a court or an agency, not oral complaints\u2014or even formal, written complaints\u2014from an employee to an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In isolation, the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d could cover Kasten\u2019s objection: It often has an expansive meaning, connoting any \u201c[expression of grief, regret, pain ... or resentment.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 546 (2d ed. 1934) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s). But at the time the FLSA was passed (and still today) the word when used in a legal context has borne a specialized meaning: \u201c[a] formal allegation or charge against a party, made or presented to the appropriate court</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">[563 U.S. 19]</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">or officer.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also Cambridge Dictionary of American English 172 (2000) (\u201ca formal statement to a government authority that you have a legal cause to complain about the way you have been treated\u201d); 3 Oxford English Dictionary 608 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[a] statement of injury or grievance laid before a court or judicial authority ... for purposes of prosecution or of redress\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">There are several reasons to think that the word bears its specialized meaning here. First, every other use of the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the FLSA refers to an official filing with a governmental body. Sections 216(b) and (c) both state that the right to bring particular types of actions \u201cshall terminate upon the filing of a complaint\u201d by the Secretary of Labor, and \u00a7 216(c) clarifies that the statute of limitations begins running in actions to recover unpaid wages \u201con the date when the complaint is filed.\u201d These provisions unquestionably use \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the narrow legal sense. Identical words used in different parts of a statute are presumed to have the same meaning absent contrary indication, <em>IBP, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>546 U.S. 21, 34, 126 S. Ct. 514, 163 L. Ed. 2d 288 (2005); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Stroop, </em>496 U.S. 478, 484, 110 S. Ct. 2499, 110 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1990). It is one thing to expand the meaning of \u201ccomplaint\u201d in \u00a7 215(a)(3) to include complaints filed with an agency instead of a court; it is quite something else to wrench it from the legal context entirely, to include an employee\u2019s objection to an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Second, the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d appears as part of the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d and thus draws meaning from the verb with which it is connected. The choice of the word \u201cfiled\u201d rather than a broader alternative like \u201cmade,\u201d if it does not connote (as the Seventh Circuit believed, and as I need not consider) something in writing, at least suggests a degree of formality consistent with legal action and inconsistent (at least in the less regulated work environment of 1938) with employee-to-employer complaints. It is noteworthy that every definition of the verb \u201cfiled\u201d that the Court\u2019s opinion provides, whether it supports the inclusion of oral</p>\n<p id=\"Afaq\">[563 U.S. 20]</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">content or not, envisions a formal, prescribed process of delivery or submission. <em>Ante, </em>at 7-8, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 386 (comparing, for example, Webster\u2019s 945 (to file is to \u201cdeliver (a paper or instrument) to the proper officer\u201d) with 1 Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 920 (rev. ed. 1938) (to file is to \u201cpresent in the regular way, as to a judicial or legislative body\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Moreover, \u201c [t]he law uses familiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>legal expressions in their familiar legal sense,\u201d <em>Henry </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U.S. 393, 395, 40 S. Ct. 185, 64 L. Ed. 322 (1920). It is, I suppose, possible to speak of \u201cfiling a complaint\u201d with an employer, but that is assuredly not common usage. Thus, when the antiretaliation provision of the Mine Health and Safety Act used that phrase in a context that includes both complaints to an agency and complaints to the employer, it did not use \u201cfiled\u201d alone, but supplemented that with \u201cor made\u201d\u2014and to boot specified \u201cincluding a complaint notifying the [mine] operator ... of an alleged danger or safety or health violation _\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 815(c)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Third, the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d appears alongside three other protected activities: \u201cinstitut[ing] or causing] to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter,\u201d \u201ctestifying] in any such proceeding,\u201d and \u201csending] on an industry committee.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3). Since each of these three activities involves an interaction with governmental authority, we can fairly attribute this characteristic to the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d as well. \u201cThat</p>\n<p id=\"A_My\">[563 U.S. 21]</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well.\u201d <em>Beecham </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U.S. 368, 371, 114 S. Ct. 1669, 128 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">And finally, the 1938 version of the FLSA, while creating private rights of action for other employer violations, see \u00a7 16(b), 52 Stat. 1069, did not create a private right of action for retaliation. That was added in 1977, see \u00a7 10, 91 Stat. 1252. Until then, only the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor could enforce the retaliation provision. See \u00a7 11(a), 52 Stat. 1066. It would seem more strange to require the employee to go to the Administrator to establish, and punish retaliation for, his intracompany complaint, than to require the Administrator-protected complaint to be filed with the Administrator in the first place.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">The meaning of the phrase \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d is clear in light of its context, and there is accordingly no need to rely on abstractions of congressional purpose. Nevertheless, Kasten argues that protecting intra-company complaints best accords with the purpose of the FLSA\u2014 \u201cto assure fair compensation to covered employees\u201d\u2014because such purposes are \u201cadvanced when internal complaints lead to voluntary compliance.\u201d Reply Brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>for Petitioner 18. But no legislation pursues its ends at all costs. <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>480 U.S. 522, 525-526, 107 S. Ct. 1391, 94 L. Ed. 2d 533 (1987) <em>(per curiam). </em>Congress may not have protected intracompany complaints for the same reason it did not provide a private cause of action for retaliation against complaints: because it was unwilling</p>\n<p id=\"AGo-\">[563 U.S. 22]</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">to expose employers to the litigation, or to the inability to dismiss unsatisfactory workers, which that additional step would entail. Limitation of the retaliation provision to agency complaints may have been an attempt \u201cto achieve the benefits of regulation right up to the point where the costs of further benefits exceed the value of those benefits.\u201d Easterbrook, Statutes\u2019 Domains, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 533, 541 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In deciding whether an oral complaint may be \u201cfiled,\u201d the Court\u2019s opinion examines modern state and federal statutes, which presumably cover complaints filed with an employer. The only relevance of these provisions to whether the FLSA covers such complaints is that none of them achieves that result by use of the term \u201cfiled any complaint,\u201d and all of them use language that unmistakably includes complaints to employers. See, <em>e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (prohibiting retaliation against employees who \u201cop-pos[e] any [unlawful] practice\u201d). Any suggestion that because more recent statutes cover intracompany complaints, a provision adopted in the 1938 Act should be deemed to do so is unacceptable. While the jurisprudence of this Court has sometimes sanctioned a \u201cliving Constitution,\u201d it has never approved a living United States Code. What Congress enacted in 1938 must be applied according to its terms, and not according to what a modern Congress (or this Court) would deem desirable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Hasten argues that this Court should defer to the Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">[563 U.S. 23]</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">(EEOC) interpretations of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3). He claims that those agencies have construed \u00a7 215(a)(3) to protect intracom-pany complaints \u201c[f]or almost half a century,\u201d in litigating positions and enforcement actions. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22. He also argues that although the Department of Labor lacks the authority to issue regulations implementing \u00a7 215(a)(3), it has such authority for several similarly worded provisions and has interpreted those statutes to include intra-company complaints. <em>Id., </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Even were \u00a7 215(a)(3) ambiguous, deference would still be unwarranted. If we are to apply our new jurisprudence that deference is appropriate only when Congress has given the agency authority to make rules carrying the force of law, see <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 255-256, 126 S. Ct. 904, 163 L. Ed. 2d 748 (2006), deference is improper here. The EEOC has no such authority. Although the Secretary of Labor and his subordinates have authority to issue regulations under various provisions of the FLSA, see, <em>e.g., \u00a7203(l); </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u00a7 206(a)(2), they have no general authority to issue regulations interpreting the Act, and no specific authority to issue regulations interpreting \u00a7 215(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Presumably for this reason, the Court\u2019s opinion seems to suggest that only so-called <em>Skidmore </em>deference is appropriate, see <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">[563 U.S. 24]</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">This doctrine states that agencies\u2019 views are \u201c \u2018entitled to respect\u2019 \u201d to the extent they have \u201cthe \u2018power to persuade.\u2019 \u201d <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2000) (quoting <em>Skidmore, supra, </em>at 140, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the reasons stated above, the agencies\u2019 views here lack the \u201cpower to persuade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The Court\u2019s opinion claims that whether \u00a7 215(a)(3) covers intracom-pany complaints is not fairly included in the question presented because the argument, although raised below, was not made in Saint-Gobain\u2019s response to Kasten\u2019s petition for certiorari. Citing this Court\u2019s Rule 15.2 and <em>Caterpillar Inc. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>519 U.S. 61, 75, n. 13, 117 S. Ct. 467, 136 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1996), the opinion says that this Court does \u201cnot normally consider a separate legal question not raised in the certiorari briefs.\u201d Ante, at 17, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">It regularly does so, however, under the circumstances that obtain here. (Curiously enough, <em>Caterpillar, </em>the case cited by the Court, was one instance.) Rule 15.2 is permissive rather than mandatory: \u201cAny objection to consideration of a question presented based on what occurred in the proceedings below . . . <em>may </em>be deemed waived unless called to the Court\u2019s attention in the brief in opposition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the Court has often permitted parties to defend a judgment on grounds not raised in the brief in opposition when doing so is \u201cpredicate to an intelligent resolution of the question presented, and therefore fairly included</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">[563 U.S. 25]</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">therein.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 38, 117 S. Ct. 417, 136 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Terrazas, </em>444 U.S. 252, 258-259, n. 5, 100 S. Ct. 540, 62 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">Kasten\u2019s petition for certiorari <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>phrases the question presented as follows: \u201cIs an oral complaint of a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act protected conduct under the anti-retaliation provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3)?\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. Surely the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d in this question must be assigned an implied addressee. It presumably does not include a complaint to Judge Judy. And the only plausible addressee, given the facts of this case, is the employer. Saint-Gobain\u2019s rewording of the question presented in its brief in opposition is even more specific: \u201cHas an employee alleging solely that he orally asserted objections <em>to his employer . . </em>. \u2018filed any complaint\u2019 within the meaning of [ \u00a7 215(a)(3)].\u201d Brief in Opposition <em>i </em>(emphasis added). Moreover, under this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a), the question presented is \u201cdeemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein.\u201d Whether in-tracompany complaints are protected is at least subsidiary to Kasten\u2019s formulation (and explicitly included in Saint-Gobain\u2019s). The question was also decided by the courts below and was briefed before this Court. It is not clear what benefit additional briefing would provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Moreover, whether \u00a7 215(a)(3) covers intracompany complaints is \u201cpredicate to an intelligent resolution of the question presented\u201d in this case. The Court\u2019s own opinion demonstrates the point. While claiming that it remains an open question whether intracompany complaints are covered, the opinion adopts a test for \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d that assumes a \u201cyes\u201d answer\u2014and that makes no sense otherwise. An employee, the Court says, is deemed to have \u201cfiled [a] complaint\u201d only when \u201c \u2018a reasonable, objective person would have understood the employee\u2019 to have \u2018put the employer on notice that the employee is asserting statutory rights under the [Act].\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 14, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 390 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">[563 U.S. 26]</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">This utterly atextual standard is obviously designed to counter the argument of Saint-Gobain, that if oral complaints are allowed, \u201cemployers too often will be left in a state of uncertainty about whether an employee ... is in fact making a complaint ... or just letting off steam.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 13-14, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 390. Of course, if intracompany complaints were excluded, this concern would be nonexistent: Filing a complaint with a judicial or administrative body is quite obviously an unambiguous assertion of one\u2019s rights. There would be no need for lower courts to question whether a complaint is \u201csufficiently clear and detailed,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 14, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 390, carries the requisite \u201cdegree of formality,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>or provides \u201cfair notice,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>whatever those terms may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The test the Court adopts amply disproves its contention that \u201cwe can decide the oral/written question separately,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 17, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 392. And it makes little sense to consider that question <em>at all </em>in the present case if neither oral nor written complaints to employers are protected, cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. 90, 94, n. 1, 126 S. Ct. 1494, 164 L. Ed. 2d 195 (2006). This Court should not issue an advisory opinion as to what would have been the scope of a retaliation provision covering complaints to employers if Congress had enacted such a provision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-12\">. Kasten and this Court\u2019s opinion, <em>ante, </em>at 9-10, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 387, argue that the use of the modifier \u201cany\u201d in the phrase \u201cfiled <em>any </em>complaint\u201d suggests that Congress meant to define the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d expansively. Not so. The modifier \u201cany\u201d does not cause a word that is in context narrow to become broad. The phrase \u201cto cash a check at any bank\u201d does not refer to a river bank, or even a blood bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-13\">. Section 5 of the original FLSA, which has since been repealed, charged industry committees with recommending minimum wages for certain industries to the Department of Labor. 52 Stat. 1062. In order to perform this function, industry committees were empowered, among other things, to \u201chear . . . witnesses\u201d and \u201creceive . . . evidence.\u201d \u00a7 8(b), <em>id., </em>at 1064.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-14\">. Kasten argues that excluding intracompany complaints would make the phrases \u201cfiled any complaint\u201d and \u201cinstituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding\u201d redundant. That is not so. An employee may file a complaint with the Administrator that does not result in a proceeding, or has not yet done so when the employer takes its retaliatory action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b493-13\">. Moreover, if the substance of the retaliation provision of any other Act could shed light upon what Congress sought to achieve in the FLSA, it would be the relatively contemporaneous provision of the National Labor Relations Act, \u00a7 8(4), 49 Stat. 453, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(4), which did not cover retaliation for employee-employer complaints. See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Scrivener, </em>405 U.S. 117, 92 S. Ct. 798, 31 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b494-14\">. Or perhaps not. The actual quantum of deference measured out by the Court\u2019s opinion is unclear\u2014seemingly intentionally so. The Court says that it is giving \u201ca degree of weight\u201d to the Secretary and EEOC\u2019s views \u201cgiven Congress\u2019 delegation of enforcement powers to federal administrative agencies.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 14-15, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 390. But it never explicitly states the level of deference applied, and includes a mysterious citation of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2001), along with a parenthetical saying that \u201csometimes . . . judicial deference [is] intended even in [the] absence of rulemaking authority.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 16, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 391. I say this is mysterious because <em>Mead </em>clearly held that rulemaking authority was necessary for full <em>Chevron </em>deference, see <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). I have chosen to interpret the Court as referring to <em>Skidmore </em>deference, rather than <em>Chevron </em>deference or something in between, in order to minimize the Court\u2019s ongoing obfuscation of this once-clear area of administrative law. See <em>Mead, supra, </em>at 245, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b494-15\">. In my view this doctrine (if it can be called that) is incoherent, both linguistically and practically. To defer is to subordinate one\u2019s own judgment to another\u2019s. If one has been persuaded by another, so that one\u2019s judgment accords with the other\u2019s, there is no room for deferral\u2014only for agreement. Speaking of <em>\u201cSkidmore </em>deference\u201d to a persuasive agency position does nothing but confuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
