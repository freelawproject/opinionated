They had been so effective in preventing infectious diseases that the public became much less alarmed at the threat of those diseases,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and much more concerned with the risk of injury from the vaccines themselves.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">[562 U.S. 227]</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Much of the concern centered around vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), which were blamed for children\u2019s disabilities and developmental delays. This led to a massive increase in vaccine-related tort litigation. Whereas between 1978 and 1981 only nine products-liability suits were filed against DTP manufacturers, by the mid-1980\u2019s the suits numbered more than 200 each year.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This destabilized the DTP vaccine market, causing two of the three domestic manufacturers to withdraw; and the remaining manufacturer, Lederle Laboratories, estimated that its potential tort liability exceeded its annual sales by a factor of 200.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Vaccine shortages arose when Lederle had production problems in 1984.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Despite the large number of suits, there were many complaints that obtaining compensation for legitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries was too costly and difficult.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A significant number of parents were already declining vaccination for their children,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and concerns about compensation threatened to depress vaccination rates even further.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This was a source of concern to public health officials, since vaccines are effective in preventing outbreaks of disease only if a large percentage of the population is vaccinated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>[562 U.S. 228]</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">To stabilize the vaccine market and facilitate compensation, Congress enacted the NCVIAin 1986.  The Act establishes a no-fault compensation program \u201cdesigned to work faster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.\u201d <em>Shalala </em>v. <em>Whitecotton, </em>514 U.S. 268, 269, 115 S. Ct. 1477, 131 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1995). A person injured by a vaccine, or his legal guardian, may file a petition for compensation in the United States Court of Federal Claims, naming the Secretary of Health and Human Services as the respondent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A special master then makes an informal adjudication of the petition within (except for two limited exceptions) 240 days.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court of Federal Claims must review objections to the special master\u2019s decision and enter final judgment under a similarly tight statutory deadline.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At that point, a claimant has two options: to accept the court\u2019s judgment and forgo a traditional tort suit for damages, or to reject the judgment and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Fast, informal adjudication is made possible by the Act\u2019s Vaccine Injury Table, which lists the vaccines covered under the Act; describes each vaccine\u2019s compensable, adverse side effects; and indicates how soon after vaccination those side effects should first manifest themselves.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Claimants who show that a listed injury first manifested itself at the appropriate time are prima facie entitled to compensation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> No showing of causation is necessary; the Secretary bears the burden of disproving causation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A claimant may also recover for unlisted side effects, and for listed side effects that occur at times other than those specified in the Table, but</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">[562 U.S. 229]</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">for those the claimant must prove causation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Unlike in tort suits, claimants under the Act are not required to show that the administered vaccine was defectively manufactured, labeled, or designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Successful claimants receive compensation for medical, rehabilitation, counseling, special education, and vocational training expenses; diminished earning capacity; pain and suffering; and $250,000 for vaccine-related deaths.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Attorney\u2019s fees are provided, not only for successful cases, but even for unsuccessful claims that are not frivolous.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These awards are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The <em>quid pro quo </em>for this, designed to stabilize the vaccine market, was the provision of significant tort-liability protections for vaccine manufacturers.  The Act requires claimants to seek relief through the compensation program before filing suit for more than $1,000.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Manufacturers are generally immunized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>from liability for failure to warn if they have complied with all regulatory requirements (including but not limited to warning requirements) and have given the warning either to the claimant or the claimant\u2019s physician.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> They are immunized from liability for punitive damages absent failure to comply with regulatory requirements, \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201cintentional and wrongful withholding of information,\u201d or other \u201ccriminal or illegal activity.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And most relevant to</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">[562 U.S. 230]</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">the present case, the Act expressly eliminates liability for a vaccine\u2019s unavoidable, adverse side effects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201cNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The vaccine at issue here is a DTP vaccine manufactured by Lederle Laboratories. It first received federal approval in 1948 and received supplemental approvals in 1953 and 1970. Respondent Wyeth purchased Lederle in 1994 and stopped manufacturing the vaccine in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Hannah Bruesewitz was born on October 20, 1991. Her pediatrician administered doses of the DTP vaccine according to the Center for Disease Control\u2019s recommended childhood immunization schedule. Within 24 hours of her April 1992 vaccination, Hannah started to experience seizures.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> She suffered over 100 seizures during the next month, and her doctors eventually diagnosed her with \u201cresidual seizure disorder\u201d and \u201cdevelopmental delay.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Hannah, now a teenager, is still diagnosed with both conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">In April 1995, Hannah\u2019s parents, Russell and Robalee Bruesewitz, filed a vaccine injury petition in the United States Court of Federal Claims, alleging that Hannah suffered from on-Table residual seizure disorder and encephalopathy injuries.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> A Special Master denied their claims on various rounds, though they were awarded 126,800 in attorney\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">[562 U.S. 231]</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">fees and costs. The Bruesewitzes elected to reject the unfavorable judgment, and in October 2005 filed this lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court. Their complaint alleged (as relevant here) that defective design of Lederle\u2019s DTP vaccine caused Hannah\u2019s disabilities, and that Lederle was subject to strict liability, and liability for negligent design under Pennsylvania common law.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">Wyeth removed the suit to the United States District Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which granted Wyeth summary judgment on the strict-liability and negligence design-defect claims, holding that the Pennsylvania law providing those causes of action was pre-empted by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We granted certiorari. 559 U.S. 991, 130 S. Ct. 1734, 176 L. Ed. 2d 211 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We set forth again the statutory text at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u201cNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The \u201ceven though\u201d clause clarifies the word that precedes it. It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine manufacturer <em>must </em>have taken for a side effect to be considered \u201cunavoidable\u201d under the statute. Provided that there</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">[562 U.S. 232]</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">was proper manufacture and warning, any remaining side effects, including those resulting from design defects, are deemed to have been unavoidable. State-law design-defect claims are therefore preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a different design, the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d would do no work. A side effect of a vaccine could <em>always </em>have been avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element. The language of the provision thus suggests that the <em>design </em>of the vaccine is a given, not subject to question in the tort action. What the statute establishes as a complete defense must be unavoidability (given safe manufacture and warning) <em>with respect to the particular design. </em>Which plainly implies that the design itself is not open to question.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">A further textual indication leads to the same conclusion. Products-liability law establishes a classic and well known triumvirate of grounds for liability: defective manufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and defective design.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> If all three were intended to be preserved, it would be strange to mention specifically only two, and leave the third to implica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>tion. It would have been much easier (and much more natural) to provide that manufacturers would be liable</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">[562 U.S. 233]</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">for \u201cdefective manufacture, defective directions or warning, and defective design.\u201d It seems that the statute fails to mention design-defect liability \u201cby deliberate choice, not inadvertence.\u201d <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Peabody Coal Co., </em>537 U.S. 149, 168, 123 S. Ct. 748, 154 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2003). <em>Expressio unius, exclusio alterius.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The dissent\u2019s principal textual argument is mistaken. We agree with its premise that \u201c \u2018side effects that were unavoidable\u2019 must refer to side effects caused by a vaccine\u2019s <em>design.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We do not comprehend, however, the second step of its reasoning, which is that the use of the conditional term \u201cif\u2019 in the introductory phrase \u201cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\u201d \u201cplainly implies that some side effects stemming from a vaccine\u2019s design are \u2018unavoidable,\u2019 while others are avoidable.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> That is not so. The \u201cif\u2019 clause makes total sense whether the design to which \u201cunavoidable\u201d refers is (as the dissent believes) any feasible design (making the side effects of the design used for the vaccine at issue avoidable), or (as we believe) the particular design used for the vaccine at issue (making its side effects unavoidable). Under the latter view, the condition established by the \u201cif\u2019 clause is that the vaccine have been properly labeled and manufactured; and under the former, that it have been properly <em>designed, </em>labeled, and manufactured. Neither view renders the \u201cif\u2019 clause a nullity. Which of the two variants must be preferred is addressed by our textual analysis, and is in no way determined by the \u201cif\u2019 clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Petitioners\u2019 and the dissent\u2019s textual argument also rests upon the proposition that the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d in \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l) is a term of art that incorporates comment <em>k </em>to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1963-1964).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Restatement</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">[562 U.S. 234]</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">generally holds a manufacturer strictly liable for harm to person or property caused by \u201cany product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Comment <em>k </em>exempts from this strict-liability rule \u201cunavoidably unsafe products.\u201d An unavoidably unsafe product is defined by a hodge-podge of criteria and a few examples, such as the Pasteur rabies vaccine and experimental pharmaceuticals. Despite this lack of clarity, petitioners seize upon one phrase in the comment <em>k </em>analysis, and assert that by 1986 a majority of courts had made this a <em>sine qua non </em>requirement for an \u201cunavoidably unsafe product\u201d: a case-specific showing that the product was \u201cquite incapable of being made safe for [its] intended .. . use.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">We have no need to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>finer points of comment <em>k. </em>Whatever consistent judicial gloss that comment may have been given in 1986, there is no reason to believe that \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l) was invoking it. The comment creates a special category of \u201cunavoidably unsafe products,\u201d while the statute refers to \u201cside effects that were unavoidable.\u201d That the latter uses the adjective \u201cunavoidable\u201d and the former the adverb \u201cunavoidably\u201d does not establish that Congress</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">[562 U.S. 235]</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">had comment <em>k </em>in mind. \u201cUnavoidable\u201d is hardly a rarely used word. Even the cases petitioners cite as putting a definitive gloss on comment <em>k </em>use the precise phrase \u201cunavoidably unsafe product\u201d; <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> none attaches special significance to the term \u201cunavoidable\u201d standing alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The textual problems with petitioners\u2019 interpretation do not end there. The phrase \u201ceven though\u201d in the clause \u201ceven though the vaccine was properly prepared and [labeled]\u201d is meant to signal the unexpected: unavoidable side effects persist <em>despite </em>best manufacturing and labeling practices.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> But petitioners\u2019 reading eliminates any opposition between the \u201ceven though\u201d clause\u2014called a concessive subordinate clause by grammarians\u2014and the word \u201cunavoidable.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Their reading makes pre-emption turn equally on unavoid-ability, proper preparation, and proper labeling. Thus, the dissent twice refers to the requirements of proper preparation and proper labeling as \u201ctwo additional prerequisites\u201d for pre-emption independent of un-avoidability.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The primary textual justification for the dissent\u2019s position depends</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">[562 U.S. 236]</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">on that independence.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But linking independent ideas is the job of a coordinating junction like \u201cand,\u201d not a subordinating junction like \u201ceven though.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Petitioners and the dissent contend that the interpretation we propose would render part of \u00a7 300aa-22(b)( 1) superfluous: Congress could have more tersely and more clearly preempted design-defect claims by barring liability \u201cif . . . the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\u201d The intervening passage (\u201cthe injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though\u201d) is unnecessary. True enough. But  the rule against giving a portion of text an interpretation which renders it superfluous does not prescribe that a passage which could have been more terse does not mean what it says. The rule applies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offending passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing interpretation. That is not the case here.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> To be sure, petitioners\u2019 and the dissent\u2019s interpretation gives independent meaning to the intervening passage (the supposed meaning of comment <em>k); </em>but it does so only at the expense of rendering the remainder of the provision superfluous. Since a vaccine is not \u201cquite incapable of being made safer for [its] intended use\u201d if manufacturing defects could have been eliminated or better warnings provided,</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">[562 U.S. 237]</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">the entire \u201ceven though\u201d clause is a useless appendage.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It would suffice to say \u201cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\u201d\u2014full stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general reinforces what the text of \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(1) suggests. A vaccine\u2019s license spells out the manufacturing method that must be followed and the directions and warnings that must accompany the product.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Manufacturers ordinarily must obtain the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) approval before modifying either.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Deviations from the license thus provide objective evidence of manufacturing defects or inadequate warnings. Further objective evidence comes from the FDA\u2019s regulations\u2014more than 90 of them<footnotemark>52</footnotemark>\u2014that pervasively regulate the manufacturing process, down to the requirements for plumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing facility.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Material noncompliance with any one of them, or with any other FDA regulation, could cost the manufacturer its regulatory-compliance defense.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Design defects, in contrast, do not merit a single mention in the NCVIA or the FDA\u2019s regulations. Indeed, the FDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>effective for its intended use.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> And the decision is surely not an easy one. Drug manufacturers often could trade a little less efficacy</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">[562 U.S. 238]</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">for a little more safety, but the safest design is not always the best one. Striking the right balance between safety and efficacy is especially difficult with respect to vaccines, which affect public as well as individual health. Yet the Act, which in every other respect micromanages manufacturers, is silent on how to evaluate competing designs. Are manufacturers liable only for failing to employ an alternative design that the FDA has approved for distribution (an approval it takes years to obtain<footnotemark>56</footnotemark>)? Or does it suffice that a vaccine design has been approved in other countries? Or could there be liability for failure to use a design that exists only in a lab? Neither the Act nor the FDA regulations provide an answer, leaving the universe of alternative designs to be limited only by an expert\u2019s imagination.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Jurors, of course, often decide similar questions with little guidance, and we do not suggest that the absence of guidance alone suggests pre-emption. But the lack of guidance for design defects combined with the extensive guidance for the two grounds of liability specifically mentioned in the Act strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The mandates contained in the Act lead to the same conclusion. Design-defect torts, broadly speaking, have two beneficial effects: (1) prompting the development of improved designs, and (2) providing compensation for inflicted injuries. The NCVIA provides other means for achieving both effects. We have already discussed the Act\u2019s generous compensation scheme.  And the Act provides many means of improving vaccine design. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote \u201cthe development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> It establishes a National Vaccine Program, whose Director is \u201cto achieve optimal prevention of human infectious diseases . . . and to achieve optimal prevention against</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">[562 U.S. 239]</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">adverse reactions.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The Program is to set priorities for federal vaccine research, and to coordinate federal vaccine safety and efficacy testing.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The Act requires vaccine manufacturers and healthcare providers to report adverse side effects,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and provides for monitoring of vaccine safety through a collaboration with eight managed-care organizations.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> And of course whenever the FDA concludes that a vaccine is unsafe, it may revoke the license.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">These provisions for federal agency improvement of vaccine design, and for federally prescribed compensation, once again suggest that \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l)\u2019s silence regarding design-defect liability was not inadvertent. It instead reflects a sensible choice to leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine design to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>FDA and the National Vaccine Program rather than juries.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">And finally, the Act\u2019s structural <em>quid pro quo </em>leads to the same conclusion: The vaccine manufacturers fund from their sales an informal, efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries;<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> in exchange they avoid costly tort litigation and</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">[562 U.S. 240]</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">the occasional disproportionate jury verdict.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> But design-defect allegations are the most speculative and difficult type of products-liability claim to litigate. Taxing vaccine manufacturers\u2019 product to fund the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design defect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax manufacturers back into the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The dissent believes the Act\u2019s mandates are irrelevant because they do not spur innovation in precisely the same way as state-law tort systems.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> That is a novel suggestion. Although we previously have expressed doubt that Congress would quietly pre-empt products-liability claims without providing a federal substitute, see <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 486-488, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1996) (plurality opinion), we have never suggested we would be skeptical of pre-emption unless the congressional substitute operated like the tort system. We decline to adopt that stance today. The dissent\u2019s belief that the FDA and the National Vaccine Program cannot alone spur adequate vaccine innovation is probably questionable, but surely beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Since our interpretation of \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l) is the only interpretation supported by the text and structure of the NCVIA, even those of us who believe legislative history is a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation have no need to resort to it. In any case, the dissent\u2019s contention that it would contradict our conclusion is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">The dissent\u2019s legislative history relies on the following syllogism: A1986 House Committee Report states that \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l) \u201csets forth the principle contained in Comment k of Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts (Second);\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> in 1986 comment <em>k </em>was \u201ccommonly understood\u201d to require a</p>\n<p id=\"AlP\">[562 U.S. 241]</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">case-specific showing that \u201cno feasible alternative design\u201d existed; Congress therefore must have intended \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l) to require that showing.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The syllogism ignores unhelpful statements in the 1986 Report and relies upon a term of art that did not exist in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Immediately after the language quoted by the dissent, the 1986 Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>port notes the difficulty a jury would have in faithfully assessing whether a feasible alternative design exists when an innocent \u201cyoung child, often badly injured or killed,\u201d is the plaintiff.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Eliminating that concern is why the 1986 Report\u2019s authors \u201cstrongly believ[e] that Comment k is appropriate and necessary as the policy for civil actions seeking damages in tort.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The dissent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l) and its version of \u201cthe principle in Comment K\u201d adopted by the 1986 Report leave that concern unaddressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The dissent buries another unfavorable piece of legislative history. Because the 1986 Report believes that \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l) should incorporate \u201cthe principle in Comment K\u201d and because the Act provides a generous no-fault compensation scheme, the 1986 Report counsels injured parties who cannot prove a manufacturing or labeling defect to \u201cpursue recompense in the compensation system, not the tort system.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> That counsel echoes our interpretation of \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Not to worry, the dissent retorts, a Committee Report by a later Congress \u201cauthoritative [ly]\u201d vindicates its interpretation.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">[562 U.S. 242]</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Post-enactment legislative history (a contradiction in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 238, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1999); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 281-282, 67 S. Ct. 677, 91 L. Ed. 884 (1947). Real (pre-enactment) legislative history is persuasive to some because it is thought to shed light on what legislators understood an ambiguous statutory text to mean when they voted to enact it into law. See <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. </em>v. <em>Allapattah Services, Inc., </em>545 U.S. 546, 568, 125 S. Ct. 2611, 162 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2005). But post-enactment legislative history by definition \u201ccould have had no effect on the congressional vote,\u201d <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 605, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">It does not matter that \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(1) did not take effect until the later Congress passed the excise tax that funds the compensation scheme,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> and that the supposedly dispositive Committee Report is attached to that funding legislation.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Those who voted on the relevant statutory language were not necessarily the same persons who crafted the statements in the later Committee Report; or if they were did not necessarily have the same views at that earlier time; and no one voting at that earlier time could possibly have been informed by those later statements. Permitting the legislative history of subsequent funding legislation to alter the meaning of a statute would set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>a dangerous precedent. Many provisions of federal law depend on appropriations or include sunset provisions;<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> they cannot be made the device for unenacted statutory revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">[562 U.S. 243]</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">That brings us to the second flaw in the dissent\u2019s syllogism: Comment <em>k </em>did not have a \u201ccommonly understood meaning\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> in the mid-1980\u2019s. Some courts thought it required a case-specific showing that a product was \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d; many others thought it categorically exempted certain types of products from strict liability. <footnotemark>77</footnotemark> When \u201call (or nearly all) of the\u201d relevant judicial decisions have given a term or concept a consistent judicial gloss, we presume Congress intended the term or concept to have that meaning when it incorporated it into a later-enacted statute. <em>Merck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>559 U.S. 633, 659, 130 S. Ct. 1784, 176 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2010) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The consistent gloss represents the public understanding of the term. We cannot make the same assumption when widespread disagreement exists among the lower courts. We must make do with giving the term its most plausible meaning using the traditional tools of statutory interpretation. That is what we have done today.</p>\n<p id=\"pAVE\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"31\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQ0AAAAfAQAAAADVAKWBAAAAjElEQVR4nN3TsQ3CMBRF0etHASUFA2SQDMAeLMAIsFtK2CFFBkhrIdmU/hJPcgoacHeuvr7swqnSOVm9CfjLkRJtIHjFavCtu9T70uggyhQvaCA0z2GpgUjXR6sOgssalhukSt6H+okseN5CNRCcD6EaiHocW3QQZRhadRC78dSqw7YX9c6GkfRbv/ENaW062To8JhwAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"269\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that  the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act pre-empts all design-defect claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plaintiffs who seek compensation for injury or death caused by vaccine side effects.

See <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>United States, </em>469 U.S. 70, 76, 105 S. Ct. 479, 83 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1984) (\u201c[T]he authoritative source for finding the Legislature\u2019s intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill\u201d). That Report says that \u201cif\u2019 vaccine-injured persons</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-18\">\u201ccannot demonstrate under appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>cable law either that a vaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by improper directions or inadequate warnings [they] should pursue recompense in the compensation system, not the tort system.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 99-908, pt. 1, p. 26 (1986) (hereinafter H. R. Rep. or Report).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The Report lists two specific kinds of tort suits that the clause does not pre-empt (suits based on improper manufacturing and improper labeling), while going on to state that compensation for other tort claims, <em>e.g., </em>design-defect claims, lies in \u201cthe [NCVIA\u2019s no-fault] compensation system, not the tort system.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The strongest contrary argument rests upon the Report\u2019s earlier description of the statute as \u201cset[ting] forth the principle contained in Comment k\u201d (of the Restatement Second of Torts\u2019 <em>strict liability </em>section, 402A) that \u201ca vaccine manufacturer should not be liable for injuries or deaths resulting from <em>unavoidable </em>side effects.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 25 (emphasis added). But the appearance of the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d in this last-mentioned sentence cannot provide petitioners with much help. That is because nothing in the Report suggests that</p>\n<p id=\"A3s\">[562 U.S. 245]</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">the statute means the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d to summon up an otherwise unmentioned third exception encompassing suits based on design defects. Nor can the Report\u2019s reference to comment <em>k </em>fill the gap. The Report itself refers, not to comment <em>k\u2019s </em>details, but only to its \u201cprinciplenamely, that vaccine manufacturers should <em>not </em>be held liable for unavoidable injuries. It says nothing at all about who\u2014judge, jury, or federal safety agency\u2014should decide whether a safer vaccine could have been designed. Indeed, at the time Congress wrote this Report, different state courts had come to very different conclusions about that matter. See Cupp, Rethinking Conscious Design Liability for Prescription Drugs: The <em>Restatement (Third) </em>Standard Versus a Negligence Approach, 63 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 76, 79 (1994-1995) (\u201c[C]ourts [had] adopted a broad range of conflicting interpretations\u201d of comment <em>k). </em>Neither the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d nor the phrase \u201cthe principle of Comment k\u201d tells us which courts\u2019 view Congress intended to adopt. Silence cannot tell us to follow those States where juries decided the design-defect question.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The legislative history describes the statute more generally as trying to protect the lives of children, in part by ending \u201cthe instability and unpredictability of the childhood vaccine market.\u201d H.

R. Rep., at 7; Childhood Immunizations 85-86. Indeed, two whooping cough vaccine manufacturers withdrew from the market, and other vaccine manufacturers, \u201cfac[ing] great difficulty in obtaining [products liability] insurance,\u201d told Congress that they were considering \u201ca similar course of action.\u201d H. R. Rep., at 6; Childhood Immunizations 68-70. The Committee Report explains that, since there were only one or two manufacturers of many childhood vaccines, \u201c[t]he loss of any of the existing manufacturers of childhood vaccines . . . could create a genuine public health hazard\u201d; it \u201cwould present the very real possibility of vaccine shortages, and, in turn, increasing numbers of unim-munized children, and, perhaps, a resurgence of preventable diseases.\u201d H. R. Rep., at 5. At the same time, Congress sought to provide generous compensation to those whom vaccines injured\u2014as determined by an expert compensation program. <em>Id., </em>at 5, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Given these broad general purposes, to read the pre-emption clause as preserving design-defect suits seems anomalous. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) decides when a vaccine is safe enough to be licensed and which licensed vaccines, with which associated injuries, should be placed on the Vaccine Injury Table. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-14; <em>ante, </em>at 228, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 8; A Comprehensive Review of Federal Vaccine Safety Programs and Public Health Activities 13-15, 32-34 (Dec. 2008), http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>nvac/documents/vaccine-safety-review. pdf. A special master in the Act\u2019s compensation program determines whether someone has suffered an injury listed on the Injury Table and, if not, whether the vaccine nonetheless caused the injury. <em>Ante, </em>at 228, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 8; \u00a7 300aa-13. To allow a jury in effect to second-guess those determinations is to substitute less expert for more expert judgment, thereby threatening manufacturers with liability (indeed, strict liability) in instances where any conflict between experts and nonexperts is likely</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">[562 U.S. 248]</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">to be particularly severe\u2014instances where Congress intended the contrary. That is because potential tort plaintiffs are unlikely to bring suit unless the specialized compensation program has determined that they are not entitled to compensation (say, because it concludes that the vaccine did not cause the injury). Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>28 (\u201c99.8% of successful Compensation Program claimants have accepted their awards, foregoing any tort remedies against vaccine manufacturers\u201d). It is difficult to reconcile these potential conflicts and the resulting tort liabilities with a statute that seeks to diminish manufacturers\u2019 products liability while simultaneously augmenting the role of experts in making compensation decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The United States, reflecting the views of HHS, urges the Court to read the Act as I and the majority would do. It notes that the compensation program\u2019s listed vaccines have survived rigorous administrative safety review. It says that to read the Act as permitting design-defect lawsuits could lead to a recurrence of \u201cexactly the crisis that precipitated the Act,\u201d namely, withdrawals of vaccines or vaccine manufacturers from the market, \u201cdisserv[ing] the Act\u2019s central purposes,\u201d and hampering the ability of the agency\u2019s \u201cexpert regulators, in conjunction with the medical community, [to] control the availability and withdrawal of a given vaccine.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>30, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The United States is supported in this claim by leading public health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Preventive Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the American Medical Association, the March of Dimes Foundation, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and 15 other similar organizations. Brief for American Academy of Pediatrics et al. as <em>Amici</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8\">[562 U.S. 249]</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\"><em>Curiae </em>(hereinafter AAP Brief). The American Academy of Pediatrics has also supported the retention of vaccine manufacturer tort liability (provided that federal law structured state-law liability conditions in ways that would take proper account of federal agency views about safety). Hearings 14-15. But it nonetheless tells us here, in respect to the specific question before us, that the petitioners\u2019 interpretation of the Act would undermine its basic purposes by threatening to \u201chalt the future production and development of childhood vaccines in this country,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>by \u201cthreaten [ing] a resurgence of the very problems which . . . caused Congress to intervene\u201d by enacting this statute. AAP Brief 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">I would give significant weight to the views of HHS. The law charges HHS with responsibility for overseeing vaccine production and safety. It is \u201clikely to have a thorough under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>standing\u201d of the complicated and technical subject matter of immunization policy, and it is comparatively more \u201cqualified to comprehend the likely impact of state requirements.\u201d <em>Geier </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>529 U.S. 861, 883, 120 S.

HHS position is particularly persuasive here because expert public health organizations support its views and the matter concerns a medical and scientific question of great importance: how best to save the lives of children. See <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In sum, congressional reports and history, the statute\u2019s basic purpose as revealed by that history, and the views of the expert agency along with those of relevant medical and scientific associations, all support the Court\u2019s conclusions. I consequently agree with the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">[562 U.S. 250]</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b119-6\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ\">with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Vaccine manufacturers have long been subject to a legal duty, rooted in basic principles of products liability law, to improve the designs of their vaccines in light of advances in science and technology. Until today, that duty was enforceable through a traditional state-law tort action for defective design. In holding that \u00a7 22(b)(1) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Vaccine Act or Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l), pre-empts all design defect claims for injuries stemming from vaccines covered under the Act, the Court imposes its own bare policy preference over the considered judgment of Congress. In doing so, the Court excises 13 words from the statutory text, misconstrues the Act\u2019s legislative history, and disturbs the careful balance Congress struck between compensating vaccine-injured children and stabilizing the childhood vaccine market. Its decision leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately take account of scientific and technological advancements when designing or distributing their products. Because nothing in the text, structure, or legislative history of the Vaccine Act remotely suggests that Congress intended such a result, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Section 22 of the Vaccine Act provides \u201c [standards of responsibility\u201d to govern civil actions against vaccine manufacturers. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22. Section 22(a) sets forth the \u201c[gleneral rule\u201d that \u201cState law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death.\u201d \u00a7 300aa-22(a). This baseline rule that state law applies is subject to three narrow exceptions, one of which, \u00a7 22(b)(1), is at issue in this case. Section 22(b)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">[562 U.S. 251]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-13\">\u201cNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\u201d \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The provision contains two key clauses: \u201cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\u201d (the \u201cif\u2019 clause), and \u201ceven though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings\u201d (the \u201ceven though\u201d clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Blackletter products liability law generally recognizes three different types of product defects: design defects, manufacturing defects, and labeling defects <em>(e.g., </em>failure to warn).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reference in the \u201ceven though\u201d clause to a \u201cproperly prepared\u201d vaccine \u201caccompanied by proper directions and warnings\u201d is an obvious reference to two such defects\u2014manufacturing and labeling defects. The plain terms of the \u201ceven though\u201d clause thus indicate that \u00a7 22(b)(1) applies only where neither kind of defect is present. Because \u00a7 22(b)(1) is invoked by vaccine manufacturers as a defense to tort liability, it follows that the \u201ceven though\u201d clause requires a vaccine manufacturer in each civil action to demonstrate that its vaccine is free from manufacturing and labeling defects to fall within the liability exemption of \u00a7 22(b)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Given that the \u201ceven though\u201d clause requires the absence of manufacturing and labeling defects, the \u201cif\u2019 clause\u2019s reference to \u201cside effects that were unavoidable\u201d must refer to</p>\n<p id=\"A-r\">[562 U.S. 252]</p>\n<p id=\"Ayu\">side effects caused by something other than manufacturing and labeling defects. The only remaining kind of product defect recognized under traditional products liability law is a design defect. Thus, \u201cside effects that were unavoidable\u201d must refer to side effects caused by a vaccine\u2019s <em>design </em>that were \u201cunavoidable.\u201d Because \u00a7 22(b)(1) uses the conditional term \u201cif,\u201d moreover, the text plainly implies that some side effects stemming from a vaccine\u2019s design are \u201cunavoidable,\u201d while others are avoidable. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1124 (2002) (\u201cif\u2019 means \u201cin the event that,\u201d \u201cso long as,\u201d or \u201con condition that\u201d). Accordingly, because the \u201cif\u2019 clause (like the \u201ceven though\u201d clause) sets forth a condition to invoke \u00a722(b)(l)\u2019s defense to tort liability, Congress must also have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate in each civil action that the particular side effects of a vaccine\u2019s design were \u201cunavoidable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Congress\u2019 use of conditional \u201cif\u2019 clauses in two other provisions of the Vaccine Act supports the conclusion that \u00a7 22(b)(1) requires an inquiry in each case in which a manufacturer seeks to invoke the provision\u2019s exception to state tort liability. In \u00a7 22(b)(2), Congress created a presumption that, for purposes of \u00a7 22(b)(1), \u201ca vaccine shall be presumed to be accompanied by proper directions and warnings if the vaccine manufacturer shows that it complied in all material respects with\u201d federal labeling requirements. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(2). Similarly, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u00a7 23(d)(2), Congress created an exemption from punitive damages \u201c[i]f . . . the manufacturer shows that it complied, in all material respects,\u201d with applicable federal laws, unless it engages in \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201cintentional and wrongful withholding of information\u201d from federal regulators, or \u201cother criminal or illegal activity.\u201d \u00a7 300aa-23(d)(2). It would be highly anomalous for Congress to use a conditional \u201cif\u2019 clause in \u00a7\u00a7 22(b)(2) and 23(d)(2) to require a specific inquiry in each case while using the same</p>\n<p id=\"AFk\">[562 U.S. 253]</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">conditional \u201cif\u2019 clause in \u00a7 22(b)(1) to denote a categorical exemption from liability. Cf. <em>Erlenbaugh </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 U.S. 239, 243, 93 S. Ct. 477, 34 L.

That intent, in turn, is manifested in the plain text of \u00a7 22(b)(1)\u2014in particular, Congress\u2019 use of the word \u201cunavoidable,\u201d as well as the phrases \u201cproperly prepared\u201d and \u201caccompanied by proper directions and warnings,\u201d which were taken nearly verbatim from comment <em>k. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(l); see Restatement 353-354 (\u201cSuch a[n unavoidably unsafe] product, properly prepared, and accompanied</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">[562 U.S. 256]</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">by proper directions and warning, is not defective\u201d). By the time of the Vaccine Act\u2019s enactment in 1986, numerous state and federal courts had interpreted comment <em>k </em>to mean that a product is \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d when, given proper manufacture and labeling, no feasible alternative design would reduce the safety risks without compromising the prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>uct\u2019s cost and utility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given Congress\u2019 expressed intent</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">[562 U.S. 257]</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">to codify the \u201cprinciple in Comment K,\u201d 1986 Report 26, the term \u201cunavoidable\u201d in \u00a7 22(b)(1) is best understood as a term of art, which incorporates the commonly understood meaning of \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d products under comment <em>k </em>at the time of the Act\u2019s enactment in 1986.

Finally, the 1986 Report confirms that the \u201ceven though\u201d clause is properly read to establish two additional prerequisites\u2014proper manufacturing and proper labeling\u2014to qualify for \u00a7 22(b)( l)\u2019s liability exemption.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">[562 U.S. 259]</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">In addition to the 1986 Report, one other piece of the Act\u2019s legislative history provides further confirmation of the petitioners\u2019 textual reading of \u00a7 22(b)(1). When Congress enacted the Vaccine Act in 1986, it did not initially include a source of payment for the no-fault compensation program the Act established. The Act thus \u201cmade the compensation program and accompanying tort reforms contingent on the enactment of a tax to provide funding for the compensation.\u201d 1987 Report 690. In 1987, Congress passed legislation to fund the compensation program. The House Energy and Commerce Committee Report<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> accompanying that legislation specifically stated that \u201cthe codi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>fication of Comment (k) of The Restatement (Second) of Torts was not intended to decide as a matter of law the circumstances in which a vaccine should be deemed unavoidably unsafe.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 691. The Committee noted that \u201c[a]n amendment to establish . . . that a manufacturer\u2019s failure to develop [a] safer vaccine was not grounds for liability was rejected by the Committee during</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">[562 U.S. 260]</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">its original consideration of the Act.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In light of that rejection, the Committee emphasized that \u201cthere should be no misunderstanding that the Act undertook to decide as a matter of law whether vaccines were unavoidably unsafe or not,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his question is left to the courts to determine in accordance with applicable law.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">To be sure, postenactment legislative history created by a subsequent Congress is ordinarily a hazardous basis from which to infer the intent of the enacting Congress. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Finkelstein, </em>496 U.S. 617, 631-632, 110 S. Ct. 2658, 110 L. Ed. 2d 563 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part). But unlike ordinary postenactment legislative history, which is justifiably given little or no weight, the 1987 Report reflects the intent of the Congress that enacted the funding legislation necessary to give operative effect to the principal provisions of the Vaccine Act, including \u00a7 22(b)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Congress in 1987 had a number of options before it, including adopting an entirely different compensation scheme, as the Reagan administration was proposing;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> establishing different limitations on tort liability, including eliminating design defect liability, as pharmaceutical industry leaders were advocating;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or not funding the</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">[562 U.S. 261]</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">compensation program at all, which would have effectively nullified the relevant portions of the Act. Because the tort reforms in the 1986 Act, including \u00a7 22(b)(1), had no operative legal effect unless and until Congress provided funding for the compensation program, the views of the Congress that enacted that funding legislation are a proper and, indeed, authoritative guide to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>meaning of \u00a7 22(b)(1). Those views, as reflected in the 1987 Report, provide unequivocal confirmation of petitioners\u2019 reading of \u00a7 22(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In sum, the text, structure, and legislative history of the Vaccine Act are fully consistent with petitioners\u2019 reading of \u00a7 22(b)(1). Accordingly, I believe \u00a7 22(b)(1) exempts vaccine manufacturers from tort liability only upon a showing by the manufacturer in each case that the vaccine was properly manufactured and labeled, and that the side effects stemming from the vaccine\u2019s design could not have been prevented by a feasible alternative design that would have eliminated the adverse side effects without compromising the vaccine\u2019s cost and utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In contrast to the interpretation of \u00a7 22(b)(1) set forth above, the majority\u2019s interpretation does considerable violence to the statutory text, misconstrues the legislative history, and draws the wrong conclusions from the structure of the Vaccine Act and the broader federal scheme regulating vaccines.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">[562 U.S. 262]</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">As a textual matter, the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 22(b)(1) is fundamentally flawed in three central respects. First, the majority\u2019s categorical reading rests on a faulty and untenable premise. Second, its reading functionally excises 13 words from the statutory text, including the key term \u201cunavoidable.\u201d And third, the majority entirely ignores the Vaccine Act\u2019s default rule preserving state tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">To begin, the majority states that \u201c[a] side effect of a vaccine could <em>always </em>have been avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element.\u201d Ante, at 232, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 10. From that premise, the majority concludes that the statute must mean that \u201cthe <em>design </em>of the vaccine is a given, not subject to question in the tort action,\u201d because construing the statute otherwise would render \u00a7 22(b)(1) a nullity. <em>Ibid. </em>A tort claimant, according to the majority, will always be able to point to a differently designed vaccine not containing the \u201charmful element,\u201d and if that were sufficient to show that a vaccine\u2019s side effects were not \u201cunavoidable,\u201d the statute would preempt nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The starting premise of the majority\u2019s interpretation, however, is fatally flawed. Although in the most literal sense, as the majority notes, a side effect can always be avoided \u201cby use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>this interpretation of \u201cunavoidable\u201d would effectively read the term out of the statute, and Congress could not have intended that result. Indeed, \u00a7 22(b)(1) specifically uses the conditional phrase \u201cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable,\u201d which plainly indicates that Congress contemplated that there would be some instances in which a vaccine\u2019s side effects are \u201cunavoidable\u201d and other instances in which they are not. See <em>supra, </em>at 252, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 22. The majority\u2019s premise that a vaccine\u2019s side effects can always be \u201cavoid [ed] by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 232, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 10, entirely ignores the fact that removing the \u201charmful</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">[562 U.S. 263]</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">element\u201d will often result in a less effective (or entirely ineffective) vaccine. A vaccine, by its nature, ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>narily employs a killed or weakened form of a bacteria or virus to stimulate antibody production;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> removing that bacteria or virus might remove the \u201charmful element,\u201d but it would also necessarily render the vaccine inert. As explained above, the legislative history of the Vaccine Act and the cases interpreting comment <em>k </em>make clear that a side effect is \u201cunavoidable\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 22(b)(1) only where there is no feasible alternative design that would eliminate the side effect of the vaccine without compromising its cost and utility. See <em>supra, </em>at 256, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 24. The majority\u2019s premise\u2014that side effects stemming from a vaccine\u2019s design are always avoidable\u2014is thus belied by the statutory text and legislative history of \u00a7 22(b)(1). And because its starting premise is invalid, its conclusion\u2014that the design of a vaccine is not subject to challenge in a tort action\u2014is also necessarily invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The majority\u2019s reading suffers from an even more fundamental defect. If Congress intended to exempt vaccine manufacturers categorically from all design defect liability, it more logically would have provided: \u201cNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.\u201d There would have been no need for Congress to include the additional 13 words \u201cthe injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though.\u201d See <em>TRW Inc. </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S. Ct. 441, 151 L. Ed. 2d 339 (2001) (noting \u201ccardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall</p>\n<p id=\"ai-dedup-0\">[562 U.S. 264]</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">be superfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC, </em>544 U.S. 431, 125 S.

Ct. 1788, 161 L. Ed. 2d 687)), cert. pending, No. 08-1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Strikingly, the majority concedes that its interpretation renders 13 words of the statute entirely superfluous. See <em>ante, </em>at 236, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 13 (\u201cThe intervening passage (\u2018the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though\u2019) is unnecessary. True enough\u201d). Nevertheless, the majority contends that \u201cthe rule against giving a portion of text an interpretation which renders it superfluous . . . applies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offending passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing interpretation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>According to the majority, petitioners\u2019 reading of \u00a7 22(b)(1) renders the \u201ceven though\u201d clause superfluous because, to reach petitioners\u2019 desired outcome, \u201c[i]t would suffice to say \u2018if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable\u2019\u2014full stop.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 237, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 13. As explained above, however, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause establishes two additional prerequisites\u2014proper manufacturing and proper labeling\u2014to qualify for \u00a7 22(b)(l)\u2019s exemption from liability. Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, then, the \u201ceven though\u201d clause serves an important function by limiting the scope of the pre-emption afforded by the preceding \u201cif\u2019 clause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">[562 U.S. 266]</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The majority\u2019s only other textual argument is based on the <em>expressio unius, exclusio alterius </em>canon. According to the majority, because blacklet-ter products liability law generally recognizes three different types of product defects, \u201c[i]f all three were intended to be preserved, it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>strange [for Congress] to mention specifically only two\u201d\u2014namely, manufacturing and labeling defects in the \u201ceven though\u201d clause\u2014\u201cand leave the third to implication.\u201d Ante, at 232, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 10-11. The majority\u2019s argument, however, ignores that the default rule under the Vaccine Act is that state law is preserved. As explained above, \u00a7 22(a) expressly provides that the \u201c[g]eneral rule\u201d is that \u201cState law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(a). Because \u00a7 22(a) already preserves state-law design defect claims (to the extent the exemption in \u00a7 22(b)(1) does not apply), there was no need for Congress separately and expressly to preserve design defect claims in \u00a7 22(b)(1). Indeed, Congress\u2019 principal aim in enacting \u00a7 22(b)(1) was not to preserve manufacturing and labeling claims (those, too, were already preserved by \u00a7 22(a)), but rather, to federalize comment \u215b-type protection for \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d vaccines. The \u201ceven though\u201d clause simply functions to limit the applicability of that defense. The lack of express language in \u00a7 22(b)(1) specifically preserving design defect claims thus cannot fairly be understood as impliedly (and categorically) pre-empting such traditional</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">[562 U.S. 267]</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">state tort claims, which had already been preserved by \u00a7 22(a).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The majority also suggests that if Congress wished to preserve design defect claims, it could have simply provided that manufacturers would be liable for \u201cdefective manufacture, defective directions or warning, and defective design.\u201d Ante, at 233, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). Putting aside the fact that \u00a7 22(a) already preserves design defect claims (to the extent \u00a7 22(b)(1) does not apply), the majority\u2019s proposed solution would not have fully effectuated Congress\u2019 intent. As the legislative history makes clear, Congress used the term \u201cunavoidable\u201d to effectuate its intent that the \u201cprinciple in Comment K regarding \u2018unavoidably unsafe\u2019 products . . . apply to the vaccines covered in the bill.\u201d 1986 Report 26; see also 1987 Report 691. At the time of the Vaccine Act\u2019s enactment in 1986, at least one State had expressly rejected comment \u215b,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> while many others had not addressed</p>\n<p id=\"AHW\">[562 U.S. 268]</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">the applicability of comment <em>k </em>specifically to vaccines or applied comment <em>k </em>to civil actions proceeding on a theory other than strict liability (e.g., negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>gence<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> ). A statute that simply stated that vaccine manufacturers would be liable for \u201cdefective design\u201d would be silent as to the availability of a comment A-type defense for \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d vaccines, and thus would not have fully achieved Congress\u2019 aim of extending greater liability protection to vaccine manufacturers by providing comment A-type protection in all civil actions as a matter of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The majority\u2019s structural arguments fare no better than its textual ones. The principal thrust of the majority\u2019s position is that, since nothing in the Vaccine Act or the FDA\u2019s regulations governing vaccines expressly mentions design defects, Congress must have intended to remove issues concerning the design of FDA-licensed vaccines from the tort system. <em>Ante, </em>at 237, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 13. The flaw in that reasoning, of course, is that the FDA\u2019s silence on design defects existed long before the Vaccine Act was enacted. Indeed, the majority itself concedes that the \u201cFDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its intended use.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>And yet it is undisputed that prior to the Act, vaccine manufacturers</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">[562 U.S. 269]</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">had long been subject to liability under state tort law for defective vaccine design. That the Vaccine Act did not itself set forth a comprehensive regulatory scheme with respect to design defects is thus best understood to mean not that Congress suddenly decided to change course <em>sub silentio </em>and pre-empt a longstanding, traditional category of state tort law, but rather, that Congress intended to leave the status quo alone (except, of course, with respect to those aspects of state tort law that the Act expressly altered). See 1987 Report 691 (\u201cIt is not the Committee\u2019s intention to preclude court actions under applicable law. The Committee\u2019s intent at the time of considering the Act. . . was ... to leave otherwise applicable law unaffected, except as expressly altered by the Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The majority also suggests that Congress necessarily intended to preempt design defect claims since the aim of such tort suits is to promote the development of improved designs and provide compensation for injured individuals, and the Vaccine Act \u201cprovides other means for achieving both effects\u201d\u2014most notably through the no-fault compensation program and the National Vaccine Program. <em>Ante, </em>at 238-239, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 14, and nn. 57-60 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-1, 300aa-2(a)(1)-(3), 300aa-3, 300aa-25(b), 300aa-27(a)(1)). But the majority\u2019s position elides a significant difference between state tort law and the federal regulatory scheme. Although the Vaccine Act charges the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the obligation to \u201cpromote the development of childhood vaccines\u201d and \u201cmake or assure improvements in ... vaccines, and research on vaccines,\u201d \u00a7 300aa-27(a), neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Act nor any other provision of federal law places a legal <em>duty </em>on vaccine manufacturers to improve the design of their vaccines to account for scientific and technological advances. Indeed, the FDA does not condition approval of a vaccine on it being the most optimally designed among reasonably available alternatives, nor does it (or any other federal entity) ensure that licensed vaccines keep pace with technological and scientific</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">[562 U.S. 270]</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">advances.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather, the function of ensuring that vaccines are optimally designed in light of existing science and technology has traditionally been left to the States through the imposition of damages for design defects.

The normal competitive forces that spur innovation and improvements to existing product lines in other markets thus operate with less force in the vaccine market, particularly for vaccines that have already been released and marketed to the public. Absent a clear statutory mandate to the contrary, there is no reason to think that Congress intended in the vaccine context to eliminate the traditional incentive and deterrence functions served by state tort liability in favor of a federal regulatory scheme providing only carrots and no sticks. <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See Levine, 555 U.S., at 575, 129 S.

As the legislative history indicates, the Act addressed \u201ctwo overriding concerns\u201d: \u201c(a) the inadequacy\u2014from both the perspective of vaccine-injured persons as well as vaccine manufacturers\u2014of the current approach to compensating those who have been damaged by a vaccine; and (b) the instability and unpredictability of the childhood vaccine market.\u201d 1986 Report 7. When viewed in the context of the Vaccine Act as a whole, \u00a7 22(b)(1) is just one part of a broader statutory scheme that balances the need for compensating vaccine-injured children with added liability protections for vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable childhood vaccine market.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The principal innovation of the Act was the creation of the no-fault compensation program\u2014a scheme funded entirely through an excise tax on vaccines.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Through that program,</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">[562 U.S. 273]</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Congress relieved vaccine manufacturers of the burden of compensating victims of vaccine-related injuries in the vast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>majority of case<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>\u2014an extremely significant economic benefit that \u201cfunctionally creat[es] a valuable insurance policy for vaccine-related injuries.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 10. The structure and legislative history, moreover, point clearly to Congress\u2019 intention to divert would-be tort claimants into the compensation program, rather than eliminate a longstanding category of traditional tort claims. See 1986 Report 13 (\u201cThe Committee anticipates that the speed of the compensation program, the low transaction costs of the system, the no-fault nature of the required findings, and the relative certainty and generosity of the system\u2019s awards will divert a significant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation\u201d). Indeed, although complete pre-emption of tort claims would have eliminated the principal source of the \u201cunpredictability\u201d in the vaccine market, Congress specifically chose <em>not </em>to preempt state tort claims categorically. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(a) (providing as a \u201c[gleneral rule\u201d that \u201cState law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death\u201d). That decision reflects Congress\u2019 recognition that court actions are essential because they provide injured persons with significant procedural tools\u2014 including, most importantly, civil discovery\u2014that are not available in administrative proceedings under the compensation program. See \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-12(d)(2)(E), (d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">[562 U.S. 274]</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Congress thus clearly believed there was still an important function to be played by state tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Instead of eliminating design defect liability entirely, Congress enacted numerous measures to reduce manufacturers\u2019 liability exposure, including a limited regulatory compliance presumption of adequate warnings, see \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(2), elimination of claims based on failure to provide direct warnings to patients, \u00a7 300aa-22(c), a heightened standard for punitive damages, \u00a7 300aa-23(d)(2), and, of course, immunity from damages for \u201cunavoidable\u201d side effects, \u00a7 300aa-22(b)(1). Considered in light of the Vaccine Act as a whole, \u00a722(b)(l)\u2019s exemption from liability for unavoidably unsafe vaccines is just one part of a broader statutory scheme that reflects Congress\u2019 careful balance between providing adequate compensation for vaccine-injured children and conferring substantial benefits on vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable and predictable childhood vaccine supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The majority\u2019s decision today disturbs that careful balance based on a bare policy preference that it is better \u201cto leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine design to the FDA and the National Vaccine Program rather than juries.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 239, 179 L.

These are especially common in the field of drugs. An outstanding example is the vaccine for the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious and damaging consequences when it is injected. Since the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing and the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree of risk which they involve. Such a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning, is not defective, nor is it <em>unreasonably </em>dangerous. The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very reason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the prescription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or perhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable risk. The seller of such products, again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk.\u201d Restatement 353-354.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\">.

The concurrence makes a similar argument. <em>Ante, </em>at 244-245, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 17-18 (opinion of Breyer, J.). This interpretation finds some support in the 1986 Report, which states that \u201cif [injured individuals] cannot demonstrate under applicable law either that a vaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by improper directions or inadequate warnings [they] should pursue recompense in the compensation system, not the tort system.\u2019\u2019 1986 Report 26. It also finds some support in the pre-Vaccine Act case law, which reflected considerable disagreement in the courts over \u201cwhether comment k applies to pharmaceutical products across the board or only on a case-by-case basis.\u2019\u2019Ausness, Unavoidably Unsafe Products and Strict Products Liability: What Liability Rule Should Be Applied to the Sellers of Pharmaceutical Products? 78 Ky. L. J. 705, 708, and n. 11 (1989-1990) (collecting cases). This interpretation, however, is undermined by the fact that Congress has never directed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other federal agency to review vaccines for optimal vaccine design, see <em>infra, </em>at 269-270, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 32-33, and n. 19, and thus it seems highly unlikely that Congress intended to eliminate the traditional mechanism for such review <em>(i.e., </em>design defect liability), particularly given its express retention of state tort law in the Vaccine Act, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22(a). In any event, to the extent there is ambiguity as to how precisely Congress intended the \u201cprinciple in Comment K\u2019\u2019 to apply to the covered vaccines, that ambiguity is explicitly resolved in petitioners\u2019 favor by the 1987 House Energy and Commerce Committee Report, H.

Thus, an injurious side effect is unavoidable <em>because </em>the vaccine was properly prepared and labeled, not \u201ceven though\u201d it was. The two conjunctions are not equivalent: The sentence \u201cI am happy <em>even though </em>it is raining\u201d can hardly be read to mean that \u201cI am happy <em>because </em>it is raining.\u201d In any event, the more fundamental point is that petitioners\u2019 interpretation actually gives meaning to the words \u201ceven though,\u201d whereas the majority concedes that its interpretation effectively reads those words entirely out of the statute.

Neither the United States nor any of the parties, however, has represented that CDC examines whether a safer alternative vaccine <em>could have been designed </em>given practical and scientific limits, the central inquiry in a state tort law action for design defect.

Ed. 2d, at 15. Congress could, of course, adopt a regulatory regime that operates differently from state tort systems, and such a difference is not necessarily a reason to question Congress\u2019 pre-emptive intent. In the specific context of the Vaccine Act, however, the relevant point is that this Court should not lightly assume that Congress intended <em>sub silentio </em>to displace a longstanding species of state tort liability where, as here, Congress specifically included an express saving clause preserving state law, there is a long history of state-law regulation of vaccine design, and pre-emption of state law would leave an important regulatory <em>function\u2014i.e., </em>ensuring optimal vaccine design\u2014entirely unaddressed by the congressional substitute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b132-13\">.

Respondent notes that there are some 5,000 petitions alleging a causal link between certain vaccines and autism spectrum disorders that are currently pending in an omnibus proceeding in the Court of Federal Claims (Vaccine Court). Brief for Respondent 56-57. According to respondent, a ruling that \u00a7 22(b)(1) does not pre-empt design defect claims could unleash a \u201ccrushing wave\u2019\u2019 of tort litigation that would bankrupt vaccine manufacturers and deplete vaccine supply. <em>Id., </em>at 28. This concern underlies many of the policy arguments in respondent\u2019s brief and appears to underlie the majority and concurring opinions in this case. In the absence of any empirical data, however, the prospect of an onslaught of autism-related tort litigation by claimants denied relief by the Vaccine Court seems wholly speculative. As an initial matter, the Special Masters in the autism cases have thus far uniformly rejected the alleged causal link between vaccines and autism. See Brief for American Academy of Pediatrics et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>20-21, n. 4 (collecting cases). To be sure, those rulings do not necessarily mean that no such causal link exists, cf. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>29 (noting that injuries have been added to the Vaccine Injury Table for existing vaccines), or that claimants will not ultimately be able to prove such a link in a state tort action, particularly with the added tool of civil discovery. But these rulings do highlight the substantial hurdles to recovery a claimant faces. See <em>Schafer </em>v. <em>American Cyanamid Co., </em>20 F.3d 1, 5 (CA1 1994) (\u201c[A] petitioner to whom the Vaccine Court gives nothing may see no point in trying to overcome tort law\u2019s yet more serious obstacles to recovery\u2019\u2019). Trial courts, moreover, have considerable experience in efficiently handling and disposing of meritless products liability claims, and decades of tort litigation (including for design defect) in the prescription-drug context have not led to shortages in prescription drugs. Despite the doomsday predictions of respondent and the various <em>amici </em>cited by the concurrence, <em>ante, </em>at 248-249, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 20-21, the possibility of a torrent of meritless lawsuits bankrupting manufacturers and causing vaccine shortages seems remote at best. More fundamentally, whatever the merits of these policy arguments, the issue in this case is what Congress has decided, and as to that question, the text, structure, and legislative history compel the conclusion that Congress intended to leave the courthouse doors open for children who have suffered severe injuries from defectively designed vaccines. The majority\u2019s policy-driven decision to the contrary usurps Congress\u2019 role and deprives such vaccine-injured children of a key remedy that Congress intended them to have.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
