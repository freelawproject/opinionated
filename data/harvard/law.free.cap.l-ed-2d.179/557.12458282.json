A jury convicted Pinholster of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">After the California Supreme Court twice unanimously denied Pinholster habeas relief, a Federal District Court held an evidentiary hearing and granted Pinholster habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254. The District Court concluded that Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective at the penalty phase of trial. Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. <em>Pinholster </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>590 F.3d 651 (2009). Considering the new evidence adduced in the District Court hearing, the Court of Appeals held that the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">We granted certiorari and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">On the evening of January 8, 1982, Pinholster solicited Art Corona and Paul David Brown to help him rob Michael Kumar, a local drug dealer. On the way, they stopped at</p>\n<p id=\"ArZ3\">[563 U.S. 175]</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">Lisa</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">Tapar\u2019s house, where Pinholster put his buck knife through her front door and scratched a swastika into her car after she refused to talk to him. The three men, who were all armed with buck knives, found no one at Kumar\u2019s house, broke in, and began ransacking the home. They came across only a small amount of marijuana before Kumar\u2019s friends, Thomas Johnson and Robert Beckett, arrived and shouted that they were calling the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-18\">Pinholster and his accomplices tried to escape through the rear door, but Johnson blocked their path. Pin-holster backed Johnson onto the patio, demanding drugs and money and repeatedly striking him in the chest. Johnson dropped his wallet on the ground and stopped resisting. Beckett then came around the corner, and Pinholster attacked him, too, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest. Pin-holster forced Beckett to the ground, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>took both men\u2019s wallets, and began kicking Beckett in the head. Meanwhile, Brown stabbed Johnson in the chest, \u201c \u2018bury[ing] his knife to the hilt.\u2019 \u201d 35 Reporter\u2019s Tr. 4947 (hereinafter Tr.). Johnson and Beckett died of their wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Corona drove the three men to Pin-holster\u2019s apartment. While in the car, Pinholster and Brown exulted, \u201c We got \u2019em, man, we got \u2019em good.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>At the apartment, Pinholster washed his knife, and the three split the proceeds of the robbery: $23 and one quarter-ounce of marijuana. Although Pinholster instructed Corona to \u201clay low,\u201d Corona turned himself in to the police two weeks later. <em>Id., </em>at 4955. Pinholster was arrested shortly thereafter and threatened to kill Corona if he did not keep quiet about the burglary and murders. Corona later became the State\u2019s primary witness. The prosecution brought numerous charges against Pinholster, including two counts of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The California trial court appointed Harry Brainard and Wilbur Dettmar to defend Pinholster on charges of first-degree murder, robbery, and burglary. Before their appointment,</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">[563 U.S. 176]</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Pin-holster had rejected other attorneys and insisted on representing himself. During that time, the State had mailed Pinholster a letter in jail informing him that the prosecution planned to offer aggravating evidence during the penalty phase of trial to support a sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">The guilt phase of the trial began on February 28, 1984. Pinholster testified on his own behalf and presented an alibi defense. He claimed that he had broken into Kumar\u2019s house alone at around 8 p.m. on January 8, 1982, and had stolen marijuana but denied killing anyone. Pinholster asserted that later that night around 1 a.m., while he was elsewhere, Corona went to Kumar\u2019s house to steal more drugs and did not return for three hours. Pinholster told the jury that he was a \u201cprofessional robber,\u201d not a murderer. 43 <em>id., </em>at 6204. He boasted of committing hundreds of robberies over the previous six years but insisted that he always used a gun, never a knife. The jury convicted Pinholster on both counts of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Before the penalty phase, Brainard and Dettmar moved to exclude any aggravating evidence on the ground that the prosecution had failed to provide notice of the evidence to be introduced, as required by Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 190.3 (West 2008). At a hearing on April 24, Dettmar argued that, in reliance on the lack of notice, he was \u201cnot presently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation.\u201d 52 Tr. 7250. He acknowledged, however, that the prosecutor \u201cpossibly ha[d] met the [notice] requirement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The trial court asked whether a continuance might be helpful, but Dett-mar declined, explaining that he could not think of a mitigation witness other than Pinholster\u2019s mother and that additional time would not \u201cmake a great deal of difference.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7257-7258. Three days later, after hearing testimony, the court found that Pinholster had received notice while representing himself and denied the motion to exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">The penalty phase was held before the same jury that had convicted Pin-holster. The prosecution produced eight witnesses,</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">[563 U.S. 177]</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">who testified about Pinholster\u2019s history of threatening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>and violent behavior, including resisting arrest and assaulting police officers, involvement with juvenile gangs, and a substantial prison disciplinary record. Defense counsel called only Pinholster\u2019s mother, Burnice Bras-hear. She gave an account of Pinhol-ster\u2019s troubled childhood and adolescent years, discussed Pinholster\u2019s siblings, and described Pinholster as \u201ca perfect gentleman at home.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7405. Defense counsel did not call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted Dr. John Stalberg at least six weeks earlier. Dr. Stalberg noted Pin-holster\u2019s \u201cpsychopathic personality traits,\u201d diagnosed him with antisocial personality disorder, and concluded that he \u201cwas not under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d at the time of the murders. App. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">After 2\u00bd days of deliberation, the jury unanimously voted for death on each of the two murder counts. On mandatory appeal, the California Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pinholster, </em>1 Cal. 4th 865, 824 P.2d 571 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In August 1993, Pinholster filed his first state habeas petition. Represented by new counsel, Pinholster alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase of his trial. He alleged that Brainard and Dettmar had failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence, including evidence of mental disorders. Pinholster supported this claim with school, medical, and legal records, as well as declarations from family members, Brainard, and Dr. George Woods, a psychiatrist who diagnosed Pinholster with bipolar mood disorder and seizure disorders. Dr. Woods criticized Dr. Stalberg\u2019s report as incompetent, unreliable, and inaccurate. The California Supreme Court unanimously and summarily<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Pinholster\u2019s penalty-phase</p>\n<p id=\"ABDT\">[563 U.S. 178]</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">ineffective-assistance claim \u201con the substantive ground that it is without merit.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Pinholster filed a federal habeas petition in April 1997. He reiterated his previous allegations about penalty-phase ineffective assistance and also added new allegations that his trial counsel had failed to furnish Dr. Stalberg with adequate background materials. In support of the new allegations, Dr. Stalberg provided a declaration stating that in 1984, Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel had provided him with only some police reports and a 1978 probation report. Dr. Stalberg explained that, had he known about the material that had since been gathered by Pinholster\u2019s habeas counsel, he would have conducted \u201cfurther inquiry\u201d before concluding that Pinholster suffered only from a personality disorder. App. to Brief in Opposition 219. He noted that Pinholster\u2019s school records showed evidence of \u201csome degree of brain damage.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Dr. Stalberg did not, however, retract his earlier diagnosis. The parties stipulated that this declaration had never been submitted to the California Supreme Court, and the federal petition was held in abeyance to allow Pinholster to go back to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">In August 1997, Pinholster filed his second state habeas petition, this time including Dr. Stalberg\u2019s declaration and requesting judicial notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the documents previously submitted in support of his first state habeas petition. His allegations of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel mirrored those in his federal habeas petition. The California Supreme Court again unanimously and summarily denied the petition \u201con the substantive ground that it is without merit.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> App. to Pet. for Cert. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">[563 U.S. 179]</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Having presented Dr. Stalberg\u2019s declaration to the state court, Pinhol-ster returned to the District Court. In November 1997, he filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. His allegations of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel were identical to those in his second state habeas petition. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and Pinhol-ster also moved, in the alternative, for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The District Court concluded that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, did not apply and granted an evidentiary hearing. Before the hearing, the State deposed Dr. Stal-berg, who stated that none of the new material he reviewed altered his original diagnosis. Dr. Stalberg disagreed with Dr. Woods\u2019 conclusion that Pinholster suffers from bipolar disorder. Pinholster did not call Dr. Stalberg to testify at the hearing. He presented two new medical experts: Dr. Sophia Vinogradov, a psychiatrist who diagnosed Pinholster with organic personality syndrome and ruled out antisocial personality disorder, and Dr. Donald Olson, a pediatric neurologist who suggested that Pin-holster suffers from partial epilepsy and brain injury. The State called Dr. F. David Rudnick, a psychiatrist who, like Dr. Stalberg, diagnosed Pinhol-ster with antisocial personality disorder and rejected any diagnosis of bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The District Court granted habeas relief. Applying pre-AEDPA standards, the court granted the habeas petition \u201cfor inadequacy of counsel by failure to investigate and present mitigation evidence at the penalty hearing.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 262. After <em>Woodford </em>v. <em>Garceau, </em>538 U.S. 202, 123 S. Ct. 1398, 155 L. Ed. 2d 363 (2003), clarified that AEDPA applies to cases like Pinholster\u2019s, the court amended its order but did not alter its conclusion. Over a dissent, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. <em>Pinholster </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>525 F.3d 742 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">[563 U.S. 180]</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals vacated the panel opinion and affirmed the District Court\u2019s grant of habeas relief. The en banc court held that the District Court\u2019s evidentiary hearing was not barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). The court then determined that new evidence from the hearing could be considered in assessing whether the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law\u201d under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). See 590 F.3d, at 666 (\u201cCongress did not intend to restrict the inquiry under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) only to the evidence introduced in the state habeas court\u201d). Taking the District Court evidence into account, the en banc court determined that the California Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Court unreasonably applied <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), in denying Pinholster\u2019s claim of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Three judges dissented and rejected the majority\u2019s conclusion that the District Court hearing was not barred by \u00a7 2254(e)(2). 590 F.3d, at 689 (opinion of Kozinski, C. J.) (characterizing Pin-holster\u2019s efforts as \u201chabeas-by-sand-bagging\u201d). Limiting its review to the state-court record, the dissent concluded that the California Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland. </em>590 F.3d, at 691-723.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We granted certiorari to resolve two questions. 560 U.S. 946, 130 S. Ct. 3410, 177 L. Ed. 2d 323 (2010). First, whether review under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) permits consideration of evidence introduced in an evidentiary hearing before the federal habeas court. Second, whether the Court of Appeals properly granted Pinholster habeas relief on his claim of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We first consider the scope of the record for a \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry. The State argues that review is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits. Pinholster contends that evidence presented</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">[563 U.S. 181]</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">to the federal ha-beas court may also be considered. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">As amended by AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 sets several limits on the power of a federal court to grant an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a state prisoner.  Section 2254(a) permits a federal court to entertain only those applications alleging that a person is in state custody \u201cin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d Sections 2254(b) and (c) provide that a federal court may not grant such applications unless, with certain exceptions, the applicant has exhausted state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">If an application includes a claim that has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d), an additional restriction applies. Under \u00a7 2254(d), that application \u201cshall not be granted with respect to [such a] claim . . . unless the adjudication of the claim\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-14\">\u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-15\">\u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">This is a \u201cdifficult to meet,\u201d <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 102, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011), and \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings, which demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,\u201d <em>Woodford </em>v. <em>Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 24, 123 S. Ct. 357, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279 (2002) <em>(per curiam) </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The petitioner carries the burden of proof. <em>Id., </em>at 25, 123 S. Ct. 357, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>We now hold that  review under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits. Section 2254(d)(1) refers, in the</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">[563 U.S. 182]</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">past tense, to a state-court adjudication that \u201cresulted in\u201d a decision that was contrary to, or \u201cinvolved\u201d an unreasonable application of, established law. This backward-looking language requires an examination of the state-court decision at the time it was made. It follows that the record under review is limited to the record in existence at that same <em>time\u2014i.e., </em>the record before the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">This understanding of the text is compelled by \u201cthe broader context of the statute as a whole,\u201d which demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent to channel prisoners\u2019 claims first to the state courts. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997).  \u201cThe federal habeas scheme leaves primary responsibility with the state courts ....\u201d <em>Visciotti, supra, </em>at 27, 123 S. Ct. 357, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279. Section 2254(b) requires that prisoners must ordinarily exhaust state remedies before filing for federal habeas relief. It would be contrary to that purpose to allow a petitioner to overcome an adverse state-court decision with new evidence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed by that court in the first instance effectively <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A48o\">Limiting \u00a7 2254(d)(1) review to the state-court record is consistent with our precedents interpreting that statutory provision. Our cases emphasize that  review under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) focuses on what a state court knew and did. State-court decisions are measured against this Court\u2019s precedents as of \u201cthe time the state court renders its decision.\u201d <em>Lockyer </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71-72, 123 S. Ct. 1166, 155 L. Ed. 2d 144 (2003). To determine whether a particular decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d then-established law, a federal court must consider whether the decision \u201capplies a rule that contradicts [such] law\u201d and how the decision \u201cconfronts [the] set of facts\u201d that were before the state court. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405, 406, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000) <em>(Terry Williams). </em>If the state-court decision \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle\u201d in existence at the time, a federal court must assess whether the decision \u201cunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 413, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389. It would be strange to ask federal</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">[563 U.S. 183]</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">courts to analyze whether a state court\u2019s adjudication resulted in a decision that unreasonably applied federal law to facts not before the state court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Our recent decision in <em>Schriro </em>v. <em>Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 127 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007), is consistent as well with our holding here. We explained that \u201c[b]ecause the deferential standards prescribed by \u00a7 2254 control whether to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into account those standards in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 474, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836. In practical effect, we went on to note, this means that when the state-court record \u201cprecludes habeas relief\u2019 under the limitations of \u00a7 2254(d), a district court is \u201cnot required to hold an evi-dentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 474, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (citing with approval the Ninth Circuit\u2019s recognition that \u201can evidentiary hearing is not required on issues that can be resolved by reference to the state court record\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The Court of Appeals wrongly interpreted <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000) <em>(Michael Williams), </em>as supporting the contrary view. The question there was whether the lower court had correctly determined that \u00a7 2254(e)(2) barred the petitioner\u2019s request for a federal evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">[563 U.S. 184]</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\"><em>Michael Williams </em>did not concern whether evidence introduced in such a hearing could be considered under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). In fact, only one claim at issue in that case was even subject to \u00a7 2254(d); the rest had not been adjudicated on the merits in state-court proceedings. See <em>id., </em>at 429, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435 (\u201cPetitioner did not develop, or raise, his claims . . . until he filed his federal habeas petition\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">If anything, the decision in <em>Michael Williams </em>supports our holding. The lower court in that case had determined that the one claim subject to \u00a7 2254(d)( 1) did not satisfy that statutory requirement. In light of that ruling, this Court concluded that it was \u201cunnecessary to reach the question whether \u00a7 2254(e)(2) would permit a [federal] hearing on th[at] claim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 444, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435. That conclusion is fully consistent with our holding that evidence later introduced in federal court is irrelevant to \u00a7 2254(d)(1) review.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 reliance on <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>542 U.S. 649, 124 S. Ct. 2736, 159 L. Ed. 2d 683 (2004) <em>(per curiam), </em>was also mistaken. In <em>Holland, </em>we initially stated that \u201cwhether a state court\u2019s decision was unreasonable [under \u00a7 2254(d)(1)] must be assessed in light of the record the court had before it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 652, 124 S. Ct. 2736, 159 L. Ed. 2d 683. We then went on to <em>assume </em>for the sake of argument what some Courts of Appeals had held\u2014that \u00a7 2254(d)(1), despite its mandatory language, simply does not apply when a federal habeas court has admitted new evidence that supports a claim previously adjudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>cated in state court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 653, 124 S. Ct. 2736, 159 L. Ed. 2d 683. There was no reason to decide that question because regardless, the hearing should have been barred by \u00a7 2254(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">[563 U.S. 185]</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Today, we reject that assumption and hold that  evidence introduced in federal court has no bearing on \u00a7 2254(d)(1) review. If a claim has been adjudicated on the merits by a state court, a federal ha-beas petitioner must overcome the limitation of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Pinholster\u2019s contention that our holding renders \u00a7 2254(e)(2) superfluous is incorrect.  Section 2254(e)(2) imposes a limitation on the discretion of federal habeas courts to take new evidence in an evidentiary hearing. See <em>Landrigan, supra, </em>at 473, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (noting that district courts, under AEDPA, generally retain the discretion to grant an evidentiary hearing). Like \u00a7 2254(d)(1), it carries out \u201cAEDPA\u2019s goal of promoting comity, finality, and federalism by giving state courts the first opportunity to review [a] claim, and to correct any constitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Quarterman, </em>555 U.S. 113, 121, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Section 2254(e)(2) continues to have force where \u00a7 2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief. For example,</p>\n<p id=\"AMBJ\">[563 U.S. 186]</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">not all federal habeas claims by state prisoners fall within the scope of \u00a7 2254(d), which applies only to claims \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\u201d At a minimum, therefore, \u00a7 2254(e)(2) still restricts the discretion of federal habeas courts to consider new evidence when deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state court. See, <em>e.g., Michael Williams, </em>529 U.S., at 427-429, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence in federal court, AEDPA\u2019s statutory scheme is designed to strongly discourage them from doing so. Provisions like \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (e)(2) ensure that \u201c[flederal courts sitting in habeas are not an alternative forum for trying facts and issues which a prisoner made insufficient effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>pursue in state proceedings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 437, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435; see also <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S., at 103, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (\u201cSection 2254(d) is part of the basic structure of federal habeas jurisdiction, designed to confirm that state courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to state convictions\u201d); <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 90, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594 (1977) (\u201c[T]he state trial on the merits [should be] the \u2018main event,\u2019 so to speak, rather than a \u2018tryout on the road\u2019 for what will later be the determinative federal ha-beas hearing\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in considering the District Court evidence in its review under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Although we might ordinarily remand for a properly limited review, the Court of Appeals also ruled, in the alternative, that Pinholster merited habeas relief</p>\n<p id=\"A8bs\">[563 U.S. 187]</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">even on the state-court record alone. 590 F.3d, at 669.

No party disputes that Pinholster\u2019s federal petition alleges an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim that had been included in both of Pinholster\u2019s state habeas petitions. The California Supreme Court denied each of those petitions \u201con the substantive ground that it is without merit.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">Section 2254(d) applies even where there has been a summary denial.

[but] simply to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial.\u201d 466 U.S., at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. Thus, \u201c[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct <em>so undermined. </em>the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 686, 104 S.

Pinhol-ster must demonstrate that it was necessarily unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to conclude: (1) that he had not overcome the strong presumption of competence; and (2) that he had failed to undermine confidence in the jury\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Pinholster has not shown that the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision that he could not demonstrate deficient performance by his trial counsel necessarily involved an unreasonable application of federal law. In arguing to the state court that his counsel performed deficiently, Pinholster contended that they should have pursued and presented additional evidence about: his family members and their criminal, mental, and substance abuse problems; his schooling; and his medical and mental health history, including his epileptic disorder. To support his allegation that his trial counsel had \u201cno reasonable tactical basis\u201d for the approach they took, Pinholster relied on statements his counsel made at trial. App. to Brief in Opposition 143. When arguing the motion to exclude the State\u2019s aggravating evidence at the penalty phase for failure to comply with Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 190.3, Dettmar, one of Pinholster\u2019s counsel, contended that because the State did not provide notice, he \u201c[was] not presently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation,\u201d 52 Tr. 7250. In response to the trial court\u2019s inquiry as to whether a continuance might be helpful, Dett-mar noted that the only mitigation witness he could think of was Pinholster\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">[563 U.S. 191]</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">mother. Additional time, Dettmar stated, would not \u201cmake a great deal of difference.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7257-7258.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">We begin with the premise that \u201cunder the circumstances, the challenged action [s] might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals dissent described one possible strategy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-14\">\u201c[Pinholster\u2019s attorneys] were fully aware that they would have to deal with mitigation sometime during the course of the trial, did spend considerable time and effort investigating avenues for mitigation [,] and made a reasoned professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>judgment that the best way to serve their client would be to rely on the fact that they never got [the required \u00a7 190.3] notice and hope the judge would bar the state from putting on their aggravation witnesses.\u201d 590 F.3d, at 701-702 (opinion of Kozinski, C. J.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Further, if their motion was denied, counsel were prepared to present only Pinholster\u2019s mother in the penalty phase to create sympathy not for Pin-holster, but for his mother. After all, the \u201c \u2018family sympathy\u2019 \u201d mitigation defense was known to the defense bar in California at the time and had been used by other attorneys. <em>Id., </em>at 707. Rather than displaying neglect, we presume that Dettmar\u2019s arguments were part of this trial strategy. See <em>Gentry, supra, </em>at 8, 124 S. Ct. 1, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1 (\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption that [counsel took certain actions] for tactical reasons rather than through sheer neglect\u201d (citing <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 690, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674)).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The state-court record supports the idea that Pinholster\u2019s counsel acted strategically to get the prosecution\u2019s aggravation witnesses excluded for lack of notice, and if that failed, to put on Pinholster\u2019s mother. Other statements made during the argument regarding the motion to exclude suggest that defense counsel were trying to take advantage of a legal technicality and were not truly surprised. Brain-ard and</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">[563 U.S. 192]</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Dettmar acknowledged that the prosecutor had invited them on numerous occasions to review Pinhol-ster\u2019s state prison file but argued that such an invitation did not meet with the \u201cstrict demands\u201d of \u00a7 190.3. 52 Tr. 7260. Dettmar admitted that the prosecutor, \u201cbeing as thorough as she is, possibly ha[d] met the requirement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7250. But if so, he wanted her \u201cto make that representation to the court.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Timesheets indicate that Pinhol-ster\u2019s trial counsel investigated mitigating evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Long before the guilty verdict, Dettmar talked with Pinholster\u2019s mother and contacted a psychiatrist.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On February 26, two months before the penalty phase started, he billed six hours for \u201c [p] reparation argument, death penalty phase.\u201d See Clerk\u2019s Tr. 864. Brainard, who merely assisted Dett-mar for the penalty phase, researched epilepsy and also interviewed Pinhol-ster\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We know that Brain-ard likely spent additional time, not reflected in these entries, preparing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Pinholster\u2019s brother, Terry, who provided some mitigation testimony</p>\n<p id=\"ArLq\">[563 U.S. 193]</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">about Pinholster\u2019s background during the guilt phase. <em>Infra, </em>at 200, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The record also shows that Pinhol-ster\u2019s counsel confronted a challenging penalty phase with an unsympathetic client, which limited their feasible mitigation strategies. By the end of the guilt phase, the jury had observed Pinholster \u201cglor[y]\u201d in \u201chis criminal disposition\u201d and \u201chundreds of robberies.\u201d <em>Pinholster, </em>1 Cal. 4th, at 945, 907, 824 P.2d, at 611, 584. During his cross-examination, Pinholster laughed or smirked when he told the jury that his \u201coccupation\u201d was \u201ca crook,\u201d when he was asked whether he had threatened a potential witness, and when he described thwarting police efforts to recover a gun he had once used. 44 Tr. 6225. He bragged about being a \u201cprofessional robber.\u201d 43 <em>id., </em>at 6204. To support his defense, Pinholster claimed that he used only gunsnot knivesto commit his crimes. But during cross-examination, Pinholster admitted that he had previously been convicted of using a knife in a kidnaping. Pin-holster also said he was a white supremacist and that he frequently carved swastikas into other people\u2019s property as \u201ca sideline to robbery.\u201d 44 <em>id., </em>at 6246.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Trial counsel\u2019s psychiatric expert, Dr. Stalberg, had concluded that Pin-holster showed no significant signs or symptoms of mental disorder or defect other than his \u201cpsychopathic personality traits.\u201d App. 131. Dr. Stalberg was aware of Pinholster\u2019s hyperactivity as a youngster, hospitalization at age 14 for incorrigibility, alleged epileptic disorder, and history of drug dependency. Nevertheless, Dr. Stal-berg told counsel that Pinholster did not appear to suffer from brain damage, was not significantly intoxicated or impaired on the night in question, and did not have an impaired ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Given these impediments, it would have been a reasonable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy for Pinholster\u2019s mother. In fact, such a family-sympathy defense is precisely how the State understood defense counsel\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">[563 U.S. 194]</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">strategy. The prosecutor carefully opened her cross-examination of Pinholster\u2019s mother with, \u201cI hope you understand I don\u2019t enjoy cross-examining a mother of anybody.\u201d 52 Tr. 7407. And in her closing argument, the prosecutor attempted to undercut defense counsel\u2019s strategy by pointing out, \u201cEven the most heinous person born, even Adolph Hitler[,] probably had a mother who loved him.\u201d 53 <em>id., </em>at 7452.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Pinholster\u2019s only response to this evidence is a series of declarations from Brainard submitted with Pinhol-ster\u2019s first state habeas petition, seven years after the trial. Brainard declares that he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of interviewing any family members (other than Pinholster\u2019s mother) regarding penalty-phase testimony, of attempting to secure Pinholster\u2019s school or medical records, or of interviewing any former teachers or counselors. Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616 (Cal.), Exh. 3. Brain-ard also declares that Dettmar was primarily responsible for mental health issues in the case, but he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of Dettmar ever having secured Pinholster\u2019s medical records. <em>Id., </em>Exh. 2. Dettmar neither confirmed nor denied Brainard\u2019s statements, as he had died by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>time of the first state habeas petition. 590 F.3d, at 700 (Kozinski, C. J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In sum, Brainard and Dettmar made statements suggesting that they were not surprised that the State intended to put on aggravating evidence, billing records show that they spent time investigating mitigating evidence, and the record demonstrates that they represented a psychotic client whose performance at trial hardly endeared him to the jury. Pinholster has responded to this evidence with only a handful of <em>post hoc </em>nondenials by one of his lawyers. The California Supreme Court could have reasonably concluded that Pinholster had failed to rebut the presumption of competence mandated by <em>Strick</em>land\u2014here, that counsel had adequately performed at the penalty phase of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">[563 U.S. 195]</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The Court of Appeals held that the California Supreme Court had unreasonably applied <em>Strickland </em>because Pinholster \u215b attorneys \u201cw[ere] far more deficient than . . . the attorneys in <em>Terry Williams, Wiggins </em>[v. <em>Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 123 S.

Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">We turn first to the aggravating and mitigating evidence that the sentencing jury considered. See <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 695, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (\u201c[A] court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury\u201d). Here, the same jury heard both the guilt and penalty phases and was instructed to consider all the evidence presented. Cf. <em>Visciotti, </em>537 U.S., at 25, 123 S. Ct. 357, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279 (noting that the state habeas court had correctly considered mitigating evidence introduced during the guilt phase).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">The State presented extensive aggravating evidence. As we have already discussed, the jury watched Pinholster revel in his extensive criminal history. <em>Supra, </em>at 193, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 577. Then, during the penalty phase, the State presented evidence that Pinholster had threatened to kill the State\u2019s lead witness, assaulted a man with a straight razor, and kidnaped another person with a knife. The State showed that Pinhol-ster had a history of violent outbursts, including striking and threatening a bailiff after a court proceeding at age 17, breaking his wife\u2019s jaw,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> resisting arrest by faking seizures, and assaulting and spitting on police officers. The jury also heard about Pin-holster\u2019s involvement in juvenile gangs and his substantial disciplinary record in both county and state jails, where he had threatened, assaulted, and thrown urine at</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">[563 U.S. 199]</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">guards, and fought with other inmates. While in jail, Pinholster had been segregated for a time due to his propensity for violence and placed on a \u201cspecial disciplinary diet\u201d reserved only for the most disruptive inmates. 52 Tr. 7305.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-16\">The mitigating evidence consisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>primarily of the penalty-phase testimony of Pinholster\u2019s mother, Bras-hear, who gave a detailed account of Pinholster\u2019s troubled childhood and adolescence. Early childhood was quite difficult. The family \u201cdidn\u2019t have lots of money.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7404. When he was very young, Pinholster suffered two serious head injuries, first at age 2 or 3 when he was run over by a car, and again at age 4 or 5 when he went through the windshield during a car accident. When he was 5, Pinholster\u2019s stepfather moved in and was abusive, or nearly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Pinholster always struggled in school. He was disruptive in kindergarten and was failing by first grade. He got in fights and would run out of the classroom. In third grade, Pinhol-ster\u2019s teacher suggested that he was more than just a \u201c \u2018disruptive child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7394. Following tests at a clinic, Pinholster was sent to a school for educationally handicapped children where his performance improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">At age 10, psychiatrists recommended that Pinholster be sent to a mental institution, although he did not go. Pinholster had continued to initiate fights with his brothers and to act like \u201cRobin Hood\u201d around the neighborhood, \u201c [stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7395. Brashear had thought then that \u201c[s]omething was not working right.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7396.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">By age 10 or 11, Pinholster was living in boys\u2019 homes and juvenile halls. He spent six months when he was 12 in a state mental institution for emotionally handicapped children. By the time he was 18, Pinholster was in county jail, where he was beaten badly. Brashear suspected that the beating caused Pinholster\u2019s epilepsy, for which he has been prescribed medication. After a stint in state prison, Pinholster</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">[563 U.S. 200]</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">returned home but acted \u201cunusual\u201d and had trouble readjusting to life. <em>Id., </em>at 7405.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Pinholster\u2019s siblings were \u201cbasically very good children,\u201d although they would get into trouble. <em>Id., </em>at 7401. His brother, Terry, had been arrested for drunk driving and his sister, Tammy, for public intoxication. Tammy also was arrested for drug possession and was self-destructive and \u201cwild.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Pinholster\u2019s eldest brother, Alvin, died a fugitive from California authorities.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">In addition to Brashear\u2019s penalty-phase testimony, Pinholster had previously presented mitigating evidence during the guilt phase from his brother, Terry. Terry testified that Pinholster was \u201cmore or less in institutions all his life,\u201d suffered from epilepsy, and was \u201cmore or less\u201d drunk on the night of the murders. 42 <em>id., </em>at 6015, 6036.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">After considering this aggravating and mitigating evidence, the jury returned a sentence of death. The state trial court found that the jury\u2019s determination was \u201csupported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence\u201d and added that \u201cthe factors in aggra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>vation beyond all reasonable doubt outweigh those in mitigation.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Tr. 1184, 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">There is no reasonable probability that the additional evidence Pinhol-ster presented in his state habeas proceedings would have changed the jury\u2019s verdict. The \u201cnew\u201d evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence at trial. School and medical records basically substantiate the testimony of</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">[563 U.S. 201]</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Pinholster\u2019s mother and brother. Declarations from Pinhol-ster\u2019s siblings support his mother\u2019s testimony that his stepfather was abusive and explain that Pinholster was beaten with fists, belts, and even wooden boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">To the extent the state habeas record includes new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of questionable mitigating value. If Pinholster had called Dr. Woods to testify consistently with his psychiatric report, Pinholster would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state expert. See, <em>e.g., Wong </em>v. <em>Belmontes, </em>558 U.S. 15, 24, 130 S. Ct. 383, 175 L. Ed. 2d 328 (2009) <em>(per curiam) </em>(taking into account that certain mitigating evidence would have exposed the petitioner to further aggravating evidence). The new evidence relating to Pinholster\u2019s family\u2014their more serious substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems, see <em>post, </em>at 226, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 577\u2014is also by no means clearly mitigating, as the jury might have concluded that Pin-holster was simply beyond rehabilitation. Cf. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 321, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002) (recognizing that mitigating evidence can be a \u201ctwo-edged sword\u201d that juries might find to show future dangerousness).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The remaining new material in the state habeas record is sparse. We learn that Pinholster\u2019s brother Alvin died of suicide by drug overdose, and there are passing references to Pin-holster\u2019s own drug dependency. According to Dr. Stalberg, Pinholster\u2019s \u201cschool records\u201d apparently evidenced \u201csome degree\u201d of brain damage. App. to Brief in Opposition 219. Mostly, there are just a few new details about Pinholster\u2019s childhood. Pinholster apparently looked like his biological father, whom his grandparents \u201cloathed.\u201d Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616 (Cal.), Exh. 98, p. 1. Accordingly, whenever his grandparents \u201cspanked or disciplined\u201d the kids, Pinholster \u201calways got the worst of it.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Pinholster was mostly unsupervised and \u201cdidn\u2019t get much love,\u201d because his mother and stepfather were always working and \u201cwere more concerned with their own lives than the welfare of their kids.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 2. Neither parent</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">[563 U.S. 202]</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">seemed concerned about Pinholster\u2019s schooling. Finally, Pinholster\u2019s aunt once saw the children mixing flour and water to make something to eat, although \u201c[m]ost meals consisted of canned spaghetti and foods of that ilk.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinholster presented in state habeas, we cannot say that the California Supreme Court\u2019s determination was unreasonable. Having already heard much of what is included in the state habeas record, the jury returned a sentence of death. Moreover, some of the new testimony would likely have undercut the mitigating value of the testimony by Pin-holster\u2019s mother. The new material is thus not so significant that, even assuming Pinholster\u2019s trial counsel performed deficiently, it was necessarily unreasonable for the California Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>preme Court to conclude that Pinhol-ster had failed to show a \u201csubstantial\u201d likelihood of a different sentence. <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S., at 112, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 693, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As with deficiency, the Court of Appeals found this case to be \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from <em>Terry Williams and Rompilla </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>545 U.S. 374, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2005). 590 F.3d, at 684. But this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the question of prejudice in those cases; each of them lack the important \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d standard of <em>Strickland </em>and AEDPA. See <em>Terry Williams, </em>529 U.S., at 395-397, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (reviewing a state-court decision that did not apply the correct legal standard); <em>Rompilla, supra, </em>at 390, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360 (reviewing <em>Strickland </em>prejudice <em>de novo </em>because the state-court decision did not reach the question). Those cases therefore offer no guidance with respect to whether a state court has <em>unreasonably </em>determined that prejudice is lacking. We have said time and again that \u201can <em>unreasonable </em>application of federal law is different from an <em>incorrect </em>application of federal law.\u201d <em>Richter, supra, </em>at 101, 131 S.

Justice Sotomayor argues that there is nothing strange about allowing consideration of new evidence under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) because, in her view, it would not be \u201cso different\u2019\u2019 from some other tasks that courts undertake. <em>Post, </em>at 218, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 592 (dissenting opinion). What makes the consideration of new evidence strange is not how \u201cdifferent\u201d the task would be, but rather the notion that a state court can be deemed to have unreasonably applied federal law to evidence it did not even know existed. We cannot comprehend how exactly a state court would have any control over its application of law to matters beyond its knowledge. Adopting Justice Sotomayor\u2019s approach would not take seriously AEDPA\u2019s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court decisions and would effectively treat the statute as no more than a \u201c \u2018mood\u2019 that the Federal Judiciary must respect,\u201d <em>Terry Williams, </em>529 U.S., at 386, 120 S.

The additional clarity of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) on this point, however, does not detract from our view that \u00a7 2254(d)(1) also is plainly limited to the state-court record.

For that reason, we need not decide whether \u00a7 2254(e)(2) prohibited the District Court from holding the evidentiary hearing or whether a district court may ever choose to hold an evidentiary hearing before it determines that \u00a7 2254(d) has been satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b681-11\">SEPARATE OPINIONS</p>\n<author id=\"b681-12\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"av_-dedup-0\">concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Although I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment, I agree with the conclusion reached in Part I of the dissent, namely, that, when an evidentiary hearing is properly held in federal court, review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) must take into account the evidence admitted at that hearing. As the dissent points out, refusing to consider the evidence received in the hearing in federal court gives \u00a7 2254(e)(2) an implausibly narrow scope and will lead either to results that Congress surely did not intend or to the distortion of other provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and the law on \u201ccause and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>prejudice.\u201d See <em>post, </em>at 214-217, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 590-592 (opinion of Soto-mayor, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Under AEDPA evidentiary hearings in federal court should be rare. The petitioner generally must have made a diligent effort to produce in state court the new evidence on which he seeks to rely. See \u00a7 2254(e)(2); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">[563 U.S. 204]</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">529 U.S. 420, 433-434, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000). If that requirement is not satisfied, the petitioner may establish the factual predicate for a claim in a federal-court hearing only if, among other things, \u201cthe facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\u201d \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Even when the petitioner does satisfy the diligence standard adopted in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>a hearing should not be held in federal court unless the new evidence that the petitioner seeks to introduce was not and could not have been offered in the state-court proceeding. Section 2254(e)(2) bars a hearing in certain situations, but it does not mean that a hearing is allowed in all other situations. See <em>Schriro </em>v. <em>Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 473-474, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007). The whole thrust of AEDPA is essentially to reserve federal habeas relief for those cases in which the state courts acted unreasonably. See \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2), (e)(1). Permitting a petitioner to obtain federal habeas relief on the basis of evidence that could have been but was not offered in state court would upset this scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">In this case, for essentially the reasons set out in the dissent from the Court of Appeals\u2019 en banc decision, see <em>Pinholster </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>590 F.3d 651, 688-691 (CA9 2009) (opinion of Kozinski, C. J.), I would hold that the federal-court hearing should not have been held because respondent did not diligently present his new evidence to the California courts. And I join all but Part II of the opinion of the Court, as I agree that the decision of the state court represented a reasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent in light of the state-court record.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b682-10\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"AZtq\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">I join Parts I and II of the Court\u2019s opinion.

Compare <em>ante, </em>at 187-203, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 573-583 (majority opinion), with <em>post, </em>at 221-246, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 595-610 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">Like the Court, I believe that its understanding of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) does not leave AEDPA\u2019s hearing section, \u00a7 2254(e), without work to do. An offender who believes he is entitled to habeas relief must first present a claim (including his evidence) to the state courts. If the state courts reject the claim, then a federal habeas court may review that rejection on the basis of the materials considered by the state court. If the federal habeas court finds that the state-court decision fails (d)\u2019s test (or if (d) does not apply), then an (e) hearing may be needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">For example, if the state-court rejection assumed the habeas petitioner\u2019s facts (deciding that, <em>even </em>\u00bf/those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>facts were true, federal law was not violated), then (after finding the state court wrong on a (d) ground) an (e) hearing might be needed to determine whether the facts alleged were indeed true. Or if the state-court rejection rested on a state ground, which a federal habeas court found inadequate, then an (e) hearing might be needed to consider the petitioner\u2019s (now unblocked) substantive federal claim. Or if the state-court rejection rested on only one of several related federal grounds <em>(e.g., </em>that counsel\u2019s assistance was not \u201cinadequate\u201d), then, if the federal court found that the state court\u2019s decision in respect to the ground it decided violated (d), an (e) hearing might be needed to consider other related parts of the whole constitutional claim <em>(e.g., </em>whether the counsel\u2019s \u201cinadequate\u201d assistance was also prejudicial). There may be other situations in which an (e) hearing is needed as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">In this case, however, we cannot say whether an (e) hearing is needed until we know whether the state court, in rejecting Pinholster\u2019s claim on the basis presented to that state court, violated (d). (In my view, the lower courts\u2019 analysis in respect to this matter is inadequate.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">[563 U.S. 206]</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">There is no role in (d) analysis for a habeas petitioner to introduce evidence that was not first presented to the state courts. But that does not mean that Pinholster is without recourse to present new evidence. He can always return to state court presenting new evidence not previously presented. If the state court again denies relief, he might be able to return to federal court to make claims related to the latest rejection, subject to AEDPA\u2019s limitations on successive petitions. See \u00a7 2244.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">I am not trying to predict the future course of these proceedings. I point out only that, in my view, AEDPA is not designed to take necessary remedies from a habeas petitioner but to give the State a first opportunity to consider most matters and to insist that federal courts properly respect state-court determinations.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b683-9\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"ABBr\">with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan join as to Part II, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">Some habeas petitioners are unable to develop the factual basis of their claims in state court through no fault of their own. Congress recognized as much when it enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and permitted therein the introduction of new evidence in federal habeas proceedings in certain limited circumstances. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). Under the Court\u2019s novel interpretation of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), however, federal courts must turn a blind eye to new evidence in deciding whether a petitioner has satisfied \u00a7 2254(d)(l)\u2019s threshold obstacle to federal habeas relief\u2014even when it is clear that the petitioner would be entitled to relief in light of that evidence. In reading the statute to \u201ccompet\u00ed]\u201d this harsh result, <em>ante, </em>at 182, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 570, the Court ignores a key textual difference between \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1) and 2254(d)(2) and discards the previous understanding in our precedents that new evidence can, in fact, inform the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry. I therefore dissent from the Court\u2019s first holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">[563 U.S. 207]</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">I also disagree with the Court that, even if the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state-court record, respondent Scott Pinholster failed to demonstrate that the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision denying his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>claim was an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). There is no reason for the majority to decide whether the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state-court record because Pinholster satisfied \u00a7 2254(d)(1) on either the state- or federal-court record.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The Court first holds that, in determining whether a state-court decision is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), \u201creview ... is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 181, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 569. New evidence adduced at a federal evidentiary hearing is now irrelevant to determining whether a petitioner has satisfied \u00a7 2254(d)(1). This holding is unnecessary to promote AEDPA\u2019s purposes, and it is inconsistent with the provision\u2019s text, the structure of the statute, and our precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">To understand the significance of the majority\u2019s holding, it is important to view the issue in context. AEDPA\u2019s entire structure\u2014which gives state courts the opportunity to decide factual and legal questions in the first instance\u2014ensures that evidentiary hearings in federal habeas proceedings are very rare. See N. King, F. Cheesman, &amp; B. Ostrom, Final Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in U. S. District Courts 35-36 (2007) (evidentiary hearings under AEDPA occur in 0.4 percent of noncapital cases and 9.5 percent of capital cases). Even absent the new restriction created by today\u2019s holding, AEDPA erects multiple hurdles to a state prisoner\u2019s ability to introduce new evidence in a federal habeas proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">[563 U.S. 208]</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">First, \u201c[u]nder the exhaustion requirement, a habeas petitioner challenging a state conviction must first attempt to present his claim in state court.\u201d <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 103, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011); see also \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). With certain narrow exceptions, federal courts cannot consider a claim at all, let alone accept new evidence relevant to the claim, if it has not been exhausted in state court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The exhaustion requirement thus reserves to state courts the first opportunity to resolve factual disputes relevant to a state prisoner\u2019s claim. See <em>O\u2019Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 845, 119 S. Ct. 1728, 144 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Second, the exhaustion requirement is \u201ccomplement[ed]\u201d by the standards set forth in \u00a7 2254(d). <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S., at 103, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. Under this provision, a federal court may not grant habeas relief on any \u201cclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d unless the adjudication</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-13\">\u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-14\">\u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">These standards \u201ccontrol whether to grant habeas relief.\u201d <em>Schriro </em>v. <em>Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 474, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007). Accordingly, we have said, if the factual allegations a petitioner seeks to prove at an evidentiary hearing would not satisfy these standards, there is no reason for a hearing. See <em>id., </em>at 481, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836. In such a case, the district court may exercise its \u201cdiscretion to deny an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>infra, </em>at 218-219, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 593. This approach makes eminent sense: If district courts held eviden-tiary hearings without first asking</p>\n<p id=\"Au_n\">[563 U.S. 209]</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">whether the evidence the petitioner seeks to present would satisfy AED-PA\u2019s demanding standards, they would needlessly prolong federal ha-beas proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Third, even when a petitioner seeks to introduce new evidence that would entitle him to relief, AEDPA prohibits him from doing so, except in a narrow range of cases, unless he \u201cmade a reasonable attempt, in light of the information available at the time, to investigate and pursue claims in state court.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 435, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000) <em>(Michael Williams). </em>Thus, \u00a7 2254(e)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201cIf the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201c(A) the claim relies on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201c(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">\u201c(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\">\u201c(B) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">In <em>Michael Williams, </em>we construed the opening clause of this provision\u2014 which triggers the bar on evidentiary hearings\u2014to apply when \u201cthere is lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner\u2019s counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 432, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435. AEDPA thus bars an evidentiary hearing for a nondiligent petitioner unless the petitioner can</p>\n<p id=\"AK0C\">[563 U.S. 210]</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">satisfy both \u00a7\u00a7 2254(e)(2)(A) and (B), which few petitioners can. Section 2254(e)(2) in this way incentivizes state petitioners to develop the factual basis of their claims in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">To the limited extent that federal evidentiary hearings are available under AEDPA, they ensure that petitioners who diligently developed the factual basis of their claims in state court, discovered new evidence after the state-court proceeding, and cannot return to state court retain the ability to access the Great Writ. See <em>ante, </em>at 203-204, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 584 (Alito, J., concurring in part and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>curring in judgment). \u201cWhen Congress codified new rules governing this previously judicially managed area of law, it did so without losing sight of the fact that the \u2018writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 649, 130 S.

Allowing a petitioner to introduce new evidence at a hearing in the limited circumstance permitted by \u00a7 2254(e)(2) does not upset the balance that Congress struck in AEDPA between the state and federal courts.

In particular, Congress\u2019 decision to include in AE-DPA a provision, \u00a7 2254(e)(2), that permits federal evidentiary hearings in certain circumstances provides further evidence that Congress did not intend to limit the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry to the state-court record in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">We have long recognized that some diligent habeas petitioners are unable to develop all of the facts supporting their claims in state court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As discussed above, in enacting AEDPA, Congress generally barred eviden-tiary hearings for petitioners who did not \u201cexercise diligence in pursuing their claims\u201d in state court. <em>Michael Williams, </em>529 U.S., at 436, 120 S.

Ed. 2d 435 (\u201c[T]he statute does not equate prisoners who exercise diligence in pursuing their claims with those who do not\u201d). For those petitioners, Congress left the decision to hold a hearing \u201cto the sound discretion of district courts.\u201d <em>Landrigan, </em>550 U.S., at 473, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">Faced with situations in which a diligent petitioner offers additional evidence in federal court, the courts of appeals have taken two approaches to applying \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Some courts have held that when a federal court admits new evidence supporting a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court, \u00a7 2254(d)(1) does not apply at all and the federal court may review the claim <em>de novo. See ante, </em>at 184, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 571; <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>542 U.S. 649, 653, 124 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>2736, 159 L. Ed. 2d 683 (2004) <em>(per curiam); </em>see, <em>e.g., Winston </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>592 F.3d 535, 555-556 (CA4 2010). I agree with the majority\u2019s rejection of this approach. See <em>ante, </em>at 185, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 571. It would undermine the comity principles motivating AE-DPA to decline to defer to a state-court adjudication of a claim because the state court, through no fault of its own, lacked all the relevant evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Other Courts of Appeals, including the court below, have struck a more considered balance. These courts have held that \u00a7 2254(d)(1) continues to apply but that new evidence properly presented in a federal hearing is relevant to the</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">[563 U.S. 214]</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">reasonableness of the state-court decision. See <em>Pinholster </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>590 F.3d 651, 668 (CA9 2009) (en banc) (\u201cIf the evidence is admissible under <em>Michael Williams </em>or \u00a7 2254(e)(2), and if it does not render the petitioner\u2019s claims unexhausted . . . , then it is properly considered in evaluating whether the legal conclusion reached by the state habeas court was a reasonable application of Supreme Court law\u201d); accord, <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Mazzuca, </em>570 F.3d 490, 500 (CA2 2009); <em>Pecoraro </em>v. <em>Walls, </em>286 F.3d 439, 443 (CA7 2002); <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d 941, 952 (CA5 2001). This approach accommodates the competing goals, reflected in \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d) and 2254(e)(2), of according deference to reasonable state-court decisions and preserving the opportunity for diligent petitioners to present evidence to the federal court when they were unable to do so in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The majority charts a third, novel course that, so far as I am aware, no court of appeals has adopted: Section 2254(d)(1) continues to apply when a petitioner has additional evidence that he was unable to present to the state court, but the district court cannot consider that evidence in deciding whether the petitioner has satisfied \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The problem with this approach is its potential to bar federal habeas relief for diligent habeas petitioners who cannot present new evidence to a state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Consider, for example, a petitioner who diligently attempted in state court to develop the factual basis of a claim that prosecutors withheld exculpatory witness statements in violation of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). The state court denied relief on the ground that the withheld evidence then known did not rise to the level of materiality required under <em>Brady. </em>Before the time for filing a federal habeas petition has expired, however, a state court orders the State to disclose additional documents the petitioner had timely requested under the State\u2019s public records Act. The disclosed documents reveal that the State withheld other exculpatory witness statements, but state law would not permit</p>\n<p id=\"a8n-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 215]</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tioner to present the new evidence in a successive petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Under our precedent, if the petitioner had not presented his <em>Brady </em>claim to the state court at all, his claim would be deemed defaulted, and the petitioner could attempt to show cause and prejudice to overcome the default. See <em>Michael Williams, </em>529 U.S., at 444, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435; see also n. 1, <em>supra. </em>If, however, the new evidence merely bolsters a <em>Brady </em>claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, it is unclear how the petitioner can obtain federal habeas relief after today\u2019s holding. What may have been a reasonable decision on the state-court record may no longer be reasonable in light of the new evidence. See <em>Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 436, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995) (materiality of <em>Brady </em>evidence is viewed \u201ccollectively, not item by item\u201d). Because the state court adjudicated the petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim on the merits, \u00a7 2254(d)(1) would still apply. Yet, under the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), a federal court is now prohibited from considering the new evidence in determining the reasonableness of the state-court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) thus suggests the anomalous result that petitioners with new claims based on newly obtained evidence can obtain federal habeas relief if they can show cause and prejudice for their default but petitioners with newly obtained evidence supporting a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court cannot obtain federal ha-beas relief if they cannot first satisfy \u00a7 2254(d)(1) without the new evidence. That the majority\u2019s interpretation leads to this anomaly is good reason to conclude that its interpretation is wrong. See <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Tamayo-Reyes, </em>504 U.S. 1, 7-8, 112 S. Ct. 1715, 118 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1992) (\u201c[I]t is . . . irrational to distinguish between failing to properly assert a federal claim in state court and failing in state court to properly develop such a claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">[563 U.S. 216]</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The majority responds to this anomaly by suggesting that my hypothetical petitioner \u201cmay well [have] a new claim.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>at 185, n. 10, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 573. This suggestion is puzzling. New evidence does not usually give rise to a new claim; it merely provides additional proof of a claim already adjudicated on the merits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The majority presumably means to suggest that the petitioner might be able to obtain federal-court review of his new evidence if he can show cause and prejudice for his failure to present the \u201cnew\u201d claim to a state court. In that scenario, however, the federal court would review the purportedly \u201cnew\u201d claim <em>de novo. </em>The majority\u2019s approach thus threatens to replace deferential review of new evidence under \u00a7 2254(d)( 1) with <em>de novo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>review of new evidence in the form of \u201cnew\u201d claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because it is unlikely that Congress intended <em>de novo </em>review\u2014the result suggested by the majority\u2019s opinion\u2014it must have intended for district courts to consider newly discovered evidence in conducting the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The majority\u2019s reading of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) appears ultimately to rest on its understanding that state courts must have the first opportunity to adjudicate habeas petitioners\u2019 claims. See <em>ante, </em>at 182, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 570 (\u201cIt would be contrary to [AEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement] to allow a petitioner to overcome an adverse state-court decision with new evidence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed by that court in</p>\n<p id=\"Ah73\">[563 U.S. 217]</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">the first instance effectively <em>de </em>novo\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Justice Breyer takes the same position. See <em>ante, </em>at 206, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 585 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (AEDPA is designed \u201cto give the State a first opportunity to consider most matters\u201d). I fully agree that habeas petitioners must attempt to present evidence to state courts in the first instance, as does Justice Alito, see <em>ante, </em>at 203-204, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 584. Where I disagree with the majority is in my understanding that \u00a7 2254(e)(2) already accomplishes this result. By reading \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to do the work of \u00a7 2254(e)(2), the majority gives \u00a7 2254(e)(2) an unnaturally cramped reading. As a result, the majority either has foreclosed habeas relief for diligent petitioners who, through no fault of their own, were unable to present exculpatory evidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims or has created a new set of procedural complexities for the lower courts to navigate to ensure the availability of the Great Writ for diligent petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">These considerations lead me to agree with the Courts of Appeals that have concluded that a federal court should assess the reasonableness of a state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) in light of evidence properly admitted in a federal evidentiary hearing. There is nothing \u201cstrange\u201d about this approach. <em>Ante, </em>at 182, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 570. Under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), federal courts routinely engage in analysis that the state court itself might never have conducted or did not conduct. For example, when a state court summarily denies a claim without explanation, as the California Supreme Court did here, district courts must deny habeas relief pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d)(1) so long as \u201cthere is any reasonable argument\u201d supporting the denial of the petitioner\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"AIVK\">[563 U.S. 218]</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">claim. <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S., at 105, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. We likewise ask whether a state-court decision unreasonably applied clearly established federal law when the state court issued a reasoned decision but failed to cite federal law altogether. See <em>Early </em>v. <em>Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 8, 123 S. Ct. 362, 154 L. Ed. 2d 263 (2002) <em>(per </em>curiam). Determining whether a state court could reasonably have denied a petitioner relief in light of newly discovered evidence is not so different than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>determining whether there is any reasonable basis for a state court\u2019s unreasoned decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Admittedly, the text of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), standing alone, does not compel either reading of that provision. But construing \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to permit consideration of evidence properly introduced in federal court best accords with the text of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) and AE-DPA\u2019s structure as a whole. By interpreting \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to prevent <em>non-diligent </em>petitioners from gaming the system\u2014the very purpose of \u00a7 2254(e)(2)\u2014the majority potentially has put habeas relief out of reach for <em>diligent </em>petitioners with meritorious claims based on new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The majority claims that its holding is \u201cconsistent\u201d with our case law. <em>Ante, </em>at 182, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 570. Quite the opposite is true: Our cases reflect our previous understanding that evidence properly admitted pursuant to \u00a7 2254(e)(2) is relevant to the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In <em>Landrigan, </em>Justice Thomas, the author of today\u2019s opinion, confirmed this understanding of the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1) and 2254(e)(2). As noted above, we admonished district courts to consider whether a petitioner\u2019s allegations, if proved true, would satisfy \u00a7 2254(d) in determining whether to grant a hearing. After highlighting the deference owed to state courts under \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d) and 2254(e)(1), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201cIn deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing, a federal court must consider whether such a hearing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">[563 U.S. 219]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">could enable an applicant to prove the petition\u2019s factual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the applicant to federal habeas relief. Because the deferential standards prescribed by \u00a7 2254 control whether to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into account those standards in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.\u201d 550 U.S., at 474, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">By instructing district courts to consider the \u00a7 2254(d) standards in deciding whether to grant a hearing, we must have understood that the evidence admitted at a hearing could be considered in the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) analysis. See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9 (\u201cThe whole point of Landrigan\u2019s admonition that the court must decide whether to hold a hearing with an eye on \u00a7 2254(d)( 1) is that some proffers of evidence will not justify federal fact-finding in view of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), but that other proffers of proof will\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">In <em>Michael Williams, </em>the warden argued that \u00a7 2254(e)(2) bars an evi-dentiary hearing whenever a petitioner was unable to develop the factual record in state court, \u201cwhether or not through his own fault or neglect.\u201d 529 U.S., at 430, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435. Under the warden\u2019s argument, a petitioner who did not develop the record in state court, whatever the reason, would be barred from presenting evidence to the federal court. In rejecting that argument, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\u201cA prisoner who developed his claim in state court and can prove the state court\u2019s decision was \u2018contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u2019 is not barred from obtaining relief</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">[563 U.S. 220]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">by \u00a7 2254(d)(1). If the opening clause of \u00a7 2254(e)(2) covers a request for an evidentiary hearing on a claim which was pursued with diligence but remained undeveloped in state court because, for instance, the prosecution concealed the facts, a prisoner lacking clear and convincing evidence of innocence could be barred from a hearing on the claim <em>even if he could satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d Id., </em>at 434, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L.

This passage thus reflects our understanding that, in some circumstances, a petitioner might need an evidentiary hearing in federal court to prove the facts necessary to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d). To avoid foreclosing habeas relief for such petitioners, we concluded that \u00a7 2254(e)(2) could not bear the warden\u2019s \u201charsh reading,\u201d which essentially would have held petitioners strictly at fault for their inability to develop the facts in state court. <em>Ibid. </em>The majority today gives an equally \u201charsh reading\u201d to \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to achieve the result we rejected in <em>Michael Williams)</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">None of the other cases cited by the majority supports its result.

We proceeded to find that the evidence was not properly admitted under \u00a7 2254(e)(2) <em>before </em>concluding that the Court of Appeals had erred in its \u00a7 2254(d)(1) analysis. <em>Id., </em>at 653, 124 S. Ct. 2736, 159 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>2d 683; see also <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Richey, </em>546 U.S. 74, 79, 126 S. Ct. 602, 163 L. Ed. 2d 407 (2005) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">In sum, our cases reflect our recognition that it is sometimes appropriate to consider new evidence in deciding whether a petitioner can satisfy \u00a7 2254(d)(1). In reading our precedent to require the opposite conclusion, the majority disregards the concerns that motivated our decision in <em>Michael Williams: </em>Some petitioners, even if diligent, may be unable to develop the factual record in state court through no fault of their own. We should not interpret \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to foreclose these diligent petitioners from accessing the Great Writ when the state court will not consider the new evidence and could not reasonably have reached the same conclusion with the new evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">I also disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that Pinholster had satisfied \u00a7 2254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court record.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">[563 U.S. 222]</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">The majority omits critical details relating to the performance of Pinhol-ster\u2019s trial counsel, the mitigating evidence they failed to discover, and the history of these proceedings. I therefore highlight several aspects of the facts and history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the court instructed the jury to return six days later for the penalty phase. This prompted discussion at sidebar regarding whether the State had provided notice of its intent to offer aggravating evidence. Pinhol-ster\u2019s court-appointed attorney, Wilbur Dettmar, argued that the State should be precluded from offering aggravating evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">\u201cI am not presently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation. If I was going to proceed on mitigation, the people would have the right to rebuttal with or without notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-14\">\u201cI took the position, since the people had not given notice, <em>I had not prepared, any evidence by way of mitigation. </em>I would submit it on that basis.\u201d 52 Reporter\u2019s Tr. 7250 (hereinafter Tr.) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-15\">[563 U.S. 223]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">Undoubtedly anticipating that counsel might need additional time to prepare an adequate mitigation defense, the court asked Dettmar whether a continuance would be helpful in the event it ruled against him. He de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>dined the offer on the spot, stating: \u201cI think we would probably still go forward on Monday. Clearly the one person that comes to mind is the defendant\u2019s mother. How much beyond that I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think the pa[s-s]age of time would make a great deal of difference.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7257-7258. After hearing testimony, the court denied Pinholster\u2019s motion to preclude aggravating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">At the penalty phase, defense counsel called only one witness: Pinhol-ster\u2019s mother, Burnice Brashear. Brashear testified that Pinholster \u201cnever really wanted for anything at home too much\u201d and \u201chad everything normally materialwise that most people have.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7395. She said that Pinholster was \u201cdifferent\u201d from his siblings, whom she characterized as \u201cbasically very good children.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7401-7402. Pinholster, she said, had a \u201cfriendly\u201d relationship with his stepfather, although his stepfather \u201csometimes would lose his temper\u201d with Pinholster, who \u201chad a mind of his own.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7392-7393; see also <em>id., </em>at 7393 (stating that his stepfather was \u201cat times\u201d \u201cabusive or near abusive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Brashear provided brief testimony regarding Pinholster\u2019s childhood. She described two car accidents\u2014one when she ran over him in the driveway and one when he went through the windshield. <em>Id., </em>at 7389-7391. She stated that he started failing school in the first grade and that the school eventually \u201csent him to [an] educationally handicapped class.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7393-7394. When Pinholster was 10, a psychologist recommended placing him in a mental institution, but she \u201cdidn\u2019t think he was that far gone.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7395. A few years later, she testified, he spent six months in a state hospital for emotionally handicapped children. <em>Id., </em>at 7402.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">According to Brashear, Pinholster had suffered from epilepsy since age 18, when he was beaten in jail. <em>Id., </em>at 7397.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">[563 U.S. 224]</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">She said that her family doctor, Dr. Dubin, had given him medication to treat the epilepsy. <em>Ibid. </em>Bras-hear also suggested that Pinholster did not have long to live, stating that he had \u201ca chip in his head floating around\u201d and that \u201cthey don\u2019t think\u2014he won\u2019t be here very much longer anyway.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">In closing argument, the prosecutor ridiculed Brashear\u2019s testimony. See 53 <em>id., </em>at 7442 (\u201cShe said his stepfather disciplined him. So what? I am sure you have all disciplined your children. I was disciplined myself\u2019); <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cHe was run over by a car when he was three years old. That\u2019s very unfortunate. There is no evidence of any brain damage. A lot of children get dropped, fall from their cribs or whatever\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 7444-7445 (\u201cI submit to you that if this defendant truly had epilepsy, ... a doctor would have been brought in to tell you that. Medical records, something\u201d). The prosecutor also highlighted Brashear\u2019s testimony about Pinholster\u2019s stable home environment, arguing: \u201cHe came from a good home. You heard that he was not a deprived child. Had many things going for him, probably more than many children.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7442.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Notwithstanding the meager mitigation case presented by Pinholster\u2019s counsel, it took the jury two days to reach a decision to sentence Pinhol-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ster to death. His counsel later moved to modify the sentence to life imprisonment. In denying the motion, the trial judge stated: \u201cThe evidence which the defense offered concerning the defendant\u2019s extenuation was merely some testimony from his mother that was not persuasive. His mother did not, in the court\u2019s opinion, present any evidence which the court would find to be a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct. No witnesses supplied such evidence.\u201d 54 <em>id., </em>at 7514.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">[563 U.S. 225]</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, Pinholster filed a habeas petition in the California Supreme Court alleging, among other things, that his counsel had \u201cunreasonably failed to investigate, prepare and present available mitigating evidence during penalty phase.\u201d Record ER-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Pinholster\u2019s state-court petition included 121 exhibits. In a series of declarations, his trial attorney Harry Brainard (who had by then been disbarred) confirmed what Dettmar had forthrightly told the trial court: Brainard and Dettmar neither expected nor prepared to present mitigation evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>id., </em>at ER-333 (\u201cMr. Dettmar and I did not prepare a case in mitigation. We felt there would be no penalty phase hearing inasmuch as we did not receive written notice of evidence in aggravation pursuant to Penal Code \u00a7 190.3\u201d). Brainard further confirmed what was apparent from the mitigation case they eventually put on: They conducted virtually no mitigation investigation. See <em>id., </em>at ER-182 (\u201cI have no recollection of Mr. Dettmar having secured or reviewed any of Scott\u2019s medical records, nor did I see any of Scott\u2019s medical records. So far as I recollect, neither Mr. Dettmar nor myself interviewed any of Scott\u2019s previous medical providers\u201d); <em>id.., </em>at ER-183 (\u201cI do not recall interviewing or attempting to interview Scott\u2019s family members or any other persons regarding penalty phase testimony, except Mrs. Brashears [sicT); <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cI have no recollection of seeing or attempting to secure Scott\u2019s school records, juvenile records, medical records, or records of prior placements\u201d); <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cI have no recollection of interviewing or attempting to interview Scott\u2019s former school teachers, counselors, or juvenile officers\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">[563 U.S. 226]</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Statements by relatives (none of whom trial counsel had attempted to interview regarding Pinholster\u2019s background) and documentary evidence revealed that the picture of Pinholster\u2019s family life painted by his mother at trial was false. Pinholster was \u201craised in chaos and poverty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-312. A relative remembered seeing the children mix together flour and water in an attempt to get something to eat. Pinholster\u2019s stepfather beat him several times a week, including at least once with a two-by-four board. \u201cThere was so much violence in [the] home\u201d that Pinholster\u2019s brother \u201cdreaded coming home each day.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at ER-313. Pinholster\u2019s half sister was removed from the home as a result of a beating by his stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Documentary evidence showed, directly contrary to Brashear\u2019s trial testimony, that Pinholster\u2019s siblings had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>very troubled pasts. Pinholster\u2019s elder brother was arrested for armed burglary, robbery, and forcible rape of a 14-year-old with a deadly weapon. While in custody, he was diagnosed as \u201ccatatonic-like\u201d and \u201cacutely psychotic, probably suffering some type of schizophrenia.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-219, ER-224. He later committed suicide.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Pinholster\u2019s half sister, a recovering alcoholic, had been made a ward of the juvenile court for prostitution and forcible sexual battery on a 14-year-old.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Pinholster\u2019s petition and exhibits described a long history of emotional disturbance and neurological problems. A former schoolteacher stated that, as a child, Pinholster \u201cseemed incapable of relating either to his peers or to adults,\u201d that \u201c[i]t was even hard to maintain eye contact with him,\u201d and that \u201c[h]is hyperactivity was so extreme that [she] formed the opinion it probably had an organic base.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-231. School records revealed that he \u201ctalk[ed] to self continuously,\u201d had \u201cmany grimaces,\u201d fought in his sleep, and could</p>\n<p id=\"AmfD\">[563 U.S. 227]</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">\u201ccontrol self for only 1 hour per day.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-230, ER-233. He \u201cshow[ed] progressive deterioration each semester since Kindergarten.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-230. School officials recommended placement in a school for emotionally handicapped students and referral to a neurologist. At age 9, he had an abnormal EEG, revealing \u201can organic basis for his behavior.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-157, ER-234. Just months before the homicides, a doctor recommended placement in the Hope Psychiatric Institute, but this did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">This and other evidence attached to the petition was summarized in a declaration by Dr. George Woods. Dr. Woods opined that Pinholster \u201csuffer [ed] from severe and long standing seizure disorders,\u201d <em>id., </em>at ER-156, that his childhood head traumas \u201cmay have been the precipitating factors for [his] seizure disorder,\u201d <em>id., </em>at ER-157, and that he suffered from bipolar mood disorder. He pointed to trial testimony that immediately before the burglary on the night of the homicides, Pinholster announced that he \u201c \u2018ha[d] a message from God\u2019 \u201d\u2014which Dr. Woods believed to reflect \u201c[a]udi-tory hallucinations\u201d and \u201csevere psychosis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-169. He concluded that at the time of the homicides Pinholster \u201cwas suffering from bipolar mood disorder with psychotic ide-ation and was suffering a complex partial seizure.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-170. He also observed that Pinholster\u2019s \u201cgrossly dysfunctional family, the abuse he received as a child, his history of suffering from substantial seizure and mood disorders, his frequently untreated psychiatric and psychological disabilities and his educational handicaps were relevant circumstances which would extenuate the gravity of the crime.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-171.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">On the basis of Pinholster\u2019s submission, the California Supreme Court denied Pinholster\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Pinholster then filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court. He included an additional exhibit: a declaration by Dr. John Stalberg, a psychiatrist who had hastily examined</p>\n<p id=\"A5Jl\">[563 U.S. 228]</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">Pinholster and produced a two-page report in the middle of the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> After reviewing the new material collected by Pinholster\u2019s habeas counsel, Dr. Stalberg stated that the available evidence showed a familial history of \u201csevere psychiatric disorders,\u201d \u201ca history of seizure disorders of unknown etiology,\u201d \u201crepeated head traumas,\u201d \u201can abnormal EEG,\u201d and \u201cevidence of mental disturbance during Mr. Pinholster\u2019s childhood and some degree of brain damage.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-493. He also opined that \u201cthere [was] voluminous mitigating evidence which includes a childhood of physical abuse, emotional neglect, and a family history of mental illness and criminal behavior.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-494.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The District Court stayed the federal proceedings while Pinholster sought state-court review of claims the District Court deemed unex-hausted. Pinholster\u2019s second habeas submission to the California Supreme Court included Stalberg\u2019s declaration. That court summarily denied Pinhol-ster\u2019s petition on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Pinholster returned to Federal District Court and filed an amended petition. After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court concluded that Pin-holster had demonstrated deficient performance and prejudice under Strickland.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed. 590 F.3d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">[563 U.S. 229]</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">As the majority notes, Pinholster\u2019s claim arises under <em>Strickland, </em>v. <em>Washington. </em>\u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness [under Strickland] must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d 466 U.S., at 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. To satisfy this benchmark, a defendant must show both that \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">When \u00a7 2254(d)(1) applies, the question is whether \u201c \u2018fairminded jurists could disagree\u2019 on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S., at 101, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (quoting <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (2004)). When the state court rejected a <em>Strickland </em>claim on the pleadings assuming the allegations to be true, as here, see <em>ante, </em>at 188, n. 12, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 574, the federal court must ask whether \u201cthere is any reasonable argument\u201d supporting the state court\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner\u2019s allegations did not state a claim, <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S., at 105, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. This standard is \u201cdifficult,\u201d but not impossible, \u201cto meet.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 102, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. This case is one in which fairminded jurists could not disagree that the state court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Under <em>Strickland, </em>\u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d measured according to \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d 466 U.S., at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. We \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. When \u00a7 2254(d) applies, federal-court review is \u201c \u2018doubly\u2019 \u201d deferential. <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S., at 105, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (quoting <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 123, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2009)). In the present AEDPA posture, \u201c[t]he question is whether there is any reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"ARqG\">[563 U.S. 230]</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S., at 105, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. Here, there is none.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The majority surmises that counsel decided on a strategy \u201cto get the prosecution\u2019s aggravation witnesses excluded for lack of notice, and if that failed, to put on Pinholster\u2019s mother.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 191, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 576. This is the sort of \u201c <em>\u2018post hoc </em>rationalization\u2019 for counsel\u2019s decisionmaking that contradicts the available evidence of counsel\u2019s actions\u201d that courts cannot indulge. <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S., at 109, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (quoting <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 526-527, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003)). The majority\u2019s explanation for counsel\u2019s conduct contradicts the best available evidence of counsel\u2019s actions: Dettmar\u2019s frank, contemporaneous statement to the trial judge that he \u201chad not prepared any evidence by way of mitigation.\u201d 52 Tr. 7250. The majority\u2019s conjecture that counsel had in fact prepared a mitigation defense, based primarily on isolated entries in counsel\u2019s billing records, requires it to assume that Dettmar was lying to the trial judge.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">In any event, even if Pinholster\u2019s counsel had a strategic reason for their actions, that would not automatically render their actions reasonable. For example, had counsel decided their best option was to move to exclude the aggravating</p>\n<p id=\"AN65\">[563 U.S. 231]</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">evidence, it would have been unreasonable to forgo a mitigation investigation on the hope that the motion would be granted. With a client\u2019s life at stake, it would \u201cflou[t] prudence,\u201d <em>Rompilla </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>545 U.S. 374, 389, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2005), for an attorney to rely on the possibility that the court might preclude aggravating evidence pursuant to a \u201clegal technicality\u201d without any backup plan in place in case the court denied the motion, <em>ante, </em>at 191, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 576. No reasonable attorney would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>pursue such a risky strategy. I do not understand the majority to suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Instead, I understand the majority\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable to rest on its belief that they did have a backup plan: a family-sympathy defense. In reaching this conclusion, the majority commits the same <em>Strickland </em>error that we corrected, applying \u00a7 2254(d)(1), in <em>Wiggins: </em>It holds a purportedly \u201ctactical judgment\u201d to be reasonable without assessing \u201cthe adequacy of the investigado[n] supporting [that] judgment,\u201d 539 U.S., at 521, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471. As we stated in <em>Strickland:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">\u201c[Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d 466 U.S., at 690-691, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We have repeatedly applied this principle since <em>Strickland. See Sears </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>561 U.S. 945, 953, 130 S. Ct. 3259, 177 L.

In other cases, however, <em>Strickland </em>requires further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><em>Wiggins </em>is illustrative of the competence we have required of counsel in a capital case. There, counsel\u2019s investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">[563 U.S. 233]</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">was limited to three sources: psychological testing, a presentencing report, and Baltimore City Department of Social Services records. 539 U.S., at 523-524, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471. The records revealed that the petitioner\u2019s mother was an alcoholic, that he displayed emotional difficulties in foster care, that he was frequently absent from school, and that on one occasion, his mother left him alone for days without food. <em>Id., </em>at 525, 123 S.

In these circumstances, we concluded, \u201cany reasonably competent attorney would have realized that pursuing these leads was necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, we held, the state court\u2019s assumption that counsel\u2019s investigation was adequate was an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland. </em>539 U.S., at 528, 123 S.

Yet counsel made no effort to obtain the readily available evidence suggested by the information they learned, such as Pinholster\u2019s schooling or medical records, or to contact Pinholster\u2019s school authorities. They did not contact Dr. Dubin or the many other healthcare providers who had treated Pinholster.

Ed. 2d, at 577, did not justify their minimal investigation. It is true that Pinholster was \u201can unsympathetic client.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But this fact compounds, rather than excuses, counsel\u2019s deficiency in ignoring the glaring avenues of investigation that could explain why Pinholster was the way he was. See <em>Sears, </em>561 U.S., at 951, 130 S. Ct. 3259, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1025 (\u201cThis evidence might not have made Sears any more likable to the jury, but it might well have helped the jury understand Sears, and his horrendous acts\u2014especially in light of his purportedly stable upbringing\u201d). Nor can Dr. Stalberg\u2019s two-page report, which was based on a very limited record and focused primarily on Pinholster\u2019s mental state at the time of the homicides, excuse counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the broader range of potential mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\u201cThe record of the actual sentencing proceedings underscores the unreasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct by suggesting</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">[563 U.S. 235]</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">that their failure to investigate thoroughly resulted from inattention, not reasoned strategic judgment.\u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S., at 526, 123 S.

The mitigation case that counsel eventually put on can be described, at best, as \u201chalfhearted.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Counsel made no effort to bolster Brashear\u2019s self-interested testimony with school or medical records, as the prosecutor effectively emphasized in closing argument. And because they did not pursue obvious leads, they failed to recognize that Brashear\u2019s testimony painting Pinholster as the bad apple in a normal, nondeprived family was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">In denying Pinholster\u2019s claim, the California Supreme Court necessarily overlooked <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>clearly established admonition that \u201cstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations.\u201d 466 U.S., at 690-691, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. As in <em>Wiggins, </em>in light of the information available to Pinholster\u2019s counsel, it is plain that \u201creasonable professional judgments\u201d could not have supported their woefully inadequate investigation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> 466 U.S., at 691, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the California Supreme Court could not reasonably have concluded that Pinholster had failed to allege that his counsel\u2019s investigation was inadequate under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">[563 U.S. 236]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The majority also concludes that the California Supreme Court could reasonably have concluded that Pin-holster did not state a claim of prejudice. This conclusion, in light of the overwhelming mitigating evidence that was not before the jury, is wrong. To establish prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 694, 104 S.

When a habeas petitioner challenges a death sentence, \u201cthe question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant <em>death.\u201dId., </em>at 695, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. This inquiry requires evaluating \u201cthe totality of the available mitigation evidence\u2014both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding\u2014in reweighing it against the evidence in aggravation.\u201d <em>Terry Williams, </em>529 U.S., at 397-398, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389. The ultimate question in this case is whether, taking into account all the mitigating and aggravating evidence, \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S., at 537, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471; see Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 190.4(b) (West 2008) (requiring a unanimous jury verdict to impose a death sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Like the majority, I first consider the aggravating and mitigating evidence presented at trial. By virtue of its verdict in the guilt phase, the jury had already concluded that Pinhol-ster had stabbed and killed the victims. As the majority states, the jury saw Pinholster \u201crevel\u201d in his history of burglaries during the guilt phase. <em>Ante, </em>at 198, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 580. The jury heard evidence of Pinhol-ster\u2019s violent tendencies: He had kid-naped someone with a knife, cut a person in the arm with a razor, and had a history of hitting and kicking people. He threatened</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">[563 U.S. 237]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">to kill the State\u2019s lead witness. And he had an extensive disciplinary record in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">Brashear offered brief testimony that was apparently intended to be mitigating. See <em>supra, </em>at 224, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 596-597; see also <em>ante, </em>at 199-200, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 580-581.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, as the prosecutor argued, Brashear was not a neutral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>witness. See 53 Tr. 7441 (\u201cA mother clearly loves her son, ladies and gentlemen. Clearly not the most unbiased witness in the world\u201d). Notwithstanding Brashear\u2019s obvious self-interest, counsel failed to offer readily available, objective evidence that would have substantiated and expanded on her testimony. Their failure to do so allowed the prosecutor to belittle her testimony in closing argument. See <em>supra, </em>at 224, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 596-597. And Brashear\u2019s statement that Pinholster would not be alive much longer because he had \u201ca chip in his head floating around,\u201d 52 Tr. 7397, could only have undermined her credibility, as the prosecutor urged, see 53 <em>id., </em>at 7447 (\u201cDoes she want you to believe sometime before he got to county jail some doctor looked in a crystal ball and said, Tn three years you are going to die\u2019? That\u2019s ridiculous\u201d). The trial judge was thoroughly unimpressed with Brashear\u2019s testimony. See <em>supra, </em>at 224, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">[563 U.S. 238]</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Moreover, the evidence presented in Pinholster\u2019s state-court petition revealed that Brashear distorted facts in her testimony in ways that undermined Pinholster\u2019s mitigation case. As in <em>Sears, </em>561 U.S., at 947-948, 130 S. Ct. 3259, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1025, the prosecutor used Brashear\u2019s testimony that Pinholster came from a good family against him. See 53 Tr. 7442.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In sum, counsel presented little in the way of mitigating evidence, and the prosecutor effectively used their halfhearted attempt to present a mitigation case to advocate for the death penalty. The jury nonetheless took two days to reach a decision to impose a death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The additional mitigating evidence presented to the California Supreme Court \u201cadds up to a mitigation case that bears no relation\u201d to Brashear\u2019s unsubstantiated testimony. <em>Rompilla, </em>545 U.S., at 393, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Assuming the evidence presented to the California Supreme Court to be true, as that court was required to do, the new mitigating evidence presented to that court would have shown that Pinholster was raised in \u201cchaos and poverty.\u201d Record ER-312. The family home was filled with violence. Pinholster\u2019s siblings had extremely troubled pasts. There was substantial evidence of \u201cmental disturbance during Mr. Pinholster\u2019s childhood and some degree of brain damage.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-493.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Dr. Woods concluded that Pinhol-ster\u2019s aggressive conduct resulted from bipolar mood disorder. Just months before the murders, a doctor had recommended that Pinholster be sent to a psychiatric institute. Dr. Woods also explained that Pinhol-ster\u2019s bizarre behavior before the murders reflected \u201c[a]uditory hallucinations\u201d and \u201csevere psychosis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-169. The available records confirmed that Pinholster suffered from longstanding seizure disorders, which may have been caused by his childhood head injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">[563 U.S. 239]</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">On this record, I do not see how it can be said that \u201c [t]he \u2018new\u2019 evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 200, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 582; see <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 298-299, 111 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991) (evidence is not \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d if it corroborates other evidence that is \u201cunbelievable\u201d on its own). Bras-hear\u2019s self-interested testimony was not confirmed with objective evidence, as the prosecutor highlighted. The new evidence would have \u201cdestroyed the [relatively] benign conception of [Pinholster\u2019s] upbringing\u201d presented by his mother. <em>Rompilla, </em>545 U.S., at 391, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360. The jury heard no testimony at all that Pinholster likely suffered from brain damage or bipolar mood disorder, and counsel offered no evidence to help the jury understand the likely effect of Pinholster\u2019s head injuries or his bizarre behavior on the night of the homicides. The jury heard no testimony recounting the substantial evidence of Pinholster\u2019s likely neurological problems. And it heard no medical evidence that Pinholster suffered from epilepsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The majority responds that \u201cmuch\u201d of Pinholster\u2019s new mitigating evidence \u201cis of questionable mitigating value.\u201d Ante, at 201, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 582. By presenting psychiatric testimony, it contends, \u201cPinholster would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state expert.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But, because the California Supreme Court denied Pin-holster\u2019s petition on the pleadings, it had no reason to know what a state expert might have said. Moreover, given the record evidence, it is reasonably probable that at least one juror would have credited his expert. In any event, even if a rebuttal expert testified that Pinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder, this would hardly have come as a surprise to the jury. <em>See ante, </em>at 194, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 578 (describing Pinholster as a \u201cpsychotic client whose performance at trial hardly endeared him to the jury\u201d). It is for this reason that it was especially important for counsel to present the available evidence to help the jury understand Pinholster. See <em>Sears, </em>561 U.S., at 951, 130 S. Ct. 3259, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">[563 U.S. 240]</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Had counsel conducted an adequate investigation, the judge and jury would have heard credible evidence showing that Pinholster\u2019s criminal acts and aggressive tendencies were \u201cattributable to a disadvantaged background, or to emotional and mental problems.\u201d <em>Penry, </em>492 U.S., at 319, 109 S. Ct. 2934, 106 L. Ed. 2d 2656 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Applying <em>Strickland, </em>we have repeatedly found \u201ca reasonable probability,\u201d 466 U.S., at 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, that the sentencer would have reached a different result had counsel presented similar evidence. See, <em>e.g., Porter, </em>558 U.S., at 41-42, 130 S. Ct. 447, 175 L. Ed. 2d 398 (evidence of the defendant\u2019s childhood history of physical abuse, brain abnormality, limited schooling, and heroic military service); <em>Rompilla, </em>545 U.S., at 392, 125 S.

However, it criticizes the Court of Appeals for relying on <em>Rompilla </em>and <em>Terry Williams </em>on the ground that we reviewed the prejudice question <em>de novo </em>in those cases. See <em>ante, </em>at 202, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 583. I do not read <em>Terry Williams </em>to review the prejudice question <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>More fundamentally, however, I cannot agree with the premise that \u201c[t]hose cases . . . offer no guidance with respect to whether a state</p>\n<p id=\"A7hPZ\">[563 U.S. 241]</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">court has unreasonably determined that prejudice is lacking.\u201d Ante, at 202, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 583 (emphasis deleted). In each of these cases, we did not purport to create new law; we simply applied the same clearly established precedent, <em>Strickland, </em>to a different set of facts. Because these cases illuminate the kinds of mitigation evidence that suffice to establish prejudice under <em>Strickland, </em>they provide useful, but not dispositive, guidance for courts to consider when determining whether a state court has unreasonably applied <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">In many cases, a state court presented with additional mitigation evidence will reasonably conclude that there is no \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. This is not such a case. Admittedly, Pinholster unjustifiably stabbed and killed two people, and his history of violent outbursts and burglaries surely did not endear him to the jury. But the homicides did not appear premeditated. And the State\u2019s aggravation case was no stronger than in <em>Rompilla </em>and <em>Terry Williams. </em>See 545 U.S., at 378, 383, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360 (the defendant committed murder by torture and had a significant history of violent felonies, including a rape); 529 U.S., at 418, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (the defendant had a lifetime of crime, and after the murder he \u201csavagely beat an elderly woman,\u201d set a home on fire, and stabbed a man (internal quotation marks omitted)). Even on the trial record, it took the jury two days to decide on a penalty. The contrast between the \u201cnot persuasive\u201d mitigation case put on by Pinholster\u2019s counsel, 54 Tr. 7514, and the substantial mitigation evidence at their fingertips was stark. Given these considerations, it is not a foregone conclusion, as the majority deems it, that a juror familiar with his troubled background and psychiatric issues would have reached the same conclusion regarding Pinholster\u2019s culpability. Fairminded jurists could not doubt that, on the record before the California Supreme Court, \u201cthere [was] a reasonable probability that at</p>\n<p id=\"alw-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 242]</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">least one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S., at 537, 123 S.

The additional evidence presented in the federal evidentiary hearing only confirms that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">At the hearing, Pinholster offered many of the same documents that were before the state habeas court. He also offered his trial attorneys\u2019 billing records, which were before the state habeas court as part of the trial record. Of the seven lay witnesses who testified at the hearing, six had previously executed declarations in support of Pinholster\u2019s state-court petition. (The seventh, Pinholster\u2019s uncle, provided testimony cumulative of other testimony.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Two experts testified on Pinhol-ster\u2019s behalf; neither had presented declarations to the state habeas court. The first was Dr. Donald Olson, assistant professor of neurology and neurological sciences and director of the Pediatric Epilepsy Program at Stanford University Medical Center. It appears that Pinholster retained Dr. Olson to rebut the testimony of the expert disclosed by the State in the federal proceeding. See Decl. of Michael D. Abzug in Support of Stipulated <em>Ex Parte </em>Application To Continue Evidentiary Hearing and Discovery Cut-Off and To Substitute Counsel in <em>Pinholster </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>No. CV 95-6240-GLT (CD Cal.), p. 2.

He concluded that it was reasonably probable that Pinholster had suffered from partial</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">[563 U.S. 243]</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">epilepsy since at least 1968 and had suffered from brain injury since at least 1964. <em>Id., </em>at ER-701.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Pinholster\u2019s second expert was Dr. Sophia Vinogradov, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Vino-gradov\u2019s testimony was based on essentially the same facts as Dr. Woods\u2019 and Dr. Stalberg\u2019s state-court declarations. She highlighted Pinholster\u2019s childhood head traumas, history of epilepsy, abusive and neglected upbringing, history of substance abuse, and bizarre behavior on the night of the homicides. She opined that his aggressive behavior resulted from childhood head traumas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">\u201cAll data indicates that there were severe effects of the two serious head injuries sustained at age 2 and age 3, with evidence for behavioral changes related to dysfunction of frontal cortex: severe attentional and learning problems in childhood, hyperactivity, aggressivity, impul-sivity, social-emotional impairment, seizure disorder, and explosive dyscontrol.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-731.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">She also opined that, right before the homicides, Pinholster was in an \u201capparently hallucinatory state [that] was likely the result of his intoxication with multiple <em>substances.\u201dId., </em>at ER-707.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">The State presented two experts: Dr. Stalberg, the psychiatrist who had examined Pinholster in the middle of trial,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and Dr. David Rudnick. Although Dr. Stalberg maintained</p>\n<p id=\"AqdH\">[563 U.S. 244]</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Pinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder, which was his original diagnosis in the middle of trial, he again emphasized that there was \u201cvoluminous\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d mitigation evidence that had not previously been made available to him or presented to the jury. <em>Id., </em>at ER-926, ER-953. He stated that conversations with Pinholster\u2019s family revealed that he and his siblings were \u201craised like animals, wild animals,\u201d <em>id., </em>at ER-948, and he opined that Pinholster\u2019s upbringing was a risk factor for antisocial personality disorder. See <em>ibid. </em>(Pinholster\u2019s upbringing \u201cwould speak volumes, looking at it from a mitigation point of view\u201d). And he agreed that the mitigation evidence presented at trial was \u201cprofoundly misleading.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at ER-966. Dr. Rud-nick testified that Pinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The State also introduced into evidence the 1978 probation report that Pinholster\u2019s counsel had in their possession at the time of his trial. The report demonstrated that counsel were aware that Pinholster was in classes for educationally handicapped children, that he was committed to a state hospital for emotionally handicapped children, and that he suffered two \u201csevere head injuries.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at SER-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Much of the evidence presented at the federal hearing was duplicative of the evidence submitted to the California Supreme Court. The additional evidence presented at the hearing only confirmed that the California Supreme Court could not reasonably have rejected Pinholster\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">[563 U.S. 245]</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">For example, the probation report presented by the State confirmed that counsel had in their possession information that would have led any reasonable attorney \u201cto investigate further.\u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S., at 527, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471. Counsel nevertheless took no action to investigate these leads.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Pinholster\u2019s experts opined that his childhood head traumas likely resulted in brain injury and conferred a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>risk of epilepsy. Although the State presented testimony that Pinholster had antisocial personality disorder, it was not clear error for the District Court to conclude that jurors could have credited Pinholster\u2019s experts. Even the State\u2019s own expert, Dr. Stal-berg, testified to the \u201cvoluminous\u201d mitigation evidence in Pinholster\u2019s case. Record ER-926.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">In sum, the evidence confirmed what was already apparent from the state-court record: Pinholster\u2019s counsel failed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation, and there was a reasonable probability that at least one juror confronted with the \u201cvoluminous\u201d mitigating evidence counsel should have discovered would have voted to spare Pinholster\u2019s life. <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, whether on the basis of the state- or federal-court record, the courts below correctly concluded that Pinholster had shown that the California Supreme</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">[563 U.S. 246]</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Court\u2019s decision reflected an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAVdy\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"40\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQMAAAAnAQAAAAAj4BDyAAAAlUlEQVR4nGP8z4AfPGQioICBYVQFGSo+IPMxOUwMDDeQBTE51HHHFw4FBBcLh4nhHZIYNg4TAz9yGsLCYWHgKUhACGLj/P/f/B8JYHAeMDEwuCC7HAvn/z9tJF2YnAdMDL8cHRC6sHH+f3gnj9CGyXnAxPCREclmbJz/v8/vR2jD5DxgYmD5gWQ1Fg414pZxNGdTXQUAPRacE+qr4DYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"259\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">I cannot agree with either aspect of the Court\u2019s ruling. I fear the consequences of the Court\u2019s novel interpretation of \u00a7 2254(d)( 1) for diligent state habeas petitioners with compelling evidence supporting their claims who were unable, through no fault of their own, to present that evidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims. And the Court\u2019s conclusion that the California Supreme Court reasonably denied Pinholster\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim overlooks counsel\u2019s failure to investigate obvious avenues of mitigation and the contrast between the woefully inadequate mitigation case they presented and the evidence they should and would have discovered.

The majority claims that <em>Michael Williams </em>supports its reading of \u00a7 2254(d)( 1). With respect to one claim asserted by the petitioner, we observed that \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals rejected this claim on the merits under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), so it is unnecessary to reach the question whether \u00a7 2254(e)(2) would permit a hearing on the claim.\u201d 529 U.S., at 444, 120 S.

That statement merely reflects the fact that the Court of Appeals had rejected that claim under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) without considering whether the petitioner was entitled to a hearing because the petitioner had not requested a hearing on that claim.

This argument is based on <em>amicus' </em>understanding that the California Supreme Court rejected the second petition as successive and, alternatively, on the merits. The State has not argued, however, that the second ruling rests on a procedural ground. See <em>ante, </em>at 178, n. 2, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 568. When a state court denies two petitions on the merits and the difference between the petitions is that the second petition contains additional evidence supporting the petitioner\u2019s claim, I see no reason why the petitioner must independently show that the first decision was unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b694-12\">.

The majority misleadingly cites entries showing that counsel were preparing Brashear\u2019s penalty phase testimony <em>after </em>counsel learned that the State intended to present aggravation evidence.

The State argues that the District Court was not entitled to rely on the evidence adduced at the hearing because Pinholster was not diligent in developing his claims in state court and the hearing was therefore barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). This argument is somewhat imprecise. Pinholster\u2019s allegations in his amended federal petition were \u201cidentical\u201d to the allegations he presented to the California Supreme Court, <em>ante, </em>at 179, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 568, and he diligently requested a hearing in state court. The State presumably means to argue that Pinholster\u2019s new expert testimony changed \u201cthe factual basis\u201d of his claim such that, by the time of the evidentiary hearing, he no longer satisfied \u00a7 2254(e)(2). However, at oral argument, the State suggested that Pinholster was presenting an altogether new claim in the federal court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. If that is the case, \u00a7 2254(d)(1) does not apply at all, and the State should be arguing lack of exhaustion or procedural default. I do not understand Pinholster to have presented a new claim to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">In any event, Pinholster satisfied \u00a7 2254(e)(2) in this case. He made \u201ca reasonable attempt, in light of the information available at the time, to investigate and pursue claims in state court.\u201d <em>Michael Williams, </em>529 U.S., at 435, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435. His experts relied on the very same facts and evidence. I cannot read \u00a7 2254(e)(2) to impose a strict requirement that petitioners must use the same experts they presented to the state court. This rule would result in numerous practical problems, for examples in the case of the unanticipated death of an expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">. The State\u2019s challenge in this Court is limited to the questions whether the Federal District Court was entitled to consider the additional evidence in the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) analysis and whether Pinholster satisfied \u00a7 2254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court record. It has not challenged the District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Pinholster had proved that he was \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u2019\u2019 \u00a7 2254(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
