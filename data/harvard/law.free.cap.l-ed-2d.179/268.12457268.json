This case concerns the scope of Exemption 2, which protects from disclosure material that is \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(2). Respondent Department of the Navy (Navy or Government) invoked Exemption 2 to deny</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">[562 U.S. 565]</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">a FOIA request for data and maps used to help store explosives at a naval base in Washington State. We hold that Exemption 2 does not stretch so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b372-19\">Congress enacted FOIA to overhaul the public-disclosure section of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (1964 ed.). That section of the APA \u201cwas plagued with vague phrases\u201d and gradually became more \u201ca withholding statute than a disclosure statute.\u201d <em>EPA </em>v. <em>Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 79, 93 S. Ct. 827, 35 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1973). Congress intended FOIA to \u201cpermit access to official information long shielded unnecessarily from public view.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 80, 93 S. Ct. 827, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>35 L. Ed. 2d 119.  FOIA thus mandates that an agency disclose records on request, unless they fall within one of nine exemptions. These exemptions are \u201cexplicitly made exclusive,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 79, 93 S. Ct. 827, 35 L. Ed. 2d 119, and must be \u201cnarrowly construed,\u201d <em>FBI </em>v. <em>Abramson, </em>456 U.S. 615, 630, 102 S. Ct. 2054, 72 L. Ed. 2d 376 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">At issue here is  Exemption 2, which shields from compelled disclosure documents \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(2). Congress enacted Exemption 2 to replace the APA\u2019s exemption for \u201cany matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (1964 ed.). Believing that the \u201csweep\u201d of the phrase \u201cinternal management\u201d had led to excessive withholding, Congress drafted Exemption 2 \u201cto have a narrower reach.\u201d <em>Department of Air Force </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 362-363, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We considered the extent of that reach in <em>Department of Air Force </em>v. <em>Rose. </em>There, we rejected the Government\u2019s invocation of Exemption 2 to withhold case summaries of honor and ethics hearings at the United States Air Force Academy.  The exemption, we suggested, primarily targets material concerning employee relations or human resources: \u201c \u2018use of parking facilities or regulations of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 363, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1965)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">[562 U.S. 566]</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">(hereinafter S. Rep.)); see <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S., at 367, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11. \u201c[T]he general thrust\u201d of Exemption 2, we explained, \u201cis simply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and maintaining [such information] for public inspection.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 369, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11. We concluded that the case summaries did not fall within the exemption because they \u201cd[id] not concern only routine matters\u201d of \u201cmerely internal significance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 370, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11. But we stated a possible caveat to our interpretation of Exemption 2: That understanding of the provision\u2019s coverage governed, we wrote, \u201cat least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 369, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">In <em>Crooker </em>v. <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>670 F.2d 1051 (1981) (en banc), the D. C. Circuit converted this caveat into a new definition of Exemption 2\u2019s scope. <em>Crooker </em>approved the use of Exemption 2 to shield a manual designed to train Government agents in law enforcement surveillance techniques. The D. C. Circuit noted that it previously had understood Exemption 2 to \u201crefe[r] only to \u2018pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking[,] etc.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1056 (quoting <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Department of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753, 763 (1978)). But the court now thought Exemption 2 should also cover any \u201cpredominantly internal\u201d materials,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Crooker, </em>670 F.2d, at 1056-1057, whose disclosure would \u201csignificantly ris [k] circumvention of agency regulations or statutes,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1074. This construction of Exemption 2, the court reasoned, flowed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>FOIA\u2019s \u201coverall design,\u201d its legislative history, \u201cand even common sense,\u201d because Congress could not have meant to \u201cenac[t] a statute</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">[562 U.S. 567]</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">whose provisions undermined . . . the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In the ensuing years, three Courts of Appeals adopted the D. C. Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Exemption 2. See 575 F.3d 959, 965 (CA9 2009) (case below); <em>Massey </em>v. <em>FBI, </em>3 F.3d 620, 622 (CA2 1993); <em>Kaganove </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>856 F.2d 884, 889 (CA7 1988).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And that interpretation spawned a new terminology: Courts applying the <em>Crooker </em>approach now refer to the \u201cLow 2\u201d exemption when discussing materials concerning human resources and employee relations, and to the \u201cHigh 2\u201d exemption when assessing records whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law. See, <em>e.g., </em>575 F.3d, at 963; <em>Schiller </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>964 F.2d 1205, 1208 (CADC 1992). Congress, as well, took notice of the D. C. Circuit\u2019s decision, borrowing language from <em>Crooker </em>to amend Exemption 7(E) when next enacting revisions to FOIA. The amended version of Exemption 7(E) shields certain \u201crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d if their disclosure \u201ccould reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E); see Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, \u00a7 1802(a), 100 Stat. 3207-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The FOIA request at issue here arises from the Navy\u2019s operations at Naval Magazine Indian Island, a base in Puget</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">[562 U.S. 568]</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Sound, Washington. The Navy keeps weapons, ammunition, and explosives on the island. To aid in the storage and transport of these munitions, the Navy uses data known as Explosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information. 575 F.3d, at 962. ESQD information prescribes \u201cminimum separation distances\u201d for explosives and helps the Navy design and construct storage facilities to prevent chain reactions in case of detonation. <em>Ibid. </em>The ESQD calculations are often incorporated into specialized maps depicting the effects of hypothetical explosions. See, <em>e.g., </em>App. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">In 2003 and 2004, petitioner Glen Milner, a Puget Sound resident, submitted FOIA requests for all ESQD information relating to Indian Island. 575 F.3d, at 962. The Navy refused to release the data, stating that disclosure would threaten the security of the base and surrounding community. In support of its decision to withhold the records, the Navy invoked Exemption 2. <em>Ibid..</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">The District Court granted summary judgment to the Navy, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the High 2 interpretation developed in <em>Crooker. </em>575 F.3d, at 963. The Court of Appeals explained that the ESQD information \u201cis predominantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>used for the internal purpose of instructing agency personnel on how to do their jobs.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 968. And disclosure of the material, the court determined, \u201cwould risk circumvention of the law\u201d by \u201cpoint[ing] out the best targets for those bent on wreaking havoc\u201d\u2014for example, \u201c[a] terrorist who wished to hit the most damaging target.\u201d <em>Id.,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">[562 U.S. 569]</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">at 971. The ESQD information, the court concluded, therefore qualified for a High 2 exemption. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We granted certiorari in light of the Circuit split respecting Exemption 2\u2019s meaning, 561 U.S. 1024, 130 S. Ct. 3505, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (2010), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Our consideration of Exemption 2\u2019s scope starts with its text. See, <em>e.g., Park \u2019N Fly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc., </em>469 U.S. 189, 194, 105 S. Ct. 658, 83 L. Ed. 2d 582 (1985) (\u201cStatutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose\u201d). Judicial decisions since FOIA\u2019s enactment have analyzed and reanalyzed the meaning of the exemption. But comparatively little attention has focused on the provision\u2019s 12 simple words: \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The key word in that dozen\u2014the one that most clearly marks the provision\u2019s boundaries\u2014is \u201cpersonnel.\u201d When used as an adjective, as it is here to modify \u201crules and practices,\u201d that term refers to human resources matters. \u201cPersonnel,\u201d in this common parlance, means \u201cthe selection, placement, and training of employees and . . . the formulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or involving] employees or their representatives.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1687 (1966) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s). So, for example, a \u201cpersonnel department\u201d is \u201cthe department of a business firm that deals with problems affecting the employees of the firm and that usually interviews applicants for jobs.\u201d Random House Dictionary 1075 (1966) (hereinafter Random House). \u201cPersonnel management\u201d is similarly \u201cthe phase of management concerned with the engagement and effective utilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency of human resources.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1687. And a \u201cpersonnel agency\u201d is \u201can agency for placing employable persons in jobs; employment agency.\u201d Random House 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">[562 U.S. 570]</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">FOIA itself provides an additional example in Exemption 6. See <em>Ratzlaf </em>v. <em>United States, </em>510 U.S. 135, 143, 114 S. Ct. 655, 126 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1994) (  \u201cA term appearing in several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each time it appears\u201d). That  exemption, just a few short paragraphs down from Exemption 2, protects from disclosure \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(6). Here too, the statute uses the term \u201cpersonnel\u201d as a modifier meaning \u201chuman resources.\u201d See Tr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>of Oral Arg. 32 (\u201c[The Court:] It\u2019s [an] H. R. file, right? [The Government:] That\u2019s generally true\u201d). As we recognized in <em>Rose, </em>\u201cthe common and congressional meaning of . . . \u2018personnel file\u2019 \u201d is the file \u201cshowing, for example, where [an employee] was born, the names of his parents, where he has lived from time to time, his . . . school records, results of examinations, [and] evaluations of his work performance.\u201d 425 U.S., at 377, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11. It is the file typically maintained in the human resources office\u2014otherwise known (to recall an example offered above) as the \u201cpersonnel department.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Exemption 2 uses \u201cpersonnel\u201d in the exact same way.  An agency\u2019s \u201cpersonnel rules and practices\u201d are its rules and practices dealing with employee relations or human resources. The D. C. Circuit, in a <em>pre-Crooker </em>decision, gave as examples \u201cmatters relating to pay, pensions, vacations, hours of work, lunch hours, parking, etc.\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>591 F.2d, at 763; see <em>supra, </em>at 566, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 275. That \u201cetc.\u201d is important; we doubt any court could know enough about the Federal Government\u2019s operations to formulate a comprehensive list. But all the rules and practices referenced in Exemption 2 share a critical feature: They concern the conditions of employment in federal agencies\u2014 such matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Courts in</p>\n<p id=\"ayu-dedup-1\">[562 U.S. 571]</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">practice have had little difficulty identifying the records that qualify for withholding under this reading: They are what now commonly fall within the Low 2 exemption. Our construction of the statutory language simply makes clear that Low 2 is all of 2 (and that High 2 is not 2 at all, see <em>infra, </em>at 573-577, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 279-282).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The statute\u2019s purpose reinforces this understanding of the exemption. We have often noted \u201cthe Act\u2019s goal of broad disclosure\u201d and insisted that the exemptions be \u201cgiven a narrow compass.\u201d <em>Department of Justice </em>v. <em>Tax Analysts, </em>492 U.S. 136, 151, 109 S. Ct. 2841, 106 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1989); see <em>Department of Interior </em>v. <em>Klamath Water Users Protective Assn., </em>532 U.S. 1, 7-8, 121 S. Ct. 1060, 149 L. Ed. 2d 87 (2001).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This practice of \u201cconstru[ing] FOIA exemptions narrowly,\u201d <em>Department of Justice </em>v. <em>Landano, </em>508 U.S. 165, 181, 113 S. Ct. 2014, 124 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1993), stands on especially firm footing with respect to Exemption 2. As described earlier, Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>worded that provision to hem in the prior APA exemption for \u201cany matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency,\u201d which agencies had used to prevent access to masses of documents. See <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S., at 362, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11. We would ill-serve</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">[562 U.S. 572]</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Congress\u2019s purpose by construing Exemption 2 to reauthorize the expansive withholding that Congress wanted to halt. Our reading instead gives the exemption the \u201cnarrower reach\u201d Congress intended, <em>id., </em>at 363, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11, through the simple device of confining the provision\u2019s meaning to its words.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The Government resists giving \u201cpersonnel\u201d its plain meaning on the ground that Congress, when drafting Exemption 2, considered but chose not to enact language exempting \u201cinternal employment rules and practices.\u201d Brief for Respondent 30-34, and n. 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). This drafting history, the Navy maintains, proves that Congress did not wish \u201cto limit the Exemption to employment-related matters,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 31, even if the adjective \u201cpersonnel\u201d conveys that meaning in other contexts, <em>id., </em>at 41. But we think the Navy\u2019s evidence insufficient: The scant history concerning this word change as easily supports the inference that Congress merely swapped one synonym for another. Cf. <em>Mead Corp. </em>v. <em>Tilley, </em>490 U.S. 714, 723, 109 S. Ct. 2156, 104 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1989) (noting with respect to the \u201cunexplained disappearance of one word from an unenacted bill\u201d that \u201cmute intermediate legislative maneuvers are not reliable\u201d aids to statutory interpretation (internal quotation marks omitted)). Those of us who make use of legislative history believe that  clear evidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambiguous text. We will not take the opposite tack of allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Exemption 2, as we have construed it, does not reach the ESQD information at issue here. These data and maps calculate and visually portray the magnitude of hypothetical detonations. By no stretch of imagination do they relate to \u201cpersonnel rules and practices,\u201d as that term is most naturally understood. They concern the physical rules governing explosives, not the workplace rules governing sailors; they address the handling of dangerous materials, not the treatment of employees. The Navy therefore may not use Exemption 2, interpreted in accord with its plain meaning to</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">[562 U.S. 573]</p>\n<p id=\"aix-dedup-0\">cover human resources matters, to prevent disclosure of the requested maps and data.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">The Government offers two alternative readings of Exemption 2 to support withholding the ESQD information. We cannot square either with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">The Navy first encourages us to adopt the construction of Exemption 2 pioneered by <em>Crooker, </em>which shields material not only if it meets the criteria set out above (Low 2), but also if it is \u201cpredominantly] interna[l]\u201d and its \u201cdisclosure would significantly risk[] circumvention of federal agency functions\u201d (High 2). Brief for Respondent 41 (internal quotation marks omitted). The dissent, too, favors this reading of the statute. <em>Post, </em>at 585, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 287. But the <em>Crooker </em>interpretation, as already suggested, suffers from a patent flaw: It is disconnected from Exemption 2\u2019s text. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The High 2 test (in addition to substituting the word \u201cpredominantly\u201d for \u201csolely,\u201d see n. 1, <em>supra) </em>ignores the plain meaning of the adjective \u201cpersonnel,\u201d see <em>supra, </em>at 569-572 and this page, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 277-280, and adopts a circumvention requirement with no basis or referent in Exemption 2\u2019s language. Indeed, the only way to arrive at High 2 is by taking a red pen to the statute\u2014 \u201ccutting out some\u201d words and \u201cpasting in others\u201d until little of the actual provision remains. <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Department of Agriculture, </em>596 F.3d 842, 845 (CADC 2010). Because this is so, High 2 is better labeled \u201cNon 2\u201d (and Low 2 . . . just 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In support of its text-light approach to the statute, the Government relies primarily on legislative history, placing particular emphasis on the House Report concerning FOIA. See Brief for Respondent 33-38. A statement in that Report buttresses the High 2 understanding of the exemption and, indeed, specifically rejects the Low 2 construction. According to the Report: \u201cOperating rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners</p>\n<p id=\"AJP\">[562 U.S. 574]</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">would be exempt from disclosure [under Exemption 2], but this exemption would not cover . . . employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1966). But the Senate Report says exactly the opposite, explaining in support of a Low 2 interpretation that the phrase \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices of an agency\u201d means \u201crules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.\u201d S. Rep., at 8.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Rose, </em>we gave reasons for thinking the Senate Report the more reliable of the two. See 425 U.S., at 366, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11. But the more fundamental point is what we said before:  Legislative history, for those who take it into account, is meant to clear up ambiguity, not create it. See <em>supra, </em>at 572, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 279; <em>Wong Yang Sung </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>339 U.S. 33, 49, 70 S. Ct. 445, 94 L. Ed. 616 (1950) (declining to consult legislative history when that \u201chistory is more conflicting than the text is ambiguous\u201d). When presented, on the one hand, with clear statutory language and, on the other, with dueling committee reports, we must choose the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The Government also advances, in support of <em>Crooker\u2019s </em>High 2 approach, an argument based on subsequent legislative action.  Congress, the Government notes, amended Exemption 7(E) in 1986 to cover law enforcement records whose production \u201cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). That amendment, the Government contends, codified <em>Crooker\u2019s </em>\u201ccircumvention of the law\u201d standard and, in so doing, ratified</p>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">[562 U.S. 575]</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\"><em>Crooker\u2019s </em>holding. Brief for Respondent 42-43. The dissent likewise counts as significant that Congress \u201ct[ook] note\u201d of <em>Crooker </em>in revising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>FOIA. <em>Post, </em>at 592, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 291; see <em>post, </em>at 586, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 287-288.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">But the Government and the dissent neglect the key feature of the 1986 amendment: Congress modified not Exemption 2 (the subject of <em>Crooker), </em>but instead Exemption 7(E). And the <em>Crooker </em>construction of Exemption 2 renders Exemption 7(E) superfluous and so deprives that amendment of any effect. See, <em>e.g., TRW Inc. </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S. Ct. 441, 151 L. Ed. 2d 339 (2001) (noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid making any provision \u201csuperfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We cannot think of any document eligible for withholding under Exemption 7(E) that the High 2 reading does not capture: The circumvention standard is the same, and the law enforcement records listed in Exemption 7(E) are \u201cpredominantly internal.\u201d So if Congress had agreed with <em>Crooker\u2019s </em>reading of Exemption 2, it would have had no reason to alter Exemption 7(E). In that event, Congress would either have left the statute alone (on the theory that <em>Crooker </em>would do the necessary work) or would have amended Exemption 2 specifically to ratify <em>Crooker. </em>The decision instead to amend Exemption 7(E) suggests that Congress approved the circumvention standard only as to law enforcement materials, and not as to the wider set of records High 2 covers. Perhaps this legislative action does not show that Congress affirmatively disagreed with <em>Crooker; </em>maybe Congress was agnostic about whether the circumvention standard should apply to other records. But one thing is clear: The 1986 amendment does not ratify, approve, or otherwise signal agreement with <em>Crooker\u2019s </em>interpretation of Exemption 2. This argument therefore cannot save the High 2 construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The dissent offers one last reason to embrace High 2, and indeed stakes most of its wager on this argument. <em>Crooker, </em>the dissent asserts, \u201chas been consistently relied upon and followed for 30 years\u201d by other lower courts. <em>Post, </em>at 592, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 291;</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">[562 U.S. 576]</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">see <em>post, </em>at 585-586, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 287-288. But this claim, too, trips at the starting gate. It would be immaterial even if true, because  we have no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on the ground that other courts have done so. And in any event, it is not true. Prior to <em>Crooker, </em>three Circuits adopted the reading of Exemption 2 we think right, and they have not changed their minds. See n. 2, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Since <em>Crooker, </em>three other Circuits have accepted the High 2 reading. See <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>at 567, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 276. One Circuit has reserved judgment on the High 2-Low 2 debate. See <em>Audubon Soc. </em>v. <em>United States Forest Serv., </em>104 F.3d 1201, 1203-1204 (CA10 1997). And the rest have not considered the matter. (No one should think <em>Crooker </em>has been extensively discussed or debated in</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">[562 U.S. 577]</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">the Courts of Appeals. In the past three decades, <em>Crooker\u2019s </em>analysis of Exemption 2 has been cited a sum total of five times in federal appellate decisions outside the D. C. Circuit\u2014on average, once every six years.) The result is a 4-to-3 split among the Circuits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n                   We will not flout all usual rules of statutory interpretation to take the side of the bare majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Presumably because <em>Crooker </em>so departs from Exemption 2\u2019s language, the Government also offers another construction, which it says we might adopt \u201con a clean slate,\u201d \u201cbased on the plain text. . . alone.\u201d Brief for Respondent 15. On this reading, the exemption \u201cencompasses records concerning an agency\u2019s internal rules and practices for its personnel to follow in the discharge of their governmental functions.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at 20; see also <em>id., </em>at 13-14 (Exemption 2 \u201capplies generally to matters concerning internal rules and practices to guide agency personnel in performing their duties\u201d). According to the Government, this interpretation makes sense because \u201cthe phrase \u2018personnel rules and practices of an agency\u2019 is logically understood to mean an agency\u2019s rules and practices <em>for its </em>personnel.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">But the purported logic in the Government\u2019s definition eludes us. We would not say, in ordinary parlance, that a \u201cpersonnel file\u201d is any file an employee uses, or that a \u201cpersonnel department\u201d is any department in which an employee</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">[562 U.S. 578]</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">serves. No more would we say that a \u201cpersonnel rule or practice\u201d is any rule or practice that assists an employee in doing her job. The use of the term \u201cpersonnel\u201d in each of these phrases connotes not that the file or department or practice/rule is <em>for </em>personnel, but rather that the file or department or practice/rule is <em>about personnel\u2014i.e., </em>that it relates to employee relations or human resources. This case well illustrates the point. The records requested, as earlier noted, are explosives data and maps showing the distances that potential blasts travel. This information no doubt assists Navy personnel in storing munitions. But that is not to say that the data and maps relate to \u201cpersonnel rules and practices.\u201d No one staring at these charts of explosions and using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ordinary language would describe them in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Indeed, the Government\u2019s \u201cclean slate\u201d construction reaches such documents only by stripping the word \u201cpersonnel\u201d of any real meaning. Under this interpretation, an agency\u2019s \u201cinternal personnel rules and practices\u201d appears to mean all its internal rules and practices. That is because agencies necessarily operate through personnel, and so all their internal rules and practices are for personnel. The modifier \u201cpersonnel,\u201d then, does no modifying work; it does not limit the class of internal rules and practices that Exemption 2 covers. What is most naturally viewed as the provision\u2019s key word\u2014the term that ought to define its scope\u2014does nothing more than state the truism that in an agency it is \u201cpersonnel\u201d who follow internal rules and practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">And this odd reading would produce a sweeping exemption, posing the risk that FOIA would become less a disclosure than \u201ca withholding statute.\u201d <em>Mink, </em>410 U.S., at 79, 93 S. Ct. 827, 35 L. Ed. 2d 119. Many documents an agency generates in some way aid employees in carrying out their responsibilities. If Exemption 2 were to reach all these records, it would tend to engulf other FOIA exemptions, rendering ineffective the limitations Congress placed on their application. Exemption 7,</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">[562 U.S. 579]</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">for example, shields records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only if one of six specified criteria is met. \u00a7 552(b)(7). Yet on the Government\u2019s view, an agency could bypass these restrictions by invoking Exemption 2 whenever law enforcement records guide personnel in performing their duties. Indeed, an agency could use Exemption 2 as an all-purpose back-up provision to withhold sensitive records that do not fall within any of FOIA\u2019s more targeted exemptions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Interpreted in this way, Exemption 2\u2014call it \u201cSuper 2\u201d now\u2014would extend, rather than narrow, the APA\u2019s former exemption for records relating to the \u201cinternal management of an agency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (1964 ed.). We doubt that even the \u201cinternal management\u201d provision, which Congress thought allowed too much withholding, see <em>supra, </em>at 565, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 275, would have protected all information that guides employees in the discharge of their duties, including the explosives data and maps in this case. And perhaps needless to say, this reading of Exemption 2 violates the rule favoring narrow</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">[562 U.S. 580]</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">construction of FOIA exemptions. See, <em>e.g., Abramson, </em>456 U.S., at 630, 102 S. Ct. 2054, 72 L. Ed. 2d 376; <em>Rose, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>425 U.S., at 361, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11. Super 2 in fact has no basis in the text, context, or purpose of FOIA, and we accordingly reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Although we cannot interpret Exemption 2 as the Government proposes, we recognize the strength of the Navy\u2019s interest in protecting the ESQD data and maps and other similar information. The Government has informed us that \u201c[p]ublicly disclosing the [ESQD] information would significantly risk undermining the Navy\u2019s ability to safely and securely store military ordnance,\u201d Brief for Respondent 47, and we have no reason to doubt that representation. The Ninth Circuit similarly cautioned that disclosure of this information could be used to \u201cwrea[k] havoc\u201d and \u201cmake catastrophe more likely.\u201d 575 F.3d, at 971. Concerns of this kind\u2014a sense that certain sensitive information <em>should </em>be exempt from disclosure\u2014in part led the <em>Crooker </em>court to formulate the High 2 standard. See 670 F.2d, at 1074 (contending that \u201ccommon sense\u201d supported the High 2 interpretation because Congress would not have wanted FOIA to \u201cun-dermin[e] . . . the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies\u201d). And we acknowledge that our decision today upsets three decades of agency practice relying on <em>Crooker, </em>and therefore may force considerable adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We also note, however, that the Government has other tools at hand to shield national security information and other sensitive materials. Most notably,  Exemption 1 of FOIA prevents access to classified documents. \u00a7 552(b)(1); see 575 F.3d, at 980 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting) (Exemption 1 is \u201cspecifically designed to allow government agencies to withhold information that might jeopardize our national security\u201d). The Government generally may classify material even after receiving a FOIA request, see Exec. Order No. 13526, \u00a7 1.7(d), 75 Fed. Reg. 711 (2009); an agency therefore may wait until that time to decide whether the dangers</p>\n<p id=\"AZL\">[562 U.S. 581]</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">of disclosure outweigh the costs of classification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30. Exemption 3 also may mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns.  That provision applies to records that any other statute exempts from disclosure, \u00a7 552(b)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), thus offering Congress an established, streamlined method to authorize the withholding of specific records that FOIA would not otherwise protect. And  Exemption 7, as already noted, protects \u201cinformation compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d that meets one of six criteria, including if its release \u201ccould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(7)(F) (2006 ed.). The Navy argued below that the ESQD data and maps fall within Exemption 7(F), see n. 3, <em>supra, </em>and that claim remains open for the Ninth Circuit to address on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">If these or other exemptions do not cover records whose release would threaten the Nation\u2019s vital interests, the Government may of course seek relief from Congress. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. All we hold today is that Congress has not enacted the FOIA exemption the Government desires. We leave to Congress, as is appropriate, the question whether it should do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">Exemption 2, consistent with the plain meaning of the term \u201cpersonnel rules and practices,\u201d encompasses only records relating to issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>of employee relations and human resources. The explosives maps and data requested here do not qualify for withholding under that exemption. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,</p>\n<p id=\"anb-dedup-0\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">. The court adopted the \u201cpredominantly internar standard as a way of implementing the exemption\u2019s requirement that materials \u201crelat[e] solely to\u2019\u2019 an agency\u2019s internal personnel rules and practices. The word \u201csolely,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201chas to be given the construction, consonant with reasonableness, of \u2018predominantly\u2019 \u201d because otherwise \u201csolely\u201d would conflict with the expansive term \u201crelated.\u201d 670 F.2d, at 1056 (some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-13\">.

Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1976).

Ed. 2d, at 291 (opinion of Breyer, J.). But  nothing in FOIA either explicitly or implicitly grants courts discretion to expand (or contract) an exemption on this basis. In enacting FOIA, Congress struck the balance it thought right\u2014generally favoring disclosure, subject only to a handful of specified exemptions\u2014and did so across the length and breadth of the Federal Government. See, <em>e.g., John Doe Agency </em>v. <em>John Doe Corp., </em>493 U.S. 146, 152-153, 110 S. Ct. 471, 107 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1989). The judicial role is to enforce that congressionally determined balance rather than, as the dissent suggests, <em>post, </em>at 588-589, 179 L.

The court nowhere discussed the High 2 versus Low 2 question at issue here. Its only reference to <em>Crooker </em>concerned the part of that decision interpreting \u201csolely\u201d to mean \u201cpredominantly.\u201d See 138 F.3d, at 1080; see also n. 1, <em>supra. </em>Subsequently, the Sixth Circuit once again held, in <em>Rugiero </em>v. <em>Department of Justice, </em>257 F.3d 534, 549 (2001), that Exemption 2 applies to \u201croutine matters of merely internal significance.\u201d In <em>Sladek </em>v. <em>Bensinger, </em>605 F.2d 899, 902 (1979), which the dissent also cites, the Fifth Circuit insisted that the Government disclose a Drug Enforcement Administration agent\u2019s manual because it \u201cis not the type of trivial rule, such as allocation of parking facilities, that is covered by Exemption 2In confirming this Low 2 interpretation of the statute, the court acknowledged that another Circuit had embraced the High 2 standard. The court, however, declined to consider this alternative interpretation because it would not have changed the case\u2019s outcome. See <em>ibid. </em>Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the Eighth Circuit\u2019s last word on Exemption 2 is clear, and the dissent does not say otherwise.

The dissent is surely right to say, <em>post </em>at 586, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 288, that <em>Crooker </em>\u201chas guided nearly every [FOIA] case decided over the last 30 years\u2019\u2019 in Circuits applying <em>Crooker; </em>but that statement does not hold in the Circuits using the Low 2 approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b380-18\">. Notably, even those courts approving <em>Crooker </em>have disagreed about how to apply High 2. Fault lines include whether the risk of circumvention must be significant, see, <em>e.g., Hidalgo </em>v. <em>FBI, </em>541 F. Supp. 2d 250, 253 (DC 2008); Pet. for Cert. 15-16; whether courts should consider the public interest in disclosure when calculating that risk, see, <em>e.g., </em>Dept, of Justice, Guide to the Freedom of Information Act, p. 185 (2009); and whether an agency must regulate the person or entity threatening circumvention; compare, <em>e.g., </em>575 F.3d, at 971, with, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 978 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting). The disagreement is not surprising. Because High 2 is nowhere evident in the statute, courts lack the normal guideposts for ascertaining its coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b381-12\">. The dissent asserts that \u201c30 years of experience\u2019\u2019 with a more expansive interpretation of the exemption suggests no \u201cseriou[s] interfere [nee] with . . . FOIA\u2019s informational objectives.\u2019\u2019 <em>Post, </em>at 589-590, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 290. But those objectives suffer any time an agency denies a FOIA request based on an improper interpretation of the statute. To give just one example, the U. S. Forest Service has wrongly invoked Exemption 2 on multiple occasions to withhold information about (of all things) bird nesting sites. See <em>Audubon Soc. </em>v. <em>United States Forest Serv., </em>104 F.3d 1201, 1203 (CA10 1997); <em>Maricopa Audubon Soc. </em>v. <em>United States Forest </em>Serv., 108 F.3d 1082, 1084 (CA9 1997). And recent statistics raise a concern that federal agencies may too readily use Exemption 2 to refuse disclosure. According to <em>amicus </em>Public Citizen, \u201cwhile reliance on exemptions overall rose 83% from 1998 to 2006, reliance on Exemption 2 rose 344% during that same time period.\u2019\u2019 Brief for Public Citizen et al. 24. In 2009 alone, federal departments cited Exemption 2 more than 72,000 times to prevent access to records. See Brief for Allied Daily Newspapers of Washington et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>3. We do not doubt that many of these FOIA denials were appropriate. But we are unable to accept the dissent\u2019s unsupported declaration that a sweeping construction of Exemption 2 has not interfered with Congress\u2019s goal of broad disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\">SEPARATE OPINIONS</p>\n<author id=\"b383-6\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"A73l\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">I agree with the Court that the text of Exemption 2 of the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 cannot support the</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">[562 U.S. 582]</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u201cHigh 2\u201d interpretation that courts have adopted and applied over the years.

In particular, Exemption 7(F) permits withholding of \u201crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d that, if disclosed, \u201ccould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(7)(F). In most cases involving security information, it is not difficult to show that disclosure may \u201cendanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\u201d A more difficult question, however, is whether the information is \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d See <em>John Doe Agency </em>v. <em>John Doe Corp., </em>493 U.S. 146, 153, 110 S. Ct. 471, 107 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1989) (\u201cBefore it may invoke [Exemption 7], the Government has the burden of proving the existence of... a compilation for such a purpose\u201d). In my view, this phrase reasonably encompasses information used to fulfill official security and crime prevention duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\"><em>\u201cLaw enforcement purposes.\u201d </em>The ordinary understanding of law enforcement includes not just the investigation and prosecution of offenses that have already been committed, but also proactive steps designed to prevent criminal activity and to maintain security. A \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d is defined as one \u201cwhose duty it is to preserve the peace,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 796 (5th ed. 1979), and fulfilling that duty involves a range of activities. Police on the beat aim to prevent crime from occurring, and they no less carry out \u201claw enforcement purposes\u201d than officers investigating a crime scene. Similarly, a \u201claw-enforcement</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">[562 U.S. 583]</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">agency\u201d is charged with \u201cthe apprehension of alleged offenders <em>as well as crime detection and </em>prevention.\u201d R. De Sola, Crime Dictionary 82 (1982) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">Crime prevention and security measures are critical to effective law enforcement as we know it. There can be no doubt, for example, that the Secret Service acts with a law enforcement purpose when it protects federal officials from attack, even though no investigation may be ongoing. Likewise, steps by law enforcement officers to prevent terrorism surely fulfill \u201claw enforcement purposes.\u201d Particularly in recent years, terrorism prevention and national security measures have been recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>as vital to effective law enforcement efforts in our Nation. Indeed, \u201c[a]fter the September 11th attacks on America,\u201d the priorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u201cshifted dramatically,\u201d and the FBI\u2019s \u201ctop priority became the prevention of another terrorist attack.\u201d Hearings before the Subcommittee on Science, the Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies of the House Committee on Appropriations, 109th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 10, p. 232 (2006) (testimony of FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III). Today, \u201c[t]he FBI\u2019s number one priority continues to be the prevention of terrorist attacks against the United States.\u201d Hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, 111th Cong., 2d Sess., 67 (2010) (statement of Mueller). If crime prevention and security measures do not serve \u201claw enforcement purposes,\u201d then those charged with law enforcement responsibilities have little chance of fulfilling their duty to preserve the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The context of Exemption 7 confirms that, read naturally, \u201claw enforcement purposes\u201d involve more than just investigation and prosecution. As Exemption 7\u2019s subparagraphs demonstrate, Congress knew how to refer to these narrower activities. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 552(b)(7)(A) (information that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings\u201d); \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E) (information that \u201cwould disclose</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">[562 U.S. 584]</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions\u201d). Congress\u2019 decision to use different language to trigger Exemption 7 confirms that the concept of \u201claw enforcement purposes\u201d sweeps in activities beyond investigation and prosecution. See <em>Sosa </em>v. <em>Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 711, n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 2739, 159 L. Ed. 2d 718 (2004) (applying the \u201cusual rule\u201d that \u201cwhen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\"><em>\u201cCompiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d </em>This Court has given a fairly broad meaning to \u201ccompiled\u201d under \u00a7 552(b)(7). In <em>John Doe Agency, </em>we held that information need not have been originally \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d to satisfy Exemption 7\u2019s threshold requirement. Rather, \u201ceven though . . . documents were put together at an earlier time for a different purpose,\u201d they may fall within Exemption 7 if they are later assembled for law enforcement purposes. 493 U.S., at 154-155, 110 S. Ct. 471, 107 L. Ed. 2d 462. For example, documents originally gathered for routine business purposes may fall within Exemption 7 if they are later compiled for use in a criminal investigation. Similarly, federal building plans and related information\u2014 which may have been compiled originally for architectural planning or internal purposes\u2014may fall within Exemption 7 if that information is later compiled and given to law enforcement officers for security purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Documents compiled for multiple purposes are not necessarily deprived of Exemption 7\u2019s protection. The text of Exemption 7 does not require that the information be compiled <em>solely </em>for law enforcement purposes. Cf. \u00a7 552(b)(2) (\u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency\u201d). Therefore, it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>enough that law enforcement purposes are a significant reason for the compilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In this case, the Navy has a fair argument that the Explosive Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) information falls</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">[562 U.S. 585]</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">within Exemption 7(F). The ESQD information, the Navy argues, is used \u201cfor the purpose of identifying and addressing security issues\u201d and for the \u201cprotection of people and property on the base, as well as in [the] nearby community, from the damage, loss, death, or injury that could occur from an accident or breach of security.\u201d Brief for Appellee in No. 07-36056 (CA9), pp. 39-40. If, indeed, the ESQD information was compiled as part of an effort to prevent crimes of terrorism and to maintain security, there is a reasonable argument that the information has been \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(7). Assuming that this threshold requirement is satisfied, the ESQD information may fall comfortably within Exemption 7(F).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b385-7\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"AkT\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Justice Stevens has explained that once \u201ca statute has been construed, either by this Court <em>or by a consistent course of decision by other federal judges </em>and agencies,\u201d it can acquire a clear meaning that this Court should hesitate to change. See <em>Shearson / American Express Inc. </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>482 U.S. 220, 268, 107 S. Ct. 2332, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1987) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added). See also <em>Commissioner v. Fink, </em>483 U.S. 89, 104, 107 S. Ct. 2729, 97 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting); B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921). I would apply that principal to this case and accept the 30-year-old decision by the D. C. Circuit in <em>Crooker </em>v. <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>670 F.2d 1051 (1981) (en banc), as properly stating the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">For one thing, the <em>Crooker </em>decision, joined by 9 of the 10 sitting Circuit Judges, has been consistently followed, or favorably cited, by every Court of Appeals to have considered the matter during the past 30 years. See <em>ibid, </em>(written by Judge Edwards, and joined by Chief Judge Robinson and Judges Wright, MacKinnon, Robb, Wald, Mikva, and then-Judge Ginsburg, with Judge Tamm concurring in the result and Judge Wilkey dissenting); <em>Massey </em>v. <em>FBI, </em>3 F.3d 620,</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">[562 U.S. 586]</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">622 (CA2 1993); <em>Kaganove </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>856 F.2d 884, 889 (CA7 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1011, 109 S. Ct. 798, 102 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1989); <em>Dirksen </em>v. <em>Department of Health and Human Servs., </em>803 F.2d 1456, 1458 (CA9 1986). Three Circuits adopted a different approach in the 1970\u2019s <em>before Crooker was decided, </em>see <em>ante, </em>at 567, n. 2, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 276, but I read subsequent decisions in two of those Circuits as not adhering to their early positions. See <em>Abraham &amp; Rose, P.L.C. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>138 F.3d 1075, 1080-1081 (CA6 1998) (finding <em>Crooker\u2019s </em>textual analysis \u201csound and persuasive,\u201d and noting that Federal Bureau of Investigation symbols \u201cused internally to identify confidential sources\u201d may be withheld); <em>Sladek </em>v. <em>Bensinger, </em>605 F.2d 899, 902 (CA5 1979) (expressly reserving judgment on the <em>Crooker </em>issue). As for the remaining Circuit, its district courts understand <em>Crooker </em>now to apply. See, <em>e.g., Gavin </em>v. <em>SEC, </em>No. 04-4522, 2007 WL 2454156, *5-*6 (D Minn., Aug. 23, 2007); see also <em>McQueen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>264 F. Supp. 2d 502, 528 (SD Tex. 2003), aff'd, 100 Fed. Appx. 964 (CA5 2004) <em>(per curiam); Ticket </em>v. <em>IRS, </em>No. Civ-1-85-709, 1986 WL 14436, *2-*3 (ED Tenn., Aug. 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>1986). I recognize that there is reasonable ground for disagreement over the precise status of certain pre-<em>Crooker </em>precedents, but the <em>Crooker </em>interpretation of Exemption 2 has guided nearly every Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case decided over the last 30 years. See generally Dept, of Justice, Guide to Freedom of Information Act, pp. 184-206 (2009) (hereinafter FOIA Guide) (identifying over 100 district court decisions applying the <em>Crooker </em>approach, and one appearing to reject it).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Congress, moreover, well aware of <em>Crooker, </em>left Exemption 2, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2), untouched when it amended the FOIA five years later. See S. Rep. No. 98-221, p. 25 (1983) (discussing <em>Crooker)-, </em>Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207-48 (amending Exemption 7, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">This Court has found that circumstances of this kind offer significant support for retaining an interpretation of a statute</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">[562 U.S. 587]</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">that has been settled by the lower courts.

Garrett, Cases and Materials on Legislation 1048 (4th ed. 2007) (\u201c[T]he acquiescence rule can also support implicit congressional ratification of a uniform line of federal appellate interpretations . . . \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">For another thing, even if the majority\u2019s analysis would have persuaded me if written on a blank slate, <em>Crooker\u2019s </em>analysis was careful and its holding reasonable. The Court of Appeals examined the statute\u2019s language, the legislative history, and the precedent. It recognized that the exemption\u2019s words (\u201c \u2018related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency\u2019 \u201d) could easily be read, as the Court reads them today, to refer only to human resources rules and practices. See 670 F.2d, at 1056-1057. But it also thought that those words could be read more broadly as referring to internal rules or practices that set forth criteria or guidelines for agency personnel to follow in respect to purely internal matters (as long as the information at issue was \u201cnot of legitimate public interest\u201d). <em>Id., </em>at 1056, 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The D. C. Circuit agreed with today\u2019s Court that the Senate Report described the exemption as referring to \u201c \u2018internal personnel\u2019 \u201d matters, giving as examples \u201c \u2018personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities . . . sick leave, and the like.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1058-1059 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">[562 U.S. 588]</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Sess., 8 (1965)). But it also noted that the House Report described the exemption as protecting from disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u201c \u2018[o] pera ting rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners.\u2019 \u201d 670 F.2d, at 1060 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10 (1966)). \u201c[U]pon reflection,\u201d it thought the views of the two Houses \u201creconcilable\u201d if one understood <em>both </em>sets of examples as referring to internal staff information (both minor personnel matters and staff instruction matters) that the public had no legitimate interest in learning about. 670 F.2d, at 1065. And it accepted this view in light of its hesitation to \u201capply individual provisions of the statute woodenly, oblivious to Congress\u2019 intention that FOIA not frustrate law enforcement efforts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1066. At the same time it found no other exemption that would protect internal documents in which there is no legitimate public interest in disclosure\u2014a category that includes, say, building plans, safe combinations, computer passwords, evacuation plans, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">After examining in depth the legislative history and relevant precedent, the court adopted an approach based on a prior opinion by Circuit Judge Leventhal, as well as language used by this Court in <em>Department of Air Force </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 369, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1976). The D. C. Circuit held that a document fits within the literal language of Exemption 2 and is exempt from disclosure <em>if </em>(1) it \u201cmeets the test of \u2018predominant internality,\u2019\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the document is \u201cnot of legitimate public interest,\u201d <em>and </em>(2) \u201cdisclosure significantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or statutes.\u201d <em>Crooker, supra, </em>at 1056, 1074; see also <em>Rose, supra, </em>at 369, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11 (suggesting that Exemption 2 might apply where \u201cdisclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation\u201d). This test, based upon Congress\u2019 broader FOIA objectives and a \u201ccommon sense\u201d view of what information Congress did and did not want to make available, <em>Crooker, supra, </em>at 1074, takes the \u201cpractical approach\u201d that this Court has \u201cconsistently . . . taken\u201d when</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">[562 U.S. 589]</p>\n<p id=\"A5nq\">interpreting the FOIA, <em>John Doe Agency </em>v. <em>John Doe Corp., </em>493 U.S. 146, 157, 110 S. Ct. 471, 107 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">I would not underestimate the importance of this \u201cpractical approach.\u201d It reflects this Court\u2019s longstanding recognition that it cannot interpret the FOIA (and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of which it is a part) with the linguistic literalism fit for interpretations of the Tax Code. See generally 1 R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 7.1, p. 413 (4th ed. 2002) (\u201cJudicial interpretation of the malleable language of the APA has produced changes in rulemaking procedure that could be characterized as revolutionary if they had been affected in a day or a year rather than gradually over a period of decades\u201d); cf. Sunstein &amp; Vermeule, Interpretation and Institutions, 101 Mich. L. Rev. 885, 917-918, and n. Ill (2003) (observing that Congress \u201cappears to rely on courts for long periods of time\u201d to give meaning to the APA, which justifies interpreting it less formalistically than statutes like \u201cthe Internal Revenue Code\u201d). That in large part is because the FOIA (like the APA but unlike the Tax Code) must govern the affairs of a vast Executive Branch with numerous different agencies, bureaus, and departments, performing numerous tasks of many different kinds. Too narrow an interpretation, while working well in the case of one agency, may seriously interfere with congressional objectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>when applied to another. The D. C. Circuit\u2019s answer to this legal problem here was to interpret Exemption 2 in light of Congress\u2019 basic effort to achieve a \u201cworkable balance between the interests of the public in greater access to information and the needs of the Government to protect certain kinds of information from disclosure.\u201d <em>John Doe Agency, supra, </em>at 157, 110 S. Ct. 471, 107 L. Ed. 2d 462. See also S. Rep. No. 1219, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 8, 11 (1964) (emphasizing this \u201cworkable\u201d balance); S. Rep. No. 813, at 3, 5 (same); H. R. Rep. No. 1497, at 2, 6 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Further, 30 years of experience with <em>Crooker\u2019s </em>holding suggests that it has not seriously interfered with the FOIA\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">[562 U.S. 590]</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">informational objectives, while at the same time it has permitted agencies to withhold much information which, in my view, Congress would not have wanted to force into the public realm. To focus only on the case law, courts have held that that information protected by Exemption 2 includes blueprints for Department of Agriculture buildings that store biological agents, <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Dept. of Agriculture, </em>518 F. Supp. 2d 217 (DC 2007); documents that would help hackers access National Aeronautics and Space Administration computers, <em>Knight </em>v. <em>NASA, </em>No. 2:04-cv-2054-MCE-GGH, 2006 WL 3780901, *6 (ED Cal., Dec. 21, 2006); agency credit card numbers, <em>Judicial Watch, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Commerce, </em>83 F.

Supp. 3, 4-5 (DC 1987); and guidelines for processing Medicare reimbursement claims, <em>Dirksen, </em>803 F.2d, at 1458-1459.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">In other Exemption 2 cases, where withholding may seem less reasonable, the courts have ordered disclosure. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 579, n. 9, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 283 (citing <em>Audubon Soc. </em>v. <em>United States Forest Serv., </em>104 F.3d 1201, 1203 (CA10 1997), and <em>Maricopa Audubon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">[562 U.S. 591]</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\"><em>Soc. </em>v. <em>United States Forest Serv., </em>108 F.3d 1082, 1084 (CA9 1997)). See generally FOIA Guide 201, and n. 106 (citing nine decisions applying the <em>Crooker </em>approach but nonetheless requiring disclosure).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">The majority acknowledges that \u201cour decision today upsets three decades of agency practice relying on <em>Crooker, </em>and therefore may force considerable adjustments.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 580, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 284. But how are these adjustments to be made? Should the Government rely upon other exemptions to provide the protection it believes necessary? As Justice Alito notes, Exemption 7 applies where the documents consist of \u201crecords or information compiled for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>law enforcement purposes\u201d and release would, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cdisclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations,\u201d or \u201ccould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7). But what about information that is <em>not </em>compiled for law enforcement purposes, such as building plans, computer passwords, credit card numbers, or safe deposit combinations? The Government, which has much experience litigating FOIA cases, warns us that Exemption 7 \u201ctargets only a subset of the important agency functions that may be circumvented.\u201d Brief for Respondent 52-53. Today\u2019s decision only confirms this point, as the Court\u2019s insistence on narrow construction might persuade judges to avoid reading Exemption 7 broadly enough to provide <em>Crooker-</em>type protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The majority suggests that the Government can classify documents that should remain private. <em>Ante, </em>at 580-581, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 284. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1) (permitting withholding of material \u201cproperly classified\u201d as authorized to be \u201ckept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy\u201d). But classification is at best a partial solution. It takes time. It is subject to its own rules. As the Government points out, it would hinder the sharing of information about Government buildings with \u201cfirst responders,\u201d such as local fire and police departments. Brief for Respondent 53-54. And both Congress</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">[562 U.S. 592]</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">and the President believe the Nation currently faces a problem of too much, not too little, classified material. See Reducing Over-Classification Act, 124 Stat. 2648; Exec. Order No. 13526, \u00a7\u00a7 1.3(d), 2.1(d), 5.4(d)(10), 3 CFR 298, 299-300, 304, 321 (2009 Comp.). Indeed, Congress recently found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cThe 9/11 Commission and others have observed that the over-classification of information interferes with accurate, actionable, and timely information sharing, increases the cost of information security, and needlessly limits stakeholder and public access to information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">\u201cOver-classification of information causes considerable confusion regarding what information may be shared with whom, and negatively affects the dissemination of information within the Federal Government and with State, local, and tribal entities, and with the private sector.\u201d Reducing Over-Classification Act, \u00a7\u00a7 2(2), (3), 124 Stat. 2648, note following 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 124m (2006 ed., Supp. IV).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">These legislative findings suggest that it is \u201cover-classification,\u201d not Crookei; that poses the more serious threat to the FOIA\u2019s public information objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">That leaves congressional action. As the Court points out, Congress remains free to correct whatever problems it finds in today\u2019s narrowing of Exemption 2. But legislative action takes time; Congress has much to do; and other matters, when compared with a FOIA revision, may warrant higher legislative priority. In my view, it is for the courts, through appropriate interpretation, to turn Congress\u2019 public information objectives into workable agency practice, and to adhere to such interpretations once they are settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">That is why: Where the courts have already interpreted Exemption 2, where that interpretation has been consistently relied upon and followed for 30 years, where Congress has taken note of that interpretation in amending other parts</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">[562 U.S. 593]</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">of the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>where that interpretation is reasonable, where it has proved practically helpful and achieved commonsense results, where it is consistent with the FOIA\u2019s overall statutory goals, where a new and different interpretation raises serious problems of its own, and where that new interpretation would require Congress to act just to preserve a decades-long status quo, I would let sleeping legal dogs he.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
