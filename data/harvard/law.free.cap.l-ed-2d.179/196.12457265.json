Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949). Congress codified this principle at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661, which provides that \u201c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information\u201d a sentencing court may consider \u201cconcerning the [defendant\u2019s] background, character, and conduct,\u201d and at \u00a7 3553(a), which sets forth certain factors that sentencing courts must consider, including \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded in this case that the District Court, when resentencing petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>after his initial sentence had been set aside on appeal, could not consider evidence of petitioner\u2019s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. That conclusion conflicts with longstanding principles of federal sentencing law and Congress\u2019 express directives in \u00a7\u00a7 3661 and 3553(a).  Although a separate statutory provision, \u00a7 3742(g)(2), prohibits a district court at resentencing from imposing a sentence outside the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at the prior sentencing\u2014thus effectively precluding the court from considering post-sentencing rehabilitation for purposes of imposing</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">[562 U.S. 481]</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">a non-Guidelines sentence\u2014that provision did not survive our holding in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005), and we expressly invalidate it today.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We hold that  when a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation and that such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Separately, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling that the law of the case doctrine did not require the District Court in this case to apply the same percentage departure from the Guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been applied at petitioner\u2019s prior sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">In October 2003, petitioner Jason Pepper was arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. After pleading guilty, Pepper appeared for sentencing before then-Chief Judge Mark W. Bennett of the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. Pepper\u2019s sentencing range under the Guidelines was 97 to 121 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government moved for a downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 based on Pepper\u2019s substantial assistance and recommended a 15-percent downward departure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court, however, sentenced Pepper to a 24-month prison</p>\n<p id=\"Aj_\">[562 U.S. 482]</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">term, resulting in an approximately 75-percent downward departure from the low end of the Guidelines range, to be followed by five years of supervised release. The Government appealed Pepper\u2019s sentence, and in June 2005, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in light of our intervening decision in <em>Booker </em>(and for another reason not relevant here). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pepper, </em>412 F.3d 995, 999 <em>(Pepper I). </em>Pepper completed his 24-month sentence three days after <em>Pepper I </em>was issued and began serving his term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>In May 2006, the District Court conducted a resentencing hearing and heard from three witnesses. In his testimony, Pepper first recounted that while he had previously been a drug addict, he successfully completed a 500-hour drug treatment program while in prison and he no longer used any drugs. App. 104-105. Pepper then explained that since his release from prison, he had enrolled at a local community college as a full-time student and had earned As in all of his classes in the prior semester. <em>Id., </em>at 106-107. Pepper also testified that he had obtained employment within a few weeks after being released from custody and was continuing to work part time while attending school. <em>Id., </em>at 106-110. Pepper confirmed that he was in compliance with all the conditions of his supervised release and described his changed attitude since his arrest. See <em>id., </em>at 111 (\u201c[M]y life was basically headed to either where\u2014I guess where I ended up, in prison, or death. Now I have some optimism about my life, about what I can do with my life. I\u2019m glad that I got this chance to try again I guess you could say at a decent life. . . . My life was going nowhere before, and I think that it\u2019s going somewhere now\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Pepper\u2019s father testified that he had virtually no contact with Pepper during the 5-year period leading up to his arrest. <em>Id., </em>at 117. Pepper\u2019s drug treatment program, according to his father, \u201ctruly sobered him up\u201d and \u201cmade his</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">[562 U.S. 483]</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">way of thinking change.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 121. He explained that Pepper was now \u201cmuch more mature\u201d and \u201cserious in terms of planning for the future,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 119, and that as a consequence, he had reestablished a relationship with his son, <em>id., </em>at 118-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Finally, Pepper\u2019s probation officer testified that, in his view, a 24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of Pepper\u2019s substantial assistance, postsentencing rehabilitation, and demonstrated low risk of recidivism. <em>Id., </em>at 126-131. The probation officer also prepared a sentencing memorandum that further set forth the reasons supporting his recommendation for a 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The District Court adopted as its findings of fact the testimony of the three witnesses and the probation officer\u2019s sentencing memorandum. The court granted a 40-percent downward departure based on Pepper\u2019s substantial assistance, reducing the bottom of the Guidelines range from 97 to 58 months. The court then granted a further 59-percent downward variance based on, <em>inter alia, </em>Pepper\u2019s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. <em>Id., </em>at 143-148.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court sentenced Pepper to 24 months of imprisonment, concluding that \u201cit would [not] advance any purpose of federal sentencing policy or any other policy behind the federal sentencing guidelines to send this defendant back to prison.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 149-150.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The Government again appealed Pepper\u2019s sentence, and the Court of Appeals again reversed and remanded for resentencing. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pepper, </em>486 F.3d 408, 410, 413 (CA8 2007) <em>(Pepper II). </em>The court concluded that, while it was \u201ca close call, [it could not] say the district court abused its discretion\u201d by grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ing the 40-percent downward departure for substantial assistance. <em>Id., </em>at 411. The court found the further 59-percent downward variance, however,</p>\n<p id=\"AeD\">[562 U.S. 484]</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">to be an abuse of discretion. <em>Id., </em>at 412-413. In doing so, the court held that Pepper\u2019s \u201cpost-sentencing rehabilitation was an impermissible factor to consider in granting a downward variance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 413. The court stated that evidence of postsentenc-ing rehabilitation \u201c \u2018is not relevant and will not be permitted at resen-tencing because the district court could not have considered that evidence at the time of the original sentencing,\u2019 \u201d and permitting courts to consider postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing \u201cwould create unwarranted sentencing disparities and inject blatant inequities into the sentencing process.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court of Appeals directed that the case be assigned to a different district judge for resentencing. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">After the Court of Appeals\u2019 mandate issued, Pepper\u2019s case was reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Linda R. Reade. In July 2007, Chief Judge Reade issued an order on the scope of the remand from <em>Pepper II, </em>stating that \u201c [t]he court will not consider itself bound to reduce [Pepper\u2019s] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by 40% pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pepper, </em>No. 03-CR-4113-LRR, 2007 WL 2076041, *4 (ND Iowa). In the meantime, Pepper petitioned this Court for a writ of certio-rari, and in January 2008, we granted the petition, vacated the judgment in <em>Pepper II, </em>and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United. States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007). See <em>Pepper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 1089, 128 S. Ct. 871, 169 L. Ed. 2d 715 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">On remand, the Court of Appeals held that <em>Gall </em>did not alter its prior conclusion that \u201cpost-sentence rehabilitation is an impermissible factor to consider in granting a downward</p>\n<p id=\"AEL\">[562 U.S. 485]</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">variance.\u201d 518 F.3d 949, 953 (CA8 2008) <em>(Pepper III). </em>The court again reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">In October 2008, Chief Judge Reade convened Pepper\u2019s second resentenc-ing hearing. Pepper informed the court that he was still attending school and was now working as a supervisor for the night crew at a warehouse retailer, where he was recently selected by management as \u201cassociate of the year\u201d and was likely to be promoted the following January. App. 320, 323. Pepper also stated that he had recently married and was now supporting his wife and her daughter. <em>Id., </em>at 321. Pepper\u2019s father reiterated that Pepper was moving forward in both his career and his family life and that he remained in close touch with his son. See <em>id., </em>at 300-304.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">In December 2008, Chief Judge Reade issued a sentencing memorandum. Noting that the remand language of <em>Pepper III </em>was nearly identical to the language in <em>Pepper II, </em>the court again observed that it was \u201cnot bound to reduce [Pepper\u2019s] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by 40%\u201d for substantial assistance and concluded that Pepper was entitled only to a 20-percent downward departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>because the assistance was \u201ctimely, helpful and important\u201d but \u201cin no way extraordinary\u201d Sealed Sentencing Memorandum in No. 03-CR-4113-LRR (ND Iowa), Record, Doc. 198, pp. 7, 10. The court also rejected Pepper\u2019s request for a downward variance based on, <em>inter alia, </em>his postsentenc-ing rehabilitation. Id., at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The District Court reconvened Pepper\u2019s resentencing hearing in January 2009. The court\u2019s decision to grant a 20-percent downward departure for substantial assistance resulted in an advisory Guidelines range of 77 to 97 months. The court also granted the Government\u2019s motion under Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to account for investigative assistance Pepper provided after he was</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">[562 U.S. 486]</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">initially sentenced. The court imposed a 65-month term of imprisonment, to be followed by 12 months of supervised release.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed Pepper\u2019s 65-month sentence. 570 F.3d 958 (CA8 2009) <em>(Pepper IV). </em>As relevant here, the Court of Appeals rejected Pepper\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in refusing to consider his postsentencing rehabilitation. The court acknowledged that \u201cPepper made significant progress during and following his initial period of imprisonment\u201d and \u201ccommend [ed] Pepper on the positive changes he has made in his life,\u201d but concluded that Pepper\u2019s argument was foreclosed by Circuit precedent holding that \u201cpost-sentencing rehabilitation is not a permissible factor to consider in granting a downward variance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 964-965 (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jenners, </em>473 F.3d 894, 899 (CA8 2007); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McMannus, </em>496 F.3d 846, 852, n. 4 (CA8 2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The Court of Appeals also rejected Pepper\u2019s claim that the scope of the remand and the law of the case from <em>Pepper II </em>and <em>Pepper III </em>required the District Court to reduce the applicable Guidelines range by at least 40 percent pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. The court noted that its remand orders in <em>Pepper II </em>and <em>Pepper III </em>were \u201cgeneral remand [s] for resentencing,\u201d which \u201cdid not place any limitations on the discretion of the newly assigned district court judge in resen-tencing.\u201d 570 F.3d, at 963. The court further noted that, although issues decided by an appellate court become law of the case on remand to the sentencing court, its earlier decisions merely held that a 40-percent downward departure for substantial assistance was not an abuse of discretion, not that the District Court would be bound by the 40-percent departure previously granted. <em>Id., </em>at 963-964.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">[562 U.S. 487]</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">We granted Pepper\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, 561 U.S. 1024, 130 S. Ct. 3499, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (2010), to decide two questions: (1) whether a district court, after a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal, may consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation to support a downward variance when resentencing the defendant, a question that has divided the Courts of Appeals;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) whether the resen-tencing court was required, under the law of the case doctrine, to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>same percentage departure from the Guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been applied at Pepper\u2019s prior sentencing. Because the United States has confessed error in the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling on the first question, we appointed an <em>am-icus curiae </em>to defend the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We now vacate the Eighth Circuit\u2019s ruling on the first question and affirm its ruling on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u201cIt has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.\u201d <em>Koon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 113, 116 S. Ct. 2035, 135 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1996). Underlying this tradition is the principle that \u201cthe punishment should</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">[562 U.S. 488]</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">fit the offender and not merely the crime.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>337 U.S., at 247, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337; see also <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, </em>302 U.S. 51, 55, 58 S. Ct. 59, 82 L. Ed. 43 (1937) (\u201cFor the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Consistent with this principle, we have observed that  \u201cboth before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>337 U.S., at 246, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337. In particular, we have emphasized that \u201c[h]ighly relevant\u2014if not essential\u2014to [the] selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 247, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337. Permitting sentencing courts to consider the widest possible breadth of information about a defendant \u201censures that the punishment will suit not merely the offense but the individual defendant.\u201d <em>Wasman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 559, 564, 104 S. Ct. 3217, 82 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">In 1970, Congress codified the \u201clongstanding principle that sentencing courts have broad discretion to consider various kinds of information\u201d at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3577 (1970 ed.). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 151, 117 S. Ct. 633, 136 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1997) <em>(per curiam). </em>Section 3577 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\"><em>\u201cNo limitation </em>shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 <em>et seq., </em>Congress effected fundamental changes to</p>\n<p id=\"aki-dedup-0\">[562 U.S. 489]</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">federal sentencing by creating the Federal Sentencing Commission and introducing the Guidelines scheme. In doing so, however, Congress recodi-fied \u00a7 3577 without change at \u00a7 3661. The Sentencing Commission, moreover, expressly incorporated \u00a7 3661 in the Guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201cIn determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, or whether a departure from the guidelines is warranted, the court may consider, <em>without limitation, </em>any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.4 (Nov. 2010) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Both Congress and the Sentencing Commission thus expressly preserved the traditional discretion of sentencing courts to \u201cconduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information [they] may consider, or the source from which it may come.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S. Ct. 589, 30 L. Ed. 2d 592 (1972).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The SRA did constrain sentencing courts\u2019 discretion in important respects, most notably by making the Guidelines mandatory, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), and by specifying various factors that courts must consider in exercising their discretion, see \u00a7 3553(a). In our seminal decision in <em>Booker, </em>we held that  where facts found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence increased the applicable Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory in those circumstances violated the Sixth Amendment right of criminal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every element of an offense proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt. 543 U.S., at 243-244, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Our remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>invalidated two offending provisions in the</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">[562 U.S. 490]</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">SRA, see <em>id-., </em>at 245, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (invalidating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(b)(1), 3742(e)), and instructed the district courts to treat the Guidelines as \u201ceffectively advisory,\u201d 543 U.S., at 245, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">Our <em>post-Booker </em>opinions make clear that,  although a sentencing court must \u201cgive respectful consideration to the Guidelines, <em>Booker </em>permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well.\u201d <em>Kimbrough </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 101, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, although the \u201cGuidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark,\u201d district courts may impose sentences within statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), subject to appellate review for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S., at 49-51, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445. This sentencing framework applies both at a defendant\u2019s initial sentencing and at any subsequent resen-tencing after a sentence has been set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>aside on appeal. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g) (\u201cA district court to which a case is remanded . . . shall resentence a defendant in accordance with section 3553\u201d); see also <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 828, 827, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 177 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2010) (distinguishing between \u201csentence-modification proceedings\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which \u201cdo not implicate the interests identified in Booker,\u201d and \u201cplenary resentencing proceedings,\u201d which do).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In light of the federal sentencing framework described above, we think it clear that when a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal and his case remanded for resentenc-ing, a district court may consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation since his prior sentencing and that such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Preliminarily,  Congress could not have been clearer in directing that \u201c[n]o limitation ... be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct\u201d of a defendant that a district court may \u201creceive and consider</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">[562 U.S. 491]</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. The plain language of \u00a7 3661 makes no distinction between a defendant\u2019s initial sentencing and a subsequent resentencing after a prior sentence has been set aside on appeal. We have recognized that \u201cthe broad language of \u00a7 3661\u201d does not provide \u201cany basis for the courts to invent a blanket prohibition against considering certain types of evidence at sentencing.\u201d <em>Watts, </em>519 U.S., at 152, 117 S. Ct. 633, 136 L. Ed. 2d 554. A categorical bar on the consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence would directly contravene Congress\u2019 expressed intent in \u00a7 3661.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">In addition,  evidence of post-sentencing rehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that Congress has expressly instructed district courts to consider at sentencing. For example, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may plainly be relevant to \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Such evidence may also be pertinent to \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed\u201d to serve the general purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u2014in particular, to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d and \u201cprovide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training ... or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(D); see <em>McMannus, </em>496 F.3d, at 853 (Melloy, J., concurring) (\u201cIn assessing . . . deterrence, protection of the public and rehabilitation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)(C) &amp; (D), there would seem to be no better evidence than a defendant\u2019s post-incarceration conduct\u201d). Postsentencing rehabilitation may also critically inform a sentencing judge\u2019s overarching duty under \u00a7 3553(a) to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the sentencing purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">As the original sentencing judge recognized, the extensive evidence of Pepper\u2019s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appropriate sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">[562 U.S. 492]</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">in this case. Most fundamentally, evidence of Pepper\u2019s conduct since his release from custody in June 2005 provides the most up-to-date picture of Pepper\u2019s \u201chistory and charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>teristics.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryson, </em>229 F.3d 425, 426 (CA2 2000) <em>(per curiam) </em>(  \u201c[A] court\u2019s duty is always to sentence the defendant as he stands before the court on the day of sentencing\u201d). At the time of his initial sentencing in 2004, Pepper was a 25-year-old drug addict who was unemployed, estranged from his family, and had recently sold drugs as part of a methamphetamine conspiracy By the time of his second resentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug free for nearly five years, had attended college and achieved high grades, was a top employee at his job slated for a promotion, had reestablished a relationship with his father, and was married and supporting his wife\u2019s daughter. There is no question that this evidence of Pepper\u2019s conduct since his initial sentencing constitutes a critical part of the \u201chistory and characteristics\u201d of a defendant that Congress intended sentencing courts to consider. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Pepper\u2019s postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct, a central factor that district courts must assess when imposing sentence. See \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C); <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S., at 59, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (\u201cGall\u2019s self-motivated rehabilitation . . . lends strong support to the conclusion that imprisonment was not necessary to deter Gall from engaging in future criminal conduct or to protect the public from his future criminal acts\u201d (citing \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C))). As recognized by Pepper\u2019s probation officer, Pepper\u2019s steady employment, as well as his successful completion of a 500-hour drug treatment program and his drug-free condition, also suggest a diminished need for \u201ceducational or vocational training ... or other correctional treatment.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Finally,  Pepper\u2019s exemplary post-sentencing conduct may be taken as the most accurate indicator of \u201chis present purposes and tendencies and significantly to suggest the period of restraint and the kind of</p>\n<p id=\"AWlV\">[562 U.S. 493]</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">discipline that ought to be imposed upon him.\u201d <em>Ashe, </em>302 U.S., at 55, 58 S. Ct. 59, 82 L. Ed. 43. Accordingly, evidence of Pepper\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation bears directly on the District Court\u2019s overarching duty to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to serve the purposes of sentencing. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In sum, the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling prohibiting the District Court from considering any evidence of Pepper\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation at re-sentencing conflicts with longstanding principles of federal sentencing law and contravenes Congress\u2019 directives in \u00a7\u00a7 3661 and 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\"><em>Amicus </em>nevertheless advances two principal arguments in defense of the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling: (1) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(2), which restricts the discretion of a resentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence, effectively forecloses consideration of a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitation; and (2) permitting district courts to consider postsentencing rehabilitation would defeat Congress\u2019 objectives under \u00a7 3553(a). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\"><em>Amicus'' </em>main argument relies on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(2), a provision that the Court of Appeals did not cite below. That provision states that when a sentence is set aside on appeal, the district court to which the case is remanded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cshall not impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range except upon a ground that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">\u201c(A) was specifically and affirmatively included in the written statement of reasons required by section 3553(c) in connection with the previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the appeal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201c(B) was held by the court of appeals, in remanding the case, to be a permissible ground of departure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">[562 U.S. 494]</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">In operation, \u00a7 3742(g)(2) restricts the discretion of a district court on remand by precluding the court from imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range except upon a \u201cground of departure\u201d that was expressly relied upon in the prior sentencing and upheld on appeal. <em>Amicus </em>thus correctly contends that, on its face, \u00a7 3742(g)(2) effectively forecloses a resentencing court from considering evidence of a defendant\u2019s postsentenc-ing rehabilitation for purposes of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence because, as a practical matter, such evidence did not exist at the time of the prior sentencing. As the Government concedes, however, \u00a7 3742(g)(2) is invalid after <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">As we have explained, <em>Booker </em>held that  where judicial factfinding increases a defendant\u2019s applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory in those circumstances would violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to be tried by a jury and to have every element of an offense proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>supra, </em>at 489-490, 179 L. Ed6. 2d, at 213-214. We recognized in <em>Booker </em>that, although the SRA permitted departures from the applicable Guidelines range in limited circumstances,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cdepartures are not available in every case, and in fact are unavailable in most.\u201d 543 U.S., at 234, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Because in those instances, \u201cthe judge is bound to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range,\u201d we concluded that the availability of departures in certain circumstances \u201cdoes not avoid the constitutional issue.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">To remedy the constitutional problem,  we rendered the Guidelines effectively advisory by invalidating two provisions of the SRA: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which generally required sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and \u00a7 3742(e)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">[562 U.S. 495]</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the standard of appellate review, including <em>de novo </em>review of Guidelines departures. 543 U.S., at 259, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. We invalidated these provisions even though we recognized that mandatory application of the Guidelines would not always result in a Sixth Amendment violation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, although the Government suggested in <em>Booker </em>that we render the Guidelines advisory only in cases in which the Constitution prohibits judicial factfinding, we rejected that two-track proposal, reasoning that \u201cCongress would not have authorized a mandatory system in some cases and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>a nonmandatory system in others, given the administrative complexities that such a system would create.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 266, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621; see <em>Dillon, </em>560 U.S., at 829-830, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 177 L. Ed. 2d 271 (\u201cThe incomplete remedy we rejected in <em>Booker </em>would have required courts to treat the Guidelines differently in similar proceedings, leading potentially to unfair results and considerable administrative challenges\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">We did not expressly mention \u00a7 3742(g)(2) in <em>Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but the rationale we set forth in that opinion for invalidating \u00a7\u00a7 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e) applies equally to \u00a7 3742(g)(2). As with those provisions, \u00a7 3742(g)(2) requires district courts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory in an entire set of cases. Specifically, \u00a7 3742(g)(2) precludes a district court on remand from imposing a sentence \u201coutside the applicable guidelines range\u201d except upon a \u201cground of departure\u201d that was expressly relied upon by the court at the prior sentencing and upheld by the court of appeals. In circumstances in which the district court did not rely upon such a departure ground at the prior sentencing, \u00a7 3742(g)(2) would</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">[562 U.S. 496]</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">require the court on remand to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, thus rendering the Guidelines effectively mandatory. Because in a large set of cases, judicial factfinding will increase the applicable Guidelines range beyond that supported solely by the facts established by the jury verdict (or guilty plea), requiring a sentencing judge on remand to apply the Guidelines range, as \u00a7 3742(g)(2) does, will often result in a Sixth Amendment violation for the reasons we explained in <em>Booker. </em>Accordingly, as with the provisions in <em>Booker, </em>the proper remedy here is to invalidate \u00a7 3742(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The sentencing proceeding at issue in <em>Booker </em>itself illustrates why \u00a7 3742(g)(2) cannot withstand Sixth Amendment scrutiny. The District Court in <em>Booker </em>increased the defendant\u2019s then-mandatory Guidelines range based on a drug-quantity finding that it, rather than the jury, made. 543 U.S., at 227, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. After we held that the Guidelines must be treated as advisory, we remanded the case for resen-tencing. <em>Id., </em>at 267, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Had \u00a7 3742(g)(2) remained valid after <em>Booker, </em>the District Court on remand would have been required to sentence within the Guidelines range because it did not depart from the Guidelines at the original sentencing. Accordingly, the resentencing judge in <em>Booker </em>would have been required under \u00a7 3742(g)(2) to impose a Guidelines sentence based on judge-found facts concerning drug quantity, the precise result that <em>Booker </em>forbids.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The same result would occur in any sentencing in which a district court erroneously refuses to impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range \u201cbased on a misunderstanding of its authority to depart under or vary from the Guidelines.\u201d Reply Brief for United States 16. For example, if \u00a7 3742(g)(2) remained valid, there would be no remedy at resentencing if a district court erroneously believed the Guidelines were presumptively reasonable, see <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>555 U.S. 350, 352, 129 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>890, 172 L. Ed. 2d 719 (2009) <em>(per curiam), </em>or if it mistakenly</p>\n<p id=\"AlPi\">[562 U.S. 497]</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">thought that a non-Guidelines sentence required extraordinary circumstances, see <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S., at 47, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445, or if it incorrectly concluded that it could not vary from the Guidelines based on a policy disagreement with their disparate treatment of crack and powder cocaine, see <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S., at 101, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481. In such cases, the district court at the initial sentencing proceeding will necessarily have imposed a sentence within the Guidelines range, and thus \u00a7 3742(g)(2) would require the imposition of a Guidelines sentence on remand. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 3-5 (describing further categories of cases where \u201cthe <em>Booker </em>remedy would be entirely unavailable if \u00a7 3742(g)(2) were valid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">To be sure, applying \u00a7 3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not always result in a Sixth Amendment violation. For example, where the applicable Guidelines range rests solely on facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, application of \u00a7 3742(g)(2) at resen-tencing would not render the sentence constitutionally infirm. But, as explained above, that possibility was equally true with respect to the sentencing provisions we invalidated in <em>Booker. </em>See <em>supra, </em>at 495, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 216-217. As with those provisions, \u201cwe cannot assume that Congress, if faced with the statute\u2019s invalidity in key applications, would have preferred to apply the statute in as many other instances as possible.\u201d 543 U.S., at 248, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Just as we rejected a two-track system in <em>Booker </em>that would have made the Guidelines mandatory in some cases and advisory in others, we reject a partial invalidation of \u00a7 3742(g)(2) that would leave us with the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The fact that \u00a7 3742(g)(2) permits a resentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence in cases where the prior sentence expressly relied upon a departure upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional infirmity. As explained above, we observed in <em>Booker </em>that the availability of departures from the applicable Guidelines ranges in specified circumstances \u201cdoes not avoid the constitutional</p>\n<p id=\"ACU\">[562 U.S. 498]</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">issue.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at 234, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Because \u201cdepartures are not available in every case, and in fact are unavailable in most,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>we held that remedying the Sixth Amendment problem required invalidation of \u00a7 3553(b)(1). That same remedial approach requires us to invalidate \u00a7 3742(g)(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\"><em>Amicus </em>contends that any constitutional infirmity in \u00a7 3742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating \u00a7 3742(j)(l)(B) rather than \u00a7 3742(g)(2). Brief for <em>Amicus Curiae </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>in Support of Judgment Below 21-22. Section 3742(j)(l)(B) provides that a \u201cground of departure\u201d is \u201cpermissible\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3742(g)(2)(B) only if it is, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cauthorized under section 3553(b).\u201d In <em>Booker, </em>we noted that \u201cstatutory cross-references\u201d to the SRA provisions we invalidated were also constitutionally infirm. 543 U.S., at 259, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Because \u00a7 3742(j)(l)(B) incorporates a cross-reference to \u00a7 3553(b)(1), one of the provisions we invalidated in <em>Booker, amicus </em>suggests that invalidating \u00a7 3742(j)(l)(B) would cure any constitutional defect in \u00a7 3742(g)(2)(B). As the Government explains, however, even if \u00a7 3742(j)(l)(B) were invalidated and a district court could depart on any ground at an initial sentencing, the district court would not be able to depart on any new ground at resen-tencing so long as \u00a7 3742(g)(2) remains</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">[562 U.S. 499]</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">in force. Because <em>amicus\u2019 </em>proposed solution would still result in the Guidelines being effectively mandatory at resentencing in an entire set of cases, it fails to remedy the fundamental constitutional defect of \u00a7 3742(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\"><em>Amicus\u2019 </em>next cluster of arguments focuses on Congress\u2019 sentencing objectives under \u00a7 3553(a). Preliminarily, <em>amicus </em>contends that even if \u00a7 3742(g)(2) is constitutionally invalid, that provision reflects a congressional policy determination that only information available at the time of original sentencing should be considered, and that this policy determination should inform our analysis of whether \u00a7 3553(a) permits consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence. This argument, however, is based on a faulty premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Contrary to <em>amicus\u2019 </em>contention,  \u00a7 3742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration of evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing. To be sure, \u00a7 3742(g)(2) has the incidental effect of limiting the weight a sentencing court may place on postsentencing rehabilitation by precluding the court from resentencing outside the Guidelines range on a \u201cground of departure\u201d on which it did not previously rely. But on its face, nothing in \u00a7 3742(g)(2) prohibits a district court from considering postsentencing developments\u2014 including postsentencing rehabilitation\u2014in selecting a sentence <em>within </em>the applicable Guidelines range. Section 3742(g)(2) also does not apply to resentencings that occur for reasons other than when a sentence is overturned on appeal and the case is remanded (e.g., when a sentence is set aside on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). In such circumstances, \u00a7 3742(g)(2) does not restrict a district court at all, much less with respect to consideration of postsen-tencing developments. Accordingly, because we see no general congressional policy reflected in \u00a7 3742(g)(2) to preclude resentencing courts from considering</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">[562 U.S. 500]</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">postsentencing information,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that provision has no bearing on our analysis of whether \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>permits consideration of evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">As we explained above, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the sentencing factors that Congress has specifically instructed district courts to consider. See <em>supra, </em>at 491-493, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 214-215 (discussing \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), (a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D)). <em>Am-icus, </em>however, argues that consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation is inconsistent with two sentencing factors: \u00a7 3553(a)(5), which directs sentencing courts to consider \u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d of the Sentencing Commission, and \u00a7 3553(a)(6), which requires courts to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">With regard to \u00a7 3553(a)(5), <em>amicus </em>points to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement in USSG \u00a7 5K2.19, which provides that \u201c[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant offense [,] are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when re-sentencing the defendant for that offense.\u201d According to <em>amicus, </em>that policy statement is \u201cclear and unequivocal,\u201d and as an</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">[562 U.S. 501]</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">exercise of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s \u201ccore function,\u201d should be given effect.

That is particularly true where, as here, the Commission\u2019s views rest on wholly unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the sentencing statutes Congress enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The commentary to USSG \u00a7 5K2.19 expresses the Commission\u2019s view that departures based on postsentencing rehabilitation would \u201c(1) be inconsistent with the policies established by Congress under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) [governing good time credit] and other statutory provisions for reducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person; and (2) inequitably benefit only those who gain the opportunity to be resentenced <em>de novo.\u201d </em>With regard to the first proffered rationale,  a sentencing reduction based on postsentencing rehabilitation can hardly be said to be \u201cinconsistent with the policies\u201d under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>lying an award of good time credit under \u00a7 3624(b) because the two serve distinctly different penological interests.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, the difference between the two is</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">[562 U.S. 502]</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">reflected most obviously in the fact that the BOP has no authority to award good time credit where, as in this case, the defendant\u2019s good behavior occurs after a sentence has already been served.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s second proffered rationale fares no better. To be sure, allowing district courts to consider evidence of postsen-tencing rehabilitation may result in disparate treatment between those defendants who are sentenced properly and those who must be resen-tenced. But that disparity arises not because of arbitrary or random sentencing practices, but because of the ordinary operation of appellate sentencing review.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In a closely related vein, <em>amicus </em>argues that consideration of postsen-tencing rehabilitation is inconsistent with \u00a7 3553(a)(6), which requires sentencing courts to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. The Court of Appeals also rested its holding on this ground, reasoning</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">[562 U.S. 503]</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">that \u201c \u2018allowing [postsen-tencing rehabilitation] evidence to influence [defendant\u2019s] sentence would be grossly unfair to the vast majority of defendants who receive no sentencing-court review of any positive post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts.\u2019 \u201d 570 F.3d, at 965 (quoting McMannus, 496 F.3d, at 852, n. 4). But [25] <em>amicus </em>points to no evidence, nor are we aware of any, suggesting that Congress enacted \u00a7 3553(a)(6) out of a concern with disparities resulting from the normal trial and sentencing process.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The differences in procedural opportunity that may result because some defendants are inevitably sentenced in error and must be resen-tenced are not the kinds of \u201cunwar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ranted\u201d sentencing disparities that Congress sought to eliminate under \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 761-762, 117 S. Ct. 1673, 137 L. Ed. 2d 1001 (1997) (disparity arising from exercise of prosecutorial discretion not unwarranted); Uni<em>ted States </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>145 F.3d 1375, 1381 (CADC 1998) (\u201cDistinguishing between prisoners whose convictions are reversed on appeal and all other prisoners hardly seems \u2018unwarranted\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">As the Government explains, moreover, the logic of the Court of Appeals\u2019 approach <em>below\u2014i.e., </em>that \u201cpost-sentence rehabilitation is not relevant ... because the district court could not have considered that evidence at the time of the original sentencing,\u201d 570 F.3d, at 965 (internal quotation marks omitted)\u2014would require sentencing courts categorically to ignore not only postsentencing rehabilitation, but</p>\n<p id=\"AQ0Js\">[562 U.S. 504]</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><em>any </em>postsentencing information, including, for example, evidence that a defendant had committed postsen-tencing offenses. Our precedents, however, provide no basis to support such a categorical bar. See, <em>e.g., </em>Was<em>man, </em>468 U.S., at 572, 104 S. Ct. 3217, 82 L. Ed. 2d 424 (\u201c[A] sentencing authority may justify an increased sentence by affirmatively identifying relevant conduct or events that occurred subsequent to the original sentencing proceedings\u201d); cf. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 723, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969). Indeed, even the Court of Appeals below does not accept the logical consequence of its approach as it permits district courts to consider postsentencing conduct that would support a higher sentence. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stapleton, </em>316 F.3d 754, 757 (CA8 2003).  Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a) and 3661, however, remotely suggests that Congress intended district courts to consider only postsentencing evidence detrimental to a defendant while turning a blind eye to favorable evidence of a defendant\u2019s postsentenc-ing rehabilitation. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>460 F.3d 191, 196 (CA2 2006) (\u201cObviously, the discretion that <em>Booker </em>accords sentencing judges to impose non-Guidelines sentences cannot be an escalator that only goes up\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Finally, we note that \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(5) and (a)(6) describe only two of the seven sentencing factors that courts must consider in imposing sentence. At root, <em>amicus </em>effectively invites us to elevate two \u00a7 3553(a) factors above all others. We reject that invitation. See <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S., at 49-50, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (  instructing sentencing courts to \u201cconsider <em>all </em>of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in categorically precluding the District Court from considering evidence of Pepper\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation after his initial sentence was set aside on appeal.  District courts post <em>-Booker </em>may consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing and</p>\n<p id=\"AKWEy\">[562 U.S. 505]</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">The Government informs us that, in granting Pepper\u2019s motion for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>lease pending disposition of this appeal, see n. 5, <em>supra, </em>the District Court stated that it would not have exercised its discretion to grant Pepper a downward variance based on postsentencing rehabilitation. That statement, however, was made in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 erroneous views regarding postsentencing rehabilitation evidence. Because we expressly reject those views today, it is unclear from the record whether the District Court would have imposed the same sentence had it properly considered the extensive evidence of Pepper\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation. On remand, the District Court should consider and give appropriate weight to that evidence, as well as any additional evidence concerning Pepper\u2019s conduct since his last sentencing in January 2009. Accordingly, we vacate the Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment in respect to Pepper\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The second question presented in this case merits only a brief discussion. As noted above, the original sentencing judge in this case granted Pepper a 40-percent downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 based on Pepper\u2019s substantial assistance and sentenced him to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. When the Court of Appeals vacated that sentence in <em>Pepper II, </em>and again in <em>Pepper III, </em>the case was reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Reade. In resentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">[562 U.S. 506]</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Pepper, Chief Judge Reade ruled that she was not bound by the prior sentencing judge\u2019s decision to grant a 40-percent downward departure and instead granted only a 20-percent downward departure, which the Court of Appeals upheld in <em>Pepper IV. </em>Pepper argues that the law of the case doctrine required Chief Judge Reade to apply the same 40-percent departure granted by the original sentencing judge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Preliminarily, we note that the mandates in <em>Pepper II </em>and <em>Pepper III </em>were \u201cgeneral remand [s] for resen-tencing,\u201d which \u201cdid not place any limitations on the discretion of the newly assigned district court judge in resentencing Pepper.\u201d 570 F.3d, at 963. In his merits briefs to this Court, Pepper does not challenge the scope or validity of the Court of Appeals\u2019 mandate ordering <em>de novo </em>resentenc-ing, and thus has abandoned any argument that the mandate itself restricted the District Court from imposing a different substantial assistance departure.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The only question before us is whether the law of the case doctrine required Chief Judge Reade to adhere to the original sentencing judge\u2019s decision granting a 40-percent downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Although we have described the \u201claw of the case [a]s an amorphous concept,\u201d \u201c[a]s most commonly defined, the doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same <em>case.\u201d Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S. Ct. 1382, 75 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1983). This doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cdirects a court\u2019s discretion, it does not limit the tribunal\u2019s power.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, the doctrine \u201cdoes not apply if the court is \u2018convinced that [its prior decision] is clearly erroneous and</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">[562 U.S. 507]</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">would work a manifest injustice.\u2019\u201d <em>Agostini </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>521 U.S. 203, 236, 117 S. Ct. 1997, 138 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1997) (quoting <em>Arizona, </em>460 U.S., at 618, n. 8, 103 S. Ct. 1382, 75 L. Ed. 2d 318; alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Pepper argues that, because the original sentencing judge\u2019s decision to grant the 40-percent departure was never set aside by the Court of Appeals or this Court, it constituted the law of the case. As such, Pepper contends that Chief Judge Reade should not have disturbed that ruling absent \u201ccompelling justification\u201d for overturning it. Brief for Petitioner 56. According to Pepper, because Chief Judge Reade identified no such justification, the law of the case doctrine required her to adhere to the 40-percent departure granted by the original sentencing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">As the Government explains, however, the Court of Appeals in <em>Pepper III </em>set aside Pepper\u2019s entire sentence and remanded for a <em>de novo </em>resen-tencing. See 518 F.3d, at 949, 953. Thus, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the original sentencing court\u2019s decision to impose a 40-percent departure was at one point law of the case, <em>Pepper III </em>effectively wiped the slate clean. To be sure, <em>Pepper III </em>vacated Pepper\u2019s 24-month sentence on grounds unrelated to the substantial assistance departure, but that fact does not affect our conclusion.  \u201cA criminal sentence is a package of sanctions that the district court utilizes to effectuate its sentencing intent.\u201d Un<em>ited States </em>v. <em>Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (CA11 1996) <em>(per curiam). </em>Because a district court\u2019s \u201coriginal sentencing intent may be undermined by altering one portion of the calculus,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>406 F.3d 827, 832 (CA7 2005), an appellate court when reversing one part of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cmay vacate the entire sentence ... so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan ... to satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>Greenlaw </em>v. <em>United States, </em>554 U.S. 237, 253, 128 S.

Rather, it was meant to ensure that under the then-mandatory Guidelines system, when a particular departure was reversed on appeal, the district court could not impose the same sentence on remand on the basis of a different departure.

See <em>ante, </em>at 493-499, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 215-219; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005); see also <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000). And, like the majority, I believe that the law does not require a sentencing court to follow a Guidelines policy statement that forbids taking account of post-sentencing rehabilitation. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K2.19 (Nov. 2010) (USSG). I would emphasize, however, that this conclusion does not leave a sentencing court free to disregard the Guidelines at will. To the contrary, the law permits the court to disregard the Guidelines only where it is \u201creasonable\u201d for a court to do so. <em>Booker, supra, </em>at 261-262, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621; <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007); <em>Kimbrough </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007). And an appellate court must be guided by the basic sentencing objectives of the statutes that create the Guidelines in determining</p>\n<p id=\"ACT\">[562 U.S. 509]</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">whether, in disregarding the Guidelines, the sentencing court has acted unreasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The Guideline in question consists of a policy statement that sets forth an exception to normal Guidelines rules. Normally, the Guidelines authorize a sentencing judge to consider a departure from an ordinary Guidelines sentence in any case \u201cwhere conduct significantly differs from the norm\u201d to which \u201ca particular guideline linguistically applies.\u201d USSG ch. 1, pt. Al, \u00a7 4(b) (discussing the Guidelines\u2019 general approach to departures). The policy statement at issue is one of a handful of Guidelines rules that nonetheless forbid departure. It says that a defendant\u2019s \u201c[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional, . . . are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentencing.\u201d \u00a7 5K2.19. The policy statement thereby adds \u201cPost-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts\u201d to such factors as race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, and socioeconomic status, which the Guidelines absolutely prohibit the sentencing judge from taking into account. <em>Id., </em>ch. 1, pt. Al, \u00a7 4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Can a sentencing court, despite this policy statement, take account of postsentencing rehabilitation in the particular circumstances that this case presents? I cannot find the answer to this question in the language of the sentencing statutes, in sentencing traditions, in the pre-Guidelines case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949), or in this Court\u2019s use of the word \u201cadvisory.\u201d As the majority points out, a sentencing statute forbids any \u201c \u2018limitation\u2019 \u201d on the \u201c \u2018information concerning the background, character, and conduct\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018a court. . . may . . . consider.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Ante, </em>at 488, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 212-213 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; emphasis deleted). But this provision must refer to all <em>relevant </em>information. See USSG \u00a7 IB 1.4 and comment, (generally incorporating \u00a7 3661, but noting that there are certain factors that should not be considered</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">[562 U.S. 510]</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">for any purpose). <em>If </em>the Guidelines policy statement\u2019s absolute prohibition on consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>postsentencing rehabilitation were legally binding, then information on that score (like information about race, religion, sex, or national origin) would fall outside the scope of this provision, for it would not be <em>relevant. </em>Thus, reference to the statute begs the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Nor can I find much help in the majority\u2019s reference to a sentencing \u201c \u2018tradition\u2019 \u201d that considers \u201c \u2018every convicted person as an individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 487, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 212 (quoting <em>Koon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 113, 116 S. Ct. 2035, 135 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1996)). That is because individualized sentencing is not the only relevant tradition. A just legal system seeks not only to treat different cases differently but also to treat like cases alike. Fairness requires sentencing uniformity as well as efforts to recognize relevant sentencing differences. Indeed, when Congress enacted the sentencing statutes before us, it focused upon the unfair way in which federal sentencing failed to treat similar offenders similarly. And Congress wrote statutes designed primarily (though not exclusively) to bring about greater uniformity in sentencing. See, <em>e.g., Booker, supra, </em>at 253-254, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. The statutes do so in large part through the creation of a system of Guidelines written by a Sentencing Commission, which Congress intended the courts to follow. See <em>Mistretta </em>v. <em>United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1989) (Sentencing Commission constitutional); <em>Rita </em>v. <em>United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 348-349, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 168 L. Ed. 2d 203 (2007); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (identifying relevant factors in sentencing, including uniformity).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The <em>Williams </em>case is similarly unhelpful. That is because Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984\u2014 the law before us\u2014disavowed the individualized approach to sentencing that that case followed. <em>Williams </em>emphasized the importance of a sentencing court\u2019s legal power to tailor punishment ability to fit the circumstances of each individual offender. 337 U.S., at 247, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (emphasizing \u201cmodern concepts individualizing punishment\u201d). But Congress, concerned</p>\n<p id=\"ARx\">[562 U.S. 511]</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">that individualized sentencing had gone too far, wrote a new sentencing law designed to help correct \u201cdisparities\u201d among similar defendants sentenced by different judges. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 45 (1983) (\u201cSentencing disparities\u201d are \u201cunfair both to offenders and to the public\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 38, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (disparities \u201ccan be traced directly to the unfettered discretion the law confers on those judges and parole authorities responsible for imposing and implementing the sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\"><em>Booker\u2019s </em>description of the Guidelines as \u201cadvisory\u201d offers somewhat greater assistance\u2014but only if that word is read in light of the Sixth Amendment analysis that precedes it. This Court has held that the Sixth Amendment forbids Congress (through the Commission) to create Guidelines that both (1) require judges (without juries) to find sentencing facts and also (2) tie those facts to the mandatory imposition of particular sentences. 543 U.S., at 226, 244, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621; see also <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S., at 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (Sixth Amendment requires jury findings in respect to factual matters that require judge to increase sentence); <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 303-304, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004) (same in respect to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>State\u2019s mandatory guidelines). In light of this Sixth Amendment prohibition, the Court, believing that Congress would not have intended to introduce new juries into each sentencing proceeding, excised the few particular provisions of the sentencing statutes that specified that application of the Guidelines was mandatory. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S., at 259, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. The Court believed that the relevant statutes remained workable without those few provisions, that their excision could further Congress\u2019 basic sentencing intentions, and that excision was more likely to do so than invalidation of the entire statutory scheme. With an occasional exception (such as the statutory provision we strike down today), there is no reason to think that the sentencing statutes as limited in <em>Booker </em>run afoul of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><em>Booker </em>made clear that the remaining statutory provisions, while leading us to call the Guidelines \u201cadvisory\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">[562 U.S. 512]</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">(rather than \u201cmandatory\u201d), do not give a sentencing judge <em>carte blanche </em>to apply, or not to apply, the Guidelines as that judge chooses. Rather, the \u201cdistrict courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 264, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Moreover, <em>Booker </em>held that appellate court review of sentencing is valid. <em>Booker </em>explained that the \u201cstatutory language, the structure of the [Sentencing Reform Act], and the sound administration of justice,\u201d taken together, require appellate courts to apply \u201creasonableness standard[s]\u201d of review. <em>Id., </em>at 260-261, 262, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (internal quotation marks omitted). Reasonableness standards, we added, are \u201cnot foreign to sentencing law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 262, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. And the \u201cAct has long required their use in important sentencing circumstances\u2014both on review of departures . . . and on review of sentences imposed where there was no applicable Guideline.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>id., </em>at 261, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (appellate courts will apply \u201ca practical standard of review already familiar to appellate courts: review for \u2018unreasonable[ness]\u2019 \u201d); <em>id., </em>at 264, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (\u201c[C]ourts of appeals\u201d will \u201creview sentencing decisions for unreasonableness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">We have also indicated that, in applying reasonableness standards, the appellate courts should take account of sentencing policy as embodied in the statutes and Guidelines, as well as of the comparative expertise of trial and appellate courts. Thus, in <em>Kimbrough, </em>we observed that in light of the \u201cdiscrete institutional strengths\u201d of the Sentencing Commission and sentencing judges, \u201ca district court\u2019s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case \u2018outside the \u201cheartland\u201d to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.\u2019 \u201d 552 U.S., at 109, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (quoting <em>Rita, supra, </em>351, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 168 L. Ed. 2d 203). We noted, however, that \u201cwhile the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge\u2019s view that the Guidelines range</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">[562 U.S. 513]</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\u2018fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations\u2019 even in a mine-run case.\u201d 552 U.S., at 109, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Unlike the majority, I would decide the question <em>Kimbrough </em>left open. And I would follow its suggested framework for evaluating \u201creasonableness.\u201d As <em>Kimbrough </em>suggests, doing so takes proper account of the comparative institutional abilities of trial courts, appellate courts, and the Sentencing Commission. The trial court typically better understands the individual circumstances of particular cases before it, while the Commission has comparatively greater ability to gather information, to consider a broader national picture, to compare sentences attaching to different offenses, and ultimately to write more coherent overall standards that reflect nationally uniform, not simply local, sentencing policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Applying Kimbrough\u2019s suggested framework, I would reason very much as does the majority. The first question is whether a sentencing judge might <em>sometimes </em>take account of a (resentenced) offender\u2019s postsentenc-ing rehabilitation\u2014despite a Guidelines policy statement that says <em>never. </em>I would find that it is reasonable for the judge to disregard the Guidelines\u2019 absolute prohibition, despite the Commission\u2019s comparatively greater policy-formation abilities. That is because the Guidelines policy statement itself runs counter to ordinary Guidelines sentencing policy, which rarely forbids departures and then for very strong policy reasons. <em>Supra, </em>at 509, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 225. See USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, \u00a7 4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The Commission offers no convincing justification for creating this exception with respect to postsentenc-ing rehabilitation. The Commission\u2019s commentary says that for a judge at resentencing to lower a sentence for this reason (reflecting good behavior while the case is on appeal) would conflict with the use of other mechanisms, such as \u201cgood-time\u201d credits, for that purpose. But how is that so? A defendant,</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">[562 U.S. 514]</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">after sentencing but while his case is on appeal, may or may not be entitled to \u201cgood time.\u201d That may depend upon whether he remains on bail or upon particular \u201cgood-time\u201d rules. Regardless, the resentencing judge can take account of any such matter. See also <em>ante, </em>at 503-504, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 221-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The Commission\u2019s commentary also suggests it would be <em>inequitable </em>to allow an offender who is being resen-tenced to receive any kind of credit for his good behavior, say, while his case was on appeal. But why is that so? After all, the Guidelines permit a judge to take account of an offender\u2019s good behavior after arrest but before initial sentencing. That time period could last longer than the time taken up on appeal. Why should pretrial behavior count but appeal time behavior not count? Like the majority, I find this justification for the policy statement unconvincing. See <em>ante, </em>at 500-502, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">The second question is whether, given the sentencing court\u2019s power to disregard the policy statement forbidding departures based on postsen-tencing rehabilitation, the facts and circumstances here could warrant a departure (or variance) for that reason. And the answer, in my view, is yes. This case presents unusual rehabilitative circumstances. As the majority observes: \u201cBy the time of his second resentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug free for nearly five years, had attended college and achieved high grades, was a top employee at his job slated for a promotion, had reestablished a relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>with his father, and was married and supporting his wife\u2019s daughter.\u201d Ante, at 492, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 215. These are case-specific facts and circumstances, and they are of the kind that should lead appellate courts to show their \u201cgreatest respect\u201d for a sentencing decision, including a departure or variance, that rests upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In sum, the sentencing statutes, as we have interpreted them, require courts of appeals to review sentences for reasonableness,</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">[562 U.S. 515]</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">including sentences that depart or vary from a specific Guideline. The appellate courts should review those decisions more closely when they rest upon disagreement with Guidelines policy. <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S., at 109, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481. They should review those decisions with greater deference when they rest upon case-specific circumstances that place the case outside a specific Guideline\u2019s \u201cheartland.\u201d See <em>ibid.; Rita, </em>551 U.S., at 351, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 168 L. Ed. 2d 203; <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S., at 98-99, 116 S. Ct. 2035, 135 L. Ed. 2d 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">By interpreting the sentencing statutes in this way, we can remain faithful to Congress\u2019 basic intent in writing them\u2014despite the need to invalidate statutory provisions that conflict with the Sixth Amendment. The statutes create a Sentencing Commission with authority to develop sentencing policy embodied in the Guidelines. The Guidelines are to further the statutes\u2019 basic objective, namely, greater sentencing uniformity, while also taking account of special individual circumstances, primarily by permitting the sentencing court to depart in nontypical cases. By collecting trial courts\u2019 reasons for departure (or variance), by examining appellate court reactions, by developing statistical and other empirical information, by considering the views of expert penologists and others, the Commission can revise the Guidelines accordingly. See USSG ch. 1, pt. Al, \u00a7 3. Trial courts, appellate courts, and the Commission all have a role to play in what is meant to be an iterative, cooperative institutional effort to bring about a more uniform and a more equitable sentencing system. See <em>id., </em>ch. 1, pt. A. I would interpret the statutes before us accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b327-10\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">I join Part III of the opinion of the Court. I agree with the Court that the decision below cannot be affirmed on the basis of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g), as <em>amicus </em>suggests. This provision was designed to function as part of the mandatory Guidelines scheme that the Court struck down in <em>United.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">[562 U.S. 516]</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\"><em>States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 258-265, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005). Although <em>amicus\u2019 </em>argument is ingenious, even the sort of surgery sanctioned in <em>Booker </em>cannot transform this provision into one that can survive in the <em>post-Booker </em>world.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">I also concur in the judgment to the extent that it holds that the decision below regarding evidence of postsen-tencing rehabilitation must be reversed. That decision, which entirely precluded consideration of such evidence, was consistent with the policy statement in \u00a7 5K2.19 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, but \u201c [t]he <em>Booker </em>remedial decision . . . does not permit a court of appeals to treat the Guidelines\u2019 policy decisions as binding.\u201d <em>Kimbrough </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 116, 128 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007) (Alito, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Under <em>Booker, </em>however, district judges are still required in almost all cases to give significant weight to the policy decisions embodied in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See <em>Kimbrough, supra, </em>at 116, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481; <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 61-67, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007) (Alito, J., dissenting). Congress delegated to the Sentencing Commission the authority to make policy decisions regarding federal sentencing, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(4), (5), and requiring judges to give significant weight to the Commission\u2019s policy decisions does not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment right that the mandatory Guidelines system was found to violate, <em>i.e., </em>the right to have a jury make certain factual findings that are relevant to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">While I continue to believe that sentencing judges should be required to give significant weight to all Guidelines provisions and policy statements, see <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S., at 116, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (opinion of Alito, J.), the Court in <em>Kimbrough </em>held that sentencing judges may not be required to give weight to some unusual policy decisions, see <em>id., </em>at 109-110, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (majority opinion). And Justice Breyer now makes a reasonable case that the particular policy statement involved in this case is distinguishable from almost all of the other rules that the Commission has adopted. See <em>ante, </em>p. 508, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 224-225 (opinion concurring</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">[562 U.S. 517]</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">in part and concurring in judgment). His position seems to me more consistent with <em>Kimbrough </em>than the Court\u2019s. It would at least prevent us from sliding all the way down the slippery slope that leads back to the regime of entirely discretionary federal sentencing that preceded the enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Anyone familiar with the history of criminal sentencing in this country cannot fail to see the irony in the Court\u2019s praise for the sentencing scheme exemplified by <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> By the time of the enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act in 1984, this scheme had fallen into widespread disrepute. See, <em>e.g., Mistretta </em>v. <em>United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 366, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1989) (noting \u201c[f]undamental and widespread dissatisfaction with the uncertainties and the disparities\u201d of this scheme); <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 142, 101 S. Ct. 426, 66 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1980) (\u201cIt has been observed . . . that sentencing is one of the areas of the criminal justice system most in need of reform\u201d); S. Rep. No. 98-223, p. 62 (1983) (\u201cThe shameful disparity in criminal sentences is a major flaw in the existing criminal justice system\u201d). Under this system, each federal district judge was free to implement his or her individual sentencing philosophy, and therefore the sentence imposed in a particular case often depended heavily on the spin of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>wheel that determined the judge to whom the case was assigned. See <em>Bullington </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 444, n. 16, 101 S. Ct. 1852, 68 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1981) (\u201cThere has been no attempt to separate policymaking from individual sentencing determinations\u201d (internal quotation marks</p>\n<p id=\"AIcN\">[562 U.S. 518]</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">omitted)); M. Frankel, Criminal Sentences: Law Without Order 5 (1973) (\u201c[T]he almost wholly unchecked and sweeping powers we give to judges in the fashioning of sentences are terrifying and intolerable for a society that professes devotion to the rule of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Some language in today\u2019s opinion reads like a paean to that old regime, and I fear that it may be interpreted as sanctioning a move back toward the system that prevailed prior to 1984. If that occurs, I suspect that the day will come when the irrationality of that system is once again seen, and perhaps then the entire <em>Booker </em>line of cases will be reexamined.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> Insofar as \u00a7 3661 permitted a sentencing judge to consider evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation, that provision was effectively modified by the subsequent enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act, which instructed the Sentencing Commission to adopt guidelines and policy statements that avoid \u201cunwarranted sentencing disparities,\u2019\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(b)(1)(B); see also \u00a7 994(f), and which provided that sentencing courts \u201cshall consider . . . any pertinent policy statement,\u2019\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b329-7\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"aoy-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">I would affirm the Court of Appeals and uphold Pepper\u2019s sentence.

Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 258-265, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005), the Court rendered the entire Guidelines scheme advisory, a remedy that was \u201cfar broader than necessary to correct constitutional error.\u201d <em>Kimbrough </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 114, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007) (Thomas, J., dissenting). Because there is \u201cno principled way to apply the <em>Booker </em>remedy,\u201d I have explained that it is \u201cbest to apply the statute as written, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b), which makes the Guidelines mandatory,\u201d unless doing so would actually violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id., </em>at 116, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481; see <em>Booker, supra, </em>at 313-326, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (Thomas, J., dissenting in part); <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 61, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L.

The constitutional problem arises only when a judge makes \u201ca finding that raises the sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Booker, supra, </em>at 313, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Pepper admitted in his plea agreement to involvement with between 1,500 and 5,000 grams of methamphetamine mixture, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)( 1)(A)(viii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pepper, </em>412 F.3d 995, 996 (CA8 2005). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Because Pepper has admitted facts that would support a much longer sentence than the 65 months he received, there is no Sixth Amendment problem in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Under a mandatory Guidelines regime, Pepper\u2019s sentence was proper. The District Court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, incorporated a USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 departure and the Government\u2019s motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), and settled on a 65-month sentence. Guideline \u00a7 5K2.19 expressly prohibits downward departures based on \u201c[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional.\u201d Nor is there any provision in the Guidelines for the \u201cvariance\u201d Pepper seeks, as such variances are creations of the <em>Booker </em>remedy. I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to uphold Pepper\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Although this outcome would not represent my own policy choice, I am bound by the choices made by Congress and the Federal Sentencing Commission. Like the majority, I believe that postsentencing rehabilitation can be highly relevant to meaningful resentencing. See <em>ante, </em>at 491-493, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 214-215. In light of Pepper\u2019s success in escaping drug addiction and becoming a productive member of society, I do not see what purpose further incarceration would serve. But Congress</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">[562 U.S. 520]</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">made the Guidelines mandatory, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1), and authorized USSG \u00a7 5K2.19. I am constrained to apply those provisions unless the Constitution prohibits me from doing so, and it does not here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-13\">. I agree with the Court that the law of the case doctrine did not control Pepper\u2019s resentencing. See <em>ante, </em>at 505-508, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 223-224.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-14\">.
