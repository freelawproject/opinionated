Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (2009): May a convicted state prisoner seeking DNA testing of crime-scene evidence assert that claim in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, or is such a claim cognizable in federal court only when asserted in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254? The Courts of Appeals have returned diverse responses. Compare <em>McKithen </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>481 F.3d 89, 99 (CA2 2007) (claim seeking DNA testing is cognizable under \u00a7 1983); <em>Savory </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>469 F.3d 667, 669 (CA7 2006) (same); and <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Pryor, </em>305 F.3d 1287, 1290-1291 (CA11 2002) (same), with <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Horan, </em>278 F.3d 370, 375 (CA4 2002) (claim is not cognizable under</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">[562 U.S. 525]</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">\u00a7 1983); and <em>Kutzner </em>v. <em>Montgomery County, </em>303 F.3d 339, 341 (CA5 2002) <em>(per curiam) </em>(same).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-18\">In <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S.

Habeas is the exclusive remedy, we reaffirmed, for the pris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>oner who seeks \u201cimmediate or speedier release\u201d from confinement. <em>Id., </em>at 82, 125 S.

Where the prisoner\u2019s claim would not \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release,\u201d however, suit may be brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>Ibid. </em>Adhering to our opinion in <em>Dotson, </em>we hold that a postconviction claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a \u00a7 1983 action. Success in the suit gains for the prisoner only access to the DNA evidence, which may prove exculpatory, inculpatory, or inconclusive. In no event will a judgment that simply orders DNA tests \u201cnecessarily impl[y] the unlawfulness of the State\u2019s custody.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 81, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253. We note, however, that the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Osborne </em>severely limits the federal action a state prisoner may bring for DNA testing. <em>Osborne </em>rejected the extension of substantive due process to this area, 557 U.S., at 72, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38, and left slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law denies him procedural due process, see <em>id., </em>at 71, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In 1995, a Texas jury convicted petitioner Henry Skinner and sentenced him to death for murdering his live-in girlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two sons. Busby was bludgeoned and choked with an axe handle and her sons were stabbed to death; the murders were committed in the house Busby shared with Skinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Skinner never denied his presence in the house when the killings occurred. He claimed, however, that he was incapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine. The potent alcohol and drug mix, Skinner maintained at trial, rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal murders charged against him. Skinner identified, as a likely</p>\n<p id=\"A6X\">[562 U.S. 526]</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">perpetrator, Busby\u2019s uncle, Robert Donnell (now deceased), an ex-convict with a history of physical and sexual abuse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On direct appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed Skinner\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>State, </em>956 S.W.2d 532, 546 (1997). The CCA\u2019s opinion described the crime-scene evidence in detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"art-dedup-0\">\u201cAs they approached the house . . . , the police noticed a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the front porch to the fence line. There was a blood smear on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch. Upon entering the residence, the police found Twila\u2019s dead body on the living room floor. . . . An ax handle stained with blood and hair was leaning against the couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag containing a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains on it was laying between the couch and the coffee table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\u201c[One officer] proceeded to the bedroom where [Busby\u2019s two sons] usually slept in bunk beds. [The officer] found [one] dead body laying face down on the upper bunk, covered by a blood spotted blanket. ... A door leading out of the bedroom and into a utility room yielded further evidence. [He] noticed a bloody handprint located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>about 24 inches off the floor on the frame of this door. He also noted a bloody handprint on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen to the utility room and a handprint on the knob of the door exiting from the utility room into the backyard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">\u201c[When] police arrested [Skinner] . . . [t]hey found him standing in a closet wearing blood-stained socks and blood-stained blue jeans.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 536.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">[562 U.S. 527]</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Investigators also retained vaginal swabs taken from Busby.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In preparation for trial, \u201cthe State tested the blood on [Skinner\u2019s] clothing, blood and hair from a blanket that partially covered one of the victims, and hairs on one of the victim\u2019s back and cheeks.\u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>State, </em>122 S.W.3d 808, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). The State also tested fingerprint evidence. Some of this evidence\u2014including bloody palm prints in the room where one victim was killed\u2014implicated Skinner, but \u201cfingerprints on a bag containing one of the knives\u201d did not. <em>Ibid. </em>Items left untested included the knives found on the premises, the axe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and additional hair samples. See <em>ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">In the decade following his conviction, Skinner unsuccessfully sought state and federal postconviction relief. See <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Quarterman, </em>576 F.3d 214 (CA5 2009), cert. denied, 559 U.S. 975, 130 S. Ct. 1689, 176 L. Ed. 2d 187 (2010). He also pursued informal efforts to gain access to untested biological evidence the police had collected at the scene of the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">In 2001, more than six years after Skinner\u2019s conviction, Texas enacted Article 64, a statute allowing prisoners to gain postconviction DNA testing in limited circumstances. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 64.01(a) (Vernon Supp. 2010).  To obtain DNA testing under Article 64, a prisoner must meet one of two threshold criteria. He may show that, at trial, testing either was \u201cnot available\u201d or was \u201cavailable, but</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">[562 U.S. 528]</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">not technologically capable of providing probative results.\u201d Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A). Alternatively, he may show that the evidence was not previously tested \u201cthrough no fault\u201d on his part, and that \u201cthe interests of justice\u201d require a post-conviction order for testing. Art. 64.01(b)(1)(B). To grant a motion for postconviction testing, a court must make further findings, prime among them, the movant \u201cwould not have been convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA testing,\u201d and \u201cthe [Article 64] request. . . [was] not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice.\u201d Art. 64.03(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">Invoking Article 64, Skinner twice moved in state court, first in 2001 and again in 2007, for DNA testing of yet untested biological evidence. See <em>supra, </em>at 527, n. 3, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>240. Both motions were denied. Affirming the denial of Skinner\u2019s first motion, the CCA held that he had failed to demonstrate a \u201creasonable probability . . . that he would not have been . . . convicted if the DNA test results were exculpatory.\u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>State, </em>122 S.W.3d, at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Skinner\u2019s second motion was bolstered by discovery he had obtained in the interim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The CCA again affirmed the denial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground that Skinner failed to meet the \u201cno fault\u201d requirement. See <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>State, </em>293 S.W.3d 196, 200 (2009).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During post-conviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial counsel testified that he had not \u201cask[ed] for testing because he was afraid the</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">[562 U.S. 529]</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">DNA would turn out to be [Skinner\u2019s].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 202. That decision, the CCA concluded, constituted \u201ca reasonable trial strategy\u201d that the court had no cause to second-guess. <em>Id., </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief under \u00a7 1983, naming as defendant respondent Lynn Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prosecuted Skinner and has custody of the evidence Skinner would like to have DNA tested. Skinner\u2019s federal-court complaint alleged that Texas violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the DNA testing he requested. Complaint \u00b633, App. 20-21. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. App. 24-41. Under the governing Circuit precedent, <em>Kutzner </em>v. <em>Montgomery County, </em>303 F.3d 339, the Magistrate Judge observed, postconviction requests for DNA evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus, not under \u00a7 1983. App. 39. Adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation, the District Court dismissed Skinner\u2019s suit. <em>Id., </em>at 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, 363 Fed. Appx. 302 (2010) <em>(per curiam), </em>reiterating that \u201can action by a prisoner for post-conviction DNA testing is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 and must instead be brought as a petition for writ of habeas corpus,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 303. On Skinner\u2019s petition,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we granted certiorari, 560 U.S. 924, 130 S. Ct. 3323, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1219 (2010), and now reverse the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Because this case was resolved on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the question below was \u201cnot whether</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">[562 U.S. 530]</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">[Skinner] will ultimately prevail\u201d on his procedural due process claim, see <em>Scheuer </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 40 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>90 (1974), but whether his complaint was sufficient to cross the federal court\u2019s threshold, see <em>Swierkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sorema N. A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 514, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). Skinner\u2019s complaint is not a model of the careful drafter\u2019s art, but  under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need not pin plaintiffs claim for relief to a precise legal theory. Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure generally requires only a plausible \u201cshort and plain\u201d statement of the plaintiffs claim, not an exposition of his legal argument. See 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 1219, pp. 277-278 (3d ed. 2004 and Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph alleging that the State\u2019s refusal \u201cto release the biological evidence for testing . . . has deprived [him] of his liberty interests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence . . . .\u201d Complaint \u00b633, App. 20-21. As earlier recounted, see <em>supra, </em>at 528-529, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 240-241, Skinner had twice requested and failed to obtain DNA testing under the only state-law procedure then available to him. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b622-31, App. 14-20.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At oral argument in this Court, Skinner\u2019s counsel clarified the gist of Skinner\u2019s due process claim: He does not challenge the prosecutor\u2019s conduct or the decisions reached by the CCA in applying Article 64 to his motions; instead, he challenges, as denying him procedural due process, Texas\u2019 postconviction DNA statute \u201cas construed\u201d by the Texas courts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. See also <em>id., </em>at 52-53 (Texas courts, Skinner\u2019s counsel argued, have \u201cconstrued the statute to completely foreclose any prisoner who could have sought DNA testing prior to trial[,] but did not[,] from seeking testing\u201d postconviction).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">[562 U.S. 531]</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The merits of Skinner\u2019s federal-court complaint assailing the Texas statute as authoritatively construed, and particularly the vitality of his claim in light of <em>Osborne, </em>see <em>supra, </em>at 525, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 239\u2014unad-dressed by the District Court or the Fifth Circuit\u2014are not ripe for review. We take up here only the questions whether there is federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner\u2019s complaint, and whether the claim he presses is cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Respondent Switzer asserts that Skinner\u2019s challenge is \u201c[j]urisdictionally [blarred\u201d by what has come to be known as the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Brief for Respondent 48-49 (boldface deleted). In line with the courts below, we conclude that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not bar Skinner\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">As we explained in <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. </em>v. <em>Saudi Basic Industries Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S. Ct. 1517, 161 L. Ed. 2d 454 (2005), the <em>Rooker-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>Feldman </em>doctrine has been applied by this Court only twice, <em>i.e., </em>only in the two cases from which the doctrine takes its name: first, <em>Rooker </em>v. <em>Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S. Ct. 149, 68 L. Ed. 362 (1923), then 60 years later, <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S. Ct. 1303, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1983). Both cases fit this pattern: The losing party in state court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> filed suit in a U. S. District Court after the state proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court judgment and seeking federal-court review and rejection of that judgment. Alleging federal-question jurisdiction, the plaintiffs in <em>Rooker </em>and <em>Feldman </em>asked the District Court to overturn the injurious state-court judgment. We held, in both cases, that the  District Courts lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over such</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">[562 U.S. 532]</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">claims, for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257 \u201cvests authority to review a state court\u2019s judgment solely in this Court.\u201d See <em>Exxon, </em>544 U.S., at 292, 125 S. Ct. 1517, 161 L. Ed. 2d 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We observed in <em>Exxon </em>that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine had been construed by some federal courts \u201cto extend far beyond the contours of the <em>Rooker </em>and <em>Feldman </em>cases.\u201d 544 U.S., at 283, 125 S. Ct. 1517, 161 L. Ed. 2d 454. Emphasizing \u201cthe narrow ground\u201d occupied by the doctrine, <em>id., </em>at 284, 125 S. Ct. 1517, 161 L. Ed. 2d 454, we clarified in <em>Exxon </em>that  <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>\u201cis confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers . . . inviting district court review and rejection of [the state court\u2019s] judgments,\u201d 544 U.S., at 284, 125 S. Ct. 1517, 161 L. Ed. 2d 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Skinner\u2019s litigation, in light of <em>Exxon, </em>encounters no <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>shoal.  \u201cIf a federal plaintiff \u2018pres-ent\u00eds] [an] independent claim,\u2019 \u201d it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction that the \u201csame or a related question\u201d was earlier aired between the parties in state court. 544 U.S., at 292-293, 125 S. Ct. 1517, 161 L. Ed. 2d 454 (quoting <em>GASH Assocs. </em>v. <em>Rosemont, </em>995 F.2d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); first alteration in original); see <em>In re Smith, </em>349 Fed. Appx. 12, 18 (CA6 2009) (Sutton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (a defendant\u2019s federal challenge to the adequacy of state-law procedures for postconviction DNA testing is not within the \u201climited grasp\u201d of <em>Rooker-Feldman).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">As earlier noted, see <em>supra, </em>at 530, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 242, Skinner does not challenge the adverse CCA decisions themselves; instead, he targets as unconstitutional the Texas statute they authoritatively construed. As the Court explained in <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S., at 487, 103 S. Ct. 1303, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, and reiterated in <em>Exxon, </em>544 U.S., at 286, 125 S. Ct. 1517, 161 L. Ed. 2d 454,  a state-court decision is not reviewable by lower federal courts, but a statute or rule governing the decision may be challenged in a federal action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Skinner\u2019s federal case falls</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">[562 U.S. 533]</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">within the latter category. There was, therefore, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner\u2019s federal suit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">When may a state prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, pursue a civil rights claim under \u00a7 1983, and when is habeas corpus the prisoner\u2019s sole remedy? This Court has several times considered that question. Pathmarking here is <em>Heck </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994). The plaintiff in that litigation was a state prisoner serving time for manslaughter. He brought a \u00a7 1983 action for damages, alleging that he had been unlawfully investigated, arrested, tried, and convicted. Although the complaint in <em>Heck </em>sought monetary damages only, not release from confinement, we ruled that the plaintiff could not proceed under \u00a7 1983. Any award in his favor, we observed, would \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalidity of his conviction. See <em>id., </em>at 487, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383.  When \u201ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d the Court held, \u00a7 1983 is not an available remedy. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cBut if . . . the plaintiffs action, even if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of [his conviction or sentence], the [\u00a7 1983] action should be allowed to proceed . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We summarized the relevant case law most recently in <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253 (2005). That case involved prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.

Success in his suit for DNA testing would not \u201cnecessarily imply\u201d the invalidity of his conviction. While test results might prove exculpatory, that outcome is hardly inevitable; as earlier observed, see <em>supra, </em>at 525, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 239, results might prove inconclusive or they might further incriminate Skinner. See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>541 U.S. 637, 647, 124 S. Ct. 2117, 158 L. Ed. 2d 924 (2004) (\u201c[W]e were careful in <em>Heck </em>to stress the importance of the term \u2018necessarily\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Respondent Switzer nevertheless argues, in line with Fifth Circuit precedent, see <em>Kutzner, </em>303 F.3d, at 341, that Skinner\u2019s request for DNA testing must be pursued, if at all, in an application for habeas corpus, not in a \u00a7 1983 action. The dissent echoes Switzer\u2019s argument. See <em>post, </em>at 539, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 247-248. Although Skin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ner\u2019s <em>immediate </em>plea is simply for an order requiring DNA testing, his <em>ultimate </em>aim, Switzer urges, is to use the test results as a platform for attacking his conviction. It suffices to point out that Switzer has found no case, nor has the dissent, in which the Court has recognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available one, where the relief sought would \u201cneither terminat[e] custody, accelerate] the future date of release from custody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody\u201d <em>Dotson, </em>544 U.S., at 86, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Respondent Switzer and her <em>amici </em>forecast that a \u201cvast expansion of federal jurisdiction . . . would ensue\u201d were we to hold that Skinner\u2019s complaint can be initiated under \u00a7 1983. See Brief for National District Attorneys Association as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>8. In particular, they predict a proliferation of federal civil actions \u201cseeking postconviction discovery of evidence [and] other relief inescapably associated</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">[562 U.S. 535]</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">with the central questions of guilt or punishment.\u201d Id., at 6. These fears, shared by the dissent, <em>post, </em>at 542, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 249-250, are unwarranted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In the Circuits that currently allow \u00a7 1983 claims for DNA testing, see <em>supra, </em>at 524, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 238, no evidence tendered by Switzer shows any litigation flood or even rainfall. The projected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding DNA testing claims, for <em>Osborne </em>has rejected substantive due process as a basis for such claims. See <em>supra, </em>at 525, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">More generally, in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321-66, Congress has placed a series of controls on prisoner suits, constraints designed to prevent sportive filings in federal court. See, <em>e.g., </em>PLRA \u00a7 803(d) (adding 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e to create new procedures and penalties for prisoner lawsuits under \u00a7 1983); PLRA \u00a7 804(a)(3) (adding 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1) to require any prisoner proceeding <em>in forma pau-peris </em>to pay the full filing fee out of a percentage of his prison trust account); PLRA \u00a7 804(c)(3) (adding 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(f) to require prisoners to pay the full amount of any cost assessed against them out of their prison trust account); PLRA \u00a7 804(d) (adding 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) to revoke, with limited exception, <em>in forma pau-peris </em>privileges for any prisoner who has filed three or more</p>\n<p id=\"AP7\">[562 U.S. 536]</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">lawsuits that fail to state a claim, or are malicious or frivolous). See also <em>Crawford-El </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>523 U.S. 574, 596-597, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1998) (PLRA aims to \u201cdiscourage prisoners from filing claims that are unlikely to succeed,\u201d and statistics suggest that the Act is \u201chaving its intended effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Nor do we see any cause for concern that today\u2019s ruling will spill over to claims relying on <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963); indeed, Switzer makes no such assertion. <em>Brady </em>announced a constitutional requirement addressed first and foremost to the prosecution\u2019s conduct pretrial. <em>Brady </em>proscribes withholding evidence \u201cfavorable to an accused\u201d and \u201cmaterial to [his] guilt or to punishment.\u201d <em>Cone </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>556 U.S. 449, 451, 129 S. Ct. 1769, 173 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2009). To establish that a <em>Brady </em>violation undermines a conviction, a convicted defendant must make each of three showings: (1) the evidence at issue is \u201cfavorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching\u201d (2) the State suppressed the evidence, \u201ceither willfully or inadvertently\u201d and (3) \u201cprejudice . . . ensued.\u201d <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-282, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1999); see <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 691, 124 S. Ct. 1256, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1166 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory, incriminating, or inconclusive results, a <em>Brady </em>claim, when successful postconviction, necessarily yields evidence undermining a conviction: <em>Brady </em>evidence is, by definition, always favorable to the defendant and material to his guilt or punishment. See <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S., at 296, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286. And parties asserting <em>Brady </em>violations postconviction generally do seek a judgment qualifying them for \u201cimmediate or speedier release\u201d from imprisonment. See <em>Dotson, </em>544 U.S., at 82, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253. Accordingly, <em>Brady </em>claims have ranked within the traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of \u00a7 1983. See <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S., at 479, 490, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L.

Then, in <em>Heck </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>we addressed \u00a7 1983 actions seeking damages. 512 U.S., at 483, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383. Determining that such actions were not covered by <em>Preiser, </em>we returned to \u201cthe hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments,\u201d 512 U.S., at 486, 114 S.

Challenges to all state procedures for reviewing the validity of a conviction should be treated the same as challenges to state trial procedures, which we have already recognized may not be brought under \u00a7 1983. Moreover, allowing such challenges under \u00a7 1983 would undermine Congress\u2019 strict limitations on federal review of state habeas decisions.

This has long been recognized for direct appellate review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">\u201cAnd while the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that a State shall provide for an appellate review in criminal cases, it is perfectly obvious that where such an appeal is provided for, and the prisoner has had the benefit of it, the proceedings in the appellate tribunal are to be regarded as part of the process of law under which he is held in custody by the State, and to be considered in determining any question of alleged deprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Mangum, </em>237 U.S. 309, 327, 35 S. Ct. 582, 59 L. Ed. 969 (1915) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Similarly, although a State is not required to provide procedures for post-conviction review, it seems clear that when state collateral review procedures are provided for, they too are part of the \u201cprocess of law under which [a prisoner] is held in custody by the State.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As this Court has explained, when considering whether the State has provided all the process that is due in depriving an individual of life, liberty, or property, we must look at both pre- and post-deprivation process. See <em>Cleveland Bd. of Ed. </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 547, n. 12, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985) (\u201c[T]he existence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the necessary scope of pretermination procedures\u201d); see also <em>National Private Truck Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>515 U.S. 582, 587, 115 S. Ct. 2351, 132 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1995); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 349, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). There is no principled reason this Court should refuse to allow \u00a7 1983 suits to challenge part of this process\u2014the trial proceedings\u2014but bless the use of \u00a7 1983 to challenge other parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">[562 U.S. 541]</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Collateral review procedures are, of course, \u201cnot part of the criminal proceeding itself.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 557, 107 S. Ct. 1990, 95 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1987). But like trial and direct appellate procedures, they concern the validity of the conviction. Trial procedures are used to initially convict a prisoner; appellate procedures review the validity of that conviction before it becomes final; and collateral review procedures permit challenge to the conviction after it is final. For purposes of deciding which claims fall within the bounds of \u00a7 1983,1 think it makes sense to treat similarly all constitutional challenges to procedures concerning the validity of a conviction. See <em>Heck, supra, </em>at 491, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]t is proper for the Court to devise limitations aimed at ameliorating the conflict [between habeas and \u00a7 1983], provided that it does so in a principled fashion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Second, \u201cprinciples of federalism and comity [are] at stake\u201d when federal courts review state collateral review procedures, just as when they review state trial procedures. <em>Osborne, </em>557 U.S., at 76, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (Alito, J., concurring). An attack in federal court on any \u201cstate judicial action\u201d concerning a state conviction must proceed with \u201cproper respect for state functions,\u201d because the federal courts are being asked to \u201ctr [y] the regularity of proceedings had in courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Preiser, </em>411 U.S., at 491, 93 S. Ct. 1827, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Because of these concerns for federal-state comity, Congress has strictly limited the procedures for federal habeas challenges to state convictions and state habeas decisions. Congress requires that before a state prisoner may seek relief in federal court, he must \u201cexhausft] the remedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). And state habeas determinations receive significant deference in subsequent federal habeas proceedings. \u00a7 2254(d). These requirements ensure that the state courts have the first opportunity to correct any error with a state conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">[562 U.S. 542]</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">and that their rulings receive due respect in subsequent federal challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">By bringing a procedural challenge under \u00a7 1983, Skinner undermines these restrictions. For example, Skinner has never presented his current challenge to Texas\u2019 procedures for postconviction relief to the Texas courts. Allowing Skinner to artfully plead an attack on state habeas <em>procedures </em>instead of an attack on state habeas <em>results </em>undercuts the restrictions Congress and this Court have placed on federal review of state convictions. See <em>Osborne, supra, </em>at 76-79, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (Alito, J., concurring). To allege that the Texas courts erred in denying him relief on collateral review, Skinner could only file a federal habeas petition, with its accompanying procedural restrictions and deferential review. But a successful challenge to Texas\u2019 collateral review procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>under \u00a7 1983 would impeach the result of collateral review without complying with any of the restrictions for relief in federal habeas.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The majority contends that its decision will not \u201cspill over to claims relying on <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963).\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 536, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 246; but cf. <em>Osborne, supra, </em>at 77-78, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (Alito, J., concurring). In truth, the majority provides a roadmap for any unsuccessful state habeas petitioner to relitigate his claim under \u00a7 1983: After state habeas is denied, file a \u00a7 1983 suit challenging the state ha-beas process rather than the result. What prisoner would not avail himself of this additional bite at the apple?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">[562 U.S. 543]</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The majority relies on <em>Dotson </em>to reach its conclusion. In that case, the plaintiffs alleged due process violations in state parole adjudications and sought injunctive relief and \u201ca new parole hearing conducted under constitutionally proper procedures.\u201d 544 U.S., at 77, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253. We found the claims cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\"><em>Dotson </em>does not control this case. Unlike state collateral review, parole does not evaluate the validity of the underlying state conviction or sentence. Collateral review permits prisoners to \u201cattack their final convictions.\u201d <em>Osborne, supra, </em>at 76, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (Alito, J., concurring). In contrast, parole may provide release, but whether or not a prisoner is paroled in no way relates to the validity of the underlying conviction or sentence. Whatever the correctness of <em>Dotson, </em>parole procedures do not review the validity of a conviction or sentence. For that reason, permitting review of parole procedures does not similarly risk transforming \u00a7 1983 into a vehicle for \u201cchallenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S., at 486, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, <em>Dotson </em>did not reduce the question whether a claim is cognizable under \u00a7 1983 to a single inquiry into whether the prisoner\u2019s claim would \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>at 533-535, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 244-245, and n. 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we recognized in <em>Heck, </em>evaluating the boundaries of \u00a7 1983 is not a narrow, mechanical inquiry. Even when the relief sought was not \u201cspeedier release,\u201d we inquired further and returned to first principles to determine that the chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>lenge in that case</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">[562 U.S. 544]</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">was not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See 512 U.S., at 486, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383. <em>Dotson </em>does not suggest that the <em>Heck </em>approach, which I would continue to follow here, was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"pAVc\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"37\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQgAAAAlAQAAAACWyEoOAAAAiklEQVR4nO3TMQrCQBAF0D9DCjtzAclFxLPlRmKXMoUHyBnSWYmdheRb5sNfSCMRQrZ7n5ndWZYNYmHlUsHmKnoNHCQbyjL8aI7h1M52JNBJVkAC54+EBZCvm0zvADkdJXQkELVsXAD5vkqbI4FHSJsjgfEgN3QkcK+krQDyeZGjHeu8bex/7g8VXwZA0jSsos75AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"265\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">This Court has struggled to limit \u00a7 1983 and prevent it from intruding into the boundaries of habeas corpus. In crafting these limits, we have recognized that suits seeking \u201cimmediate or speedier release\u201d from confinement fall outside its scope. <em>Dotson, supra, </em>at 82, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253. We found another limit when faced with a civil action in which \u201ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Heck, supra, </em>at 487, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383. This case calls for yet another: due process challenges to state procedures used to review the validity of a conviction or sentence. Under that rule, Skinner\u2019s claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-12\">. I adopt the majority\u2019s view that Skinner has alleged a violation of procedural due process despite the fact that his complaint is more naturally read as alleging a violation of <em>substantive </em>due process. I also ignore the questionable premise that the requested relief\u2014DNA testing\u2014would be available in a procedural due process challenge. Compare <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 77, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253 (2005) (seeking \u201ca new parole hearing conducted under constitutionally proper procedures\u201d), with <em>Osborne, </em>557 U.S., at 78, n. 1, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (Alito, J., concurring) (distinguishing <em>Dotson </em>because Osborne sought \u201c \u2018exculpatory\u2019 evidence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-13\">. Skinner challenges Texas\u2019Article 64, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 64.01 <em>et seq. </em>(Vernon 2006 and Supp. 2010), which provides for postconviction discovery of DNA evidence that can then be used in a state habeas proceeding to challenge the validity of a conviction. See <em>Ard </em>v. <em>State, </em>191 S.W.3d 342, 344 (Tex. App. 2006). Article 64 does not itself \u201cprovide a vehicle for obtaining relief,\u201d <em>Ex parte Tuley, </em>109 S.W.3d 388, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002), but rather is by design and by nature part of Texas\u2019 collateral review procedures. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 8 (\u201cBecause [Article 64] does not give the convicting court authority to overturn a conviction, the prisoner still must bring a habeas proceeding to challenge the conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">Although Article 64 is, for the purposes of Skinner\u2019s due process challenge, part of the state collateral review process, I do not suggest that a motion under Article 64 is an \u201capplication for . . . collateral review\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). See <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Kholi, post, </em>at 556, n. 4, 131 S. Ct. 1278, 179 L. Ed. 2d 252 (noting that an application for review must \u201cprovide a state court with authority to order relief from a judgment\u201d). Texas has divided postconviction discovery of DNA evidence and the application for state habeas into separate proceedings, but both remain parts of the State\u2019s collateral review process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\">. Nor is there any reason to believe that the Court\u2019s holding will be cabined to collateral review procedures. The Court does not discuss whether a State\u2019s direct review process may be subject to challenge under \u00a7 1983, but it suggests no principled distinction between direct and collateral review. This risks transforming \u00a7 1983 into a vehicle for direct criminal appeals. Cf. <em>Heck </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994). Just as any unsuccessful state habeas petitioner will now resort to \u00a7 1983 and challenge state collateral review procedures, so, too, will unsuccessful appellants turn to \u00a7 1983 to challenge the state appellate procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\">. Because parole procedures are unrelated to the validity of a conviction, a \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release\u2019\u2019 test may sufficiently summarize the analysis of \u00a7 1983 challenges to parole procedures.
