Those facilities, here called \u201c340B\u201d or \u201ccovered\u201d entities, include public hospitals and community health centers, many of them providers of safety-net services to the poor. The \u00a7 340B ceiling-price program (340B Program) is superintended by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Drug manufacturers opt into the 340B Program by signing a form Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement (PPA) used nationwide. PPAs are not transactional, bargained-for contracts. They are uniform agreements that recite the responsibilities \u00a7 340B imposes, respectively, on drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS. Manufacturers\u2019 eligibility to participate in State Medicaid programs is conditioned on their entry into PPAs for covered drugs purchased by 340B entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">It is conceded that  Congress authorized no private right of action under \u00a7 340B for covered entities who claim they have been charged prices exceeding the statutory ceiling. This case presents the question whether 340B entities, though accorded no right to sue for overcharges under the statute itself, may nonetheless sue allegedly overcharging manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs to which the manufacturers subscribed. We hold that suits by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS are incompatible with the statutory regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">[563 U.S. 114]</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">Congress placed the Secretary (acting through her designate, HRSA) in control of \u00a7 340B\u2019s drug-price prescriptions. That control could not be maintained were potentially thousands of covered entities permitted to bring suits alleging errors in manufacturers\u2019 price calculations. If 340B entities may not sue under the statute, it would make scant sense to allow them to sue on a form contract implementing the statute, setting out terms identical to those contained in the statute. Though labeled differently, suits to enforce \u00a7 340B and suits to enforce PPAs are in substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>one and the same. Their treatment, therefore, must be the same, \u201c[n]o matter the clothing in which [340B entities] dress their claims.\u201d <em>Tenet </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>544 U.S. 1, 8, 125 S. Ct. 1230, 161 L. Ed. 2d 82 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The 340B Program is tied to the earlier-enacted, much larger Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Adopted by Congress in 1990, the Medicaid Rebate Program covers a significant portion of drug purchases in the United States. See GAO, J. Dicken, Prescription Drugs: Oversight of Drug Pricing in Federal Programs 1 (GAO-0748IT, 2007) (testimony before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n                   To gain payment under Medicaid for covered drugs, a manufacturer must enter a standardized agreement with HHS; in the agreement, the manufacturer undertakes to provide rebates to States on their Medicaid drug purchases. 104 Stat. 1388-143, as amended, 124 Stat. 3290, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-8(a). The amount of the rebates depends on the manufacturer\u2019s \u201caverage\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">[563 U.S. 115]</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">and \u201cbest\u201d prices, as defined by legislation and regulation. \u00a7 1396r-8(c), (k).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Calculation of a manufacturer\u2019s \u201caverage\u201d and \u201cbest\u201d prices, undertaken by the pharmaceutical company, is a complex enterprise requiring recourse to detailed information about the company\u2019s sales and pricing. \u00a7 1396r-8(k); 42 CFR \u00a7 447.500-520 (2010). To enable HHS to calculate the rebate rate for each drug, manufacturers submit the relevant data to HHS on a quarterly basis. \u00a7 1396r-8(b)(3). With exceptions set out in the legislation, HHS is prohibited from disclosing the submitted information \u201cin a form which discloses the identity of a specific manufacturer . . . [or] prices charged for drugs by such manufacturer.\u201d \u00a7 1396r-8(b)(3)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Under \u00a7 340B, added in 1992, 106 Stat. 4967, as amended, 124 Stat. 823, manufacturers participating in Medicaid must offer discounted drugs to covered entities, dominantly, local facilities that provide medical care for the poor. See \u00a7 256b(a); \u00a7 1396r-8(a)(1) (2006 ed.). The 340B Program, like the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, employs a form contract as an opt-in mechanism. The 340B Program also draws on the larger scheme\u2019s pricing methodology. In their 340B Program contracts with HHS, called Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreements (PPAs), see <em>supra, </em>at 113, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 465, manufacturers agree to charge covered entities no more than predetermined ceiling prices, derived from the \u201caverage\u201d and \u201cbest\u201d prices and rebates calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. \u00a7 256b(a)(l) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 165a-171a (PPA \u00a7 I-ID.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">If a manufacturer overcharges a covered entity, HRSA may require the manufacturer to reimburse the covered entity; HRSA may also terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the manufacturer\u2019s PPA,</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">[563 U.S. 116]</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00a7 1396r-8(b)(4)(B)(i), (v) (2006 ed.); App. to Pet. for Cert. 174a (PPA \u00a7 IV(c)), which terminates as well the manufacturer\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid coverage of its drugs, \u00a7 1396r-8(a)(l), (5). Currently, HRSA handles overcharge complaints through informal procedures. Manufacturer Audit Guidelines and Dispute Resolution Process, 61 Fed. Reg. 65412 (1996). The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Pub. L. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119, provides for more rigorous enforcement. The PPACA directs the Secretary to develop formal procedures for resolving overcharge claims. <em>Id., </em>at 826, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b(d)(3)(A) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Under those procedures, which are not yet in place, HRSA will reach an \u201cadministrative resolution\u201d that is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq. </em>See 124 Stat. 827, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b(d)(3)(C). In addition to authorizing compensation awards to overcharged entities, the PPACA provides for the imposition of monetary penalties payable to the Government. <em>Id., </em>at 824-825, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b(d)(l)(B)(ii), (vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Respondent Santa Clara County (County), operator of several 340B entities, commenced suit against As-tra and eight other pharmaceutical companies, alleging that the companies were overcharging 340B healthcare facilities in violation of the PPAs to which the companies subscribed. The County styled its suit a class action on behalf of both 340B entities in California and the counties that fund those entities. Asserting that the 340B entities and the counties that fund them are the intended beneficiaries of the PPAs, the County sought compensatory damages for the pharmaceutical companies\u2019 breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding that the PPAs conferred no enforceable rights on 340B entities. Reversing the District Court\u2019s judgment, the Ninth Circuit held that covered entities, although they have no</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">[563 U.S. 117]</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">right to sue under the statute, could maintain the action as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs. 588 F.3d 1237, 1241 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">We granted certiorari, 561 U.S. 1057, 131 S. Ct. 61, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1151 (2010),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now reverse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b564-15\">As the County conceded below and before this Court, see 588 F.3d, at 1249; Tr. of Oral Arg. 45,  covered entities have no right of action under \u00a7 340B itself. \u201c[Recognition of any private right of action for violating a federal statute,\u201d currently governing decisions instruct, \u201cmust ultimately rest on congressional intent to provide a private remedy.\u201d <em>Virginia Bankshares, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>501 U.S. 1083, 1102, 111 S. Ct. 2749, 115 L. Ed. 2d 929 (1991). See also <em>Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC </em>v. <em>Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 148, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>164, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627 (2008); <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. 275, 286, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2001). Congress vested authority to oversee compliance with the 340B Program in HHS and assigned no auxiliary enforcement role to covered entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Notwithstanding its inability to assert a statutory right of action, the County maintains that the PPAs implementing the 340B Program are agreements enforceable by covered entities as third-party beneficiaries.  A nonparty becomes legally entitled to a benefit promised in a contract, the County recognizes, only if the contracting parties so intend. Brief for Respondent 31 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302(l)(b) (1979)). The PPAs \u201cspecifically</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">[563 U.S. 118]</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">nam[e]\u201d covered entities as the recipients of discounted drugs, the County observes; indeed the very object of the agreements is to ensure that those entities would be \u201ccharge [d] ... no more than the ceiling price.\u201d Brief for Respondent 33. When the Government uses a contract to secure a benefit, the County urges, the intended recipient acquires a right to the benefit enforceable under federal common law. <em>Id., </em>at 30. But see 9 J. Murray, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 45.6, p. 92 (rev. ed. 2007) ([10] \u201cThe distinction between an intention to benefit a third party and an intention that the third party should have the right to enforce that intention is emphasized where the promisee is a governmental entity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The County\u2019s argument overlooks that the  PPAs simply incorporate statutory obligations and record the manufacturers\u2019 agreement to abide by them. The form agreements, composed by HHS, contain no negotiable terms. Like the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program agreements, see <em>supra, </em>at 114-115, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 466, the 340B Program agreements serve as the means by which drug manufacturers opt into the statutory scheme. A third-party suit to enforce an HHS-drug manufacturer agreement, therefore, is in essence a suit to enforce the statute itself. The absence of a private right to enforce the statutory ceiling-price obligations would be rendered meaningless if 340B entities could overcome that obstacle by suing to enforce the contract\u2019s ceiling-price obligations instead. The statutory and contractual obligations, in short, are one and the same. See <em>Grochowski </em>v. <em>Phoenix Construction, </em>318 F.3d 80, 86 (CA2 2003) (  when a government contract confirms a statutory obligation, \u201ca third-party private contract action [to enforce that obligation] would be inconsistent with . . . the legislative scheme ... to the same extent as would a cause of action directly under the statute\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Telling in this regard, the County based its suit on allegations that the manufacturers charged more than the \u00a7 340B ceiling price, see, <em>e.g., </em>Third Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">[563 U.S. 119]</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">in No. 3:05-cv-03740 (ND Cal.), \u00b6\u00b61, 65, not that they violated any independent substantive obligation arising only from the PPAs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Repeatedly, the County acknowledged that \u00a7 340B is the source of the contractual term allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>breached. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>\u00b628 (\u201c[Section] 340B requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure that \u00a7 340B Participants pay no more than the \u2018ceiling price\u2019... for any pharmaceutical product.\u201d); <em>id., </em>\u00b636 (\u201cUnder both \u00a7 340B and the PPA, [drug manufacturers] are required to ensure that the \u00a7 340B Participants . . . pay no more for any product than the \u00a7 340B ceiling price.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The Ninth Circuit determined that \u201c[p]ermitting covered entities to sue as intended beneficiaries of the PPA is . . . wholly compatible with the Section 340B program\u2019s objectives\u201d to ensure \u201cthat drug companies comply with their obligations under the program and provide [the required] discounts.\u201d 588 F.3d, at 1251. Suits like the County\u2019s, the Court of Appeals reasoned, would spread the enforcement burden instead of placing it \u201c[entirely] on the government.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Price </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>823 F.2d 1114, 1121 (CA7 1987)). But spreading the enforcement burden, the United States stressed, both in the Ninth Circuit and in this Court, is hardly what Congress contemplated when it \u201ccentralized enforcement in the government.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>32; see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in No. 09-15216 (CA9), p. 13 (County\u2019s challenge is at</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">[563 U.S. 120]</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">odds with Congress\u2019 unitary administrative and enforcement scheme).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Congress made HHS administrator of both the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Program, the United States observed, Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>33-34, and \u201c[t]he interdependent nature of the two programs\u2019 requirements means that an adjudication of rights under one program must proceed with an eye towards any implications for the other,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 34. Far from assisting HHS, suits by 340B entities would undermine the agency\u2019s efforts to administer both Medicaid and \u00a7 340B harmoniously and on a uniform, nationwide basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Recognizing the County\u2019s right to proceed in court could spawn a multitude of dispersed and uncoordinated lawsuits by 340B entities. With HHS unable to hold the control rein, the risk of conflicting adjudications would be substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"Aefr\">[563 U.S. 121]</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">As earlier noted, see <em>supra, </em>at 115, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 465,  the Medic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>aid Rebate Program\u2019s statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing information in a form that could reveal the prices a manufacturer charges for drugs it produces. \u00a7 1396r-8(b)(3)(D).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This ban on disclosure is a further indication of the incompatibility of private suits with the statute Congress enacted. If Congress meant to leave open the prospect of third-party beneficiary suits by 340B entities, it likely would not have barred the potential suitors from obtaining the very information necessary to determine whether their asserted rights have been violated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">It is true, as the Ninth Circuit observed, that HHS\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has published reports finding that \u201cHRSA lacks the oversight mechanisms and authority to ensure that [covered] entities pay at or below the . . . ceiling price.\u201d 588 F.3d, at 1242 (quoting OIG, D. Levin-son, Deficiencies in the Oversight of the 340B Drug Pricing Program, p. ii (OE1-05-02-00072, Oct. 2005)). See also 588 F.3d, at 1242-1243 (citing OIG, D. Levinson, Review of 340B Prices 11 (OE1-05-02-00073, July 2006) (estimating that covered entities overpaid $3.9 million in June 2005 alone)). But Congress did not respond to the reports of inadequate HRSA enforcement by inviting 340B entities to launch lawsuits in district courts across the country. Instead,  in the PPACA, Congress directed HRSA to create a formal dispute resolution procedure, institute refund and civil penalty systems, and perform audits of manufacturers. 124 Stat. 823-827, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b(d).
