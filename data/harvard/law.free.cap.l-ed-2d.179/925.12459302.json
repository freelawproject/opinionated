Brief in Opposition 2. They seek a judicial order that would require their release from custody <em>into the United States. </em>The District Court concluded that the law entitled petitioners to such an order. <em>In re Guantanamo Bay Detainee Litigation, </em>581 F. Supp. 2d 33 (DC 2008). The Court of Appeals held to the contrary. <em>Kiyemba </em>v. <em>Obama, </em>555 F.3d 1022 (CADC 2009). And this Court initially granted certiorari to resolve the important question whether a district court may order the release of an unlawfully held prisoner into the United States <em>where no other remedy is available. Kiyemba </em>v. <em>Obama, </em>558 U.S. 969, 130 S. Ct. 458, 175 L. Ed. 2d 306 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">The Court subsequently learned that each of the remaining petitioners had received and rejected at least two offers of resettlement. In light of these changed circumstances, the Court vacated the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision and remanded the case to the lower courts to \u201cdetermine, in the first instance, what further proceedings in that court or in the District Court are necessary and appropriate for the full and prompt disposition of the case in light of the new developments.\u201d <em>Kiyemba </em>v. <em>Obama, </em>559 U.S. 131, 132, 130 S. Ct. 1235, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1070 (2010) <em>(per curiam). </em>The Court of Appeals found that no further proceedings were necessary and reinstated its prior opinion as modified. 605 F.3d 1046 (CADC 2010) <em>(per curiam). </em>Petitioners have asked this Court to review the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1023-18\">Judge Rogers,</author>\n<p id=\"AzJIU\">separately concurring in the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment on remand, pointed out that petitioners have \u201creceived two offers of resettlement in countries [including Palau, which] the United States determined \u2018appropriate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1050, n. 3.

At the same time, the Government tells us that \u201cif petitioners were to express interest, the United States would again discuss the matter with the government of Palau [and that it] continues to work to find other options for resettlement.\u201d Brief in Opposition 13, n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">In my view, these offers, the lack of any meaningful challenge as to their appropriateness, and the Government\u2019s uncontested commitment to continue to work to resettle petitioners transform petitioners\u2019 claim. Under present circumstances, I see no Government-imposed obstacle to petitioners\u2019 timely release and appropriate resettlement. Accordingly, I join in the Court\u2019s denial of certiorari. Should circumstances materially change, however, petitioners may of course raise their original issue (or related issues) again in the lower courts and in this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
