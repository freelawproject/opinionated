One of those exemptions covers law enforcement records, the disclosure of which \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). The question presented is whether corporations have \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d for the purposes of this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">The Freedom of Information Act request at issue in this case relates to an investigation of respondent AT&amp;T Inc., conducted by the Federal Communications Commission. AT&amp;T participated in an FCC-administered program\u2014the E-Rate (or Education-Rate) program\u2014that was created to enhance access for schools and libraries to advanced telecommunications and information services. In August 2004, AT&amp;T voluntarily reported to the FCC that it might have overcharged the Government for services it provided as part of the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau launched an investigation. As part of that investigation, AT&amp;T provided the Bureau various documents, including responses to interrogatories, invoices, e-mails with pricing and billing information, names and job descriptions of employees involved, and AT&amp;T\u2019s assessment of whether those employees had violated the company\u2019s code of conduct. 582 F.3d 490, 492-493 (CA3 2009). The FCC and AT&amp;T resolved the matter in December 2004 through a consent decree in which AT&amp;T\u2014without conceding liability\u2014 agreed to pay the Government $500,000 and to institute a plan to ensure compliance with the program. See 19 FCC Red. 24014, 24016-24019.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Several months later, CompTel\u2014\u201ca trade association representing some of AT&amp;T\u2019s competitors\u201d\u2014submitted a FOIA request seeking \u201c \u2018[a]ll pleadings and correspondence\u2019 \u201d in the Bureau\u2019s file on the AT&amp;T investigation. 582 F.3d, at 493. AT&amp;T opposed CompTel\u2019s request, and the Bureau issued a letter-ruling in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">[562 U.S. 401]</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The Bureau concluded that some of the information AT&amp;T had provided (including cost and pricing data, billing-related information, and identifying information about staff, contractors, and customer representatives) should be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4, which relates to \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4). App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a-41a. The Bureau also decided to withhold other information under FOIA Exemption 7(C).  Exemption 7(C) exempts \u201crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). The Bureau concluded that \u201cindividuals identified in [AT&amp;T\u2019s] submissions\u201d have \u201cprivacy rights\u201d that warrant protection under Exemption 7(C). <em>Id., </em>at 43a. The Bureau did not, however, apply that exemption to the corporation itself, reasoning that \u201cbusinesses do not possess \u2018personal privacy\u2019 interests as required\u201d by the exemption. <em>Id., </em>at 42a-43a.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">On review the FCC agreed with the Bureau. The Commission found AT&amp;T\u2019s position that it is \u201ca \u2018private corporate citizen\u2019 with personal privacy rights that should be protected from disclosure that would \u2018embarrass\u2019 it . . . within the meaning of Exemption 7(C) . . . at odds with established [FCC] and judicial precedent.\u201d 23 FCC Red. 13704, 13707 (2008). It therefore concluded that \u201cExemption 7(C) has no applicability to corporations such as [AT&amp;T].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13710.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">AT&amp;T sought review in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and that court rejected the FCC\u2019s reasoning. Noting that Congress had defined the word \u201cperson\u201d to include corporations as well as individuals, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(2), the court held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d of corporations, since \u201cthe root from which the statutory word [personal] ... is derived\u201d is the defined term \u201cperson.\u201d 582 F.3d, at 497. As the court explained, \u201c [i]t would be very odd indeed for an adjectival form of a defined term not to refer back to that defined term.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court</p>\n<p id=\"Abk\">[562 U.S. 402]</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">accordingly ruled \u201cthat FOIA\u2019s text unambiguously indicates that a corporation may have a \u2018personal privacy\u2019 interest within the meaning of Exemption 7(C).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">The FCC petitioned this Court for review of the Third Circuit\u2019s decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>and CompTel filed as a respondent supporting petitioners. We granted certiorari, 561 U.S. 1057, 131 S. Ct. 61, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1151 (2010), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Like the Court of Appeals below, AT&amp;T relies on the argument that the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in Exemption 7(C) incorporates the statutory definition of the word \u201cperson.\u201d See Brief for Respondent AT&amp;T 8-9, 14-15 (AT&amp;T Brief); 582 F.3d, at 497.  The Administrative Procedure Act defines \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201can individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than an agency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(2). Because that definition applies here, the argument goes, \u201cpersonal\u201d must mean relating to those \u201cperson [s]\u201d: namely, corporations and other entities as well as individuals. This reading, we are told, is dictated by a \u201cbasic principle of grammar and usage.\u201d AT&amp;T Brief 8; see <em>id., </em>at 14-15; see also 582 F.3d, at 497 (citing <em>Delaware River Stevedores </em>v. <em>DiFidelto, </em>440 F.3d 615, 623 (CA3 2006) (Fisher, J., concurring), for \u201c[t]he grammatical imperativ[e]\u201d that \u201ca statute which defines a noun has thereby defined the adjectival form of that noun\u201d). According to AT, \u201c[b]y expressly defining the noun \u2018person\u2019 to include corporations, Congress <em>necessarily </em>defined the adjective form of that noun\u2014\u2018personal\u2019\u2014also to include corporations.\u201d AT&amp;T Brief 14 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We disagree. Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of corresponding nouns, but not always. Sometimes they acquire distinct meanings of their own. The noun \u201ccrab\u201d refers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while the related adjective \u201ccrabbed\u201d can refer to handwriting that is \u201cdifficult to read,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 527 (2002); \u201ccorny\u201d can mean \u201cusing familiar and stereotyped</p>\n<p id=\"ATz\">[562 U.S. 403]</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">formulas believed to appeal to the unsophisticated,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 509, which has little to do with \u201ccorn,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 507 (\u201cthe seeds of any of the cereal grasses used for food\u201d); and while \u201ccrank\u201d is \u201ca part of an axis bent at right angles,\u201d \u201ccranky\u201d can mean \u201cgiven to fretful fussiness,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Even in cases such as these there may well be a link between the noun and the adjective. \u201cCranky\u201d describes a person with a \u201cwayward\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d temper, see 3 Oxford English Dictionary 1117 (2d ed. 1989) (OED), which might bear some relation to the distorted or crooked angular shape from which a \u201ccrank\u201d takes its name. That is not the point. What is significant is that, in ordinary usage, a noun and its adjective form may have meanings as disparate as any two unrelated words. The FCC\u2019s argument that \u201cpersonal\u201d does not, in fact, derive from the English word \u201cperson,\u201d but instead developed along its own etymological path, Reply Brief for Petitioners 6, simply highlights the shortcomings of AT&amp;T\u2019s proposed rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\u201cPerson\u201d is a defined term in the statute; \u201cpersonal\u201d is not.  When a statute does not define a term, we typically \u201cgive the phrase its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 138, 130 S. Ct. 1265, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2010). \u201cPersonal\u201d ordinarily refers to individuals. We do not usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal correspondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as referring to corporations or other artificial entities. This is not to say that corporations do not have correspondence, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>fluence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not use the word \u201cpersonal\u201d to describe them.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation approached the chief financial officer and said, \u201cI have something personal to tell you,\u201d we would not assume the CEO was about to discuss company business. Responding to a request for information, an individual might say, \u201cthat\u2019s personal.\u201d A company spokesman, when asked for information about the company, would not. In fact, we often use the</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">[562 U.S. 404]</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">word \u201cpersonal\u201d to mean precisely the <em>opposite </em>of business related: We speak of personal expenses and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a company\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Dictionaries also suggest that \u201cpersonal\u201d does not ordinarily relate to artificial \u201cpersons\u201d such as corporations. See, <em>e.g., </em>7 OED 726 (1933) (\u201c[1] [o]f, pertaining to . . . the individual person or self,\u201d \u201cindividual; private; one\u2019s own\u201d; \u201c[3] [o]f or pertaining to one\u2019s person, body, or figure\u201d; \u201c[5] [o]f, pertaining to, or characteristic of a person or self-conscious being, as opposed to a thing or abstraction\u201d); 11 OED 599-600 (2d ed. 1989) (same); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1686 (1976) (\u201c[3] relating to the person or body\u201d; \u201c[4] relating to an individual, his character, conduct, motives, or private affairs\u201d; \u201c[5] relating to or characteristic of human beings as distinct from things\u201d); <em>ibid. </em>(2002) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">AT&amp;T dismisses these definitions, correctly noting that \u201cpersonal\u201d\u2014at its most basic level\u2014simply means \u201c[o]f or pertaining to a particular person.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1828 (2d ed. 1954). The company acknowledges that \u201cin nonlegal usage, where a \u2018person\u2019 is a human being, it is entirely unsurprising that the word \u2018personal\u2019 is used to refer to human beings.\u201d AT&amp;T Brief 8. But in a watered-down version of the \u201cgrammatical imperative\u201d argument, AT&amp;T contends that \u201cperson\u201d\u2014in common <em>legal </em>usage\u2014is understood to include a corporation. \u201cPersonal\u201d in the same context therefore can and should have the same scope, especially here in light of the statutory definition. See <em>id., </em>at 8-9, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">The construction of statutory language often turns on context, see, <em>e.g., Johnson, supra, </em>at 139, 130 S. Ct. 1265, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1, which certainly may include the definitions of related words. But here the context to which AT&amp;T points does not dissuade us from the ordinary meaning of \u201cpersonal.\u201d We have no doubt that \u201cperson,\u201d in a legal setting, often refers to artificial entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">[562 U.S. 405]</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">The Dictionary Act makes that clear.  1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (defining \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201ccorporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals\u201d). But AT&amp;T\u2019s effort to ascribe a corresponding legal meaning to \u201cpersonal\u201d again elides the difference between \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cpersonal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">When it comes to the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d there is little support for the notion that it denotes corporations, even in the legal context. AT&amp;T notes that corporations are \u201cprotected by the doctrine of\u2018personal\u2019jurisdiction,\u201d AT&amp;T Brief 19, but that phrase refers to jurisdiction <em>in personam, </em>as opposed to <em>in rem, </em>not the jurisdiction \u201cof a person.\u201d The only other example AT&amp;T cites is an 1896 case that referred to the \u201c \u2018personal privilege\u2019 \u201d of a corporation. <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Mercantile Bank </em>v. <em>Tennessee ex rel. Memphis, </em>161 U.S. 161, 171, 16 S. Ct. 461, 40 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Ed. 656 (1896; emphasis deleted). These examples fall far short of establishing that \u201cpersonal\u201d here has a legal meaning apart from its ordinary one, even if \u201cperson\u201d does. Cf. <em>Merck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>559 U.S. 633, 644-646, 130 S. Ct. 1784, 176 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2010) (noting that \u201c \u2018discovery\u2019 is often used as a term of art in connection with the \u2018discovery rule\u2019 \u201d and describing the judicial and legislative codification of that meaning over time); <em>Molzof v. United States, </em>502 U.S. 301, 306, 112 S. Ct. 711, 116 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1992) (\u201c \u2018Punitive damages\u2019 is a legal term of art that has a widely accepted common-law meaning;... this Court\u2019s decisions make clear that the concept . . . has a long pedigree in the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Regardless of whether \u201cpersonal\u201d can carry a special meaning in legal usage,  \u201cwhen interpreting a statute ... we construe language ... in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d <em>Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 9, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2004). Exemption 7(C) refers not just to the word \u201cpersonal,\u201d but to the term \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C); cf. <em>Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. </em>v. <em>Automobile Workers, </em>523 U.S. 653, 657, 118 S. Ct. 1626, 140 L. Ed. 2d 863 (1998) (\u201cIt is not the meaning of \u2018for\u2019 we are seeking here, but the meaning of \u2018[s]uits for violation of contracts\u2019 \u201d). AT&amp;T\u2019s effort to attribute a special legal</p>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">[562 U.S. 406]</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">meaning to the word \u201cpersonal\u201d in this particular context is wholly unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">AT&amp;T\u2019s argument treats the term \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d as simply the sum of its two words: the privacy of a person. Under that view, the defined meaning of the noun \u201cperson,\u201d or the asserted specialized legal meaning, takes on greater significance. But two words together may assume a more particular meaning than those words in isolation. We understand a golden cup to be a cup made of or resembling gold. A golden boy, on the other hand, is one who is charming, lucky, and talented. A golden opportunity is one not to be missed. \u201cPersonal\u201d in the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d conveys more than just \u201cof a person.\u201d It suggests a type of privacy evocative of human concerns\u2014not the sort usually associated with an entity like, say, AT&amp;T.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Despite its contention that \u201c[c]om-mon legal usage\u201d of the word \u201cperson\u201d supports its reading of the term \u201cpersonal privacy,\u201d AT&amp;T Brief 9, 13, 18, AT&amp;T does not cite a single instance in which this Court or any other (aside from the Court of Appeals below) has expressly referred to a corporation\u2019s \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d Nor does it identify any other statute that does so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. On the contrary, treatises in print around the time that Congress drafted the exemptions at hand reflect the understanding that the specific concept of \u201cpersonal privacy,\u201d at least as a matter of common law, did not apply to corporations. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 6521, Comment c (1976) (\u201cA corporation, partnership or unincorporated association has no personal right of privacy\u201d); W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 97, pp. 641-642 (2d ed. 1955) (\u201cA corporation or a partnership as such can have no personal privacy, although it seems clear that it may have an exclusive right to its name and its business prestige\u201d (footnotes omitted)); cf. <em>id., </em>\u00a7 112, at 843-844 (3d ed. 1964) (\u201cIt seems to be generally agreed that the right of privacy is one pertaining only to individuals, and that a corporation or a partnership cannot claim it as</p>\n<p id=\"AXt\">[562 U.S. 407]</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">such\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>(footnotes omitted)); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 117, at 815 (4th ed. 1971) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">AT&amp;T contends that this Court has recognized \u201cprivacy\u201d interests of corporations in the Fourth Amendment and double jeopardy contexts, and that the term should be similarly construed here. See AT&amp;T Brief 20-25. But this case does not call upon us to pass on the scope of a corporation\u2019s \u201cprivacy\u201d interests as a matter of constitutional or common law. The discrete question before us is instead whether Congress used the term \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d to refer to the privacy of artificial persons in FOIA Exemption 7(C); the cases AT&amp;T cites are too far afield to be of help here.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">AT&amp;T concludes that the FCC has simply failed to demonstrate that the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d \u201cnecessarily <em>excludes </em>the privacy of corporations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 31-32 (emphasis added). But  construing statutory language is not merely an exercise in ascertaining \u201cthe outer limits of [a word\u2019s] definitional possibilities,\u201d <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Postal Service, </em>546 U.S. 481, 486, 126 S. Ct. 1252, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1079 (2006). AT&amp;T has given us no sound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The meaning of \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) is further clarified by the rest of the statute. Congress enacted Exemption 7(C) against the backdrop of pre-existing FOIA exemptions, and the purpose and scope of Exemption 7(C) becomes even more apparent when viewed in this context. <em>See Nken </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>556 U.S. 418, 426, 129 S. Ct. 1749, 173 L. Ed. 2d 550 (2009) (  \u201cstatutory interpretation turns on \u2018the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997))). Two of those other exemptions are particularly relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d first appeared in the FOIA exemptions in Exemption 6, enacted in 1966, eight years before</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">[562 U.S. 408]</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Congress enacted Exemption 7(C). See 80 Stat. 250, codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).  Exemption 6 covers \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(6). Not only did Congress choose the same term in drafting Exemption 7(C), it also used the term in a nearly identical manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Although the question whether Exemption 6 is limited to individuals has not come to us directly, we have regularly referred to that exemption as involving an \u201cindividual\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d <em>Department of State </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>502 U.S. 164, 175, 112 S. Ct. 541, 116 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1991) (quoting <em>Department of Air Force </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 372, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1976); internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Department of State </em>v. <em>Washington Post Co., </em>456 U.S. 595, 599, 102 S. Ct. 1957, 72 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">AT&amp;T does not dispute that  \u201cidentical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning,\u201d <em>Powerex Corp. </em>v. <em>Reliant Energy Services, Inc., </em>551 U.S. 224, 232, 127 S. Ct. 2411,168 L. Ed. 2d 112 (2007), but contends that \u201cif Exemption 6 does not protect corporations, it is because [it] applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>only to \u2018personnel and medical files and similar files,\u2019 \u201d not because of the term \u201cpersonal privacy.\u201d AT&amp;T Brief 36 (quoting \u00a7 552(b)(6)). Yet the significance of the pertinent phrase\u2014 \u201cthe disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d \u00a7 552(b)(6)\u2014can-not be so readily dismissed. Without it, Exemption 6 would categorically exempt \u201cpersonnel and medical files\u201d as well as any \u201csimilar\u201d file. Even if the scope of Exemption 6 is also limited by the types of files it protects, the \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d phrase importantly defines the particular subset of that information Congress sought to exempt. See <em>Washington Post Co., supra, </em>at 599, 102 S. Ct. 1957, 72 L. Ed. 2d 358. And because Congress used the same phrase in Exemption 7(C), the reach of that phrase in Exemption 6 is pertinent in construing Exemption 7(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In drafting Exemption 7(C), Congress did not, on the other hand, use language similar to that in Exemption 4.  Exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">[562 U.S. 409]</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">4 pertains to \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4). This clearly applies to corporations\u2014it uses the defined term \u201cperson\u201d to describe the source of the information\u2014and we far more readily think of corporations as having \u201cprivileged or confidential\u201d documents than personally private ones. So at the time Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in place an exemption that plainly covered a corporation\u2019s commercial and financial information, and another that we have described as relating to \u201cindividuals.\u201d The language of Exemption 7(C) tracks the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The Government has long interpreted the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) accordingly. Shortly after Congress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted Exemption 7(C), the Attorney General issued a memorandum to executive departments and agencies explaining that \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in that exemption \u201cpertains to the privacy interests of individuals.\u201d U. S. Dept, of Justice, Attorney General\u2019s Memorandum on the 1974 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 9, reprinted in House Committee on Government Operations and Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Freedom of Information Act and Amendments of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-502), 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 507, 519 (Joint Comm. Print 1975). The exemption, the Attorney General noted, \u201cdoes not seem applicable to corporations or other entities.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We have previously viewed this Memorandum as a reliable guide in interpreting FOIA, see <em>National Archives and Records Admin. </em>v. <em>Favish, </em>541 U.S. 157, 169, 124 S. Ct. 1570, 158 L. Ed. 2d 319 (2004); <em>FBI </em>v. <em>Abramson, </em>456 U.S. 615, 622, n. 5, 102 S. Ct. 2054, 72 L. Ed. 2d 376 (1982), and we agree with its conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"pAGk\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"36\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQcAAAAkAQAAAACsn8ImAAAAjklEQVR4nO3TMQqDQBAF0L+DtXigQHKzeBgPkSKXSQpr0wmG+ZZ++UvSWDrd+8ywyyxbiN/F+NMAnB3WsduqI4DsJXQccQ+Qlw+3MmSAb+13BMo0bWEFATxGmauAnK9ytCEDaG4y5ghg1NARwNBIWAHZvuRoQwbYdbKCCsjnImOGBPm9S2jII962nP92Vyufz79mJu0prAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"263\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">We reject the argument that because \u201cperson\u201d is defined for purposes of FOIA to include a corporation, the phrase \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d in Exemption 7(C) reaches corporations as well.  The protection in FOIA against disclosure of law</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">[562 U.S. 410]</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">enforcement information on the ground that it would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy does not extend to corporations. We trust that AT&amp;T will not take it personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
