Sovereign immunity therefore bars this suit for damages against the State of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">[563 U.S. 281]</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">RLUIPA is Congress\u2019 second attempt to accord heightened statutory protection to religious exercise in the wake of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1990). Congress first enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb <em>et seq., </em>with which it intended to \u201crestore the compelling interest test as set forth in <em>Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398 [83 S. Ct. 1790, 10 L. Ed. 2d 965] (1963) and <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205 [92 S. Ct. 1526, 32 L. Ed. 2d 15] (1972) ... in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened.\u201d \u00a7 2000bb(b)(l). See generally <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal, </em>546 U.S. 418, 424, 126 S. Ct. 1211, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (2006). We held RFRA unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments because it exceeded Congress\u2019 power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>City of Boerne </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>521 U.S. 507, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-18\">Congress responded by enacting RLUIPA pursuant to its Spending Clause and Commerce Clause authority. RLUIPA borrows important elements from RFRA\u2014which continues to apply to the Federal Government\u2014 but RLUIPA is less sweeping in scope. See <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. 709, 715, 125 S. Ct. 2113, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1020 (2005).  It targets two areas of state and local action: land-use regulation, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc (RLUIPA \u00a7 2), and restrictions on the religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>exercise of institutionalized persons, \u00a7 2000cc-1 (RLUIPA \u00a7 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">Section 3 of RLUIPA provides that \u201c[n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise\u201d of an institutionalized person unless, as in RFRA, the government demonstrates that the burden \u201cis in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest\u201d and \u201cis the least restrictive means of furthering\u201d that interest. \u00a7 2000cc-l(a); cf. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb-1(a), (b). As relevant here, \u00a7 3 applies \u201cin any case\u201d in which \u201cthe substantial burden is imposed in a program</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">[563 U.S. 282]</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">or activity that receives Federal financial assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 2000cc-l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">RLUIPA also includes an express private cause of action that is taken from RFRA: \u201cA person may assert a violation of [RLUIPA] as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.\u201d \u00a7 2000cc-2(a); cf. \u00a7 2000bb-l(c). For purposes of this provision, \u201cgovernment\u201d includes, <em>inter alia, </em>States, counties, municipalities, their instrumentalities and officers, and persons acting under color of state law. \u00a7 2000cc-5(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Petitioner Harvey Leroy Sossamon III is an inmate in the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division. In 2006, Sossamon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials in their official capacities under RLUIPA\u2019s private cause of action, seeking injunctive and monetary relief. Sossamon alleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (l)a policy preventing inmates from attending religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions; and (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for religious worship. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant here, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon\u2019s claims for monetary relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See 713 F. Supp. 2d 657, 662-663 (WD Tex. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">[563 U.S. 283]</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 560 F.3d 316, 329 (2009). Acknowledging that Congress enacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the court determined that Texas had not waived its sovereign immunity by accepting federal funds. The Court of Appeals strictly construed the text of RLU-IPA\u2019s cause of action in favor of the State and concluded that the statutory phrase \u201cappropriate relief against a government\u201d did not \u201cunambiguously notifiy]\u201d Texas that its acceptance of funds was conditioned on a waiver of immunity from claims for money damages. <em>Id., </em>at 330-331. We granted certiorari to resolve a division of authority among the Courts of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>peals on this question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 560 U.S. 923, 130 S. Ct. 3319, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1218 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">\u201cDual sovereignty is a defining feature of our Nation\u2019s constitutional blueprint.\u201d <em>Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>South Carolina Ports </em>Authority, 535 U.S. 743, 751, 122 S. Ct. 1864, 152 L. Ed. 2d 962 (2002). Upon ratification of the Constitution, the States entered the Union \u201cwith their sovereignty intact.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Immunity from private suits has long been considered \u201ccentral to sovereign dignity.\u201d <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 715, 119 S. Ct. 2240, 144 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1999). As was widely understood at the time the Constitution was drafted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">\u201cIt is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual <em>without its consent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-8\">[563 U.S. 284]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\">This is the general sense, and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union.\u201d The Federalist No. 81, p. 511 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">Indeed, when this Court threatened state immunity from private suits early in our Nation\u2019s history, the people responded swiftly to reiterate that fundamental principle. See <em>Hans </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 11, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890) (discussing <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>2 Dall. 419, 1 L. Ed. 440 (1793), and the Eleventh Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Sovereign immunity principles enforce an important constitutional limitation on the power of the federal courts. See <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 98, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984). For over a century now, this Court has consistently made clear that \u201cfederal jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting States \u2018was not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial power of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla. </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>517 U.S. 44, 54, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996) (quoting <em>Hans, supra, </em>at 15, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842); see <em>Seminole Tribe, supra, </em>at 54-55, n. 7, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (collecting cases). A State, however, may choose to waive its immunity in federal court at its pleasure. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>108 U.S. 436, 447-448, 2 S. Ct. 878, 27 L. Ed. 780 (1883).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Accordingly, \u201cour test for determining whether a State has waived its immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is a stringent one.\u201d <em>College Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., </em>527 U.S. 666, 675, 119 S. Ct. 2219, 144 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). A State\u2019s consent to suit must be \u201cunequivocally expressed\u201d in the text of the relevant statute. <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital, supra, </em>at 99, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67; <em>see Atascadero State Hospital </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>473 U.S. 234, 238, n. 1, 239-240, 105 S. Ct. 3142, 87 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1985). Only by requiring this \u201cclear declaration\u201d by the State can we be \u201ccertain that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>State in fact consents to suit.\u201d <em>College Savings Bank, </em>527 U.S., at 680, 119 S. Ct. 2219, 144 L. Ed. 2d 605. Waiver may not be implied. <em>Id., </em>at 682, 119 S. Ct. 2219, 144 L. Ed. 2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">[563 U.S. 285]</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">For these reasons, a waiver of sovereign immunity \u201cwill be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\u201d <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1996).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> So, for example, a State\u2019s consent to suit in its own courts is not a waiver of its immunity from suit in federal court. <em>College Savings Bank, supra, </em>at 676, 119 S. Ct. 2219, 144 L. Ed. 2d 605. Similarly, a waiver of sovereign immunity to other types of relief does not waive immunity to damages: \u201c[T]he waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims.\u201d <em>Lane, supra, </em>at 192, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nordic Village, Inc., </em>503 U.S. 30, 34, 112 S. Ct. 1011, 117 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1992) (construing an ambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity to permit equitable but not monetary claims); <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, </em>492 U.S. 96, 101-102, 109 S. Ct. 2818, 106 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1989) (plurality opinion) (construing a statute to authorize injunc-tive relief but not \u201cmonetary recovery from the States\u201d because intent to abrogate immunity to monetary recovery was not \u201c \u2018unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Atascadero, supra, </em>at 242, 105 S.

Ed. 2d 171)).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">RLUIPA\u2019s authorization of \u201cappropriate relief against a government,\u201d \u00a7 2000cc-2(a), is not the unequivocal expression of state consent that our precedents require. \u201c[A]ppro-priate relief\u2019 does not so clearly and unambiguously waive sovereign immunity to private suits for damages that we can</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">[563 U.S. 286]</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">\u201cbe certain that the State in fact consents\u201d to such a suit. <em>College Savings Bank, supra, </em>at 680, 119 S. Ct. 2219, 144 L. Ed. 2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">\u201c [Appropriate relief\u2019 is open-ended and ambiguous about what types of relief it includes, as many lower courts have recognized. See, <em>e.g., </em>560 F.3d, at 330-331.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Far from clearly identifying money damages, the word \u201cappropriate\u201d is inherently context dependent. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining \u201cappropriate\u201d as \u201cspecially suitable: fit, proper\u201d). The context here\u2014where the defendant is a sovereign\u2014suggests, if anything, that monetary damages are not \u201csuitable\u201d or \u201cproper.\u201d See <em>Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>535 U.S., at 765, 122 S. Ct. 1864, 152 L. Ed. 2d 962 (\u201c[S\u00edtate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>sovereign immunity serves the important function of shielding state treasuries ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Indeed, both the Court and dissent appeared to agree in <em>West </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>527 U.S. 212, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1999), that \u201cappropriate\u201d relief, by itself, does not unambiguously include damages against a sovereign. The question was whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has authority to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the Federal Government \u201cthrough appropriate remedies,\u201d could require the Federal Government to pay damages. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(b). The dissent argued that the phrase \u201cappropriate remedies\u201d did not authorize damages \u201cin express and unequivocal terms.\u201d <em>Gibson, </em>527 U.S., at 226, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed. 2d 196 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). The Court apparently did not disagree but reasoned that \u201cappropriate remedies\u201d had a flexible meaning that had expanded to include money damages after a related statute was amended to explicitly allow damages in actions under Title VII. See <em>id., </em>at 217-218, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed. 2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">[563 U.S. 287]</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Further,  where a statute is susceptible of multiple plausible interpretations, including one preserving immunity, we will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign immunity. See <em>Dellmuth </em>v. <em>Muth, </em>491 U.S. 223, 232, 109 S. Ct. 2397, 105 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1989) (holding that \u201ca permissible inference\u201d is not the necessary \u201cunequivocal declaration\u201d that States were intended to be subject to damages actions); <em>Nordic Village, supra, </em>at 37, 112 S. Ct. 1011, 117 L. Ed. 2d 181 (holding that the existence of \u201cplausible\u201d interpretations that would not permit recovery \u201cis enough to establish that a reading imposing monetary liability on the Government is not \u2018unambiguous\u2019 and therefore should not be adopted\u201d). That is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly limits the United States to \u201cinjunctive or declaratory relief\u2019 to enforce the statute, the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 in the private cause of action necessarily must be broader. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-2(f). Texas responds that, because the State has no immunity defense to a suit brought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to exclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in the context of private suits. Further, the private cause of action provides that a person may assert a violation of the statute \u201cas a claim <em>or </em>defense.\u201d \u00a7 2000cc-2(a) (emphasis added). Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is not \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 for a successful defense, Texas explains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to those forms of relief would make no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires that it be \u201cconstrued in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise.\u201d \u00a7 2000cc-3(g). Texas responds that this provision is best read as addressing the substantive standards in the statute, not the scope of \u201cappropriate relief.\u201d Texas also highlights Congress\u2019 choice of the word \u201crelief,\u201d which it argues primarily connotes equitable relief. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1293 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \u201crelief\u2019 as \u201c [t] he redress</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">[563 U.S. 288]</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">or benefit, esp. equitable in nature . . . , that a party asks of a court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that we may conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their sovereign immunity to suits for damages. Strictly construing that phrase in favor of the sovereign\u2014as we must, see <em>Lane, </em>518 U.S., at 192, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486\u2014we conclude that it does not include suits for damages against a State.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The Court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 in <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Gwinnett County Public Schools, </em>503 U.S. 60, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1992), and <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>536 U.S. 181, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 153 L. Ed. 2d 230 (2002), does not compel a contrary conclusion. In those cases, the Court addressed what remedies are available against municipal entities under the <em>implied </em>right of action to enforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \u00a7 202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. With no statutory text to interpret, the Court \u201cpresume[d] the availability of all appropriate remedies unless Congress ha[d] expressly indicated otherwise.\u201d <em>Franklin, </em>503 U.S., at 66, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208. The Court described the presumption as \u201c [t]he general rule\u201d that \u201cthe federal courts have the power to award any <em>appropriate relief </em>in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 70-71, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208 (emphasis added); see <em>Barnes, supra, </em>at 185, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 153 L. Ed. 2d 230 (quoting <em>Franklin, supra, </em>at 73, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208). Finding no express congressional intent to limit the remedies available under the implied right of action, the Court held that compensatory damages were available. <em>Franklin, supra, </em>at 73, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The presumption in <em>Franklin </em>and <em>Barnes </em>is irrelevant to construing the scope of an express waiver of sovereign immunity. See <em>Lane, supra, </em>at 196, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486 (\u201c[RJeliance on <em>Franklin </em>... is misplaced\u201d in determining whether damages are available</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">[563 U.S. 289]</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">against the Federal Government). The question here is not whether Congress has given clear direction that it intends to <em>exclude </em>a damages remedy, see <em>Franklin, supra, </em>at 70-71, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L.

In <em>Franklin </em>and <em>Barnes, </em>congressional silence had an entirely different implication than it does here. Whatever \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 might have meant in those cases does not translate to this context.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Sossamon contends that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Congress enacted \u00a7 3 of RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the States were necessarily on notice that they would be liable for damages. He argues that Spending Clause legislation operates as a contract and damages are always available relief for a breach of contract, whether the contract explicitly includes a damages remedy or not. Relying on <em>Barnes </em>and <em>Franklin, </em>he asserts that all recipients of federal funding are \u201c \u2018generally on notice that [they are] subject... to those remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract,\u2019 \u201d including compensatory damages. Brief for Petitioner 27 (quoting <em>Barnes, </em>536 U.S., at 187, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 153 L. Ed. 2d 230; emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">[563 U.S. 290]</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">We have acknowledged the contract-law analogy, but we have been clear \u201cnot [to] imply . . . that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to all issues that they <em>raise.\u201dId., </em>at 189, n. 2, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 153 L. Ed. 2d 230. We have not relied on the Spending Clause contract analogy to expand liability beyond what would exist under nonspending statutes, much less to extend monetary liability against the States, as Sossa-mon would have us do. In fact, in <em>Barnes </em>and <em>Franklin, </em>the Court discussed the Spending Clause context only as a potential <em>limitation </em>on liability. <em>See Barnes, supra, </em>at 187-188, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 153 L. Ed. 2d 230; <em>Franklin, supra, </em>at 74-75, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here would make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique. They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance:  \u201c \u2018The contracts between a Nation and an individual are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to compulsive force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>292 U.S. 571, 580-581, 54 S. Ct. 840, 78 L.

Hamilton)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">More fundamentally, Sossamon\u2019s implied-contract-remedies proposal cannot be squared with our longstanding rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the relevant statute. It would be bizarre to create an \u201cunequivocal statement\u201d rule and then find that every Spending Clause enactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule because it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against the States. The requirement of a clear statement in the text of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically considered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally legislated on the matter. Cf. <em>Spector </em>v. <em>Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., </em>545 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">[563 U.S. 291]</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">119, 139, 125 S. Ct. 2169, 162 L. Ed. 2d 97 (2005) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[C]lear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or without due deliberation\u201d). Without such a clear statement from Congress and notice to the States, federal courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>may not step in and abrogate state sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Sossamon also argues that \u00a7 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7, independently put the State on notice that it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA. That provision expressly waives state sovereign immunity for violations of \u201csection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <em>or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial </em>assistance.\u201d \u00a7 2000d-7(a)(l) (emphasis added). Section 1003 makes \u201cremedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) . . . available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.\u201d \u00a7 2000d-7(a)(2). Sossamon contends that \u00a7 3 of RLUIPA falls within the residual clause of \u00a7 1003 and therefore \u00a7 1003 waives Texas\u2019 sovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">[563 U.S. 292]</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Even assuming that a residual clause like the one in \u00a7 1003 could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, \u00a7 3 is not unequivocally a \u201cstatute prohibiting discrimination\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1003.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The text of \u00a7 3 does not prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d; rather, it prohibits \u201csubstantial!] burden[s]\u201d on religious exercise.

A waiver of sovereign immunity must be \u201cstrictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>518 U.S., at 192, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486.

That monetary damages are \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 is, in my view, self-evident. Under general remedies principles, the usual remedy for a violation of a legal right is damages. Consistent with these principles, our precedents make clear that the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 includes monetary relief.

Accordingly, it is evident that Texas had notice that, in accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ing federal funds, it waived its sovereign immunity to suit by institutionalized persons upon whom it has imposed an unlawful substantial burden.

Under \u201cour traditional approach to deciding what remedies are available for violation of a federal right,\u201d damages are the default\u2014and equitable relief the exception\u2014for \u201cit is axiomatic that a court should determine the adequacy of a remedy in law before resorting to equitable relief.\u201d <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Gwinnett County Public Schools, </em>503 U.S. 60, 75-76, 112 S.

Ct. 2743, 177 L. Ed. 2d 461 (2010) (\u201cAn injunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course\u201d). It is unsurprising, therefore, that on more than one occasion Congress has felt it necessary to clarify in the text of a statute that it meant the terms \u201crelief\u2019 and \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 to <em>exclude </em>damages. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (providing that,</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">[563 U.S. 297]</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">under the Administrative Procedure Act, \u201crelief other than money damages\u201d is available against a federal agency to remedy a \u201clegal wrong\u201d); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6395(e)(1) (providing a cause of action for \u201cappropriate relief,\u201d but specifying that \u201c[n]othing in this subsection shall authorize any person to recover damages\u201d); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(b)(5) (similar).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">If, despite the clarity of this background principle, state officials reading RLUIPA were somehow still uncertain as to whether the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 encompasses monetary damages, our precedents would relieve any doubt. In <em>Franklin </em>we made clear that, \u201cabsent clear direction to the contrary by Congress,\u201d federal statutes providing a private right of action authorize all \u201cappropriate relief,\u201d including damages, against violators of its substantive terms. 503 U.S., at 70-71, 75-76, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208. We reiterated this principle in <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>536 U.S. 181, 185, 187, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 153 L. Ed. 2d 230 (2002), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>affirming that \u201cthe scope of \u2018appropriate relief\u2019 \u201d includes compensatory damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The holdings in these cases are fully consistent with the general principle that monetary relief is available for violations of the substantive conditions Congress attaches, through Spending Clause legislation, to the acceptance of federal funding. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Monroe County Bd. of Ed., </em>526 U.S. 629, 640, 119 S. Ct. 1661, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1999) (\u201c[Pursuant to Congress\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">[563 U.S. 298]</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">authority under the Spending Clause . . . private damages actions are available\u201d); <em>Gebser </em>v. <em>Lago Vista Independent School Dist., </em>524 U.S. 274, 287, 118 S.

It would be an odd derogation of the normal rules of statutory construction for state officials reading RLUIPA to assume that Congress drafted the statute in ignorance of these unambiguous precedents. See <em>Merck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>559 U.S. 63, 648, 130 S. Ct. 1784, 176 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2010) (\u201cWe normally assume that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Accordingly, it is difficult to understand the basis for the Court\u2019s position that the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 in \u00a7 2000cc-2(a) fails to provide state officials with clear notice that waiving sovereign immunity to monetary relief is a condition of accepting federal funds. In arguing that \u201ca waiver of sovereign immunity <em>to other types of relief </em>does not waive immunity to damages,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 285, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 709 (emphasis added), the majority appears to accept that equitable relief is available to RLUIPA plaintiffs. See <em>Madison, </em>474 F.3d, at 131 (holding that an RLUIPA plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaims for equitable relief are</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">[563 U.S. 299]</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">not barred by the Eleventh Amendment\u201d); cf. 560 F.3d 316, 331, 336 (CA5 2009) (reversing the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Texas on one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>of petitioner\u2019s RLUIPA claims for declaratory and injunctive relief). The explanation for the majority\u2019s implicit acceptance of suits for injunctive and declaratory relief is obvious enough: It would be a particularly curious reading of the statute to conclude that Congress\u2019 express provision of a private right of action to seek \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 against \u201ca State\u201d nonetheless left plaintiffs suing for state violations of RLUIPA with <em>no </em>available relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">It is not apparent, however, why the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 is too ambiguous to secure a waiver of state sovereign immunity with respect to damages but is clear enough as to injunctive and other forms of equitable relief. The majority appears to believe that equitable relief is a \u201csuitable\u201d or \u201cproper\u201d remedy for a state violation of RLUIPA\u2019s substantive provisions but monetary relief is not; therefore, a state official reading the \u201copen-ended and ambiguous\u201d phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 will be unaware that it includes damages but fully apprised that it makes equitable relief available. See <em>ante, </em>at 286, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 709-710. But sovereign immunity is not simply a defense against certain classes of remedies\u2014it is a defense against being sued at all. See, <em>e.g., Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>South Carolina Ports Authority, </em>535 U.S. 743, 766, 122 S. Ct. 1864, 152 L. Ed. 2d 962 (2002). As a result, there is no inherent reason why the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 would provide adequate notice as to equitable remedies but not as to monetary ones. In fact, as discussed earlier, in light of general remedies principles the presumption arguably should be the reverse. See <em>supra, </em>at 296-298, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 716-717.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The majority suggests that equitable relief is the sole \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 for statutory violations \u201cwhere the defendant is a sovereign.\u201d Ante, at 286, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 709-710. There can be little doubt, however, that the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of relief to be afforded a civil plaintiff is generally determined by the nature</p>\n<p id=\"AS68\">[563 U.S. 300]</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">of the injury to his legal rights. See <em>Franklin, </em>503 U.S., at 76, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208 (concluding that monetary damages were \u201cappropriate\u201d because equitable relief offered no redress for the injury suffered); see also <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>433 U.S. 267, 280, 97 S. Ct. 2749, 53 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1977) (\u201c[T]he nature of the . . . remedy is to be determined by the nature and scope of the . . . violation\u201d); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. 939 (1946) (\u201c[W]here federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief\u2019). In support of its proposition the majority cites only to a case in which we expressly <em>rejected </em>the argument that state sovereign immunity operates differently according to what type of relief is sought. See <em>Federal Maritime, </em>535 U.S., at 765, 122 S. Ct. 1864, 152 L. Ed. 2d 962 (\u201c[Sovereign immunity applies regardless of whether a private plaintiffs suit is for monetary damages or some other type of relief\u2019); cf. <em>id., </em>at 769, 122 S. Ct. 1864, 152 L. Ed. 2d 962 (\u201c[T]he primary function of sovereign immunity is not to protect state treasuries, but to afford the States the dignity and respect due sovereign en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>tities\u201d (citation omitted)). Nor is the basis for the majority\u2019s view apparent from the other cases that it cites.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The majority\u2019s additional arguments in support of its holding also fail to persuade. The majority contends that the use of a \u201ccontext dependent\u201d word like \u201cappropriate\u201d necessarily renders the provision ambiguous. <em>Ante, </em>at 286, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 709. But the fact that the precise relief afforded by a court may vary depending on the particular injury to be addressed in a given</p>\n<p id=\"apt9-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 301]</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">case does not render \u00a7 2000cc-2(a) ambiguous; it simply means that Congress meant for that provision to be comprehensive. See <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Yeskey, </em>524 U.S. 206, 212, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998) (\u201c[T]he fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <em>West </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>527 U.S. 212, 217-218, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1999) (holding that the phrase \u201cappropriate remedies\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(b) includes remedies not expressly enumerated).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Next, the majority repeats Texas\u2019 dictionary-based contention that in using the word \u201crelief\u2019 Congress meant to \u201cconnot[e] equitable relief.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 287, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 710. This proposition suffers from three flaws. First, it is not established by the dictionary to which the majority cites. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1293 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201crelief . . . Also termed <em>remedy\u201d); id., </em>at 1296 (\u201cremedy . .. The means of enforcing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong; <em>legal or equitable relief\u2019 </em>(emphasis added)). Second, it is inconsistent with our precedent. See <em>Barnes, </em>536 U.S., at 185-187, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 153 L. Ed. 2d 230 (noting that \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 includes monetary and in-junctive relief). Third, it is undermined by the fact that, on numerous occasions, Congress has deemed it necessary to specify that \u201crelief\u2019 <em>includes </em>injunctive and other equitable relief. See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 973i(e) (authorizing the Attorney General to \u201ccommence a civil action for appropriate relief, including permanent or temporary injunction\u201d); see also 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437g(a)(6)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(f)(2); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-4a(b); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6309(a). If the term \u201crelief\u2019 already connotes equitable relief\u2014and <em>only </em>equitable relief\u2014additional explication is redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Finally, the majority asserts that because the parties to this case advance opposing \u201cplausible arguments\u201d regarding the correct interpretation of RLUIPA\u2019s text, we must conclude that the statute is ambiguous. <em>Ante, </em>at 288, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 710-711. This view of how we adjudicate cases is incorrect as a descriptive</p>\n<p id=\"AXPNC\">[563 U.S. 302]</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">matter. See, <em>e.g., Carcieri </em>v. <em>Salazar, </em>555 U.S. 379, 390, 129 S. Ct. 1058, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>172 L. Ed. 2d 791 (2009) (reviewing the parties\u2019 conflicting textual interpretations of a statute but concluding that it was unambiguous nonetheless). Moreover, I cannot agree with the majority that our capacity to interpret authoritatively the text of a federal statute is held hostage to the litigants\u2019 strategic arguments. If this were true, there would be few cases in which we would be able to decide that a statute was unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In sum, the majority\u2019s conclusion that States accepting federal funds have not consented to suit for monetary relief cannot be reconciled with the fact that the availability of such relief is evident in light of RLUIPA\u2019s plain terms and the principles animating our relevant precedents. In so holding, the majority discovers ambiguity where none is to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">There is another reason to question the soundness of today\u2019s decision. The Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 2000cc-2(a) severely undermines Congress\u2019 unmistakably stated intent in passing the statute: to afford \u201cbroad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of [the statute] and the Constitution.\u201d \u00a7 2000cc-3(g). I find it improbable that, in light of this express statutory purpose and the history of \u201clong-running congressional efforts to accord religious exercise heightened protection from government-imposed burdens,\u201d <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. 709, 714, 125 S. Ct. 2113, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1020 (2005), state officials would read RLUIPA\u2019s relief provision in the same limited manner the majority does.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">[563 U.S. 303]</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">As the majority acknowledges, RLUIPA was Congress\u2019 second attempt to guarantee by statute the \u201cbroad protection\u201d of religious exercise that we found to be unwarranted as a constitutional matter in <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1990). As we have previously recognized, in passing RLUIPA Congress was clearly concerned that state institutions regularly imposed \u201cfrivolous or arbitrary barriers imped [ing] institutionalized persons\u2019 religious exercise.\u201d <em>Cutter, </em>544 U.S., at 716, 125 S. Ct. 2113, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1020 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 146 Cong. Rec. 16698, 16699 (2000) (joint statement of Sen. Hatch and Sen. Kennedy on RLUIPA) (\u201cWhether from indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack of resources, some institutions restrict religious liberty in egregious and unnecessary ways\u201d); <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cInstitutional residents\u2019 right to practice their faith is at the mercy of those running the institution . . . \u201d). It is difficult to believe that Congress would have devoted such care and effort to establishing significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>statutory protections for religious exercise and specifically extended those protections to persons in state institutions, yet withheld from plaintiffs a crucial tool for securing the rights the statute guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">By depriving prisoners of a damages remedy for violations of their statutory rights, the majority ensures that plaintiffs suing state defendants under RLUIPA will be forced to seek enforcement of those rights with one hand tied behind their backs. Most obviously, the majority\u2019s categorical denial of monetary relief means that a plaintiff who prevails on the merits of his claim that a State has substantially burdened</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">[563 U.S. 304]</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">his religious exercise will often be denied redress for the injury he has suffered, because in many instances \u201cprospective relief accords ... no remedy at all.\u201d <em>Franklin, </em>503 U.S., at 76, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208; see H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 2, p. 25 (1991) (Report of Committee on the Judiciary on the Civil Rights Act of 1991) (\u201cThe limitation of relief under Title VII to equitable remedies often means that victims . . . may not recover for the very real effects of the [statutory violation]\u201d). Injunctive relief from a federal court may address a violation going forward, but this fact will be of cold comfort to the victims of serious, nonrecurring violations for which equitable relief may be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">In addition, the unavailability of monetary relief will effectively shield unlawful policies and practices from judicial review in many cases. Under state law, discretion to transfer prisoners \u201cin a wide variety of circumstances is vested in prison officials.\u201d <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 227, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1976). A number of RLUIPA suits seeking injunctive relief have been dismissed as moot because the plaintiff was transferred from the institution where the alleged violation took place prior to adjudication on the merits. See, <em>e.g., Colvin </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>605 F.3d 282, 287, 289 (CA6 2010); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Herrera, </em>No. C 09-0318 JSW (PR), 2010 WL 1233815, *3 (ND Cal., Mar. 26, 2010); see generally Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>8-11. Absent a damages remedy, longstanding RLUIPA challenges may well be dismissed for lack of a case or controversy conferring Article III jurisdiction on the federal court. Cf. <em>Moussazadeh </em>v. <em>Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice, </em>Civ. Action No. G-07-574, 2009 WL 819497, *9 (SD Tex., Mar. 26, 2009) (dismissing as moot plaintiffs RLUIPA claim because he had been transferred to a facility that provided kosher food), remanded, 364 Fed. Appx. 110 (CA5 2010); Opening Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant in <em>Moussazadeh </em>v. <em>Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice, </em>No. 09-40400 (CA5), p. 11 (noting that transfer to a special facility took place 19 months after the plaintiff filed</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">[563 U.S. 305]</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">suit and just before discovery\u2014which had been stayed 12 months for negotiation\u2014 was scheduled to recommence). Or, as happened in this case, officials may change the policy while litigation is pending. The fact of \u201cvoluntary cessation\u201d may allow some of these claims to go forward, but many will nonetheless be dismissed as moot (as happened in this case).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Of course, under the rule the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>ity announces, Congress can revise RLUIPA to provide specifically for monetary relief against the States, perhaps by inserting the phrase \u201cincluding monetary relief\u2019 into the text of \u00a7 2000cc-2(a). But we have never demanded that a waiver be presented in a particular formulation to be effective; we only require that it be clear. See, <em>e.g., Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974) (holding that waiver may be found in \u201cexpress language\u201d or by \u201coverwhelming implications from the text\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In holding to the contrary, the majority erects a formalistic barrier to the vindication of statutory rights deliberately provided for by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">More problematically, because there is no apparent reason why the term \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 is sufficiently clear as to</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">[563 U.S. 306]</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">equitable relief but not as to monetary relief, we are left with the very real possibility that, in order to secure a waiver of immunity under the majority\u2019s new rule, Congress must now itemize in the statutory text every type of relief meant to be available against sovereign defendants. I, for one, do not relish the prospect of federal courts being presented with endless state challenges to all manner of federal statutes, on the ground that Congress failed to predict that a laundry list of terms must be included to waive sovereign immunity to all forms of relief. I would avoid the problems the majority\u2019s decision invites and hold instead that, as is the case here, when a general statutory term like \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 is used, clear notice has been provided and a State\u2019s acceptance of federal funds constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity to all relief, equitable and monetary.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">As explained above, nothing in our precedent demands the result the majority reaches today. The conclusion that RLUIPA fails to provide States with sufficient notice that they are liable for monetary relief cannot be squared with the straightforward terms of the statute and the general principles evident in our prior cases. For these reasons, and because the majority\u2019s decision significantly undermines Congress\u2019 ability to provide needed redress for violations of individuals\u2019 rights under federal law, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\">. Though the Court reserves the general question whether RLUIPA is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Spending Clause, see <em>ante, </em>at 282, n. 1, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 707, there is apparently no disagreement among the Federal Courts of Appeals, see 560 F.3d 316, 328, n. 34 (CA5 2009) (\u201cEvery circuit to consider whether RLUIPA is Spending Clause legislation has concluded that it is constitutional under at least that power\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\">. The majority suggests that our use of the phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 in <em>Franklin </em>and <em>Barnes </em>did not \u201cput the States on notice that the same phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief,\u2019\u2019 because \u201c[t]hose cases did not involve sovereign defendants.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 289, n. 6, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 711. The majority misperceives the point. <em>Franklin </em>and <em>Barnes </em>simply confirmed what otherwise would have been already apparent to any informed reader of RLUIPA\u2014when it comes to remedying injuries to legal rights, monetary damages are \u201cappropriate relief.\u2019\u2019 Moreover, as noted in the text, see <em>supra, </em>at 296, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 716-717 and this page, the Administrative Procedure Act expressly excludes \u201cmoney damages\u2019\u2019 from the \u201crelief\u2019 available against the United States, suggesting that Congress understands the term normally to encompass monetary relief even when the defendant enjoys sovereign immunity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702; <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>487 U.S. 879, 891-892, 108 S. Ct. 2722, 101 L. Ed. 2d 749 (1988) (noting that \u00a7 702 waives the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity to suit).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\">. Curiously, the majority appears to believe that it would be appropriate for state officials to read the statutory phrase \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 without reference to general remedies principles. See <em>ante, </em>at 291, n. 8, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 712. It is well established, however, that \u201cCongress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law . . . principles,\u2019\u2019 <em>Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Solimino, </em>501 U.S. 104, 108, 111 S. Ct. 2166, 115 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1991), and there can be no doubt that general legal principles necessarily inform judicial determinations as to what remedies are available to civil plaintiffs, see, <em>e.g., Atlantic Sounding Co. </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>557 U.S. 404, 421, 129 S. Ct. 2561, 174 L. Ed. 2d 382 (2009) (concluding that, in light of \u201cgeneral principles of maritime tort law,\u2019\u2019 punitive damages were a remedy available to the plaintiff (internal quotation marks omitted)). Why Texas\u2019 sovereign immunity defense renders this approach improper is a mystery the majority opinion leaves unsolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b817-10\">. In <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>518 U.S. 187, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1996), <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nordic Village, Inc., </em>503 U.S. 30, 112 S. Ct. 1011, 117 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1992), and <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, </em>492 U.S. 96, 109 S. Ct. 2818, 106 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1989), we simply reaffirmed the principle that a sovereign\u2019s liability for damages must be unambiguously expressed in the statute purporting to waive immunity; as demonstrated above, RLUIPA satisfies this requirement. The majority tellingly relies on the <em>dissent\u2019s </em>assertion in <em>West </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>527 U.S. 212, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1999), that the phrase \u201cappropriate remedies\u2019\u2019 was too ambiguous to waive sovereign immunity to monetary relief. See <em>id., </em>at 226, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed. 2d 196 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Accordingly, the cases the majority cites do not mandate the conclusion it draws today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b818-10\">. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that, because \u00a7 3 of RLUIPA, addressing the rights of institutionalized persons, is not a \u201cprovisio[n] of [a] . . . Federal statute prohibiting discrimination\u201d within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7(a)( 1), the latter statute\u2019s waiver provision does not put the States on notice that they can be sued for damages under RLUIPA. See <em>ante, </em>at 291-292, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 713-714. It bears noting, however, that \u00a7 2 of RLUIPA explicitly prohibits discrimination in land-use regulation. See \u00a7 2000cc(b)(2) (\u201cNo government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that discriminates ... on the basis of religion or religious denomination\u201d). As a result, the majority\u2019s decision in this case means that some RLUIPA plaintiffs will be able to seek monetary damages against a State and others will not, even though RLUIPA\u2019s provision of \u201cappropriate relief\u2019 applies equally to suits for violations of the terms of both \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b819-12\">. See <em>Parents Involved in Community Schools </em>v. <em>Seattle School Dist. No. 1, </em>551 U.S. 701, 719, 127 S. Ct. 2738, 168 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2007) (\u201cVoluntary cessation does not moot a case or controversy unless subsequent events make it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). The Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Circuit declined to apply the \u201cvoluntary cessation\u2019\u2019 doctrine in this case and instead granted Texas\u2019 motion that the court dismiss as moot petitioner\u2019s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the prison\u2019s cell-restriction policy. Because the prison director averred that the policy was no longer in force, and \u201cabsent evidence that the voluntary cessation [wa]s a sham,\u2019\u2019 the court held that the \u201cgood faith nature\u2019\u2019 of Texas\u2019 change in policy rendered moot petitioner\u2019s claim for injunctive relief.
