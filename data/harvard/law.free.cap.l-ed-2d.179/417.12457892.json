Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). Thompson was convicted. Because of that conviction Thompson elected not to testify defense in his later trial for murder, and he was again convicted. Thompson spent 18 years in prison, including 14 years on death row. One month before Thompson\u2019s scheduled execution, his investigator discovered the undisclosed evidence from his armed robbery trial. The reviewing court determined that the evidence was exculpatory, and both of Thompson\u2019s convictions were vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">After his release from prison, Thompson sued petitioner Harry Con-nick, in his official capacity as the Orleans Parish district attorney, for damages under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Thompson alleged that Connick had failed to train his prosecutors adequately about their duty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of training had caused the nondisclosure in Thompson\u2019s robbery case. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by an evenly divided en banc court. We granted certiorari to decide whether  a district attorney\u2019s office may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for failure to train based on a single <em>Brady </em>violation. We hold that it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">In early 1985, John Thompson was charged with the murder of Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr., in New Orleans. Publicity following the murder charge led <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the victims of an unrelated</p>\n<p id=\"aof-dedup-1\">[563 U.S. 55]</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">armed robbery to identify Thompson as their attacker. The district attorney charged Thompson with attempted armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">As part of the robbery investigation, a crime scene technician took from one of the victims\u2019 pants a swatch of fabric stained with the robber\u2019s blood. Approximately one week before Thompson\u2019s armed robbery trial, the swatch was sent to the crime laboratory. Two days before the trial, Assistant District Attorney Bruce Whittaker received the crime lab\u2019s report, which stated that the perpetrator had blood type B. There is no evidence that the prosecutors ever had Thompson\u2019s blood tested or that they knew what his blood type was. Whittaker claimed he placed the report on Assistant District Attorney James Williams\u2019 desk, but Williams denied seeing it. The report was never disclosed to Thompson\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Williams tried the armed robbery case with Assistant District Attorney Gerry Deegan. On the first day of trial, Deegan checked all of the physical evidence in the case out of the police property room, including the bloodstained swatch. Deegan then checked all of the evidence but the swatch into the courthouse property room. The prosecutors did not mention the swatch or the crime lab report at trial, and the jury convicted Thompson of attempted armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">A few weeks later, Williams and Special Prosecutor Eric Dubelier tried Thompson for the Liuzza murder. Because of the armed robbery conviction, Thompson chose not to testify in his own defense. He was convicted and sentenced to death. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>516 So. 2d 349 (La. 1987). In the 14 years following Thompson\u2019s murder conviction, state and federal courts reviewed and denied his challenges to the conviction and sentence. See <em>State ex rel. Thompson </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>95-2463 (La. 4/25/96), 672 So. 2d 906; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>161 F.3d 802 (CA5 1998). The State scheduled Thompson\u2019s execution for May 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">[563 U.S. 56]</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">In late April 1999, Thompson\u2019s private investigator discovered the crime lab report from the armed robbery investigation in the files of the New Orleans Police Crime Laboratory. Thompson was tested and found to have blood type O, proving that the blood on the swatch was not his. Thompson\u2019s attorneys presented this evidence to the district attorney\u2019s office, which, in turn, moved to stay the execution and vacate Thompson\u2019s armed robbery conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Louisiana Court of Appeal then reversed Thompson\u2019s murder conviction, concluding that the armed robbery conviction unconstitutionally deprived Thompson of his right to testify in his own defense at the murder trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>2002-0361 (La. App. 7/17/02), 825 So. 2d 552. In 2003, the district attorney\u2019s office retried Thomp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>son for Liuzza\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found him not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Thompson then brought this action against the district attorney\u2019s office, Connick, Williams, and others, alleging that their conduct caused him to be wrongfully convicted, incarcerated for 18 years, and nearly executed. The only claim that proceeded to trial was Thompson\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1983 that the district attorney\u2019s office had violated <em>Brady </em>by failing</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">[563 U.S. 57]</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">to disclose the crime lab report in his armed robbery trial. See <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215. Thompson alleged liability under two theories: (1) The <em>Brady </em>violation was caused by an unconstitutional policy of the district attorney\u2019s office; and (2) the violation was caused by Connick\u2019s deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train the prosecutors in his office in order to avoid such constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Before trial, Connick conceded that the failure to produce the crime lab report constituted a <em>Brady </em>violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Record EX608, EX880. Accordingly, the District Court instructed the jury that the \u201conly issue\u201d was whether the nondisclosure was caused by either a policy, practice, or custom of the district attorney\u2019s office or a deliberately indifferent failure to train the office\u2019s prosecutors. <em>Id., </em>at 1615.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Although no prosecutor remembered any specific training session regarding <em>Brady </em>prior to 1985, it was undisputed at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the general <em>Brady </em>requirement that the State disclose to the defense evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused. Prosecutors testified that office policy was to turn crime lab reports and other scientific evidence over to the defense. They also testified that, after the discovery of the undisclosed crime lab report in 1999, prosecutors disagreed about whether it had to be disclosed under <em>Brady </em>absent knowledge of Thompson\u2019s blood type.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">The jury rejected Thompson\u2019s claim that an unconstitutional office policy caused the <em>Brady </em>violation, but found the district attorney\u2019s office liable for failing to train the prosecutors. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million in damages, and the District Court added more than $1 million in attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">After the verdict, Connick renewed his objection\u2014which he had raised on summary judgment\u2014that he could not have</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">[563 U.S. 58]</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">been deliberately indifferent to an obvious need for more or different <em>Brady </em>training because there was no evidence that he was aware of a pattern of similar <em>Brady </em>violations. The District Court rejected this argument for the reasons that it had given in the summary judgment order. In that order, the court had concluded that a pattern of violations is not necessary to prove deliberate indifference when the need for training is \u201cso obvious.\u201d No. Civ. A. 03-2045 (ED La., Nov. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>141a, 2005 WL 3541035, *13. Relying on <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1989), the court had held that Thompson could demonstrate deliberate indifference by proving that \u201cthe DA\u2019s office knew to a moral certainty that assis-tan[t] [district attorneys] would acquire <em>Brady </em>material, that without training it is not always obvious what <em>Brady </em>requires, and that withholding <em>Brady </em>material will virtually always lead to a substantial violation of constitutional rights.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005 WL 3541035, *13.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. The panel acknowledged that Thompson did not present evidence of a pattern of similar <em>Brady </em>violations, 553 F.3d 836, 851 (2008), but held that Thompson did not need to prove a pattern, id., at 854. According to the panel, Thompson demonstrated that Connick was on notice of an obvious need for <em>Brady </em>training by presenting evidence \u201cthat attorneys, often fresh out of law school, would undoubtedly be required to confront <em>Brady </em>issues while at the DA\u2019s Office, that erroneous decisions regarding <em>Brady </em>evidence would result in serious constitutional violations, that resolution of <em>Brady </em>issues was often unclear, and that training in <em>Brady </em>would have been helpful.\u201d 553 F.3d, at 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">[563 U.S. 59]</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The Court of Appeals sitting en banc vacated the panel opinion, granted rehearing, and divided evenly, thereby affirming the District Court. 578 F.3d 293 (CA5 2009) <em>(per curiam). </em>In four opinions, the divided en banc court disputed whether Thompson could establish municipal liability for failure to train the prosecutors based on the single <em>Brady </em>violation without proving a prior pattern of similar violations, and, if so, what evidence would make that showing. We granted certiorari. 559 U.S. 1004, 130 S. Ct. 1880, 176 L. Ed. 2d 399 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The <em>Brady </em>violation conceded in this case occurred when one or more of the four prosecutors involved with Thompson\u2019s armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the crime lab report to Thompson\u2019s counsel. Under Thompson\u2019s failure-to-train theory, he bore the burden of proving both (1) that Connick, the policymaker for the district attorney\u2019s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the prosecutors about their <em>Brady </em>disclosure obligation with respect to evidence of this type and (2) that the lack of training actually caused the <em>Brady </em>violation in this case. Connick argues that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Thompson did not prove that he was on actual or constructive notice of, and therefore deliberately indifferent to, a need for more or different <em>Brady </em>training. We agree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">[563 U.S. 60]</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">\u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">A municipality or other local government may be liable under this section if the governmental body itself \u201csubjects\u201d a person to a deprivation of rights or \u201ccauses\u201d a person \u201cto be subjected\u201d to such deprivation.

See <em>id.., </em>at 691, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611; <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 392, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L.

Ed. 2d 626 (1997) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Plaintiffs who seek to impose liability on local governments under \u00a7 1983 must prove that \u201caction pursuant to official municipal policy\u201d caused their injury. <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S.,</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">[563 U.S. 61]</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">at 691, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611; see <em>id., </em>at 694, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611. Official municipal policy includes the decisions of a government\u2019s lawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law. See <em>ibid.; Pembaur, supra, </em>at 480-481, 106 S. Ct. 1292, 89 L. Ed. 2d 452; <em>Adickes </em>v. <em>S. H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 167-168, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970). These are \u201caction [s] for which the municipality is actually responsible.\u201d <em>Pembaur, supra, </em>at 479-480, 106 S. Ct. 1292, 89 L. Ed. 2d 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In limited circumstances, a local government\u2019s decision not to train certain employees about their legal duty to avoid violating citizens\u2019 rights may rise to the level of an official government policy for purposes of \u00a7 1983. A municipality\u2019s culpability for a depri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>vation of rights is at its most tenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train. See <em>Oklahoma City </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>471 U.S. 808, 822-823, 105 S. Ct. 2427, 85 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1985) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[A] \u2018policy\u2019 of \u2018inadequate training\u2019 \u201d is \u201cfar more nebulous, and a good deal further removed from the constitutional violation, than was the policy in <em>Monell\u201d). </em>To satisfy the statute, a municipality\u2019s failure to train its employees in a relevant respect must amount to \u201cdeliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 388, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. Only then \u201ccan such a shortcoming be properly thought of as a city \u2018policy or custom\u2019 that is actionable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 389, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L.

Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626. Thus, when city policymakers are on actual or constructive notice that a particular omission in their training program causes city employees to violate citizens\u2019 constitutional rights, the city may be deemed deliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to retain that program. <em>Id., </em>at 407, 117 S.

The city\u2019s \u201c \u2018policy of inaction\u2019 \u201d in light of notice that its program will cause constitutional violations \u201cis the functional equivalent of a decision by the city itself to violate</p>\n<p id=\"ApE_\">[563 U.S. 62]</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">the Constitution.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 395, 109 S.

(\u201c[M]unicipal liability under \u00a7 1983 attaches where\u2014and only where\u2014a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives by [the relevant] officials . . . \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">A pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is \u201cordinarily necessary\u201d to demonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train. <em>Bryan Cty., </em>520 U.S., at 409, 117 S.

Policymakers\u2019 \u201ccontinued adherence to an approach that they know or should know has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees may establish the conscious disregard for the consequences of their action\u2014the \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019\u2014necessary to trigger municipal liability.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 407, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626. Without notice that a course of training is deficient in a particular respect, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause violations of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Although Thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern of similar <em>Brady </em>violations, 553 F.3d, at 851, vacated, 578 F.3d 293 (en banc), he points out that, during the 10 years preceding his armed robbery trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Louisiana courts had overturned four convictions because of <em>Brady </em>violations by prosecutors in Connick\u2019s office.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Those four reversals could not have put Connick on notice that the office\u2019s <em>Brady </em>training was inadequate with respect to the sort of <em>Brady </em>violation at issue here. None of those cases involved failure to disclose blood evidence, a crime lab report, or physical or</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">[563 U.S. 63]</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">scientific evidence of any kind. Because those incidents are not similar to the violation at issue here, they could not have put Connick on notice that specific training was necessary to avoid this constitutional violation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Instead of relying on a pattern of similar <em>Brady </em>violations, Thompson relies on the \u201csingle-incident\u201d liability that this Court hypothesized in <em>Canton. </em>He contends that the <em>Brady </em>violation in his case was the \u201cobvious\u201d consequence of failing to provide specific <em>Brady </em>training, and that this showing of \u201cobviousness\u201d can substitute for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">In <em>Canton, </em>the Court left open the possibility that, \u201cin a narrow range of circumstances,\u201d a pattern of similar violations might not be necessary to show deliberate indifference. <em>Bryan Cty., supra, </em>at 409, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626. The Court posed the hypothetical example of a city that arms its police force with firearms and deploys the armed officers into the public to capture fleeing felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly force. <em>Canton, supra, </em>at 390, n. 10, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. Given the known frequency with which police attempt to arrest fleeing felons and the \u201cpredictability that an officer lacking specific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens\u2019 rights,\u201d the Court theorized that a city\u2019s decision not to train the officers about constitutional limits on</p>\n<p id=\"AF9I\">[563 U.S. 64]</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">the use of deadly force could reflect the city\u2019s deliberate indifference to the \u201chighly predictable consequence,\u201d namely, violations of constitutional rights. <em>Bryan Cty., supra, </em>at 409, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626. The Court sought not to foreclose the possibility, however rare, that the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train could be so patently obvious that a city could be liable under \u00a7 1983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">Failure to train prosecutors in their <em>Brady </em>obligations does not fall within the narrow range of <em>Canton\u2019s </em>hypoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>esized single-incident liability. The obvious need for specific legal training that was present in the <em>Canton </em>scenario is absent here. Armed police must sometimes make split-second decisions with life-or-death consequences. There is no reason to assume that police academy applicants are familiar with the constitutional constraints on the use of deadly force. And, in the absence of training, there is no way for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they require. Under those circumstances there is an obvious need for some form of training. In stark contrast, legal \u201c[t] raining is what differentiates attorneys from average public employees.\u201d 578 F.3d, at 304-305 (opinion of Clement, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment. Before they may enter the profession and receive a law license, all attorneys must graduate from law school or pass a substantive examination; attorneys in the vast majority of jurisdictions must do both. See, <em>e.g., </em>La. State Bar Assn. (LSBA), Articles of Incorporation, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 37, ch. 4, App., Art. 14, \u00a7 7 (1988 West Supp.) (as amended through 1985). These threshold requirements are designed to ensure that all new attorneys have learned how to find, understand, and apply legal rules. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 658, 664, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 80 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1984) (noting that the presumption \u201cthat the lawyer is competent to provide the guiding hand that the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"ABqa\">[563 U.S. 65]</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">needs\u201d applies even to young and inexperienced lawyers in their first jury trial and even when the case is complex).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Nor does professional training end at graduation. Most jurisdictions require attorneys to satisfy continuing-education requirements. See, <em>e.g., </em>LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, Rule 1.1(b) (effective 1987); La. Sup. Ct. Rule XXX (effective 1988). Even those few jurisdictions that do not impose mandatory continuing-education requirements mandate that attorneys represent their clients competently and encourage attorneys to engage in continuing study and education. See, <em>e.g., </em>Mass. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.1 and comment 6 (West 2006). Before Louisiana adopted continuing-education requirements, it imposed similar general competency requirements on its state bar. LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 1\u20141, 1-2, DR 6-101 (West 1974) (effective 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Attorneys who practice with other attorneys, such as in district attorney\u2019s offices, also train on the job as they learn from more experienced attorneys. For instance, here in the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office, junior prosecutors were trained by senior prosecutors who supervised them as they worked together to prepare cases for trial, and trial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases. Senior attorneys also circulated court decisions and instructional memo-randa to keep the prosecutors abreast of relevant legal developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">In addition, attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy character and fitness standards to receive a law license and are personally subject to an ethical regime designed to reinforce the profession\u2019s standards. See, <em>e.g., </em>LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 14, \u00a7 7 (1985); see generally <em>id., </em>Art. 16 (1971) (Code of Professional Responsibility). Trial lawyers have a \u201cduty to bring to bear such skill and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial testing process.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). Prosecutors have a special \u201cduty to seek justice, not merely to</p>\n<p id=\"AvOL\">[563 U.S. 66]</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">convict.\u201d LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 7-13 (1971); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 3-1.1(c) (2d ed. 1980). Among prosecutors\u2019 unique ethical obligations is the duty to produce <em>Brady </em>evidence to the defense. See, <em>e.g., </em>LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 7-13 (1971); ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct 3.8(d) (1984).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An attorney who violates his or her ethical obligations is subject to professional discipline, including sanctions, suspension, and disbarment. See, <em>e.g., </em>LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6 (1971); <em>id.., </em>Art. 16, DR 1-102; ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct 8.4 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In light of this regime of legal training and professional responsibility, recurring constitutional violations are not the \u201cobvious consequence\u201d of failing to provide prosecutors with formal in-house training about how to obey the law. <em>Bryan Cty., </em>520 U.S., at 409, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626. Prosecutors are not only equipped</p>\n<p id=\"aye-dedup-1\">[563 U.S. 67]</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">but are also ethically bound to know what <em>Brady </em>entails and to perform legal research when they are uncertain. A district attorney is entitled to rely on prosecutors\u2019 professional training and ethical obligations in the absence of specific reason, such as a pattern of violations, to believe that those tools are insufficient to prevent future constitutional violations in \u201cthe usual and recurring situations with which [the prosecutors] must deal.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 391, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. A licensed attorney making legal judgments, in his capacity as a prosecutor, about <em>Brady </em>material simply does not present the same \u201chighly predictable\u201d constitutional danger as <em>Canton\u2019s </em>untrained officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">A second significant difference between this case and the example in <em>Canton </em>is the nuance of the allegedly necessary training. The <em>Canton </em>hypothetical assumes that the armed po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>lice officers have no knowledge at all of the constitutional limits on the use of deadly force. But it is undisputed here that the prosecutors in Connick\u2019s office were familiar with the general <em>Brady </em>rule. Thompson\u2019s complaint therefore cannot rely on the utter lack of an ability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies the <em>Canton </em>hypothetical, but rather must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular <em>Brady </em>evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case. That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate indifference here. As the Court said in <em>Canton, </em>\u201c[i]n virtually every instance where a person has had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city employee, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff will be able to point to something the city \u2018could have done\u2019 to prevent the unfortunate incident.\u201d 489 U.S., at 392, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412 (citing <em>Tuttle, </em>471 U.S., at 823, 105 S. Ct. 2427, 85 L. Ed. 2d 791 (plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">[563 U.S. 68]</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Thompson suggests that the absence of any <em>formal </em>training sessions about <em>Brady </em>is equivalent to the complete absence of legal training that the Court imagined in <em>Canton. </em>But failure-to-train liability is concerned with the substance of the training, not the particular instructional format. The statute does not provide plaintiffs or courts <em>carte blanche </em>to micromanage local governments throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We do not assume that prosecutors will always make correct <em>Brady </em>decisions or that guidance regarding specific <em>Brady </em>questions would not assist prosecutors. But showing merely that additional training would have been helpful in making difficult decisions does not establish municipal liability. \u201c[P]rov[ing] that an injury or accident could have been avoided if an [employee] had had better or more training, sufficient to equip him to avoid the particular injury-causing conduct\u201d will not suffice. <em>Canton, supra, </em>at 391, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. The possibility of single-incident liability that the Court left open in <em>Canton </em>is not this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The dissent rejects our holding that <em>Canton\u2019s </em>hypothesized single-incident liability does not, as a legal matter, encompass failure to train prosecutors in their <em>Brady </em>obligation. It would instead apply the <em>Canton </em>hypothetical to this case, and thus devotes almost all of its opinion to explaining</p>\n<p id=\"AmMq\">[563 U.S. 69]</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">why the evidence supports liability under that theory.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But the dissent\u2019s attempt to address our holding\u2014by pointing out that not all prosecutors will necessarily have enrolled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>criminal procedure class\u2014misses the point. See <em>post, </em>at 106-107, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 454-455. The reason why the <em>Canton </em>hypothetical is inapplicable</p>\n<p id=\"avi-dedup-2\">[563 U.S. 70]</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">is that attorneys, unlike police officers, are equipped with the tools to find, interpret, and apply legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">By the end of its opinion, however, the dissent finally reveals that its real disagreement is not with our holding today, but with this Court\u2019s precedent. The dissent does not see \u201cany reason,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 108, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 456, for the Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Bryan County </em>that a pattern of violations is \u201cordinarily necessary\u201d to demonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train, 520 U.S., at 409, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626. Cf. <em>id,, </em>at 406-408, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626 (explaining why a pattern of violations is ordinarily necessary). But cf. <em>post, </em>at 108, 179 L.

As our precedent makes clear, proving that a municipality itself actually caused a constitutional violation by failing to train the offending employee presents \u201cdifficult problems of proof,\u201d and we must adhere to a \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d lest municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 collapse into <em>respondeat superior,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> Bryan Cty., supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>406, 410, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626; see <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 391-392, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The District Court and the Court of Appeals panel erroneously believed that Thompson had proved deliberate indifference by showing the \u201cobviousness\u201d of a need for additional training. They based this conclusion on Con-nick\u2019s awareness that (1) prosecutors would confront <em>Brady </em>issues while</p>\n<p id=\"AHum\">[563 U.S. 71]</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">at the district attorney\u2019s office; (2) inexperienced prosecutors were expected to understand <em>Brady\u2019s </em>requirements; (3) <em>Brady </em>has gray areas that make for difficult choices; and (4) erroneous decisions regarding <em>Brady </em>evidence would result in constitutional violations. 553 F.3d, at 854; App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005 WL 3541035, *13. This is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">It does not follow that, because <em>Brady </em>has gray areas and some <em>Brady </em>decisions are difficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them amounts to \u201ca decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.\u201d <em>Canton, supra, </em>at 395, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). To prove deliberate indifference, Thompson needed to show that Connick was on notice that, absent additional specified training, it was \u201chighly predictable\u201d that the prosecutors in his office would be confounded by those gray areas and make incorrect <em>Brady </em>decisions as a result. In fact, Thompson had to show that it was <em>so </em>predictable that failing to train the prosecutors amounted to <em>conscious disregard, </em>for defendants\u2019 <em>Brady </em>rights. See <em>Bryan Cty., supra, </em>at 409, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626; <em>Canton, supra, </em>at 389, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. He did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The role of a prosecutor is to see that justice is done. <em>Berger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S. Ct. 629, 79 L. Ed. 1314 (1935). \u201cIt is as much [a prosecutor\u2019s] duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>By their own admission, the prosecutors who tried Thompson\u2019s armed robbery case failed to carry out that responsibility. But the only issue before us is whether Connick, as the policymaker for the district attorney\u2019s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the attorneys under his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">We conclude that this case does not fall within the narrow range of \u201csingle-incident\u201d liability hypothesized in <em>Canton </em>as</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">[563 U.S. 72]</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">a possible exception to the pattern of violations necessary to prove deliberate indifference in \u00a7 1983 actions alleging failure to train. The District Court should have granted Connick judgment as a matter of law on the failure-to-train claim because Thompson did not prove a pattern of similar violations that would \u201cestablish that the \u2018policy of inaction\u2019 [was] the functional equivalent of a decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.\u201d <em>Canton, supra, </em>at 395, 109 S.

Because we conclude that Thompson failed to prove deliberate indifference, we need not reach causation. Thus, we do not address whether the alleged training deficiency, or some other cause, was the \u201c \u2018moving force,\u2019 \u201d <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 389, 109 S.

Affirming the verdict in favor of Thompson would require finding both that he proved deliberate indifference and that he proved causation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the dissent has not conducted the second step of the analysis, which would require showing that the failure to provide particular training (which the dissent never clearly identifies) \u201cactually caused\u2019\u2019 the flagrant\u2014and quite possibly intentional\u2014misconduct that occurred in this case. See <em>post, </em>at 98, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 449 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.)

Of course, if evidence of a need for training, by itself, were sufficient to prove that the lack of training \u201cactually caused\u201d the violation at issue, no causation requirement would be necessary because every plaintiff who satisfied the deliberate indifference requirement would necessarily satisfy the causation requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b526-13\">. Thompson had every incentive at trial to attempt to establish a pattern of similar violations, given that the jury instruction allowed the jury to find deliberate indifference based on, among other things, prosecutors\u2019 \u201chistory of mishandling\u2019\u2019 similar situations.

See Tr. of OralArg. 37, 42; Record EX42, EX43 (evidence card identifying \u201cOne (1) Piece of Victims <em>[sic] </em>Right Pants Leg, W/Blood\u201d among the evidence in the evidence locker and indicating that some evidence had been checked out); Tr. 401 (testimony from Thompson\u2019s counsel that he \u201c[w]ent down to the evidence room and checked all of the evidence\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 103, 369-370, 586, 602 (testimony that evidence card was \u201cavailable to the public,\u201d would have been available to Thompson\u2019s counsel, and would have been seen by Thompson\u2019s counsel because it was stapled to the evidence bag in \u201cthe normal process\u201d). Moreover, the dissent cannot seriously believe that the jury could have found <em>Brady </em>violations\u2014indisputably, questions of law. See <em>post, </em>at 89, n. 10, 92, n. 11, 179 L.

I write separately only to address several aspects of the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">1. The dissent\u2019s lengthy excavation of the trial record is a puzzling exertion. The question presented for our review is whether a municipality is liable for a single <em>Brady </em>violation by one of its prosecutors, even though no pattern or practice of prior violations put the municipality on notice of a need for specific training that would have prevented it. See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). That question is a legal one: whether a <em>Brady </em>violation presents one of those rare circumstances we hypothesized in <em>Canton\u2019s </em>footnote 10, in which the need for training in constitutional requirements is so obvious <em>ex ante </em>that the municipality\u2019s failure to provide that training amounts to deliberate indifference to constitutional violations. See <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 390, n. 10, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The dissent defers consideration of this question until the twenty-third page of its opinion. It first devotes considerable space to allegations that Connick\u2019s prosecutors misunderstood <em>Brady </em>when asked about it at trial, see <em>post, </em>at 93-95, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 447-448 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.), and to supposed gaps in the</p>\n<p id=\"Au0r\">[563 U.S. 73]</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\"><em>Brady </em>guidance provided by Connick\u2019s office to prosecutors, including deficiencies (unrelated to the specific <em>Brady </em>violation at issue in this case) in a policy manual published by Connick\u2019s office three years after Thompson\u2019s trial, see <em>post, </em>at 96-98, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 448-449. None of that is relevant. Thompson\u2019s failure-to-train theory at trial was not based on a pervasive culture of indifference to <em>Brady, </em>but rather on the inevitability of mistakes over enough iterations of criminal trials. The District Court instructed the jury it could find Connick deliberately indifferent if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">\u201cFirst: The District Attorney was certain that prosecutors would confront the situation where they would have to decide which evidence was required by the constitution to be provided to an accused[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">\u201cSecond: The situation involved a difficult choice, or one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling, such that additional training, supervision, or monitoring was clearly needed [; and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">\u201cThird: The wrong choice by a prosecutor in that situation will frequently cause a deprivation of an accused\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d App. 828.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">That theory of deliberate indifference would repeal the law of <em>Monel</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in favor of the Law of Large Numbers. <em>Brady </em>mistakes are inevitable. So are all species of error routinely confronted by prosecutors: authorizing a bad warrant; losing a Batson<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claim; crossing the line in closing argument; or eliciting hearsay that violates the Confrontation Clause. Nevertheless, we do not have <em>\u201cde facto respondeat superior </em>liability,\u201d <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>at 392, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412, for each such violation under the rubric of failure to train simply because the municipality does not have a professional educational program covering</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">[563 U.S. 74]</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">the specific violation in sufficient depth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Were Thompson\u2019s theory the law, there would have been no need for Canton\u2019s footnote to confine its hypothetical to the extreme circumstance of arming police officers with guns without telling them about the constitutional limitations upon shooting fleeing felons; the District Court\u2019s instructions cover every recurring situation in which citizens\u2019 rights can be violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">That result cannot be squared with our admonition that failure-to-train liability is available only in \u201climited circumstances,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 387, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412, and that a pattern of constitutional violations is \u201cordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability and causation,\u201d <em>Board of Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cty. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 409, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1997). These restrictions are indispensable because without them, \u201cfailure to train\u201d would become a talismanic incantation producing municipal liability \u201c [i]n virtually every instance where a person has had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city employee\u201d\u2014which is what <em>Monell </em>rejects. <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 392, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. Worse, it would \u201cengage the federal courts in an endless exercise of second-guessing municipal employee-training programs,\u201d thereby diminishing the autonomy of state and local governments. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">2. Perhaps for that reason, the dissent does not seriously contend that Thompson\u2019s theory of recovery was proper. Rather, it accuses Connick of acquiescing in that theory at trial. See <em>post, </em>at 102, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 452. The accusation is false. Connick\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"AzjV\">[563 U.S. 75]</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">central claim was and is that failure-to-train liability for a <em>Brady </em>violation cannot be premised on a single incident, but requires a pattern or practice of previous violations. He pressed that argument at the summary judgment stage but was rebuffed. At trial, when Connick offered a jury instruction to the same effect, the trial judge effectively told him to stop bringing up the subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">\u201c[Connick\u2019s counsel]: Also, as part of that definition in that same location, Your Honor, we would like to include language that says that deliberate indifference to training requires a pattern of similar violations and proof of deliberate indifference requires more than a single isolated act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">\u201c[Thompson\u2019s counsel]: That\u2019s not the law, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, I\u2019m not giving that. That was in your motion for summary judgment that I denied.\u201d Tr. 1013.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Nothing more is required to preserve a claim of error. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 51(d)(1)(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">3. But in any event, to recover from a municipality under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must satisfy a \u201crigorous\u201d standard of causation, <em>Bryan Cty., </em>520 U.S., at 405, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626; he must \u201cdemonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 404, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626. Thompson</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">[563 U.S. 76]</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">cannot meet that standard. The withholding of evidence in his case was almost certainly caused not by a failure to give prosecutors specific training, but by miscreant prosecutor Gerry Deegan\u2019s willful suppression of evidence he believed to be exculpatory, in an effort to railroad Thompson. According to Deegan\u2019s colleague Michael Riehlmann, in 1994 Deegan confessed to him\u2014in the same conversation in which Deegan revealed he had only a few months to live\u2014that he had \u201csuppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thompson that in some way exculpated the defendant.\u201d App. 367; see also <em>id., </em>at 362 (\u201c[Deegan] told me . . . that he had failed to inform the defense of exculpatory information\u201d). I have no reason to disbelieve that account, particularly since Riehl-mann\u2019s testimony hardly paints a flattering picture of himself: Riehl-mann kept silent about Deegan\u2019s misconduct for another five years, as a result of which he incurred professional sanctions. See <em>In re Riehlmann, </em>2004-0680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239. And if Riehlmann\u2019s story is true, then the \u201cmoving force,\u201d <em>Bryan Cty., supra, </em>at 404, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626 (internal quotation marks omitted), behind the suppression of evidence was Deegan, not a failure of continuing legal education.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">4. The dissent suspends disbelief about this, insisting that with proper <em>Brady </em>training, \u201csurely at least one\u201d of the prosecutors in Thompson\u2019s trial would have turned over the lab report and blood swatch. <em>Post, </em>at 89, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 449. But training must consist of more than mere broad encomiums of <em>Brady: </em>We have made clear that \u201cthe identified deficiency in a city\u2019s training program [must be] closely related to the ultimate injury.\u201d <em>Canton, supra, </em>at 391, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. So even indulging the dissent\u2019s assumption that Thompson\u2019s prosecutors failed to disclose the lab report <em>in good-</em>faith\u2014in a way that could be prevented by training\u2014what sort of training would have prevented the good-faith nondisclosure of a blood report not known to be exculpatory?</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">[563 U.S. 77]</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Perhaps a better question to ask is what <em>legally accurate </em>training would have prevented it. The dissent\u2019s suggestion is to instruct prosecutors to ignore the portion of <em>Brady </em>limiting prosecutors\u2019 disclosure obligations to evidence that is \u201cfavorable to an accused,\u201d 373 U.S., at 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215. Instead, the dissent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>proposes that \u201cConnick could have communicated to Orleans Parish prosecutors, in no uncertain terms, that, \u2018[i]f you have physical evidence that, if tested, can establish the innocence of the person who is charged, you have to turn it over.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>at 97, n. 13, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 449 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 34). Though labeled a training suggestion, the dissent\u2019s proposal is better described as a <em>sub silentio </em>expansion of the substantive law of <em>Brady. </em>If any of our cases establishes such an obligation, I have never read it, and the dissent does not cite it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Since Thompson\u2019s trial, however, we have decided a case that appears to say just the opposite of the training the dissent would require: In <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S. Ct. 333, 102 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1988), we held that \u201cunless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\u201d We acknowledged that <em>\u201cBrady . . . </em>makes the good or bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence,\u201d but concluded that \u201cthe Due Process Clause requires a different</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">[563 U.S. 78]</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">result when we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 57, 109 S. Ct. 333, 102 L. Ed. 2d 281. Perhaps one day we will recognize a distinction between good-faith failures to preserve from destruction evidence whose inculpa-tory or exculpatory character is unknown, and good-faith failures to turn such evidence over to the defense. But until we do so, a failure to train prosecutors to observe that distinction cannot constitute deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">5. By now the reader has doubtless guessed the best-kept secret of this case: There was probably no <em>Brady </em>violation at all\u2014except for Deegan\u2019s (which, since it was a bad-faith, knowing violation, could not possibly be attributed to lack of training).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The dissent surely knows this, which is why it leans heavily on the fact that Connick conceded that <em>Brady </em>was violated. I can honor that concession in my analysis of the case because even if it extends beyond Deegan\u2019s deliberate actions, it remains irrelevant to Connick\u2019s training obligations. For any <em>Brady </em>violation apart from Dee-gan\u2019s was surely on the very frontier of our <em>Brady </em>jurisprudence; Connick could not possibly have been on notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>decades ago that he was required to instruct his prosecutors to respect a right to untested evidence that we had not <em>(and still have not) </em>recognized. As a consequence, even if I accepted the dissent\u2019s conclusion that failure-to-train liability could be premised on a single <em>Brady </em>error, I could not agree that the lack of an accurate training regimen caused the violation Connick has conceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">[563 U.S. 79]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-14\">. <em>Monell </em>v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.

I do not share the dissent\u2019s confidence that this result will be avoided by the instruction\u2019s requirement that \u201c \u2018more likely than not the <em>Brady </em>material would have been produced if the prosecutors involved in his underlying criminal cases had been properly trained, supervised or monitored regarding the production of <em>Brady </em>evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>at 102, n. 17, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 452 (quoting Tr. 1100). How comforting that assurance is depends entirely on what proper training consists of. If it is not limited to training in aspects of <em>Brady </em>that have been repeatedly violated, but includes\u2014as the dissent would have it include here\u2014training that would avoid any one-time violation, the assurance is no assurance at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b534-12\">. The dissent\u2019s contention that \u201c[t]he instruction Connick proposed resembled the charge given by the District Court,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 102, n. 18, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 452, disregards his requested instruction concerning the necessity of a pattern of prior violations. It is meaningless to say that after \u201cthe court rejected [Connick\u2019s] categorical position,\u201d as it did, he did not \u201cassail the District Court\u2019s formulation of the deliberate indifference instruction,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 103, n. 18, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 452. The prior-pattern requirement was <em>part </em>of Connick\u2019s requested formulation of deliberate indifference: \u201cTo <em>prove deliberate indifference, </em>a plaintiff must demonstrate \u2018at least a pattern of similar violations arising from training that is so clearly inadequate as to be obviously likely to result in a constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d Record, Doc. 94, p. 18 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\">. What the dissent <em>does </em>cite in support of its theory comes from an unexpected source: Connick\u2019s testimony about what qualifies as <em>Brady </em>material. See <em>post, </em>at 98, n. 13, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 449. (\u201cOr Connick could have told prosecutors what he told the jury when he was asked whether a prosecutor must disclose a crime lab report to the defense, even if the prosecutor does not know the defendant\u2019s blood type: \u2018Under the law it qualifies as <em>Brady </em>material\u2019 \u2019\u2019 (quoting Tr. 872)). Given the effort the dissent has expended persuading us that Connick\u2019s understanding of <em>Brady </em>is profoundly misguided, its newfound trust in his expertise on the subject is, to the say the least, surprising.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\">. The dissent\u2019s only response to this is that the jury must have found otherwise, since it was instructed that \u201c \u2018[f]or liability to attach because of a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not in any particular prosecutor.\u2019 <em>\"Post, </em>at 105, n. 20, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 454 (quoting Tr. 1098). But this instruction did not require the jury to find that Deegan did not commit a bad-faith, knowing violation; it merely prevented the jury from finding that, if he did so, Connick was liable for a failure to train. I not only agree with that; it is part of my point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b536-5\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"APcq\">with whom Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), this Court held that due process requires the prosecution to turn over evidence favorable to the accused and material to his guilt or punishment. That obligation, the parties have stipulated, was dishonored in this case; consequently, John Thompson spent 18 years in prison, 14 of them isolated on death row, before the truth came to light: He was innocent of the charge of attempted armed robbery, and his subsequent trial on a murder charge, by prosecutorial design, was fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The Court holds that the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office (District Attorney\u2019s Office or Office) cannot be held liable, in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, for the grave injustice Thompson suffered. That is so, the Court tells us, because Thompson has shown only an aberrant <em>Brady </em>violation, not a routine practice of giving short shrift to <em>Brady\u2019s </em>requirements. The evidence presented to the jury that awarded compensation to Thompson, however, points distinctly away from the Court\u2019s assessment. As the trial record in the \u00a7 1983 action reveals, the conceded, long-concealed prosecutorial transgressions were neither isolated nor atypical.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">From the top down, the evidence showed, members of the District Attorney\u2019s Office, including the District Attorney himself, misperceived <em>Brady\u2019s </em>compass and therefore inadequately attended to their disclosure obligations. Throughout the pretrial and trial proceedings against Thompson, the team of four engaged in prosecuting him for armed robbery and murder hid from the defense and the court exculpatory information Thompson requested and had a constitutional right to receive. The prosecutors did so despite multiple opportunities, spanning nearly two decades, to set the record straight. Based on the prosecutors\u2019 conduct relating to Thompson\u2019s trials, a fact trier could reasonably conclude that</p>\n<p id=\"Arq7\">[563 U.S. 80]</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">inattention to <em>Brady </em>was standard operating procedure at the District Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">What happened here, the Court\u2019s opinion obscures, was no momentary oversight, no single incident of a lone officer\u2019s misconduct. Instead, the evidence demonstrated that misperception and disregard of <em>Brady\u2019s </em>disclosure requirements were pervasive in Orleans Parish. That evidence, I would hold, established persistent, deliberately indifferent conduct for which the District Attorney\u2019s Office bears responsibility under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">I dissent from the Court\u2019s judgment mindful that <em>Brady </em>violations, as this case illustrates, are not easily detected. But for a chance discovery made by a defense team investigator weeks before Thompson\u2019s scheduled execution, the evidence that led to his exoneration might have remained under wraps. The prosecutorial conceal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ment Thompson encountered, however, is bound to be repeated unless municipal agencies bear responsibility\u2014made tangible by \u00a7 1983 liability\u2014for adequately conveying what <em>Brady </em>requires and for monitoring staff compliance. Failure to train, this Court has said, can give rise to municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 \u201cwhere the failure . . . amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.\u201d <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 388, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1989). That standard is well met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">I turn first to a contextual account of the <em>Brady </em>violations that infected Thompson\u2019s trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In the early morning hours of December 6, 1984, an assailant shot and killed Raymond T.

As recorded in two contemporaneous police reports, that</p>\n<p id=\"AJe1\">[563 U.S. 81]</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">eyewitness initially described the assailant as African-American, six feet tall, with \u201cclose cut hair.\u201d Record EX2-EX3, EX9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thompson is five feet eight inches tall and, at the time of the murder, styled his hair in a large \u201cAfro.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at EX13. The police reports of the witness\u2019 immediate identification were not disclosed to Thompson or to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">While engaged in the murder investigation, the Orleans Parish prosecutors linked Thompson to another violent crime committed three weeks later. On December 28, an assailant attempted to rob three siblings at gunpoint. During the struggle, the perpetrator\u2019s blood stained the oldest child\u2019s pant leg. That blood, preserved on a swatch of fabric cut from the pant leg by a crime scene analyst, was eventually tested. The test conclusively established that the perpetrator\u2019s blood was type B. <em>Id., </em>at EX151. Thompson\u2019s blood is type O. His prosecutors failed to disclose the existence of the swatch or the test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">One month after the Liuzza murder, Richard Perkins, a man who knew Thompson, approached the Liuzza family. Perkins did so after the family\u2019s announcement of a $15,000 reward for information leading to the murderer\u2019s conviction. Police officers surreptitiously recorded the Perkins-Liuzza conversations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As documented on tape, Perkins told the family, \u201cI don\u2019t mind helping [you] catch [the perpetrator], . . . but I would like [you] to help me and, you know, I\u2019ll help</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">[563 U.S. 82]</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">[you].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at EX479, EX481. Once the family assured Perkins, \u201cwe\u2019re on your side, we want to try and help you,\u201d <em>id., </em>at EX481, Perkins intimated that Thompson and another man, Kevin Freeman, had been involved in Liuzza\u2019s murder. Perkins thereafter told the police what he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>learned from Freeman about the murder, and that information was recorded in a police report. Based on Perkins\u2019 account, Thompson and Freeman were arrested on murder charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Freeman was six feet tall and went by the name \u201cKojak\u201d because he kept his hair so closely trimmed that his scalp was visible. Unlike Thompson, Freeman fit the eyewitness\u2019 initial description of the Liuzza assailant\u2019s height and hair style. As the Court notes, <em>ante, </em>at 56, n. 2, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 423, Freeman became the key witness for the prosecution at Thompson\u2019s trial for the murder of Liuzza.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">After Thompson\u2019s arrest for the Liuzza murder, the father of the armed robbery victims saw a newspaper photo of Thompson with a large Afro hairstyle and showed it to his children. He reported to the District Attorney\u2019s Office that the children had identified Thompson as their attacker, and the children then picked that same photo out of a \u201cphotographic lineup.\u201d Record EX120, EX642-EX643. Indicting Thompson on the basis of these questionable identifications, the District Attorney\u2019s Office did not pause to test the pant leg swatch dyed by the perpetrator\u2019s blood. This lapse ignored or overlooked a prosecutor\u2019s notation that the Office \u201cmay wish to do [a] blood test.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at EX122.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The murder trial was scheduled to begin in mid-March 1985. Armed with the later indictment against Thompson for robbery, however, the prosecutors made a strategic choice: They switched the order of the two trials, proceeding first on the robbery indictment. <em>Id., </em>at EX128-EX129. Their aim was twofold. A robbery conviction gained first would serve to inhibit Thompson from testifying in his own defense at the murder trial, for the prior conviction could be</p>\n<p id=\"A76g\">[563 U.S. 83]</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">used to impeach his credibility. In addition, an armed robbery conviction could be invoked at the penalty phase of the murder trial in support of the prosecution\u2019s plea for the death penalty. <em>Id., </em>at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Recognizing the need for an effective prosecution team, petitioner Harry F. Connick, District Attorney for the Parish of Orleans, appointed his third-in-command, Eric Dubelier, as special prosecutor in both cases. Dubelier enlisted Jim Williams to try the armed robbery case and to assist him in the murder case. Gerry Dee-gan assisted Williams in the armed robbery case. Bruce Whittaker, the fourth prosecutor involved in the cases, had approved Thompson\u2019s armed robbery indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">During pretrial proceedings in the armed robbery case, Thompson filed a motion requesting access to all materials and information \u201cfavorable to the defendant\u201d and \u201cmaterial and relevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,\u201d as well as \u201cany results or reports\u201d of \u201cscientific tests or experiments.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at EX144, EX145. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Prosecutorial responses to this motion fell far short of <em>Brady </em>compliance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">[563 U.S. 84]</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">First, prosecutors blocked defense counsel\u2019s inspection of the pant leg swatch stained by the robber\u2019s blood. Although Dubelier\u2019s April 3 response stated, \u201cInspection to be permitted,\u201d <em>id., </em>at EX149, the swatch was signed out from the property room at 10:05 a.m. the next day, and was not returned until noon on April 10, the day before trial, <em>id., </em>at EX43, EX670. Thompson\u2019s attorney inspected the evidence made available to him and found no blood evidence. No one told defense counsel about the swatch and its recent removal from the property room. <em>Id., </em>at EX701-EX702; Tr. 400-402. But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 69, n. 11, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 432 (Thompson\u2019s attorney had \u201caccess to the evidence locker where the swatch was recorded as evidence.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Second, Dubelier or Whittaker ordered the crime laboratory to rush a pretrial test of the swatch. Tr. 952-954. Whittaker received the lab report, addressed to his attention, two days before trial commenced. Immediately thereafter, he placed the lab report on Williams\u2019 desk. Record EX151, EX589. Although the lab report conclusively identified the perpetrator\u2019s blood type, <em>id., </em>at EX151, the District Attorney\u2019s Office never revealed the report to the defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">[563 U.S. 85]</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Third, Deegan checked the swatch out of the property room on the morning of the first day of trial, but the prosecution did not produce the swatch at trial. <em>Id., </em>at EX43. Deegan did not return the swatch to the property room after trial, and the swatch has never been found. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\u201c[Biased solely on the descriptions\u201d provided by the three victims, Record 683, the jury convicted Thompson of attempted armed robbery. The court sentenced him to 49.5 years without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>possibility of parole\u2014the maximum available sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Prosecutors continued to disregard <em>Brady </em>during the murder trial, held in May 1985, at which the prosecution\u2019s order-of-trial strategy achieved its aim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By prosecuting Thompson for armed robbery first\u2014and withholding blood evidence that might have exonerated Thompson of that charge\u2014the District Attorney\u2019s Office disabled Thompson from testifying in his own defense at the murder trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As earlier observed, see <em>supra, </em>at 82-83, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 440, impeaching use of the prior conviction would have severely undermined Thompson\u2019s credibility. And because Thompson was effectively stopped from testifying in his own defense, the testimony of the witnesses against him gained force. The prosecution\u2019s failure to reveal</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">[563 U.S. 86]</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">evidence that could have impeached those witnesses helped to seal Thompson\u2019s fate.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">First, the prosecution undermined Thompson\u2019s efforts to impeach Perkins. Perkins testified that he volunteered information to the police with no knowledge of reward money. Record EX366, EX372-EX373. Because prosecutors had not produced the audiotapes of Perkins\u2019 conversations with the Liuzza family (or a police summary of the tapes), Thompson\u2019s attorneys could do little to cast doubt on Perkins\u2019 credibility. In closing argument, the prosecution emphasized that Thompson presented no \u201cdirect evidence\u201d that reward money had motivated any of the witnesses. <em>Id., </em>at EX3171-EX3172.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Second, the prosecution impeded Thompson\u2019s impeachment of key witness Kevin Freeman. It did so by failing to disclose a police report containing Perkins\u2019 account of what he had learned from Freeman about the murder. See <em>supra, </em>at 82, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 439. Freeman\u2019s trial testimony was materially inconsistent with that report. Tr. 382-384, 612-614; Record EX270-EX274. Lacking any knowledge of the police report, Thompson could not point to the inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Third, and most vital, the eyewitness\u2019 initial description of the assailant\u2019s hair, see <em>supra, </em>at 81, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 439, was of prime relevance, for it suggested that Freeman, not Thompson, murdered Liuzza, see <em>supra, </em>at 82, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 439. The materiality of the eyewitness\u2019 contemporaneous description of the murderer should have been altogether apparent to the prosecution. Failure to produce the police reports setting out what the eyewitness first said not only undermined efforts to impeach that witness and the police officer who initially interviewed him. The omission left defense counsel without knowledge that the prosecutors were restyling the killer\u2019s \u201cclose cut hair\u201d into an \u201cAfro.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">Prosecutors finessed the discrepancy between the eyewitness\u2019 initial description and Thompson\u2019s appearance. They asked leading questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>prompting the eyewitness to agree</p>\n<p id=\"AOMR\">[563 U.S. 87]</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">on the stand that the perpetrator\u2019s hair was \u201cafro type,\u201d yet \u201cstraight back.\u201d Record EX322-EX323. Corrobora-tively, the police officer\u2014after refreshing his recollection by reviewing material at the prosecution\u2019s table\u2014 gave artful testimony. He characterized the witness\u2019 initial description of the perpetrator\u2019s hair as \u201cblack and short, <em>afro style.\u201d Id., </em>at EX265 (emphasis added). As prosecutors well knew, nothing in the withheld police reports, which described the murderer\u2019s hair simply as \u201cclose cut,\u201d portrayed a perpetrator with an Afro or Afro-style hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder. Having prevented Thompson from testifying that Freeman was the killer, the prosecution delivered its ultimate argument. Because Thompson was already serving a near-life sentence for attempted armed robbery, the prosecution urged, the only way to punish him for murder was to execute him. The strategy worked as planned; Thompson was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Thompson discovered the prosecutors\u2019 misconduct through a serendipitous series of events. In 1994, nine years after Thompson\u2019s convictions, Deegan, the assistant prosecutor in the armed robbery trial, learned he was terminally ill. Soon thereafter, Deegan confessed to his friend Michael Riehlmann that he had suppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery case. <em>Id., </em>at EX709. Deegan did not heed Riehlmann\u2019s counsel to reveal what he had done. For five years, Riehlmann, himself a former Orleans Parish prosecutor, kept Dee-gan\u2019s confession to himself. <em>Id., </em>at EX712-EX713.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">On April 16, 1999, the State of Louisiana scheduled Thompson\u2019s execution. <em>Id., </em>at EX1366-EX1367. In an eleventh-hour effort to save his life, Thompson\u2019s attorneys hired a private investigator. Deep in the crime lab archives, the investigator unearthed a microfiche copy of the lab report identifying the robber\u2019s blood type. The copy showed that the report had been addressed to Whittaker. See</p>\n<p id=\"ArpU\">[563 U.S. 88]</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\"><em>supra, </em>at 84, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 441. Thompson\u2019s attorneys contacted Whittaker, who informed Riehlmann that the lab report had been found. Riehlmann thereupon told Whittaker that Deegan \u201chad failed to turn over stuff that might have been exculpatory.\u201d Tr. 718. Riehlmann prepared an affidavit describing Deegan\u2019s disclosure \u201cthat he had intentionally suppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thompson.\u201d Record EX583.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Thompson\u2019s lawyers presented to the trial court the crime lab report showing that the robber\u2019s blood type was B, and a report identifying Thompson\u2019s blood type as 0. This evidence proved Thompson innocent of the robbery. The court immediately stayed Thompson\u2019s execution, <em>id., </em>at EX590, and commenced proceedings to assess the newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Connick sought an abbreviated hearing. A full hearing was unnecessary, he urged, because the Office had confessed error and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery charges. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at EX617. The court insisted on a public hearing. Given \u201cthe history of this case,\u201d the court said, it \u201cwas not willing to accept the representations that [Connick] and [his] office made [in their motion to dismiss],\u201d <em>id., </em>at EX882. After a full day\u2019s hearing, the court vacated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Thompson\u2019s attempted armed robbery conviction and dismissed the charges. Before doing so, the court admonished:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">\u201c[A] 11 day long there have been a number of young Assistant D. A.\u2019s . . . sitting in this courtroom watching this, and I hope they take home . . . and take to heart the message that this kind of conduct cannot go on in this Parish if this Criminal Justice System is going to work.\u201d <em>Id,, </em>at EX883.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The District Attorney\u2019s Office then initiated grand jury proceedings against the prosecutors who had withheld the lab report. Connick terminated the grand jury after just one day. He maintained that the lab report would not be</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">[563 U.S. 89]</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\"><em>Brady </em>material if prosecutors did not know Thompson\u2019s blood type. Tr. 986; cf. <em>supra, </em>at 84-85, n. 6, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 441. And he told the investigating prosecutor that the grand jury \u201cw[ould] make [his] job more difficult.\u201d Tr. 978-979. In protest, that prosecutor tendered his resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Thereafter, the Louisiana Court of Appeal reversed Thompson\u2019s murder conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>2002-0361, p. 10 (7/17/02), 825 So. 2d 552, 558. The unlawfully procured robbery conviction, the court held, had violated Thompson\u2019s right to testify and thus fully present his defense in the murder trial. <em>Id., </em>at 557. The merits of several <em>Brady </em>claims arising out of the murder trial, the court observed, had therefore become \u201cmoot.\u201d 825 So. 2d, at 555; see also Record 684.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 63, n. 7, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 428, 69, n. 11, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 431-432 (suggesting that there were no <em>Brady </em>violations in the murder prosecution because no court had adjudicated any violations).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">[563 U.S. 90]</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Undeterred by his assistants\u2019 disregard of Thompson\u2019s rights, Connick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>retried him for the Liuzza murder. Thompson\u2019s defense was bolstered by evidence earlier unavailable to him: ten exhibits the prosecution had not disclosed when Thompson was first tried. The newly produced items included police reports describing the assailant in the murder case as having \u201cclose cut\u201d hair, the police report recounting Perkins\u2019 meetings with the Liuzza family, see <em>supra, </em>at 81-82, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 439-440, audio recordings of those meetings, and a 35-page supplemental police report. After deliberating for only 35 minutes, the jury found Thompson not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">On May 9, 2003, having served more than 18 years in prison for crimes he did not commit, Thompson was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">On July 16, 2003, Thompson commenced a civil action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that Connick, other officials of the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office, and the Office</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">[563 U.S. 91]</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">itself, had violated his constitutional rights by wrongfully withholding <em>Brady </em>evidence. Thompson sought to hold Con-nick and the District Attorney\u2019s Office liable for failure adequately to train prosecutors concerning their <em>Brady </em>obligations. Such liability attaches, I agree with the Court, only when the failure \u201camountfs] to \u2018deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 61, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 427 (quoting <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S., at 388, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412). I disagree, however, with the Court\u2019s conclusion that Thompson failed to prove deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">Having weighed all the evidence, the jury in the \u00a7 1983 case found for Thompson, concluding that the District Attorney\u2019s Office had been deliberately indifferent to Thompson\u2019s <em>Brady </em>rights and to the need for training and supervision to safeguard those rights. \u201cViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to [Thompson], as appropriate in light of the verdicft] rendered by the jury,\u201d <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Burget, </em>486 U.S. 94, 98, n. 3, 108 S. Ct. 1658, 100 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1988), I see no cause to upset the District Court\u2019s determination, affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, that \u201cample evidence . . . adduced at trial\u201d supported the jury\u2019s verdict. Record 1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Over 20 years ago, we observed that a municipality\u2019s failure to provide training may be so egregious that, even without notice of prior constitutional violations, the failure \u201ccould properly be characterized as \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 390, n. 10, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. \u201c[I]n light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees,\u201d <em>Canton </em>recognized, \u201cit may happen that . . . the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers . . . can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 390, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. Thompson presented convincing evidence to satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>[563 U.S. 92]</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Thompson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit proceeded to a jury trial on two theories of liability: First, the Orleans Parish Office\u2019s official <em>Brady </em>policy was unconstitutional; and second, Connickwas deliberately indifferent to an obvious need to train his prosecutors about their <em>Brady </em>obligations. Connick\u2019s <em>Brady </em>policy directed prosecutors to \u201cturn over what was required by state and federal law, but no more.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 6-7. The jury thus under standably rejected Thompson\u2019s claim that the official policy itself was unconstitutional. <em>Ante, </em>at 57, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The jury found, however, that Con-nick was deliberately indifferent to the need to train prosecutors about <em>Brady\u2019s </em>command. On the special verdict form, the jury answered yes to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201cWas the <em>Brady </em>violation in the armed robbery case or any infringements of John Thompson\u2019s rights in the murder trial substantially caused by [Connick\u2019s] failure, through deliberate indifference, to establish policies and procedures to protect one accused of a crime from these constitutional violations?\u201d Record 1585.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Consistent with the question put to the jury, and without objection, the court instructed the jurors: \u201c[Y]ou are not limited to the nonproduced blood evidence and the resulting infringement of Mr. Thompson\u2019s right to testify at the murder trial. You may consider all of the evidence presented during this trial.\u201d Tr. 1099; Record 1620.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 54, 59,</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">[563 U.S. 93]</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">63, n. 7, 68, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 422, 424, 428, 431; <em>ante, </em>at 72, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 434 (Scalia, J., concurring) (maintaining that the case involves a single <em>Brady </em>violation). That evidence included a stipulation that in his retrial for the Liuzza murder, Thompson had introduced ten exhibits containing relevant information withheld by the prosecution in 1985. See <em>supra, </em>at 90, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Abundant evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that additional <em>Brady </em>training was obviously necessary to ensure that <em>Brady </em>violations would not occur: (1) Connick, the Office\u2019s sole policymaker, misunderstood <em>Brady. </em>(2) Other leaders in the Office, who bore direct responsibility for training less experienced prosecutors, were similarly uninformed about <em>Brady. </em>(3) Prosecutors in the Office received no <em>Brady </em>training. (4) The Office shirked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>its responsibility to keep prosecutors abreast of relevant legal developments concerning <em>Brady </em>requirements. As a result of these multiple shortfalls, it was hardly surprising that <em>Brady </em>violations in fact occurred, severely undermining the integrity of Thompson\u2019s trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Connick was the Office\u2019s sole policymaker, and his testimony exposed a flawed understanding of a prosecutor\u2019s <em>Brady </em>obligations. Connick admitted to the jury that his</p>\n<p id=\"azu-dedup-2\">[563 U.S. 94]</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">earlier understanding of <em>Brady, </em>conveyed in prior sworn testimony, had been too narrow. Tr. 181-182. Even at trial Connick persisted in misstating <em>Brady\u2019s </em>requirements. For example, Con-nick urged that there could be no <em>Brady </em>violation arising out of \u201cthe inadvertent conduct of [an] assistant under pressure with a lot of case load.\u201d Tr. 188-189. The court, however, correctly instructed the jury that, in determining whether there has been a <em>Brady </em>violation, the \u201cgood or bad faith of the prosecution does not matter.\u201d Tr. 1094-1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The testimony of other leaders in the District Attorney\u2019s Office revealed similar misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings, the jury could find, were in large part responsible for the gross disregard of <em>Brady </em>rights Thompson experienced. Dubelier admitted that he never reviewed police files, but simply relied on the police to flag any potential <em>Brady </em>information. Tr. 542. The court, however, instructed the jury that an individual prosecutor has a \u201cduty ... to learn of any favorable evidence known to others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1095; Record 1614. Williams was asked whether <em>\u201cBrady </em>material includes documents in the possession of the district attorney that could be used to impeach a witness, to show that he\u2019s lying\u201d; he responded simply, and mistakenly, \u201cNo.\u201d Tr. 381. The testimony of \u201chigh-ranking individuals in the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office,\u201d Thompson\u2019s expert explained,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> exposed \u201ccomplete errors ... as to what</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">[563 U.S. 95]</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\"><em>Brady </em>required [prosecutors] to do.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 427, 434. \u201cDubelier had no understanding of his obligations under <em>Brady </em>whatsoever,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 458, the expert observed, and Williams \u201cis still not sure what his obligations were under <em>Brady,\u201d id., </em>at 448. But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 57, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 424 (\u201c[I] t was undisputed at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the general <em>Brady </em>requirement that the State disclose to the defense evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">The jury could attribute the violations of Thompson\u2019s rights directly to prosecutors\u2019 misapprehension of <em>Brady. </em>The prosecution had no obligation to produce the \u201cclose-cut hair\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>police reports, Williams maintained, because newspaper reports had suggested that witness descriptions were not consistent with Thompson\u2019s appearance. Therefore, Williams urged, the defense already \u201chad everything.\u201d Tr. 139. Dubelier tendered an alternative explanation for the nondisclosure. In Dubelier\u2019s view, the descriptions were not \u201cinconsistent with [Thompson\u2019s] appearance,\u201d as portrayed in a police photograph showing Thompson\u2019s hair extending at least three inches above his forehead. <em>Id., </em>at 171-172; Record EX73. Williams insisted that he had discharged the prosecution\u2019s duty to disclose the blood evidence by mentioning, in a motion hearing, that the prosecution intended to obtain a blood sample from Thompson. Tr. 393-394. During the armed robbery trial, Williams told one of the victims that the results of the blood test made on the swatch had been \u201cinconclusive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 962. And he testified in the \u00a7 1983 action that the lab report was not <em>Brady </em>material \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t know what the blood type of Mr. Thompson was.\u201d Tr. 393. But see <em>supra, </em>at 84, n. 5, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 441 (District Court instructed the jury that the lab report was <em>Brady </em>material).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">[563 U.S. 96]</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Connick should have comprehended that Orleans Parish prosecutors lacked essential guidance on <em>Brady </em>and its application. In fact, Connick has effectively conceded that <em>Brady </em>training in his Office was inadequate. Tr. of Oral Arg. 60. Connick explained to the jury that prosecutors\u2019 offices must \u201cmake . . . very clear to [new prosecutors] what their responsibility [i]s\u201d under <em>Brady </em>and must not \u201cgiv[e] them a lot of leeway.\u201d Tr. 834-835. But the jury heard ample evidence that Connick\u2019s Office gave prosecutors no <em>Brady </em>guidance, and had installed no procedures to monitor <em>Brady </em>compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In 1985, Connick acknowledged, many of his prosecutors \u201cwere coming fresh out of law school,\u201d and the Office\u2019s \u201c[h]uge turnover\u201d allowed attorneys with little experience to advance quickly to supervisory positions. See Tr. 853-854, 832. By 1985, Dubelier and Williams were two of the highest ranking attorneys in the Office, <em>id., </em>at 342, 356-357, yet neither man had even five years of experience as a prosecutor, see <em>supra, </em>at 83, n. 3, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 440; Record EX746; Tr. 55, 571-576.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Dubelier and Williams learned the prosecutorial craft in Connick\u2019s Office, and, as earlier observed, see <em>supra, </em>at 95, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 447-448, their testimony manifested a woefully deficient understanding of <em>Brady. </em>Dube-lier and Williams told the jury that they did not recall any <em>Brady </em>training in the Office. Tr. 170-171, 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Connick testified that he relied on supervisors, including Dubelier and Williams, to ensure prosecutors were familiar with their <em>Brady </em>obligations. Tr. 805-806. Yet Connick did not inquire whether the supervisors themselves understood the importance of teaching newer prosecutors about <em>Brady. </em>Riehlmann could not \u201crecall that [he] was ever trained or instructed by anybody about [his] <em>Brady </em>obligations,\u201d on the job or otherwise. Tr. 728-729. Whittaker agreed it was possible for \u201cinexperienced lawyers, just a few weeks out of law school with no training,\u201d to bear responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">[563 U.S. 97]</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">for \u201cdecisions on . . . whether material was <em>Brady </em>material and had to be produced.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">Thompson\u2019s expert characterized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Connick\u2019s supervision regarding <em>Brady </em>as \u201cthe blind leading the blind.\u201d Tr. 458. For example, in 1985 trial attorneys \u201csometimes . . . went to Mr. Connick\u201d with <em>Brady </em>questions, \u201cand he would tell them\u201d how to proceed. Tr. 892. But Connick acknowledged that he had \u201cstopped reading law books . . . and looking at opinions\u201d when he was first elected District Attorney in 1974. <em>Id., </em>at 175-176.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">As part of their training, prosecutors purportedly attended a pretrial conference with the Office\u2019s chief of trials before taking a case to trial. Connick intended the practice to provide both training and accountability. But it achieved neither aim in Thompson\u2019s prosecutions, for Dube-lier and Williams, as senior prosecutors in the Office, were free to take cases to trial without pretrying them, and that is just how they proceeded in Thompson\u2019s prosecutions. <em>Id., </em>at 901-902; Record 685. But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 65, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 429 (\u201c[T]rial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Prosecutors confirmed that training in the District Attorney\u2019s Office, overall, was deficient. Soon after Connick retired, a survey of assistant district attorneys in the Office revealed that more than half felt that they had not received the training they needed to do their jobs. Tr. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Thompson, it bears emphasis, is not complaining about the absence of formal training sessions. Tr. of Oral Arg. 55. But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 68, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 430-431. His complaint does not demand that <em>Brady </em>compliance be enforced in any particular way. He asks only that <em>Brady </em>obligations be communicated accurately and genuinely enforced.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because that did not happen in</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">[563 U.S. 98]</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">the District Attorney\u2019s Office, it was inevitable that prosecutors would misapprehend <em>Brady. </em>Had <em>Brady\u2019s </em>importance been brought home to prosecutors, surely at least one of the four officers who knew of the swatch and lab report would have revealed their existence to defense counsel and the court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Louisiana did not require continuing legal education at the time of Thompson\u2019s trials. Tr. 361. But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 65, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 429. Primary responsibility for keeping prosecutors <em>au courant </em>with developments in the law, therefore, resided in the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Over the course of Connick\u2019s tenure as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>District Attorney, the jury learned, the Office\u2019s chief of appeals circulated memoranda when appellate courts issued important opinions. Tr. 751-754, 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The 1987 Office policy manual was a compilation of memoranda on criminal law and practice circulated to prosecutors from 1974, when Connick became District Attorney, through 1987. <em>Id., </em>at 798. The manual contained four sentences, nothing more, on <em>Brady </em>.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This slim instruction, the jury</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">[563 U.S. 99]</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">learned, was notably inaccurate, incomplete, and dated. Tr. 798-804, 911-918. But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 65, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 429 (\u201cSenior attorneys also circulated court decisions and instructional memoranda to keep the prosecutors abreast of relevant legal developments.\u201d). For example, the manual did not acknowledge what <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972), made plain: Impeachment evidence is <em>Brady </em>material prosecutors are obligated to disclose.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">[563 U.S. 100]</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">In sum, the evidence permitted the jury to reach the following conclusions. First, Connick did not ensure that prosecutors in his Office knew their <em>Brady </em>obligations; he neither confirmed their familiarity with <em>Brady </em>when he hired them, nor saw to it that training took place on his watch. Second, the need for <em>Brady </em>training and monitoring was obvious to Connick. Indeed he so testified. Third, Connick\u2019s cavalier approach to his staffs knowledge and observation of <em>Brady </em>requirements contributed to a culture of inattention to <em>Brady </em>in Orleans Parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">As earlier noted, see <em>supra, </em>at 88-89, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 444, Connick resisted an effort to hold prosecutors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>accountable for <em>Brady </em>compliance because he felt the effort would \u201cmake [his] job more difficult.\u201d Tr. 978. He never disciplined or fired a single prosecutor for violating <em>Brady. </em>Tr. 182-183. The jury was told of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995), a capital case prosecuted by Connick\u2019s Office that garnered attention because it featured \u201cso many instances of the state\u2019s failure to disclose exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 455, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (Stevens, J., concurring). When questioned about <em>Kyles, </em>Con-nick told the jury he was satisfied with his Office\u2019s practices and saw no need, occasioned by <em>Kyles, </em>to make any changes. Tr. 184-185. In both quantity and quality, then, the evidence canvassed here was more than sufficient to warrant a jury determination that Connick and the prosecutors who served under him were not merely negligent regarding <em>Brady. </em>Rather, they were deliberately indifferent to what the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In <em>Canton, </em>this Court spoke of circumstances in which the need for training may be \u201cso obvious,\u201d and the lack of training \u201cso likely\u201d to result in constitutional violations, that policymakers who do not provide for the requisite training \u201ccan reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need\u201d for such training. 489 U.S., at 390, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">[563 U.S. 101]</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">This case, I am convinced, belongs in the category <em>Canton </em>marked out.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\"><em>Canton </em>offered an often-cited illustration. \u201c[C]ity policymakers know to a moral certainty that their police officers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.\u201d <em>Ibid.., </em>n. 10. Those policymakers, <em>Canton </em>observed, equip police officers with firearms to facilitate such arrests. <em>Ibid. </em>The need to instruct armed officers about \u201cconstitutional limitations on the use of deadly force,\u201d <em>Canton </em>said, is \u201c \u2018so obvious,\u2019 that failure to [train the officers] could properly be characterized as \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The District Court, tracking <em>Canton\u2019 </em>s language, instructed the jury that Thompson could prevail on his \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d claim only if the evidence persuaded the jury on three points. First, Connick \u201cwas certain that prosecutors would confront the situation where they would have to decide which evidence was required by the Constitution to be provided to the accused.\u201d Tr. 1099. Second, \u201cthe situation involved a difficult choice [,] or one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling, such that additional training, supervision or monitoring was clearly needed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Third, \u201cthe wrong choice by a prosecutor in that situation would frequently cause a deprivation of an accused\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>Record 1619-1620; see <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 390, and n. 10, 109 S.

See <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 390, n. 10, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The jury, furthermore, could reasonably find that <em>Brady </em>rights may involve choices so difficult that Con-nick obviously knew or should have known prosecutors needed more than perfunctory training to make the correct choices. See <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 390, and n. 10, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Ed. 2d 412.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As demonstrated earlier, see <em>supra, </em>at 94-96, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 447-448, even at trial prosecutors failed to give an accurate account of their <em>Brady </em>obligations. And, again as emphasized earlier, see <em>supra, </em>at 96-98, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 448-449, the evidence permitted the jury to conclude that Connick should have known <em>Brady </em>training in his office bordered on \u201czero.\u201d See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. Moreover, Connick understood that newer prosecutors needed \u201cvery clear\u201d guidance and should not be left to grapple with <em>Brady </em>on their own. Tr. 834-835. It was thus \u201cobvious\u201d to him, the jury could find, that constitutional rights would be in jeopardy if prosecutors received slim to no <em>Brady </em>training.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Based on the evidence presented, the jury could conclude that <em>Brady </em>errors by untrained prosecutors would frequently cause deprivations of defendants\u2019 constitutional rights. The jury learned of several <em>Brady </em>oversights in Thompson\u2019s trials and heard testimony that Connick\u2019s Office had one of the worst <em>Brady </em>records in the country. Tr. 163. Because prosecutors faced considerable pressure to get convictions, <em>id., </em>at 317, 341, and were instructed to \u201cturn over what was required by state and federal law, but no more,\u201d Brief for</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">[563 U.S. 104]</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Petitioners 6-7, the risk was all too real that they would err by withholding rather than revealing information favorable to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In sum, despite Justice Scalia\u2019s protestations to the contrary, <em>ante, </em>at 72, 76, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 434, 436, the <em>Brady </em>violations in Thompson\u2019s prosecutions were not singular and they were not aberrational. They were just what one would expect given the attitude toward <em>Brady </em>pervasive in the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Thompson demonstrated that no fewer than five prosecutors\u2014the four trial prosecutors and Riehlmann\u2014disregarded his <em>Brady </em>rights. He established that they kept from him, year upon year, evidence vital to his defense. Their conduct, he showed with equal force, was a foreseeable consequence of lax training in, and absence of monitoring of, a legal requirement fundamental to a fair trial. <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">[563 U.S. 105]</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Unquestionably, a municipality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>that leaves police officers untrained in constitutional limits on the use of deadly weapons places lives in jeopardy. <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S., at 390, n. 10, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. But as this case so vividly shows, a municipality that empowers prosecutors to press for a death sentence without ensuring that those prosecutors know and honor <em>Brady </em>rights may be no less \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to the risk to innocent lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><em>Brady, </em>this Court has long recognized, is among the most basic safeguards brigading a criminal defendant\u2019s fair trial right. See <em>Cone </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>556 U.S. 449, 451, 129 S. Ct. 1769, 173 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2009). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 695, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Vigilance in superintending prosecutors\u2019 attention to <em>Brady\u2019s </em>requirement is all the more important for</p>\n<p id=\"AEYg\">[563 U.S. 106]</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">this reason: A <em>Brady </em>violation, by its nature, causes suppression of evidence beyond the defendant\u2019s capacity to ferret out. Because the absence of the withheld evidence may result in the conviction of an innocent defendant, it is unconscionable not to impose reasonable controls impelling prosecutors to bring the information to light.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The Court nevertheless holds <em>Canton\u2019 </em>s example inapposite. It maintains that professional obligations, ethics rules, and training\u2014including on-the-job training\u2014set attorneys apart from other municipal employees, including rookie police officers. <em>Ante, </em>at 64-68, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 428-431. Connick \u201chad every incentive at trial to attempt to establish\u201d that he could reasonably rely on the professional education and status of his staff. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 62, n. 6, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 428. But the jury heard and rejected his argument to that effect. Tr. 364, 576-577, 834-835.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The Court advances Connick\u2019s argument with greater clarity, but with no greater support. On what basis can one be confident that law schools acquaint students with prosecutors\u2019 unique obligation under Brady? Whit-taker told the jury he did not recall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>covering <em>Brady </em>in his criminal procedure class in law school. Tr. 335. Dubelier\u2019s <em>alma mater, </em>like most other law faculties, does not make criminal procedure a required course.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Connick suggested that the bar examination ensures that new attorneys will know what <em>Brady </em>demands. Tr. 835. Research indicates, however, that from 1980 to the present, <em>Brady </em>questions have not accounted for even 10% of the total points in the criminal law and procedure section of any administration of the Louisiana Bar Examination.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A person sitting for the Louisiana Bar Examination, moreover, need</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">[563 U.S. 107]</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">pass only five of the exam\u2019s nine sections.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> One can qualify for admission to the profession with no showing of even passing knowledge of criminal law and procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The majority\u2019s suggestion that lawyers do not need <em>Brady </em>training because they \u201care equipped with the tools to find, interpret, and apply legal principles,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 70, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 432, \u201cblinks reality\u201d and is belied by the facts of this case. See Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials and Prosecutors as <em>Amici Curiae </em>13 (hereinafter Prosecutors Brief). Connick himself recognized that his prosecutors, because of their inexperience, were not so equipped. Indeed, \u201cunderstanding and complying with <em>Brady </em>obligations are not easy tasks, and the appropriate way to resolve <em>Brady </em>issues is not always self-evident.\u201d Prosecutors Brief 6. <em>\u201cBrady </em>compliance,\u201d therefore, \u201cis too much at risk, and too fundamental to the fairness of our criminal justice system, to be taken for granted,\u201d and \u201ctraining remains critical.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 3, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The majority further suggests that a prior pattern of similar violations is necessary to show deliberate indifference to defendants\u2019 <em>Brady </em>rights. See <em>ante, </em>at 57-59, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 424-425, and n. 4, 63-64, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 428-429.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">[563 U.S. 108]</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">The text of \u00a7 1983 contains no such limitation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Nor is there any reason to imply such a limitation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> A district attorney\u2019s deliberate indifference might be shown in several ways short of a prior pattern.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This case is one such instance. Connick created a tinderbox in Orleans Parish in which <em>Brady </em>violations were nigh inevitable. And when they did occur, Connick insisted there was no need to change anything, and opposed efforts to hold prosecutors accountable on the ground that doing so would make his job more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">A district attorney aware of his office\u2019s high turnover rate, who recruits prosecutors fresh out of law school and promotes them rapidly through the ranks, bears responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"aqhz-dedup-0\">[563 U.S. 109]</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">for ensuring that on-the-job training takes place. In short, the buck stops with him.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As the Court recognizes, \u201cthe duty to produce <em>Brady </em>evidence to the defense\u201d is \u201c[a]mong prosecutors\u2019 unique ethical obligations.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 66, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 430. The evidence in this case presents overwhelming support for the conclusion that the Orleans Parish Office slighted its responsibility to the profession and to the State\u2019s system of justice by providing no on-the-job <em>Brady </em>training. Con-nick was not \u201centitled to rely on prosecutors\u2019 professional training,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 67, 179 L.

Ed. 2d, at 453 (\u201cBecause prosecutors faced considerable pressure to get convictions, and were instructed to turn over what was required by state and federal law, but no more, the risk was all too real that they would err by withholding rather than revealing information favorable to the defense.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 60, n. 5, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 426 (\u201cThe dissent believes that evidence that the prosecutors allegedly \u2018misapprehended]\u2019 <em>Brady </em>proves causation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">I note, furthermore, that the jury received clear instructions on the causation element, and neither Connick nor the majority disputes the accuracy or adequacy of the instruction that, to prevail, Thompson must prove \u201cthat more likely than not the <em>Brady </em>material would have been produced if the prosecutors involved in his underlying criminal cases had been properly trained, supervised or monitored regarding the production of <em>Brady </em>evidence.\u201d Tr. 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The jury was properly instructed that \u201c [f] or liability to attach because of a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not in any particular prosecutor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1098. Under that instruction, in finding Connick liable, the jury necessarily rejected the argument\u2014echoed by Justice Scalia\u2014that Deegan \u201cwas the only bad guy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1074. See also <em>id., </em>at 1057; <em>ante, </em>at 76, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 424. If indeed Thompson had shown simply and only that Deegan deliberately withheld evidence, I would agree that there would be no basis for liability. But, as reams of evidence showed, disregard of <em>Brady </em>occurred, over and over again in Orleans Parish, before, during, and after Thompson\u2019s 1985 robbery and murder trials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b553-13\">.

When Congress sought to render a claim for relief contingent on showing a pattern or practice, it did so expressly. See, <em>e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14141(a) (\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any governmental authority ... to engage in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers . . . that deprives persons of rights . . . protected by the Constitution . . . .\u201d); 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u00a7 6104(a) (\u201cAny person adversely affected by any pattern or practice of telemarketing . . . may . . . bring a civil action . . . 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 306(e) (authorizing the Attorney General to bring a civil action when he \u201chas reason to believe that a person is engaged in a pattern or practice [of] violating this section\u2019\u2019). See also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 532(e)(2)\u2014(3) (authorizing the Federal Communications Commission to establish additional rules when \u201cthe Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b554-10\">. In the end, the majority leaves open the possibility that something other than \u201ca pattern of violations\u2019\u2019 could also give a district attorney \u201cspecific reason\u2019\u2019 to know that additional training is necessary. See <em>ante, </em>at 67, 179 L. Ed. 2d, at 430-431. Connick, by his own admission, had such a reason. See <em>supra, </em>at 96-98, 179 L.

For example, a prosecutor\u2019s office could be deliberately indifferent if it had a longstanding open-file policy, abandoned that policy, but failed to provide training to show prosecutors how to comply with their <em>Brady </em>obligations in the altered circumstances. Or a district attorney could be deliberately indifferent if he had a practice of pairing well-trained prosecutors with untrained prosecutors, knew that such supervision had stopped untrained prosecutors from committing <em>Brady </em>violations, but nevertheless changed the staffing on cases so that untrained prosecutors worked without supervision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b554-12\">. If the majority reads this statement as an endorsement of <em>respondeat superior </em>liability, <em>ante, </em>at 70, n. 12, 179 L.

Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412. Connick was directly responsible for the <em>Brady </em>violations in Thompson\u2019s prosecutions not because he hired prosecutors who violated <em>Brady, </em>but because of his own deliberate indifference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
