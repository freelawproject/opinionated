Plaintiff contends that it has not received the full amount to which it was entitled for such services. Defendant, in a counterclaim, asserts that it overpaid plaintiff for the latter\u2019s services in connection with the shipments mentioned in the petition, and that it is entitled to a judgment against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The freight charges for the transportation service so performed were billed by plaintiff on the basis of the export rate under the authority of the Transcontinental Freight Bureau Tariff 29 Series and AAR Section 22 Quotation No. 265-A, and were paid by defendant as billed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Subsequent to the Government\u2019s failure to file export certificates, as required by Item 6 of AAR Section 22 Quotation No. 265-A, plaintiff filed supplemental bills with the General Accounting Office for the difference between the export rate paid by the Government and the applicable domestic rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">On October 2, 1956 this petition was filed by plaintiff, seeking to recover the difference between the domestic rate and the export rate. On May 6, 1959 this court determined in <em>Union Pacific Railroad Company </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 145 Ct. Cl. 619, 172 F. Supp. 668 (1959) that the Government was entitled to the export rate in Tariff No. 29-Series in conjunction with AAR Section 22 Quotation No. 265-A without complying with the terms and conditions of Item 6 of that quotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">After examining the Government\u2019s proof of exportation of the shipments herein, plaintiff conceded that the export rate was applicable in accordance with the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The issue that remains in the present case for consideration and disposition by the court was raised by defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">The parties have agreed that plaintiff is entitled to the net amount of $960.56 on the claims asserted in the petition, other than the claims arising out of the 15 shipments that were involved in plaintiff\u2019s bills Nos. W-245874, W-245956, and W-246278.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">With respect to the 15 shipments that remain in controversy, the parties have agreed that the legal question to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>decided by tbe court is whether the military equipment that was involved in those shipments should:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">(a) be rated under Item 1800 of Trans-Continental Freight Bureau Tariff No. 29-1 as \u201cFreight Highway Vehicles with built-in and permanently attached machinery or machines, NOSor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">(b) be rated under Item 28380 of the Consolidated Freight Classification as \u201cCranes, derricks, or power shovels, revolving or military bridge erecting, mounted on automobile or trailer truck, loose or in packages,\u201d or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">(c) be rated under Item 1470 of Trans-Continental Freight Bureau Tariff No. 29-1 as \u201cCranes or Derricks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The 15 shipments referred to as remaining in controversy involved the transportation of a type of military equipment which was described in some of the pertinent bills of lading as a \u201cFreight Automobile (Truck Cargo) \u201d and in other bills of lading as a \u201cFreight Automobile (Cargo Truck),\u201d and which was identified by the Department of the Army in a pertinent supply catalog as a \u201cTRUCK: * * * Cargo, Treadway, ES T-1959, 6 ton, 6x6, four d.t., 220 inch wheelbase, with front mounted winch, with hydraulic crane, all makes and models.\u201d (The letters \u201cES\u201d in the designation just quoted meant \u201cEngineer Specification,\u201d the letter \u201cT\u201d meant \u201cTentative\u201d and the letters \u201cd.t.\u201d meant \u201cdual tires.\u201d) This piece of equipment was designed for use in military operations, its function being to transport a bay of vehicular treadway bridge, consisting of two treadways, the saddles, and the pontoon floats, and to provide mechanical assistance in connection with the handling and erection of the bridging materials. The Army procured the cargo-carrying body and the crane from one manufacturer, and procured the truck chassis from other manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Defendant asserts in its counterclaim that it is entitled to recover the net sum of $4,596.94 since the shipments in question should have been classified under Item 1470 of the Trans-Continental Freight Bureau Tariff No. 29-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Alternatively, defendant asserts that if the above tariff does not apply, Item 28380 of the Consolidated Freight Classification is applicable, and defendant should recover $2,537.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>We think that defendant is incorrect in its contention that Item 1470 of Tariff No. 29-1 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Item 1470 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">Machinery or Machines or Parts thereof * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">Cranes or Derricks (Subject to Note 4)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u00edj\u00ed 5|i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">Note 4. \u2014 Does not apply on shipments moving on own wheels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">The item here in controversy is clearly not a crane or derrick. It is a truck, 6 ton, 6x6, bridge erecting, w/winch. Though the \u201cvehicle is provided with a rear-mounted derrick operated by hydraulic hoists * * *\u201d the generic term derrick does not adequately describe the equipment. On the other hand, Item 1800 upon which plaintiff relies, does no better in describing this machinery. This item is not a <em>\u201cFreight Highway Vehicle </em>with built-in and permanently attached machinery or machines NOS;\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">But Item 28380 of the Consolidated Freight Classification does specifically describe the equipment here involved. In fact, in 1943 the War Department requested, and the railroads agreed, to amend Item 28380 CFC No. 15 to read \u201cCranes, derricks or power shovels, or <em>military bridge erec</em>ting, mounted on automobile or trailer truck\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] in order to add this particular military bridge erecting vehicle specifically. Item 28380 CFC, as thus amended, was thereafter issued with the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission, dated March 1, 1943, and was in effect during the period of the shipments involved in this case. Quite clearly, the rule that a specific provision will cut across a more general provision and will be applied in a proper case, should be invoked here.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Plaintiff contends, however, that defendant\u2019s alternative claim, founded as it is on Item 28380 of the Consolidated Freight Classification, seeks application of a domestic rate in lieu of the export rate. It argues that since defendant established the exportation of the shipments, defendant must accept an export rate, and cannot alternatively claim the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>benefit of a domestic rate which lies between the export rate claimed to be applicable by plaintiff, and the export rate claimed to be applicable by defendant. To support this argument, plaintiff seems to rely on our prior decision in <em>Union Pacific Railroad Co., supra. </em>In that case, we held that where both parties knew that the shipments there in question were destined for export and were in fact exported, the Government\u2019s failure to provide a notice certificate of export within the requisite sixty days was insufficient to deprive defendant of the benefit of the lower export rates. We do not think that decision establishes a controlling distinction between domestic and export rates. Rather, we think it merely upholds the accepted policy that defendant shall receive the benefits of the <em>lowest </em>rates available. This position is certainly supported by established precedent. When this court was faced with the choice of applying the higher domestic tariff or the lower export tariff in <em>Western Pacific Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>150 Ct. Cl. 1, 279 F.2d 258 (1960), Judge Jones, speaking for the court stated (at 11) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">The tariff which Western Pacific advocates applies to domestic shipments. Therefore, it seems to us that we are asked to choose between two tariffs, one for domestic freight, the other for export freight, neither of which violates the meaning of Quotation No. 64-B. The list of iron and steel articles in both tariffs was similar, and apparently neither listed nor rated airplane landing mats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">It is a familar principle in construing freight tariffs that when two tariffs are equally appropriate the one which provides the shipper with the lower rate is to be applied. Moreover, there is language in each of the tariffs presented to us in connection with Group IV to the effect that on export traffic, a rate designated as an export rate will take precedence over other rates between the same two points.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The court went on to say that the choice of the lower tariff was buttressed in logic by the fact that the goods involved had been exported, and hence the export rate should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The instant case differs from the cases cited above in that the <em>domestic </em>rate is the lower of the two rates. Moreover, there is no language in the tariffs here involved indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>that the export rate should take precedence. In such a circumstance, should the lower domestic rate control or should the export rate control ? In keeping with the general rule that the shipper should benefit from the lowest rate, we think this factor of lowest applicable rate should control notwithstanding the exportation of the goods after delivery by the carrier to the domestic destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Our conclusion that the lowest rate applicable governs is particularly compelling in the instant suit. Item 28380 of the Consolidated Freight Classification was amended in 1943 to specifically and particularly cover the equipment here involved. In this situation, where the lowest rate available is also the rate devised to specifically apply to the item in question, there can be no doubt about its applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The parties have agreed that if Item 28380 of the Consolidated Freight Classification is applicable, judgment should be entered for defendant on its counterclaim in the sum of $3,498 for the 15 shipments here in question, minus the $960.56 due plaintiff on the other claims asserted in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Since we hold that Item 28380 of the Consolidated Freight Classification is applicable, judgment is accordingly entered for defendant in the net sum of $2,537.44 in full settlement of all claims asserted by the parties in the petition and the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The court, having considered the evidence, the report of Trial Commissioner Mast\u00edn G. White, and the briefs and argument of counsel, makes findings of fact as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">1. The plaintiff is a corporation organized aad existing under the laws of the State of Utah. It is a common carrier by railroad in interstate commerce over its own lines and jointly with other carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">2. During the years 1945 to 1951, inclusive, the plaintiff, as the final and delivering carrier, performed freight transportation services for the defendant from various points of origin in the United States to destination points on the plaintiff\u2019s lines, in connection with 40 separate shipments that are involved in the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>3. (a) The freight charges for the transportation services referred to in finding 2 were billed by the plaintiff and were paid by the defendant as billed. There were 14 bills covering the 40 shipments. Upon subsequent audit by the General Accounting Office, that office made adjustments in connection with a number of the charges. In some instances, the adjustments were made by means of deductions from amounts otherwise due the plaintiff with respect to transportation services not directly involved in this case. In other instances, the adjustments were accomplished by means of refunds demanded of and paid by the plaintiff. The payment and audit procedure was in accordance with the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">(b) The petition was filed on October 2, 1956, to recover the amounts of the adjustments mentioned in paragraph (a) of this finding and, in addition, to recover the amounts of certain alleged undercharges and underpayments which (according to the plaintiff) had been made in connection with some of the original bills referred to in paragraph (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">(c) The principal issue raised by the petition related to the failure of the Government to furnish export certificates, as required by Item 6 of AAR Section 22 Quotation No. 265-A. The shipments involving the principal question were initially billed and paid for on the basis of the export rate under the authority of Trans-Continental Freight Bureau Tariff 29 Series and AAR Section 22 Quotation No. 265-A. Subsequent to the Government\u2019s failure to file export certificates, as required by Item 6 of AAR Section 22 Quotation No. 265-A, the plaintiff filed supplemental bills with the General Accounting Office for the difference between the export rate paid by the Government and the applicable domestic rate. However, the Government contended that it was entitled to the export rate under the authority of TCFB Tariff 29 without complying with the terms and conditions of Quotation No. 265-A. This action was then filed in the Court of Claims by the plaintiff. With respect to the principal issue, the petition sought to recover the difference between the domestic rate and the export rate in the Tariff 29 Series.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">(d) On May 6,1959, this court determined, in another case styled <em>Union Pacific Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 145 Ct. Cl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>619, that the Government was entitled to the export rate in the Tariff 29 Series, in conjunction with AAR Section 22 Quotation No. 265-A, without complying with the terms and conditions of Item 6 of that quotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">(e) In view of the decision referred to in paragraph (d) of this finding, the plaintiff in the present case, after examination of the proof of exportation furnished by the Government, conceded that the export rate on the described commodities was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">4. The issue that remains in the present case for consideration and disposition by the court (see findings 6-16) was raised by the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">5. The parties have agreed that the plaintiff is entitled to the net amount of $960.56 on the claims asserted in the petition, other than the claims arising out of the 15 shipments that were involved in the plaintiff\u2019s bills Nos. W-245874, W-245956, and W-246278. Those 15 shipments are dealt with in findings 6-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">6. The 15 shipments referred to in finding 5 as remaining in controversy involved the transportation of a type of military equipment which was described in some of the pertinent bills of lading as a \u201cFreight Automobile (Truck Cargo)\u201d and in other bills of lading as a \u201cFreight Automobile (Cargo Truck),\u201d and which was identified by the Department of the Army in a pertinent supply catalog as a \u201cTRUCK: * * * Cargo, treadway, ES T-1959, 6 ton, 6x6, four d.t., 220 inch wheelbase, with front mounted winch, with hydraulic crane, all makes and models.\u201d (The letters \u201cES\u201d in the designation just quoted meant \u201cEngineer Specification\u201d; the letter \u201cT\u201d meant \u201cTentative\u201d; and the letters \u201cd.t.\u201d meant \u201cdual tires.\u201d) This piece of equipment was designed for use in military operations, its function being to transport a bay of a vehicular treadway bridge, consisting of two treadways, the saddles, and the pontoon floats, and to provide mechanical assistance in connection with the handling and erection of the bridging materials. The Army procured the cargo-carrying body and the crane from one manufacturer, and procured the truck chassis from other manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">7. The articles involved in the 15 shipments mentioned in findings 5 and 6 were shipped by the Engineer Supply Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>tion, Utah General Depot, Ogden, Utah, and were consigned to the Port Transportation Officer, Seattle Port of Embarkation, Seattle, Washington, for export during the month of January 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">8. With respect to the 15 shipments that remain in controversy, the parties have agreed that the legal question to be decided by the court is whether the military equipment that was involved in those shipments should:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">(a) be rated under Item 1800 of Trans-Continental Freight Bureau Tariff No. 29-1 as \u201cFreight Highway Vehicles with built-in and permanently attached machinery or machines, NOS\u201d; or</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">(b) be rated under Item 28380 of the Consolidated Freight Classification as \u201cCranes, derricks or power shovels, revolving or military bridge erecting, mounted on automobile or trailer truck, loose or in packages\u201d; or</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">(c) be rated under Item 1470 of Trans-Continental Freight Bureau Tariff No. 29-1 as \u201cCranes or Derricks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">,9. With respect to the 15 shipments that remain in controversy, the parties have further agreed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">(a) If Item 1800 of Trans-Continental Freight Bureau Tariff No. 29-1 is applicable, neither side is due anything in connection with the 15 shipments that remain in controversy; the defendant\u2019s counterclaim should be dismissed; and judgment should be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $960.56 under finding 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">(b) If Item 28380 of the Consolidated Freight Classification is applicable, the defendant is due the net amount of $3,498 on its counterclaim in connection with the 15 shipments that remain in controversy; and judgment should be entered for the defendant in the net sum of $2,537.44 ($3,498 minus the $960.56 mentioned in finding 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">(c) If Item 1470 of Trans-Continental Freight Bureau Tariff No. 29-1 is applicable, the defendant is due the net amount of $5,557.50 on its counterclaim in connection with the 15 shipments that remain in controversy; and judgment should be entered for the defendant in the net sum of $4,596.94 ($5,557.50 minus the $960.56 mentioned in finding 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>10.
