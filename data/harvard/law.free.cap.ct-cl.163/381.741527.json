The invitation stated that \u201cthe Government desires delivery\u201d of the items in accordance with a definite schedule (ranging from September 30, 1956, to August 31, 1957), but it was also provided that \u201cin the event bidder is unable to make deliveries in accordance with the foregoing schedule, he shall set forth in the space below his proposed delivery schedule.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Immediately beneath this blank space for the bidder\u2019s own delivery schedule, the form declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">Bids offering a proposed delivery schedule which will extend the time for the delivery of the quantities as called for in any delivery period of the foregoing delivery schedule by more than 60 days, <em>may </em>be cause for rejection of bid [emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Plaintiff John Reiner &amp; Company submitted a bid with its own delivery schedule specifying dates more than 60 days after those listed by the Government in the invitation. When the bids were opened on June 21,1956, Reiner was the lowest in price of the thirteen bidders. Seven others proposed their own delivery schedules, some (like Reiner) offering delivery dates more than 60 days beyond the invitation times. The Corps of Engineers then inquired of the requisitioning agency (the Signal Corps) whether plaintiff\u2019s schedule was satisfactory and met its requirements. Upon receiving an affirmative reply, the Engineers notified plaintiff by telephone, on June 29,1956, that its bid had been accepted; this was followed by a written notice of award received on July 2, 1956. The formal contract came shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Plaintiff proceeded to negotiate with suppliers of the main components of the generator sets and to incur certain other limited costs under the contract. Before it was well launched, however, it received word from the defendant (on August 3, 1956) to suspend all operations under the contract until further notice and to inform its suppliers and subcontractors accordingly. This came about because, unknown to plaintiff, an unsuccessful bidder had prevailed upon the General Accounting Office to rule that the award was improper and the contract should be cancelled. That Office felt that the invitation did not adequately inform bidders as to how they should bid with respect to delivery dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s efforts to have the Comptroller General\u2019s decision reversed were fruitless, and on September 21, 1956, the contracting officer informed plaintiff that in compliance with the ruling its contract was cancelled. On September 24th, Reiner replied that the Comptroller General\u2019s decision was not binding on the Army and that the contractor considered the cancellation a breach for which it would seek recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>of full damages. This suit was then brought for breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The initial question is whether the award was illegal and void so that the plaintiff cannot found a court action upon it. This inquiry, we believe, is not precisely the same as that with which the Comptroller General dealt. Because of his general concern with the proper operation of competitive bidding in government procurement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he can make recommendations and render decisions that, as a matter of procurement policy, awards on contracts should be cancelled or withdrawn even though they would not be held invalid in court. He is not confined to the minimal measure of legality but can sponsor and encourage the observance of higher standards by the procuring agencies. Courts, on the other hand, are restricted, when an invitation or award is challenged, to deciding the rock-bottom issue of whether the contract purported to be made by the Government was invalid and therefore no contract at all \u2014 not whether another procedure would have been preferable or better attuned to the aims of the competitive bidding legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">In testing the enforceability of an award made by the Government, where a problem of the validity of the invitation or the responsiveness of the accepted bid arises after the award,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court should ordinarily impose the binding stamp of nullity only when the illegality is plain. If the contracting officer has viewed the award as lawful, and it is reasonable to take that position under the legislation and regulations, the court should normally follow suit. Any other course could place the contractor in an unfortunate dilemma. If he questions the award and refuses to accept it because of his own doubts as to possible illegality, the contracting officer could forfeit his bid bond for refusing to enter into the contract. The full risk of an adverse decision on validity would then rest on the bidder. If he accedes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>to the contracting officer and commences performance of the contract, a subsequent holding of non-enforceability would lead to denial of all recovery under the agreement even though the issue of legality is very close; and under the doctrine of quantum meruit there would be no reimbursement for expenses incurred in good faith but only for any tangible benefits actually received by the defendant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mississippi Valley Generating Co., </em>364 U.S. 520, 566 n. 22 (1961); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>United States, </em>95 U.S. 539, 542 (1877). It is therefore just to the contractor, as well as to the Government, to give him the benefit of reasonable doubts and to uphold the award unless its invalidity is clear. Cf. 17 Comp. Gen. 53, 54-55 (1937).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Applying that norm, we cannot deem this award to have been a nullity. Reiner\u2019s bid was responsive to the invitation which allowed the bidders to set their own delivery schedules and went no further than to caution that schedules extending the time over 60 days beyond that designated in the defendant\u2019s preferred (\u201cdesired\u201d) schedule <em>might </em>be cause for rejection. There was no statement or indication that time was of the essence. On other occasions plaintiff, answering the same type of invitation, had proposed schedules extending the procurement agency\u2019s desired schedule by more than 60 days and had been granted the contracts. This was an accepted form for procurement by the Corps of Engineers. There was no reason to think that in this particular invitation <em>\u201cmay </em>be cause for rejection\u201d (emphasis added) meant <em>\u201cwill\u201d </em>or <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>be cause for rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">But, defendant urges, this very provision, with its implicit permission to propose longer schedules, vitiated the invitation. The \u201cfull and free competition\u201d envisaged by the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, \u00a7 3, 62 Stat. 21, 22-23, as amended, 69 Stat. 551-52 (1955), 41 U.S.C. \u00a7152 (1952 ed.), was stifled, it is said, by allowing bidders to present their own delivery program, no matter how protracted. One charge levied against this phase of the invitation is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>it was so worded tliat bidders would not understand that they could depart from the listed schedule by more than 60 days. This does not seem probable. The form used the permissive word \u201cmay\u201d instead of the mandatory \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cshall\u2019; its ordinary meaning would be that bidders took their chances in offering a too-extended schedule but were not barred from shouldering that risk. In previous uses of this standard form bidders had apparently not felt themselves limited to a deviation of 60 days; in this very case others than Reiner extended their suggested dates for more than that period. There is no showing that any bidder was actually misled. Like much procurement prose, the delivery section of the invitation was not a stylist\u2019s model, but we think it conveyed its meaning sufficiently to ward off the charge of undue ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The second vice defendant marks in the invitation is that it left both bidders and the contracting officer too much at large.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The latter might or might not accept a lower bid with an extended delivery schedule, rather than a \u201ctimely\u201d one at a higher price. From the viewpoint of improving procurement procedures, the Comptroller General could well believe that some method of evaluating the bids according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>to both, price and delivery dates should have been explicitly stated. That defect, however, was not so deep or so clear that it nullified the invitation as a matter of law. The bidders were not helpless. They were free to submit more than one bid if the delivery schedule affected their price proposals ; they could file, if they wished, one price based on the Government\u2019s schedule, another on an extension of less than 60 days, and a third on an extension of over 60 days. The contracting officer, for his part, would be guided by the directives in the Procurement Act of 1947 to consider \u201cthe requirements of the agency concerned\u201d and the bid which was \u201cmost advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.\u201d 62 Stat. 23, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(a), (b) (1952 ed.). To the extent that quicker delivery was called for by the procuring agency, the contracting officer would evaluate on the basis of price those bids meeting the earlier delivery requirement; if a delayed schedule turned out to be acceptable, the other bidders would enter the widened circle of competition. That would be the natural and proper way to proceed and that is the way the contracting officer did proceed. The Procurement Act was designed to leave to him business discretion of this type and measure. See S. Rep. No. 571, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 2-3. In the circumstances present here, the contracting officer did not assume for himself so great an area of judgment as to destroy the free competition (on a common basis) the statute demands. We hold, accordingly, that the award to plaintiff must be deemed lawful, not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The next inquiry concerns the nature of the cancellation resulting from the Comptroller General\u2019s ruling and the damages to which the contractor is entitled. Plaintiff characterizes the cancellation as a clear breach, entailing the full common-law measure of recovery; it points out that the contracting officer did not purport to terminate the contract for the Government\u2019s convenience or to follow the procedures established for that kind of termination. Those were in fact the circumstances of the cancellation but the plaintiff\u2019s conclusion does not necessarily follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>If the contracting officer had deliberately employed the termination-for-convenience article of the contract, his action would have been entirely valid. Such termination is authorized \u201cwhenever the contracting officer shall determine\u201d that it is \u201cin the best interests of the Government.\u201d The broad reach of that phrase comprehends termination in a host of variable and unspecified situations calling (in the contracting officer\u2019s view) for the ending of the agreement; the article is not restricted, as plaintiff contends, to a decrease in the need for the item purchased. Under such an all-inclusive clause, the Government has the right to terminate \u201cat will\u201d <em>(Davis Sewing Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>60 Ct. Cl. 201, 217 (1925), <em>aff'd, </em>273 U.S. 324 (1927); <em>Librach </em>v. <em>United States, </em>147 Ct. Cl. 605, 611 (1959)), and in the absence of bad faith or clear abuse of discretion the contracting officer\u2019s election to terminate is conclusive. See <em>Line Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>109 Ct. Cl. 154, 187 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Here, termination would have been invoked in deference to the Comptroller General\u2019s declaration that the contract should be cancelled. The contracting officer did not agree with that opinion, but it is the usual policy, if not the obligation, of the procuring departments to accommodate themselves to positions formally taken by the General Accounting Office with respect to competitive bidding. That Office, as we have pointed out, has special concern with, and supervision over, that aspect of procurement. It would be entirely justifiable for the contracting officer to follow the general policy of acceding to the views of the Accounting Office in this area even though he had another position on the particular issue of legality or propriety. He would not be allowing the Comptroller General to dictate the termination of the contract but, rather, would be using termination as a means of minimizing a conflict with another arm of Government properly concerned with the contractual problem.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It cannot be contrary to \u201cthe best interests of the Government\u201d \u2014 the controlling standard of the termination clause\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>to end a contract which the Comptroller General has branded as incorrectly advertised.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Plaintiff refers to decisions holding that a contracting officer should not abdicate his functions to another official <em>(e.g., Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>76 Ct. Cl. 154, 187 (1932)), but those were cases in which someone else made specific determinations of fact under the contract, for example, that the contractor was in default or had no excusable delays. In this case the contracting officer would not be shifting a problem to the General Accounting Office; he would simply be deciding that the Government\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d required that as a matter of general policy he bow to an opinion of the Comptroller General on competitive bidding, even though he thought it wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Plaintiff emphasizes, of course, that the contracting officer did not invoke the termination clause as we hold that he could well have done. But this phase of the contractual history does not compel us to hold that in cancelling the contract the contracting officer committed a common-law breach. Almost forty years ago, in <em>College Point Boat Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 12, 15-16 (1925), the Supreme Court gave us the lead (speaking through Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is) in a closely comparable case. The defendant purported to cancel a Navy contract in midstream, without benefit of any power of termination reserved in the agreement and without knowledge that the Navy had such authority under a World War I statute. \u201c[S]o far as appears, neither party knew that the United States had such a right. The Navy Department failed to give the notice requisite to terminate the contract\u201d (id. at 15). It appeared on the surface that the defendant was anticipatorily breaching the contract. The Court held, nevertheless, that the contractor could only recover the measure of relief allowed by the termination statute. \u201cA party to a contract who is sued for its breach may ordinarily defend on the ground that there existed, at the time, a legal excuse for nonperformance by him, although he was then ignorant of the fact. He may, likewise, justify an asserted termination, rescission, or repudiation, of a contract by proving that there was, at the time, an adequate cause, although it did not become known to him until later.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Id. at 15-16 (footnotes omitted). The Government\u2019s right to terminate was held effective when asserted later in court, and recovery of prospective profits was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling embraces this case. The broad termination clause in plaintiff\u2019s contract stands in the place of the statutory termination power involved in <em>College Point Boat Corp. </em>(the Act of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 182). Under that clause, we have shown above, the defendant had a valid ground to terminate. As the Supreme Court held, such \u201cadequate cause\u201d for termination may be asserted as a defense to a breach action even though it may not have been known at the time of cancellation. The contracting officer on plaintiff\u2019s contract probably thought that he was cancel-ling the agreement for illegality. That excuse was not a valid justification as we now know, but just as in <em>College Point Boat Corp. </em>a good ground did exist in the far-reaching right to terminate under the termination article. That justifiable cause controls the case and \u201coperate [s] to curtail the damages recoverable\u201d (267 U.S. at 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Some of the foregoing may seem incompatible with certain observations in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 152 Ct. Cl. 8, 16-20, 285 F. 2d 778, 782-85 (1961). That case dealt with an erroneous termination for default which the defendant later sought to turn into a convenience termination. The only <em>holding </em>of the court (on this point) is that, once the Government wrongfully terminates for default where there has been no default, it cannot thereafter seek to avoid liability by invoking a convenience termination. That holding the court accepts and reaffirms today in <em>Goldwasser </em>v. <em>United States, post, </em>p. 450. Although some portions of the <em>Klein </em>opinion may seem to go beyond that holding if taken out of context, we now read the case as confined to the issue of default presented by its facts. Indeed, the <em>Klein </em>decision appears to have put aside situations like the present when it said that that case \u201chas no resemblance to that of one who has terminated a contract for a stated reason, which turns out to be insupportable, but later discovers and relies on a valid reason for cancellation\u201d (152 Ct. Cl. at 19, 285 F. 2d at 784). See also <em>Newark Fireproofing Sash &amp; Door Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>107 Ct. Cl. 606, 627, 69 F. Supp. 121, 124 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Just as the failure to invoke the termination article leaves untouched the defendant\u2019s right to rely on the damage limitation of that clause, so the failure to follow the termination procedures of the Armed Services Procurement Regulations (ASPR) is ineffective to broaden plaintiff\u2019s rights of recovery. Those regulatory provisions have the force of law <em>(G. L. Christian and Associates </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 160 Ct. Cl. 58, 320 F. 2d 345 (1963)), but a departure from their requirements does not convert a termination into a common-law breach subjecting the United States to liability for unearned anticipated profits any more than would a deviation from the procedures set forth in a statutory provision for termination. Unless the contractor can show that he has been injured by the failure to pursue the ASPR procedures, such a lapse is immaterial to his recovery. Cf. <em>J. W. Bateson Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 F. 2d 510, 514 (C.A. 5, 1962). Plaintiff does not claim, and there is no reason to believe, that it was hurt by the informal procedures followed here. As soon as the Comptroller General had ruled, Reiner was told to suspend all operations, to defer incurring any further expenses, and to inform its subcontractors and suppliers. It did so immediately. The amount of plaintiff\u2019s termination expenses is known because it has stipulated the exact sum recoverable on the basis of a convenience termination, <em>i.e., </em>$17,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">This stipulation facilitates our disposition of the case. Since we hold that Reiner is entitled to recover only the amount collectible on a termination for convenience, and that sum is agreed to be $17,000, we shall enter judgment in that figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We add that, in the present circumstances, there is another ground, related but separate, why plaintiff is restricted to this stipulated amount. Even if we assume that the reasoning of <em>College Point Boat Corp. </em>is inapplicable, the plaintiff could not recover anticipated but unearned profits without clear and direct proof that it would have made such gains. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Penn Foundry &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>337 U.S. 198 (1949); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Behan, </em>110 U.S. 338, 344 (1884). That type of proof is unavailable here because the plaintiff cannot show that its contract would have been allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>continue to completion. A standard termination clause was ever-ready for use and it is more than likely that this contracting officer (who thought the award to plaintiff valid) would have acted explicitly under that provision to end performance legally as soon as someone he deemed authoritative had whispered in his ear that he was breaching the agreement by cancelling it in the way he did. Since plaintiff cannot show that that would not have happened, it must fail in its quest for prospective profits. See the opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas for the four concurring Justices in <em>Penn Foundry &amp; Mfg. </em>Co., <em>supra </em>at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Plaintiff Reiner sues also on behalf of Kurz &amp; Root Company, an actual or potential subcontractor. After Reiner had received the award for the generator sets at the end of June 1956 it negotiated with Kurz <em>&amp; </em>Root to supply the generators, one of the major components. An oral agreement was reached on July 10,1956, and Kurz &amp; Root then began preliminary work, but no written purchase order was executed prior to suspension of the prime contract on August 3, 1956. At that time Reiner advised Kurz &amp; Root to stop all work. Defendant insists that no valid subcontract was ever made and that, in any event, nothing is recoverable on behalf of Kurz &amp; Root.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">We need not decide (i) whether Reiner had an enforceable agreement with Kurz &amp; Root, (ii) if so, whether Reiner can sue on its subcontractor\u2019s behalf, or (iii) whether the claim is barred because not included in Reiner\u2019s own termination claim. The record fails to show that the subcontractor suffered any damages from the defendant\u2019s cancellation of the main contract. Almost nine months after this cancellation, the Government re-let the very same contract to another company (John R. Hollingsworth Corp.) and Kurz &amp; Root obtained the subcontract to produce the 3,567 generators which it would have supplied to Reiner. It made a good profit on that subcontract, more than would necessarily have been expected and more than it claims it would have made on the subcontract with Reiner. Kurz &amp; Root cannot obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>these profits twice. The Hollingsworth contract and subcontract would never have existed had there been no cancellation of the Reiner contract; nor is there substantial ground for belief that Kurz &amp; Root lost other business because it undertook to supply Reiner. In these circumstances the gains made under the second contract must be deducted from the damages claimed for the alleged breach of the Reiner agreement. Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7 336, <em>Comment c; Canton-Hughes Pump Co. </em>v. Llera, 205 Fed. 209, 215 (C.A. 6, 1913); <em>Ed. 8. Michelson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nebraska Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>63 F. 2d 597, 601 (C.A. 8, 1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Kurz &amp; Root did incur some preliminary expenses on the Reiner generator but there is no evidence whether or not this work was useful in the performance of the Hollingsworth subcontract; moreover, the evidence of these out-of-pocket expenses was not well supported. On the whole record, we are justified in finding, as we do, that Kurz &amp; Root has failed to prove that it was damaged to any appreciable extent by the suspension and cancellation of the Reiner contract. No right to recover has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Our conclusion is that plaintiff is entitled to recover $17,000 on its own claim and judgment will be entered to that effect. It is not entitled to recover on behalf of Kurz &amp; Root Company and its petition will be dismissed to that extent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\"> For reflections of the Comptroller General\u2019s particular Interest in the competitive bidding system, see 37 Comp.

In that situation my belief is that plaintiff Goldwasser should have an opportunity to prove a breach thereof and resulting damages, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The contract in the instant case was not terminated for default, and I believe under the circumstances of this case the correct measure of damages should be based on the cost resulting from the termination provision of the contract.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Whitaker, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aab-dedup-0\">dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Having written the opinion of the court in <em>Goldwasser </em>v. <em>United </em>States, this day decided, post, p. 4-50, it follows that I disagree with the opinion in this case. It reiterates, I think, the positions taken in the dissenting opinions in the <em>Goldwasser </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In <em>Goldwasser, </em>the defendant became dissatisfied with plaintiff\u2019s performance but it did not refuse further to honor the contract because plaintiff had defaulted in performance, but, instead, took refuge in the \u201cindefinite-quantities\u201d clause of the contract, contending that under that clause it was no longer obligated to avail itself of plaintiff\u2019s services. Because we thought this clause was inapplicable and that defendant had wrongfully refused to further honor the contract unless plaintiff was actually in default, and because it did not take advantage of the termination-for-convenience-of-the-Govemment clause, we held this clause did not prescribe the measure of defendant\u2019s liability, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Nor in the case at bar did defendant take advantage of the termination-for-convenience-of-the-Govemment clause; it cancelled the contract because, acting upon the opinion of the Comptroller General, it held that it had been awarded without compliance with the statute and was, therefore, a nullity. It is a contradiction to say that it terminated a contract that in law it asserted had never existed. Whether it had a right to do so or not is immaterial, because it did not in fact do so. The possession of a right means nothing unless that right is exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">As in the <em>Goldwasser </em>case, a cancellation of the contract because it had been illegally entered into involved no liability on the part of the Government; a termination for convenience did render the Government liable. The Contracting Officer chose the former course. The Government is bound by the action he took.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">What I have said is in harmony with our holding in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>United States, </em>152 Ct. Cl. 8, 285 F. 2d 778 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The majority relies upon <em>College Point Boat Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 12 (1925), affirming 58 Ct. Cl 380 (1923), but in that case there was no election by the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ment between two alternative courses of action, one of which subjected the Government to liability and the other did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">FINDINGS OE PACT</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The court, having considered the evidence, the report of Trial Commissioner Paul H. McMurray, and the briefs and arguments of counsel, making findings of fact as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">1. Plaintiff John Reiner &amp; Company (sometimes hereinafter referred to as Reiner) was a limited partnership at times material herein which formerly had its principal place of business at Long Island City, New York. In 1956 Reiner was a manufacturer of special-purpose generator sets and pump units. The firm was also an exclusive distributor in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the New England states of machinery and equipment manufactured by others, maintaining distributor branches in Syracuse, New York, Springfield, Massachusetts, and Flemington, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">2. Reiner received from defendant, acting through the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago Procurement Office, Invitation No. DA-ENG-41-184-56-F-707, requesting bids for the furnishing of 3,567 5KW generator sets. The invitation, originally issued under date of May 18, 1956, and amended by four addenda, contained the following special terms and conditions as to delivery of the generator sets (Iteml) and a tabular list of parts (Item 3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">11. <em>Delmery Scheckile: </em>The Government desires delivery of the articles or supplies awarded under this invitation in accordance with the following schedule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">\n<em>Item 1 Item 3</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">172 units 30 Sept. 1956 6 each \u2014 31 Oct. 1956</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">300 units 31 Oct. 1956</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO3S\">300 units 30 Nov. 1956</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeA\">300 units 31 Dec. 1956</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aya-dedup-0\">350 units 31 Jan. 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avr\">350 units 28 Feb. 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8y\">350 units 30 Mar. 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"auu-dedup-0\">350 units 30 Apr. 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAvp\">350 units 31 May 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAih\">350 units 29 June 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a4k-dedup-0\">350 units 31 July 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAs4\">45 units 31 Aug. 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>In the event bidder is unable to make deliveries in accordance with the foregoing schedule, he shall set forth in the below his proposed delivery schedule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAua\">\n<em>Bidder's Proposed Delivery Schedule:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA8u\">[Blank space of several lines provided in form.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8J\">Bids offering a proposed delivery schedule which will extend the time for the delivery of the quantities as called for in any delivery period of the foregoing delivery schedule by more than 60 days, may be cause for rejection of bid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">In the event a bidder does not set forth a proposed delivery schedule the Government\u2019s delivery schedule as hereabove set forth shall be bidder\u2019s proposed delivery schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The General Provisions provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">12.

If delivery is of importance to the requisitioning agencies as indicated by the delivery requirements, no exception should be considered unless a like exception is extended to all bidders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">\u201c4. If delivery is not of consequence to the requisitioning agencies, then a restrictive or suggestive clause that refers to the possible rejection of a bid exceeding by more than sixty days the desired delivery, should not have been included in the invitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">Section 3 (b) of the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, 62 Stat. 21, 23, provides that all bids shall be publicly opened at the time and place stated in the advertisement and that \u201cAward shall be made with reasonable promptness by written notice to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.\u201d The purpose of this statute is, of course, to afford all bidders an opportunity to bid on an equal basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">We have held that time of delivery may be considered in making an award, price alone not being controlling, when early delivery is required in the Government\u2019s interest, and when the invitation to bid so provides, all bidders thus being placed on notice and given an equal opportunity to compete for the Government\u2019s business. In the present case the advertised specifications expressly advised bidders that the Government desired delivery of the equipment on the dates and in the quantities set forth in the bid schedule. The reasonable interpretation of this delivery provision is that the Government required the equipment on the dates and in the quantities stated. While the invitation for bids purported to afford an opportunity^ to bidders to propose a different delivery schedule if they could not meet the Government\u2019s delivery requirements, the force and effect thereof was virtually eliminated by the further provision to the effect that any proposed delivery schedule which would extend the time for delivery as called for in the Government\u2019s \u201cdelivery schedule by more than 60 days, may .be cause for rejection of bid.\u201d It would seem only logical to assume that, in the face of this clear admonition, those bidders who promised delivery in compliance with the Government\u2019s delivery requirements did not propose any longer schedule since no useful purpose apparently would be served thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>If the requisitioning agency did not actually require delivery on the dates specified then the dates should have been extended in line with the Government\u2019s requirement, or some alternative should have been left to the bidders to offer longer delivery schedules at lower prices, in which event, of course, some method of evaluating the bids according to price and delivery dates should have been stated. Had all bidders been given an opportunity to bid on the basis of the delivery schedule offered by the low bidder as being the time required by the Government, it is reasonable to assume that additional bids would have been received quoting more favorable prices and that those bidders quoting prices for delivery within the time stated as desired by the Government might have quoted prices even lower than that quoted by the successful bidder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">Under the circumstances we have no alternative but to conclude that the award as made does violence to the spirit and purpose of the law due to the fact that the bidders were not properly advised as to the basis upon which bids should have been submitted. Hence, the contract should be cancelled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">11. Reiner had observed the same delivery clauses in other prior invitations as was contained in the invitation involved herein and had on other occasions proposed delivery schedules extending the procurement agency\u2019s desired schedule by more than 60 days, and had been awarded contracts on such invitations when the bid was lowest in price. The same form of \u201cdelivery schedule\u201d provisions had previously been used by the Corps of Engineers in many invitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">12. Reiner\u2019s attempt to have the Comptroller General\u2019s decision reversed was unsuccessful, and on September 21, 1956, the contracting officer sent Reiner a telegram as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">IN REPLY REFER TO ENGPB-3-1785 SGD COL MURRAY CONTRACTING OFFICER.

Reiner did not receive a telegram or letter from the contracting officer specifically stating that the prime contract was terminated for the convenience of the Government pursuant to clause 21 of the General Provisions of the prime contract. The contracting officer did not send to Reiner a set of standard forms for the submission of a settlement proposal of its termination claims, nor did the contracting officer request Reiner to settle the termination claims of its subcontractors and suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-19\">15. On September 24,1956, Reiner replied to the telegram of September 21, 1956, from the contracting officer with a telegram as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-20\">REFER TO ENG PB-3-1Y85 SGD COL.

YOU ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT YOUR NOTICE OF CANCELLATION IS DEEMED A FORMAL ADMISSION OF BREACH OF CONTRACT ON THE PART OF YOUR DEPARTMENT AND THAT WE INTEND TO SEEK RECOVERY OF FULL DAMAGES FOR SAID BREACH AND TO PURSUE SUCH OTHER REMEDIES AS MAY BE ADVISABLE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">16. At the time -when the contract was cancelled, Reiner desired to continue performance and had the physical facilities, the personnel, the financing and the knowledge to complete the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">17. The parties have stipulated that if it should be determined that Reiner\u2019s individual claim is to be restricted to the costs recoverable on the basis of a termination for the convenience of the Government, Reiner would be entitled to recover $17,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">18. Reiner claims individual damages for breach of the prime contract by defendant of $457,713, consisting of estimated loss of profits of $440,713 plus unrecovered costs of $17,000. Plaintiff determined its claim by adding estimated costs of material, direct labor, and overhead, and deducting this sum from the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">19. Kurz <em>&amp; </em>Root Company (Incorporated) (hereinafter referred to as Kurz &amp; Root) is a Wisconsin corporation, organized in 1898, which has its principal plant and place of business in Appleton, Wisconsin. In 1956 it was a manufacturer of rotary electrical equipment, primarily generators. Approximately 90 percent of its manufacturing was for the United States Department of Defense, as both a prime contractor and subcontractor. It had approximately 200 employees in its plants at Appleton and Seymour, Wisconsin, and Los Angeles, California. Kurz &amp; Root has manufactured more than 50,000 generators. Eugene B. Brownell, its president, was the sole owner of Kurz &amp; Root at times material herein. In May 1961 he owned approximately 86 percent of the stock which would have been reduced to 80 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>if certain key employees had elected to take up stock options held by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">20. After Eeiner had been awarded the prime contract involved in this action, Brownell, as president of Kurz <em>&amp; </em>Eoot, entered into negotiations with John Merk, Eeiner\u2019s general manager, in an effort to obtain a subcontract for the generators. On July 10, 1956, at Eeiner\u2019s offices, they reached an oral agreement that Kurz &amp; Eoot would furnish the generators to Eeiner at a price of $200 per unit, delivery to be made 60 days prior to the dates proposed by Eeiner in the prime contract and in the quantities therein specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">21. Eeiner assigned Purchase Order No. EM 16200 for contemplated use in submitting an order to Kurz &amp; Eoot, but had not written up such purchase order nor placed any information regarding the verbal agreement with Kurz &amp; Eoot on the purchase order prior to suspension and cancellation of the prime contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">22. Kurz <em>&amp; </em>Eoot began certain necessary preliminary work on the 5KW generator which it planned to supply Eeiner, after the oral agreement of July 10,1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">23. After the suspension of August 3, 1956, Eeiner advised Kurz &amp; Eoot by telephone to stop work under the subcontract. On August 6,1956, Kurz &amp; Eoot was notified that the contracting officer had ordered suspension of all operations in performance of the prime contract and had required Eeiner to notify subcontractors to avoid incurring any further costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">24. The New York Statute of Frauds provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">\u00a7 31. <em>Agreements required to be in writing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-12\">Every agreement, promise or undertaking is void, unless it or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing, and subscribed by the party to be charged therewith, or by his lawful agent, if such agreement, promise or undertaking;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">1. By its terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof or the performance of which is not to be completed before the end of a lifetime. (As amended L. 1911, c. 571, \u00a7 2; L. 1933, c. 616; L. 1943, c. 104; L. 1949, c. 203, eff. Sept. 1,1949; Personal Property Law, \u00a7 31.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">The evidence does not show that Kurz &amp; Eoot would have delivered all the generators needed for Eeiner\u2019s contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>within a year\u2019s time, although the same number of similar generators was subsequently produced in approximately one year for another contractor (finding 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">25. On August 7, 1956, Kurz &amp; Root wrote Reiner, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">In accordance with your advice, we have ceased all further activity here and have placed a hold on our suppliers in reference to this order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">$ $ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">We are further quite disturbed because we have based our 1957 operations upon this contract as the backlog contract. Knowing that we had this order, we have refrained from bidding on certain other business that we otherwise would have gone after. It is now too late to seek that business. Further, in one case we bid higher than we would have except for having this backlog contract and we missed an award for that reason. We have also arranged to sub-contract certain business which we now cannot bring back into our plant. I cite these examples to show you the difficulties we run into when we have a hold up of this character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">If there is a substantial delay before we are able to proceed, it will be necessary for us to adjust our price upward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">26. Kurz <em>&amp; </em>Root was subsequently notified by Reiner that the prime contract had been cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">At the time of the cancellation Kurz &amp; Root had the facilities, the knowledge, and the financial capacity to perform this subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">27. Kurz &amp; Root has insisted that Reiner is liable for breach of a subcontract, and requested Reiner to include its claim in Reiner\u2019s action against defendant. However, in view of the circumstances of cancellation, Kurz &amp; Root advised Reiner they would not press for payment of their claim if plaintiff does not prevail in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">28. Plaintiff claims damages to the use of Kurz &amp; Root of $167,383, consisting of (1) estimated loss of profits of $157,744 plus (2) unrecovered out-of-pocket costs of $9,639. The latter item is based primarily on a computation which is arrived at by using estimated costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">29. After cancellation of the prime contract here involved, the same contract was re-let as DA-ENG-H-184-57-F-616 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>JD, the date of invitation being March 26, 1957. Plaintiff Reiner bid on this contract also, but was unsuccessful, and the contract was awarded to the John R. Hollingsworth Corp. Although this re-let contract was not put in evidence, two of Reiner\u2019s witnesses, Nicholas and Brownell, admitted that the contract involved in this suit was re-let. Kurz &amp; Root obtained the subcontract from Hollingsworth to produce the 3,567 generators involved. These units were produced by Kurz &amp; Root for Hollingsworth. They were priced at $180 each and were basically the same as the unit which was to have been produced previously for Reiner, except that they lacked certain accessories, including a fan, etc., which was to have been included in the Reiner unit (see finding 46). Kurz &amp; Root made more profit on the Hollings-worth contract than would necessarily have been expected and more than it claims it would have made on the Reiner subcontract ($21.69 per unit). Production under the subcontract proceeded in a satisfactory manner. Brownell testified that Kurz &amp; Root\u2019s profit amounted to $23.87 per unit on the Hollingsworth contract. Kurz &amp; Root produced this generator for Hollingsworth almost entirely in its fiscal year 1958, while the Reiner subcontract would have been produced primarily in fiscal 1957. No evidence was offered to show whether any portion of the prior preliminary work on the Reiner generator was useful in the performance of the re-let contract to Hollingsworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">30. Kurz &amp; Root\u2019s claim for out-of-pocket expenses was based on estimates which primarily consisted of wages estimated in hours, for various employees and for Brownell, on work performed for Reiner. The claimed expenses were estimated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">Prototype, material, labor, and overhead---------------- $676</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">Engineering costs------------------------------------- 1,423</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">Estimating costs______________________________________ 283</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">Purchasing Department_______________________________ 348</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">Executive costs_______________________________________ 1,200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">Administration______________________________________ 388</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">Additional overhead at 50% of special costs____________ 1,821</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-14\">iSettlement fees and costs_____________________________ 3,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-15\">Total----------------------------------------- 9,639</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-16\">31. For the most part, claimed out-of-pocket expenses of Kurz &amp; Root lack supporting evidence. The evidence re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>veals that the drawings submitted to Reiner, consisting of about 10 or 12 drawings, actually were prepared fear previous contracts except for a top layout drawing which included the various components included in the other drawings submitted. These various component drawings were selected by Kurz &amp; Root from its files based on their suitability for the Reiner contract. The evidence supports a finding that Kurz &amp; Root improperly or erroneously included in this claim (1) settlement costs of $3,500, (2) the time spent with defendant\u2019s auditors in connection with this claim, and (3) executive salary at $15 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">32. Assuming that Kurz &amp; Root could not use any of the preliminary work performed for Reiner on the Hollings-worth or any other contract, the proof does not warrant a finding that out-of-pocket expenses of Kurz &amp; Root were more than $5,000. Defendant\u2019s computation resulted in an amount of $3,209. There is no adequate proof that Kurz &amp; Root could not or did not make use of this preliminary work for the Hollingsworth or some other contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">33. Kurz &amp; Root made its verbal agreement with Reiner on July 10, 1956. The suspension was made on August 3, 1956. The assumption that defendant was responsible for maintaining a volume of business for Kurz &amp; Root of $713,-400 in addition to what could be obtained elsewhere for portions of the following 2 fiscal years (December 1956 through November 1957), and the further assumption that no fixed overhead or general and administrative expenses would be applicable to this contract, are improper and unwarranted. Kurz &amp; Root was responsible for acquiring such other work as it could obtain to maintain its proper volume of business. If Reiner had an agreement with Kurz <em>&amp; </em>Root, it existed only for about 3% weeks prior to suspension.. Had Kurz &amp; Root not obtained the re-let contract from Hollingsworth the following year, it admittedly would have obtained other work to replace what was lost under the subcontract. Whatever volume of business was lost during fiscal 1957 was gained in fiscal 1958 when Kurz &amp; Root successfully obtained the subcontract for the 3,567 generators from Hol-lingsworth. Kurz &amp; Root\u2019s volume of business in fiscal 1957, the year in which most of this contract was to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>performed, was greater than in any of the previous 5 years, and also more than fiscal year 1958, when the re-let Hollings-worth contract was actually performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">34. Kurz &amp; Eoot obtained a subcontract under the re-let contract for the same generator sets as are involved in the suit here, and produced these units primarily in fiscal 1958 rather than in fiscal 1957 as was originally contemplated under the agreement with Eeiner. The proof does not show that Kurz &amp; Eoot was damaged to an appreciable extent by the suspension and cancellation of the Eeiner contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">conclusion op law</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Upon the foregoing findings of fact, which are made a part of the judgment herein, the court concludes as a matter of law that plaintiff is entitled to recover only $17,000 on its own claim, and it is therefore adjudged and ordered that plaintiff recover from the United States the sum of seventeen thousand dollars ($17,000), on its own claim. Otherwise the petition is dismissed, including the claim for the use of Kurz &amp; Eoot Company (Incorporated).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
