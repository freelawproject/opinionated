Comfort, </em>390 F.3d 1158 (10th Cir.2004), and deny the petition. <em>Berrunu-Garcia </em>criticizes the majority\u2019s holding that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 permits persons previously removed or deported, who illegally reenter the United States, to seek permission to reapply for admission from within the United States. <em>Betrurtu-Garcia </em>points out, and I agree, that the majority decision is inconsistent with the plain language of INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(ii), which requires \u201caliens who illegally reenter the country after having been removed or deported\u201d to \u201cfirst exit the United States and wait ten years before applying for an 1-212 waiver\u201d while still outside the country.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Berrum-Garcia, </em>390 F.3d at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">The majority offers two reasons for looking to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 instead of INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) in assessing whether Perez-Gonzalez\u2019s application for an 1-212 waiver was valid. The majority first asserts that it is necessary for us to regard 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 as controlling because this is the only way we can reconcile alleged conflicts between INA \u00a7 245(i) and INA \u00a7 212. <em>See </em>379 F.3d 783, 791 (9th Cir.2004)(\u201c[I]t is illogical to conclude that \u00a7 245(i) awarded illegal entrants the right to apply for adjustment of status, but then made it statutorily impossible for the Attorney General to grant it to them because they would never be considered admissible under the provisions of INA \u00a7 212.\u201d); 379 F.3d at 793-94, 795-96 (\u201cThe statutory provisions in \u00a7 241(a)(5), \u00a7 245(i), and \u00a7 212(a) should be read to harmonize with one another....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">I disagree because there is no necessary conflict between INA \u00a7 245(i) and \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C), which is the subsection of \u00a7 212 that specifically covers \u201cAliens previously removed,\u201d like Perez-Gonzalez, who have \u201ccrossed the border and are currently living in the country without lawful status.\u201d 379 F.3d at 794 n. 9. INA \u00a7 245(i) provides that an alien physically present in the United States after entering without inspection may apply for adjustment of status if: (1) the alien is the beneficiary of a petition or an application for labor certification filed on or before April 30, 2001; (2) the alien pays a $1,000 fee; (3) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa; (4) the alien <em>is \u201cadmissible, </em>\u201d <em>as defined by INA \u00a7 212; </em>and (5) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed. INA \u00a7 245(i)(l)-(2); 379 F.3d at 790-91. Section 212(a)(9)(C) in turn provides that aliens like Perez-Gonzalez, who illegally reenter the country after having been removed or deported are inadmissible, and therefore ineligible for \u00a7 245(i) adjustment of status, unless they apply for and receive an 1-212 waiver under \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(ii), which as noted above, they cannot do from within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-12\">A straightforward application of these two provisions, which can rationally be read together without conflict, leads to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>conclusion that Perez-Gonzalez cannot qualify for adjustment of status under the plain language of \u00a7 245(i) because he is inadmissible under \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C). That Perez-Gonzalez applied for an 1-212 waiver does not save him from \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)\u2019s bar to admissibility because he did not comply with \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(ii), which requires that such applications be filed from outside the United States before reentry. Where then, is the statutory conflict that prevents us from affirming the INS\u2019 determination that Perez-Gonzalez is ineligible for a \u00a7 245(i) adjustment because he is inadmissible under \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)? There is none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-3\">In my view, the conflict we must address is that between INA \u00a7 212 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2, when the regulation is given the unduly broad interpretation urged by the majority. It is well-settled that a \u201cregulation cannot be interpreted independently of the statute under which i[t] was promulgated,\u201d and that \u201c[wjhile regulations may impose additional or more specific requirements, they cannot eliminate statutory requirements.\u201d <em>Hunsaker v. Contra Costa County, </em>149 F.3d 1041, 1043 (9th Cir.1998). The majority errs by \u201cconsidering only the language of the regulations without acknowledging the requirements imposed by the relevant statutory language.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">When one considers that INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) states that aliens previously removed or deported must apply for waivers from inadmissibility prior to \u201creembarkation at a place outside the United States or attempt to be readmitted from a foreign contiguous territory,\u201d the incongruity of interpreting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 to permit such aliens to obtain a waiver under more lax procedures is apparent. The majority erroneously treats 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 as an independent authority for 1-212 waivers, separate from INA \u00a7 212 itself, <em>see </em>379 F.3d at 794 n. 10, when 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 is an agency regulation that implements INA \u00a7 21-2-. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">In <em>Berrum-Garcia, </em>the Tenth Circuit reconciled 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 with INA \u00a7 212 by asserting that the regulation was ambiguous because it \u201conly implies that <em>some </em>aliens illegally present in the United States may apply for an 1-212 waiver without leaving the country; it does not explicitly extend that privilege to aliens who have illegally reentered the country after a prior deportation or removal.\u201d 390 F.3d at 1167. Scrutinizing the language of INA \u00a7 212 and the legislative history and language of the LIFE Act, the Tenth Circuit resolved this ambiguity in favor of the government, concluding that only \u201c \u2018first-time\u2019 illegal aliens who are unlawfully in the United States without having been previously ordered removed or deported\u201d can apply for a waiver under the regulation, whereas aliens like Perez-Gonzalez \u201cwho have illegally reentered the country in defiance of a prior removal order\u201d cannot. <em>Id. </em>at 1167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">I conclude that the Tenth Circuit\u2019s narrowing construction of the regulation is reasonable, and prefer its moderate approach to the more drastic alternative of invalidating the regulation because it conflicts with the plain language of the statute it is meant to implement. <em>See Portland Audubon Soc\u2019y v. Endangered Species Comm., </em>984 F.2d 1534, 1543 n. 21 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cRegulations that are inconsistent with the provisions of the act they implement cannot stand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">The Tenth Circuit\u2019s approach is appropriate because the government never challenged 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2\u2019s validity, but rather argued that the majority had erred in interpreting the regulation too broadly. The government pointed out that the regulation predates IIRIRA and the enactment of INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C), and asserted that the majority\u2019s reading of the regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>extends 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 beyond the scope of INA \u00a7 212 as amended by IIRIRA. Given that no challenge was made, to the regulation\u2019s validity, a court should hesitate to strike it down in the face of the general principles that duly noticed agency regulations are presumed valid and that a heavy burden must be met by those who would overturn them. <em>See Boske v. Comin-gore, </em>177 U.S. 459, 470, 20 S.Ct. 701, 44 L.Ed. 846 (1900) (\u201cThose who insist that ... a regulation is invalid must make its invalidity so manifest that the court has no choice except to hold that the Secretary has exceeded his authority and employed means that are not at all appropriate to the end specified in the act of Congress.\u201d); <em>Ramirez v. INS, </em>550 F.2d 560, 563 (9th Cir.1977) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court places a heavy burden on those who would overturn an administrative regulation.\u201d); <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>491 F.2d 1163, 1167 (9th Cir.1973) (\u201cWhere a statute specifically delegates to an administrative agency the power to make rules [as 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103 does here], courts recognize a presumption that such rules, when duly noticed, are valid.\u201d). Instead, there is no judicial impediment to our proceeding down the path urged by the government and adopted by the Tenth Circuit, giving the regulation a narrowing construction that permits it to stand alongside the statute it implements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">The majority also suggests that its broad reading of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 is necessary to give weight to Congress\u2019 goal in enacting INA \u00a7 245(i) of allowing \u201cspouses, children, parents and siblings of permanent residents or U.S. citizens [to] be able to adjust their status in the \u00da.S. and avoid needless separation from their loved ones.\u201d 379 F.3d at 793 (alternation in original) (quoting Joint Memorandum, Statement of Senator Kennedy, 146 Cong. Rec. S11850-52 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 2000)). I agree that Congress enacted \u00a7 245(i) to help keep families together, a laudable goal that all can value. However, reading the regulation as it does, the majority disregards another of Congress\u2019 important immigration policies, which is to \u201cexpedite] the process of removing illegal aliens.\u201d <em>Berrum-Garcia, </em>390 F.3d at 1163; <em>see also </em>S.Rep. No. 104-249, at 2 (1996) (stating that the amendments are \u201cintended ... to increase control over immigration ... expediting the removal of excludable and deportable aliens\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 7 (\u201cAliens who violate U.S. immigration law should be removed from this country as soon as possible.\u201d); H.R.Rep. No. 104-469, at 13 (1996) (explaining that IIRIRA was designed to \u201cassure removal and prevent further reentry\u201d and that aliens who \u201cseek reentry ... are subject to immediate removal under the prior order\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 107-08 (noting that pre-IIRIRA procedures were \u201ccumbersome and duplicative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">In considering whether a regulation is permissible in light of the statute it implements, \u201cwe look not only at the precise statutory section in question, but analyze the provision in the context of the governing statute as a whole, presuming congressional intent to create a \u2018symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morales-Izquierdo v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 1299, 1303 (9th Cir.2004). Thus, in interpreting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2, we must be mindful not only of the congressional policy underlying INA \u00a7 245(i), but also of the policies underlying other sections of the INA, such as \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\"><em>Berrum-Garcia </em>approach enables us to read INA \u00a7 212 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2 in a way that reasonably accommodates both of Congress\u2019 policy goals, not just the family unity goal championed by the majority. INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C) provides that aliens previously removed or deported are inadmissible, thereby paving the way for the government expeditiously to remove them, but at the same time, \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) sets forth procedures permitting such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>aliens to apply for a discretionary waiver from inadmissibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">. INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) states that \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(i)'s life-time inadmissibility provision, which covers previously removed or deported aliens:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-9\">shall not apply to an alien seeking admission more than 10 years after the date of the alien's last departure from the United States if, prior to the alien\u2019s reembarkation at a place outside the United States or attempt to be readmitted from a foreign contiguous territory, the Attorney General has consented to the alien's reapplying for admission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AnA\">. Although the requirements in \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) are stringent, Congress designed them to be commensurate with the degree of the immigration offense committed by the aliens subject to inadmissibility under subsection (C), which covers the most serious grounds for inadmissibility in INA \u00a7 212(a)(9). In contrast, lesser offenders who fall within \u00a7 212(a)(9)(A) because they were deported immediately upon their arrival to the United States can apply for the same waiver under \u00a7 212 (a) (9) (A) (iii) without having to wait ten years, but even they have to apply for the waiver \"prior to [their] reembar-kation at a place outside the United States or attempt to be readmitted from a foreign contiguous territory.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
