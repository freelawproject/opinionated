Matthews argues that he stated a claim that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs because they misdiagnosed and mistreated his psoriasis. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-22\">A district court is required to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s complaint against an official if the complaint is frivolous, malicious, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1). We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim and accept as true the allegations in the complaint. <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of </em>Corr., 254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">To state a claim of deliberate indifference for medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment, an inmate must allege that officials have made an \u201comissionf ] sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to [the inmate\u2019s] serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). The inmate \u201cmust satisfy both an objective and a subjective inquiry.\u201d <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2003). Under the objective inquiry, the inmate must allege that he has been diagnosed with or obviously exhibits a serious medical condition that, if not treated, \u201cpos[es] a substantial risk of serious harm,\u201d and his treatment was so inadequate that it constituted \u201can unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting T<em>aylor v. Adams, </em>221 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Under the subjective inquiry, the inmate must allege that the prison official knew of the risk of harm and deliberately delayed or denied treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Even if we assume that psoriasis is a serious medical condition, Matthews\u2019s complaint that his condition was misdiagnosed as spider bites and mistreated with steroid creams does not state a claim of deliberate indifference. Matthews\u2019s allegations of misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment involve no more than medical negligence. <em>Farrow, </em>320 F.3d at 1245. Matthews alleges that his condition more recently has been correctly diagnosed by a dermatologist as psoriasis. Matthews also has received regular treatment for his psoriasis, which the exhibits to Matthews\u2019s complaint establish is an incurable and chronic condition. The district court did not err when it dismissed Matthew\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">The dismissal of Matthews\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
