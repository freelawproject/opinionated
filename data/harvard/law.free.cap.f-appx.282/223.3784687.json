In No. 07-2186, Crum petitions for a writ of mandamus, alleging the district court has unduly delayed acting on his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion seeking reconsideration of the order denying his consolidated 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) petitions. He requests an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court issued an order on February 29, 2008, denying Crum\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, although we grant Crum leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny as moot both the mandamus petition and Crum\u2019s motion to expedite.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In No. 08-6387, Crum appeals the district court\u2019s orders adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denying relief on the \u00a7 2241 petitions and denying Crum\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Crum v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>No. 5:04-cv00983, 2007 WL 781935 (S.D. W.Va. Mar. 13, 2007 &amp; Feb. 29, 2008). We deny as moot Crum\u2019s motions to expedite and for bail pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">No. 07-2186 <em>PETITION DENIED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">No. 08-6387 <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
