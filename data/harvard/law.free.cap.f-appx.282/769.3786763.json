All claims rely on Pace\u2019s contention that officer Ahler acted unreasonably when he used a police dog to apprehend Pace. Ahler released the dog after Pace fled from a stolen vehicle and hid from police in a mangrove swamp at night. The district court found officer Ahler\u2019s use of the police dog did not constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>and Ahler was therefore entitled to qualified immunity. Due to the lack of a constitutional violation, the district court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claims against officer Ahler and the City of Palmetto. In similar fashion, the district court concluded Ahler was entitled to statutory immunity against the state tort claim because Pace had not demonstrated Ahler acted maliciously or in bad faith. <em>See </em>\u00a7 768.28(9)(a), Fla. Stat. On appeal, Pace argues the district court\u2019s conclusions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">\u201cCourts should determine the \u2018objective reasonableness\u2019 of a seizure by balancing the \u2018nature and quality of the intrusion\u2019 against the \u2018governmental interest at stake.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mercado v. City of Orlando, </em>407 F.3d 1152, 1157 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)). We perform this balancing test by measuring \u201cthe severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">After reviewing the record <em>de novo, </em>and with the benefit of briefing and oral argument, we conclude the district court committed no reversible error. Viewing the facts of this case in the light most favorable to Pace, no constitutional violation occurred under <em>Graham </em>because officer Ahler\u2019s use of a police dog was not objectively unreasonable. The state tort claim similarly fails because officer Ahler did not act maliciously or in bad faith. Therefore, we affirm the judgments of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
