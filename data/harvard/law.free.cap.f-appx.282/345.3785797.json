Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Delgado argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the disciplinary proceeding, which resulted in a loss of 27 days of good time credits, is invalid because he is not required to take a breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Delgado\u2019s argument is conclusional, and he does not show that his disciplinary conviction has been invalidated \u201con direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such a determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Therefore, Delgado\u2019s disciplinary conviction is still outstanding, and his claims for monetary damages are barred by <em>Heck. See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Delgado\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as one strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Delgado is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
