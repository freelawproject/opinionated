Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, which requires that the decision be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Almendarez argues that the Government failed to meet its burden under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(a) to establish by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that she was deportable. However, the Respondent correctly observes that Almendarez had the burden of proof under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2). In addition, Almendarez had the burden under \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A) of specifically establishing that she was not inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Almendarez contends that the IJ should not have relied upon the statement she signed at the conclusion of a January 2005 interview with a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officer because the statement was inaccurate due to mistranslation during the interview and because the statement was not read to her in Spanish before she signed it. Almendarez also argues that the IJ mischaracterized her testimony as vague when in fact she demonstrated an understanding of the difference between a passport and a green card. However, the IJ credited the testimony of the USCIS officer regarding the January 2005 interview, and this testimony, together with the sworn statement, constituted substantial evidence that Almendarez used a false United States passport to enter the United States in 1999. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). In addition, substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s assessment of Almendarez\u2019s testimony. <em>See id. </em>In any case, the record does not compel \u201ca contrary conclusion,\u201d especially given the great deference we must give to the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Almendarez also contends that the IJ\u2019s ruling that she was statutorily inadmissible should be reversed because the IJ\u2019s reliance on \u201csticky notes\u201d in the record was improper. The record shows that Almendarez failed to raise her argument regarding the \u201csticky notes\u201d before the BIA. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review in part for lack of jurisdiction over this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Almendarez also contends that the IJ and BIA violated her due process rights in ordering her removed based on a sworn statement that was elicited without a qualified and accurate translator. Due process claims are not generally subject to \u00a7 1252(d)(1)\u2019s exhaustion requirement, but the jurisdictional bar does apply to claims of \u201cprocedural errors that are correctable by the BIA.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004). Although her claim is couched in due process terms, Almendarez complains of a procedural error correctable by the BIA. <em>See id. </em>at 137. The record shows that Almendarez did not raise her procedural due process claim before the BIA. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review in part for lack of jurisdiction over this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
