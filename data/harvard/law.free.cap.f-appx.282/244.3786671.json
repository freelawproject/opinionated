The jury also convicted Countess of conspiracy to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2008) (Count One). The district court sentenced both men to multiple life sentences and to other concurrent and consecutive terms in addition to those life sentences. Finding no reversible error in Appellants\u2019 convictions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">On appeal, Appellants raise a number of arguments challenging their respective convictions, including the following: (1) the district court erred in instructing the jury that a motor vehicle is a \u201cfacility in interstate ... commerce\u201d under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1958 when the Government put on evidence that the \u201cfacility\u201d element was satisfied by Appellants\u2019 use of a telephone; (2) the court violated <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), when it admitted, over Countess\u2019s objection, Thomas\u2019s post-arrest statement to a federal agent because the statement incriminated Countess; (3) the court erred in denying Thomas\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction because, <em>inter alia, </em>there was no verified complaint and because Thomas did not consent to or understand the jurisdiction of the court; (4) the court erred in removing Thomas from the courtroom during trial for alleged disruptive behavior; and (5) Countess\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated because, <em>inter alia, </em>the court refused to remove his appointed counsel when Countess made clear that he would not accept any counsel who swore allegiance to the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>We first consider Appellants\u2019 argument that the district court erred in instructing the jury that Appellants\u2019 use of a Jeep Cherokee motor vehicle could qualify as use of a \u201cfacility in interstate ... commerce\u201d under \u00a7 1958 when the Jeep never crossed state lines and the Government only presented evidence that Appellants had used telephones as part of their murder-for-hire scheme, not the Jeep. As an initial matter, and as a majority of our sister circuits have held, the phrase \u201cfacility in interstate ... commerce\u201d encompasses motor vehicles that are used either in an intrastate or interstate fashion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 313 (5th Cir.2001) (en banc) (holding that \u201c \u00a7 1958\u2019s use of a \u2018facility in interstate commerce\u2019 is synonymous with the use of an \u2018interstate commerce facility\u2019 and satisfies the jurisdictional element of the federal murder-for-hire statute, irrespective of whether the particular transaction in question is itself <em>inter </em>state or wholly <em>intra </em>state\u201d (emphasis in original)). And, in 2004, Congress amended \u00a7 1958, striking the phrase \u201cfacility in interstate ... commerce\u201d and replacing it with \u201cfacility of interstate ... commerce,\u201d to make pellucidly clear that the majority view is the correct interpretation of the statute. <em>See </em>Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Pub.L. No. 108-458, 118 Stat. 3638 (2004); <em>see also United States v. Perez, </em>414 F.3d 302, 305 n. 5 (2d Cir.2005) (stating that the December 2004 amendment \u201cclarif [ied] rather than expand [ed] the scope\u201d of \u00a7 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">With respect to Appellants\u2019 contention that the Government presented no evidence that they used the Jeep as part of their murderous plot, this contention is simply belied by the record. Indeed, the Government mentioned in its opening argument that the \u201cfacility in interstate ... commerce\u201d element of \u00a7 1958 could be satisfied by the use of either vehicles or telephones, and the Government went on to detail the significant role that the Jeep Cherokee played in the murder-for-hire scheme. Thus, the district court did not err in instructing the jury that the \u201cfacility in interstate ... commerce\u201d element of \u00a7 1958 could be satisfied by Appellants\u2019 use of the Jeep as part of them murder scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">With respect to Countess\u2019s claim that the district court erred under <em>Bruton </em>in admitting Thomas\u2019s post-arrest statement, \u201cI do know something about the murder, and I will only speak about myself,\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 21; Appellee\u2019s Br. at 26), this contention is wholly without merit. Even if Thomas\u2019s redacted statement implied the participation of at least one other person in the crime, it did not point in any way to Countess, and, on top of this fact, the district court gave a limiting instruction that the jury could only consider the statement as it related to Thomas\u2019s guilt. As such, no <em>Bruton </em>violation occurred. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999) (recognizing that \u201cstatements that ... do not even refer to the existence of the defendant are admissible and do not require severance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Finally, we have considered Appellants\u2019 other arguments and reviewed the briefs in this case, and we find no reversible error in Appellants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">For the aforesaid reasons, we affirm Appellants\u2019 convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
