On appeal, Petitioners argue that they established eligibility for withholding of removal <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because they were members of a particular social group, namely wealthy individuals who reported crime to the police, and suffered past persecution in that they were harassed and De Giacomo\u2019s vehicles were vandalized. For the reasons set forth below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-22\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision directly because it did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review a BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We can reverse a finding of fact by the BIA \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). We <em>review </em>the BIA\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1344 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">An alien is entitled to a withholding of removal if the Attorney General decides that the \u201calien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened ... because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). The \u201cparticular social group\u201d category refers to persons who share a \u201ccommon, immutable characteristic ... that is fundamental to its members\u2019 individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1193, 1196 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 977, 166 L.Ed.2d 709 (2007). In assessing whether the applicant belongs to a particular social group, we focus on (1) immutability, and (2) social visibility. <em>See id. </em>at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Here, the BIA correctly concluded that Petitioners failed to establish that they belonged to a particular social group, and substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that they failed to establish past persecution. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-18\">. In their appellate brief, Petitioners do not argue that the BIA erred in finding their asylum application was untimely or that the BIA erred in denying them protection under CAT, and they have thus abandoned those claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (noting that when a party fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
