These 66-month sentences are a downward variance from Orlando Puche\u2019s advisory guidelines range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment and Enrique and Mauricio Puche\u2019s advisory guidelines ranges of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. After review, we conclude that the district court based its variance on a legally erroneous factor, and thus we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">This appeal marks the third occasion that this case has been before us. We briefly review its procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">A. Conviction, Sentencing and First Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The Puches proceeded to trial on the single charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The trial evidence established that the Puches owned and operated a money transmittal company, Gloria Exchange Corporation (\u201cGEC\u201d), in Miami, Florida. <em>United States v. Puche, </em>350 F.3d 1137, 1141 (11th Cir.2003). The Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d), in connection with local police, conducted a sting operation targeting another money transmittal company, wherein an officer \u201cposed as a drug dealer responsible for collecting cash from various drug sales locations and forwarding money to overseas accounts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Through the owner of the other company, officers eventually met with employees of the Puches. <em>See id. </em>at 1141-42. Over the next few months, agents brought a total of $714,500 in small bills to the Puches\u2019 GEC, which was deposited into GEC\u2019s accounts and then transferred to accounts in Canada and England that were controlled by the DEA. <em>Id. </em>at 1142. The jury found the Puches guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">At a sentencing hearing in April 2002, the district court calculated guidelines ranges of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment for Orlando Puche and 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment for Enrique and Mauricio Puche. The district court sentenced Orlando Puche to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Enrique and Mauricio Puche to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment each, all of which were at the low end of their respective guidelines ranges. The Puches were imprisoned on July 27, 2001, when the jury found them guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">In November 2003, this Court affirmed the Puches\u2019 convictions but concluded that the district court erroneously failed to apply a three-level reduction to their offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57. Accordingly, this Court vacated the Puches\u2019 sentences and remanded to the district court \u201cfor the limited purpose of applying the three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2) and then resentencing within the resulting U.S.S.G. range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">B. Resentencing and Second Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">At a resentencing hearing in December 2004, the district court applied the three-level \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2) reduction and recalculated guidelines ranges of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment for Orlando Puche and 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment for Enrique and Mauricio Puche. The district court resenteneed Orlando Puche to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment and Enrique and Mauricio Puche to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, all of which were at the low end of their respective guideline ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-15\">In this second appeal, this Court concluded that \u201cthe district court committed statutory Booker<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> error by sentencing the Puches under a mandatory system,\u201d and that such error was not harmless because the record did not indicate how the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>court would have sentenced the Puches under an advisory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Puche, </em>155 Fed.Appx. 487, 490-93 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished). Accordingly, this Court again vacated the Puches\u2019 sentences and remanded \u201cfor the limited purpose of resentencing pursuant to <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>at 493. To that end, this Court\u2019s opinion instructed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">[T]he district court is required to sentence the Puches under an advisory Sentencing Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Sentencing Guidelines range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment for Orlando Puche, and the range of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment for Enrique and Mauricio Puche, and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 493-94 (quoting <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 125 S.Ct. at 757) (bracket omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">C. Briefing Before Resentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Prior to their second resentencing, the Puches filed sentencing memoranda arguing that several factors supported resentencing them below the guidelines range and that sentences of time served would further the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, the Puches cited these factors: (1) their money laundering operation was non-violent, (2) there were no third-party victims, (3) they had worked to better themselves while incarcerated, (4) they had a strong support system of family and friends, (5) they would not pose a threat to society if released, and (6) the amount-of-loss figure used to enhance their guidelines calculations violated their Sixth Amendment rights because it was not submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">The Puches later filed a supplemental memorandum that (1) cited several cases where defendants who laundered more money than they did received sentences below the Puches\u2019 guidelines ranges, and (2) cited a Department of Justice report stating that the average sentence for those convicted of money laundering offenses was 44 months\u2019 imprisonment and that approximately one-quarter of those convicted in 2001 of money laundering offenses received only probation. The Puches also submitted letters from friends and family that described them as good, hardworking men.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">The government\u2019s brief responded that sentences of time served would not be appropriate. Instead, the government recommended that sentences at the low end of the advisory guidelines range \u2014 i.e., 135 months\u2019 imprisonment for Orlando Puche and 108 months\u2019 imprisonment for Enrique and Mauricio Puche \u2014 were reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In response to the Puches\u2019 claim of <em>Booker </em>error in the amount-of-loss figure under an advisory regime, the government argued that (1) the loss amount was, in fact, determined by the jury when it found the forfeiture amount, and (2) <em>post-Booker, </em>judge-found facts may still be used to calculate the advisory guidelines range and need not be charged, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, or admitted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">D. Order Resentencing to Time Served</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">Upon receipt of the briefing and before the start of the resentencing hearing, the district court issued a written order on January 26, 2007 resentencing the Puches to time served (which was 66 months at that time).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district comb\u2019s order not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>ed that, pursuant to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s mandate, the district court was instructed \u201cto reconsider its sentence of the Defendants under an <em>advisory </em>Sentencing Guidelines regime, as opposed to the <em>mandatory </em>regime.\u201d The order also stated that at the Puches\u2019 original sentencing, it had expressed its \u201cdeep dissatisfaction\u201d with imposing a sentence within the guidelines range and its opinion that the guidelines \u201cin this instance are quite harsh.\u201d The district court\u2019s order again observed that post <em>-Booker </em>the guidelines are advisory and that the court, after considering the guidelines range, \u201cis permitted to tailor a sentence in light of other statutory concerns, such as relevant individual circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The district court\u2019s order listed the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. It then noted that this Court had held that post-sentence rehabilitative conduct was an impermissible factor to consider at sentencing, but recognized here \u201cother factors warranting a downward departure from the recommended Guidelines range.\u201d The district court found these factors warranted a lesser sentence: (1) there was no violence connected with the Puches\u2019 offense or any third-party victims; (2) the Puches\u2019 had \u201cstrong familial ties\u201d and \u201can otherwise impressive support system comprised of Mends and family\u201d; and (3) \u201cbecause the Defendants\u2019 amounts of loss were not submitted to the jury, the use of such amounts violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial on all issues.\u201d The district court pointed out that, in this case, the Puches\u2019 base offense levels were increased due to conduct found at sentencing that was not determined by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The district court stated that upon weighing the above relevant concerns, the defendants should be resentenced to time served, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\">Upon weighing all of the relevant concerns, the Court has concluded that without regard to the ultimate calculation of the sentencing guidelines, i.e., whether the Court accepts the government\u2019s proposed calculation or that of the defendant or some middle ground, the ultimate sentence that this Court would impose would be the same. Thus, under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B), the Court need not undertake the resolution of the disputed sentencing factors in the presentence report, because the ultimate sentence would be identical in any event, even under the calculations presently contained in the presentence report. To the extent that a calculation of the guidelines is required, the Court will proceed with the acceptance of the guideline range as determined by the probation officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">The Court concludes that, after considering the factors enumerated in Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the Defendants should be resentenced to a sentence that is no \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to comply with the comprehensive statutory factors. The Court will therefore impose a sentence of TIME SERVED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Accordingly, the district court ordered that the Puches\u2019 be released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">E. Resentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">At the start of the resentencing hearing on January 26, 2007, the district court indicated that the parties had already been provided with copies of its above-described resentencing order. The district court stated that because the court preferred \u201csubstance over form,\u201d it would be a \u201crelatively short\u201d resentencing hearing. The district court reiterated that it had commented on many occasions in the past about \u201cthe harshness of the punishment imposed\u201d and that those matters had been addressed in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>The district court then formally sentenced the Puches to time served and three years\u2019 supervised release, but noted that it would \u201cfavorably consider\u201d a motion to terminate the final year of supervised release if the Puches successfully completed the first two years. The sentences of time served (which was 66 months) were a downward variance from Orlando Puche\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment and from Enrique and Mauricio Puche\u2019s advisory guidelines ranges of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The district court inquired if the Puches objected to their sentences, and they said they did not. The district court did not make the same inquiry of the government before adjourning the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A7y6\">A. Sentencing <em>Post-Gall</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the district courts are still required to correctly calculate the advisory guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). If the district court decides that a sentence outside of the guidelines is warranted, it \u201c \u2018must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\"><em>Gall </em>emphasized that \u201cwhile the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range is surely relevant, courts of appeals must review all sentences \u2014 whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range \u2014 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1189 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 591).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">Under <em>Gall, </em>we must engage in a two-step process of sentencing review. <em>See id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">Second, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d taking into account the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597). In considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we may \u201c \u2018not apply a presumption of unreasonableness\u2019 \u201d where a sentence is outside of the Guidelines range, and we \u201c \u2018must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">A sentence may be substantive unreasonable \u201c \u201cwhen the district court selects the sentence arbitrarily, <em>bases the sentence on impermissible factors </em>[or] fails to consider pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1192 (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). If such an error exists, we will vacate the sentence and remand, unless the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006). A district court\u2019s consideration of an impermissible factor at sentencing is harmless if the record as a whole shows the error did not substantially affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>imposed. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">We now apply the two-step appellate review process outlined in <em>Gall </em>to the Puches\u2019 sentences of time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">B. The Puches\u2019 Time-Served Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">As to the first prong of the analysis outlined by <em>Gall, </em>we conclude that the district court did not commit procedural error in sentencing the Puches. By adopting the advisory guidelines ranges calculated in the presentence investigation report, which were the same guidelines ranges that this Court instructed the district court to consider on remand, the district court properly calculated the advisory guidelines range. The district court stated that it had considered the advisory guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, along with the pleadings filed by the parties, in its sentencing decision. The district court then listed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, even though it was not required to do so. Finally, the district court explained its reasons as to why a sentence of time served was sufficient, but not greater than necessary to satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In light of the above, we conclude that there was no procedural error in the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">As to the second prong of the analysis outlined in <em>Gall, </em>however, we conclude that the Puches\u2019 sentences are substantively unreasonable because the district court based its <em>Booker </em>variance on a legally erroneous factor. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1192. The district court accepted the guidelines calculations by the probation officer. However, in outlining the factors supporting the <em>Booker </em>variance to a time-served sentence, the district court stated that the guidelines enhancement of the Puches\u2019 base offense levels based on the amount of loss violated their Sixth Amendment rights because the loss figure was not submitted to the jury. This statement was incorrect because \u201c \u2018the use of extra-verdict enhancements in an advisory guidelines system is not unconstitutional.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2005)). In other words, enhancement of the Puches\u2019 sentences based <em>on </em>a loss figure that was not submitted to the jury did not violate the Puches\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Booker </em>because the district court was now resentencing the Puches\u2019 under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 1324 (stating that a sentencing court could make fact findings beyond those charged in the indictment \u201cbecause it applied the guidelines in an advisory way\u201d and that \u201c[njothing in <em>Booker </em>is to the contrary\u201d); <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1300 (stating, in reviewing a pre<em>Booker </em>sentence, that \u201cif the same extra-verdict enhancements had been found and used in the same way in a non-mandatory guidelines system the result would have been constitutionally permissible\u201d). Thus, the district court based the extent of its sentence variance on a legally incorrect factor, i.e., a supposed Sixth Amendment violation that did not exist.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Further, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s consideration of this alleged Sixth Amendment error in its <em>Booker </em>variance sentences was harmless. The district court\u2019s sentencing order does not indicate that it gave the alleged Sixth Amendment error any less weight than the other factors listed as a basis for its <em>Booker </em>variance. While the district court\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>ments expressing \u201cdeep dissatisfaction\u201d with the guidelines range and its opinion that a guidelines sentence was \u201cquite harsh\u201d strongly suggest that it would make some downward variance from the advisory guidelines range, it is not clear that the district court would have varied downward to the same extent if not for its misconception regarding the Sixth Amendment violation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, because the record as a whole does not show that the misconception about the alleged Sixth Amendment violation did not substantially affect the district court\u2019s decision to impose <em>Booker </em>variance sentences of time served, we vacate the Puches\u2019 sentences and remand to the district court for the limited purpose of resentencing the Puches without consideration of this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">SENTENCES VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-9\">. The Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), after this Court's opinion in the Puches\u2019 first appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-9\">. Although Orlando, Mauricio, and Enrique Puche filed separate sentencing memoranda, their arguments were essentially identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A-4B\">. The government makes no claim of procedural error as to the order being entered before the resentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">. We reject the Puches' argument that the government waived its objections to their sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\">. We recognize that the district court stated that it would impose the same sentences regardless of the guidelines range. However, the district court\u2019s order suggests that it would do so, in part, because of its conclusion that there was a Sixth Amendment violation in the amount-of-loss figure.</p>\n<p id=\"AfLP\">Nothing herein suggests any opinion regarding the ultimate sentences imposed in this case. We say only that the district court considered a legally incorrect factor in imposing the sentences here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b825-6\">BARKETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AzA\">Dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Based on this record, I would affirm the sentencing order imposed by the district court. Although the structure of the sentencing order creates some ambiguity, it does not clearly indicate that the district court partially based the variance on the legally erroneous ground. Therefore, I see no reason to question the district court\u2019s statement that it would impose the same sentence in the case. <em>See United, States v. Dean, </em>517 F.3d 1224, 1232 (11th Cir.2008) (reiterating that we will uphold the sentence imposed by the district court where the sentence is reasonable and the district court states that it would impose the same sentence irrespective of any sentencing calculation errors).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
