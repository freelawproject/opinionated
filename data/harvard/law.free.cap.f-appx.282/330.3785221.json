On appeal, Reyes challenges the district court\u2019s characterization of his prior Texas conviction of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle as an aggravated felony. Reyes concedes that this issue is foreclosed, but he nevertheless seeks to preserve it for Supreme Court review in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). As Reyes concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Brieva-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 356 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Galvan-Rodriguez, </em>169 F.3d 217 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Reyes\u2019s motion for summary disposition is GRANTED and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
