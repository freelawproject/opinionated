(\u201cMEI\u201d), Curtis Jones, and Annie Jones. Markel argues that the district court erred by refusing to enforce an exclusion in its commercial umbrella liability insurance policy providing excess coverage to MEI. Markel says that it has no duty to indemnify MEI for amounts paid to settle lawsuits arising from injuries to MEI\u2019s employees in the workplace because the policy unambiguously excludes coverage for MEI employees who were injured by other employees during the course of their employment. Alternatively, Markel says that a material issue of fact exists, requiring the case to go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">We agree with the district court that the exclusion is ambiguous because it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, one providing coverage and another limiting coverage. <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>756 So.2d 29, 34 (Fla.2000). As a result of the ambiguity, the exclusion must be interpreted \u201cliberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the drafter who prepared the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the district court held, the most logical reading of the exclusion requires \u201ca direct or immediate injury\u201d by a fellow employee, which does not fit the factual circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s Order Granting Summary Judgment On Liability, dated September 6, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
