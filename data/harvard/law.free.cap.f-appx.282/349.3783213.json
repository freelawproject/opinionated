Lander-man, </em>167 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Because the presentence report, which was adopted by the district court, stated that Erwin had a net worth of $70,000 and because Erwin has not shown that he will be unemployable at the time of his release from prison, he has not shown that the encumbrance of his assets to pay the fine will be unduly burdensome on his spouse or that the imposition of the f\u00edne was plainly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Magnuson, </em>307 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Matovsky, </em>935 F.2d 719, 723 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
