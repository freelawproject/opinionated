The MOA, which addresses representational and union organizing issues affecting employee rights at the Grand Casino-Gulfport, contains an arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>clause providing in part that \u201c[t]he parties agree that any disputes over the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be submitted to expedited and binding arbitration.\u201d The Unions ask us to reverse the district court\u2019s denial of their alternative motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss or stay Gulfside\u2019s declaratory-judgment action. We decline this request and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">First, the Unions contend that the district court erred when it ruled that it, not the arbitrator, had to determine whether Grand Casino-Gulfport\u2019s rights and obligations under the MOA were assigned to Gulfside. Second, the Unions insist that, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the district court was the proper arbiter, it erred in ruling that Grand Casino-Gulfport\u2019s rights and obligations under the MOA were not assigned to Gulfside, especially because it did not require Gulfside to introduce evidence supporting the allegations in its complaint before ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Having reviewed the record on appeal, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable law, we are convinced that the district court properly denied the Unions\u2019 motion. When a party challenges the very existence of an agreement, as opposed to its continued validity or enforcement, the court, not the arbitrator, must first resolve the dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even though Grand CasinoGulfport entered into the MOA with the Unions, and later entered into a side agreement with Gulfside in which it purported to assign its rights and obligations under the MOA, Gulfside \u2014 which was not a signatory to the MOA \u2014 insists that Grand Casino-Gulfport\u2019s rights and obligations were not properly assigned to it. In other words, Gulfside contends that it is <em>not </em>a party to the MOA, and therefore challenges the very existence of the agreement <em>with respect to itself. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly ruled that it, not the arbitrator, had to resolve the question whether Grand Casino-Gulfport\u2019s rights and obligations under the MOA were assigned to Gulfside.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">Furthermore, we hold that the district court properly ruled that Grand Casino-Gulfport\u2019s rights and obligations were <em>not </em>assigned to Gulfside. The MOA, by its own terms, applied only to active casino and associated landside operations. Following Hurricane Katrina, Grand CasinoGulfport was forced to cease all riverboat casino and associated landside operations and to terminate all employees. It follows that there were no rights or obligations remaining under the MOA that could be assigned to Gulfside when it entered into the side agreement with Grand CasinoGulfport.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Unions\u2019 contention to the contrary is rejected. Moreover, because of the Unions\u2019 prior insistence that the district court rule expeditiously on their motion, their contention that the court decided the issue prematurely is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">The district court\u2019s ruling denying the Unions\u2019 alternative motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss or stay Gulfside\u2019s declaratory-judgment action is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
