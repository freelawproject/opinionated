He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on a finding that his Texas conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d Rodriguez correctly concedes that his Guidelines argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 717 (5th Cir.2007), and he raises it solely to preserve its further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Rodriguez also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
