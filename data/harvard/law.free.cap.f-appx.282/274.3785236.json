Schoolfield was convicted of various crack cocaine of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>fenses. On appeal, Schoolfield challenges the sufficiency of Alfonso Harmon\u2019s identification evidence at trial. Harmon testified that he purchased drugs from School-field in controlled buys on three occasions. Harmon spoke with Schoolfield on the phone to arrange the purchases, and Schoolfield then sent others to deliver the drugs and take Harmon\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Schoolfield argues first that Harmon\u2019s voice identification failed to meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(5). However, all that is required under the Rule is that the witness have \u201cminimal familiarity\u201d with the speaker\u2019s voice; once minimal familiarity is satisfied, it is for the jury to assess any issues regarding the extent of the witness\u2019s familiarity with the voice. <em>See United States v. Bush, </em>405 F.3d 909, 919 (10th Cir.2005). Here, Harmon testified that he had known Schoolfield for several years, through family members and from seeing him around the neighborhood, and had spoken personally with him on at least three or four occasions. This evidence laid the proper foundation for Harmon\u2019s familiarity with Schoolfield\u2019s voice, and the admission of his identification testimony was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Schoolfield next argues that, because the only evidence against him was Harmon\u2019s identification, the evidence was sufficiency of the evidence, we do not \u201cweigh the evidence or review the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.1997). We will uphold a jury\u2019s verdict if there is substantial evidence to support it, and will reverse only in those rare cases \u201cwhere the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Here, Harmon identified Schoolfield as the person who brokered the drug sales. In addition, circumstantial evidence corroborated Harmon\u2019s testimony. The people who conducted the actual drug sales were all individuals with whom Schoolfield was closely associated, including his own mother. Further, phone records were admitted at trial showing that one of the cell phones used to broker and make the transactions was subscribed in a third party\u2019s name at an address where Schoolfield\u2019s grandmother and aunt lived and where Schoolfield had been observed on numerous occasions. We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support School-field\u2019s convictions. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1190 (4th Cir.1997) (holding that uncorroborated testimony of one witness may be sufficient to sustain a conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Schoolfield\u2019s convictions. We deny Schoolfield\u2019s attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
