After they were served notices to appear for remaining in the United States longer than permitted, Cubillos, with Isaza as a derivative applicant, filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal and sought relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Immigration Judge denied relief and the BIA dismissed the petitioners\u2019 appeal. Cubillos and Isaza did not file a petition for review with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Instead, they filed a motion to reopen with the BIA. That motion was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and contended that their attorney, Darnell T. Flowers, had not adequately represented them on appeal to the BIA. The BIA denied the motion to reopen. It initially determined that they had failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 687 (BIA 1988). Furthermore, the BIA concluded that the petitioners had failed to establish that they suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance. Cubillos and Isaza petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">As an initial matter, we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to review the petition insofar as it attacks both the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination against Cubillos and the underlying decisions denying the petitioners\u2019 application for asylum and withholding of removal. A petitioner has only thirty days from the date of the final order of removal within which to file a petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). This limitation period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Dakane, </em>899 F.3d at 1272 n. 3 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The final order of removal in this case was entered on May 10, 2007. Cubillos and Isaza did not file a petition for review until nearly five months later in October 2007. This Court cannot, therefore, review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination or the denial of the petitioners\u2019 application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>(refusing to consider the merits of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal based on a lack of jurisdiction because it took the alien over four months to file a petition for review).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">We also lack jurisdiction to review the petitioners\u2019 claims, which they raise for the first time in this Court, that they were prejudiced by Flowers\u2019 ineffective assistance during the course of their removal hearing. The petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was based exclusively on the alleged inadequacies of Flowers\u2019 representation before the BIA on appeal. Because the petitioners\u2019 motion failed to challenge the effectiveness of Flowers\u2019 representation during the course of the removal hearing, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider those claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right----\u201d); <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001) (finding that the Court lacked jurisdiction to consider an issue that the petitioner failed to raise before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">With respect to the petition insofar as it challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen, we review only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1145 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cIn this particular area, the BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad,\u201d <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>1276 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam), and our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious,\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">\u201c[A]n alien in civil deportation proceedings, while not entitled to a Sixth Amendment right to counsel, has the constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause right to a fundamentally fair hearing to <em>effective </em>assistance of counsel where counsel has been obtained.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2005). A motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">(1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel\u2019s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1274 (quoting <em>Lozada, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. at 639).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">In addition to establishing \u201csubstantial, if not exact, compliance with the procedural requirements of <em>Lozada, </em>a petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel ... must also show prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cPrejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\"><em>We </em>conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen. Although Cubillos and Isaza contend that they satisfied all three of the <em>Lozada </em>requirements, they failed to comply with at least the second prong.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In arguing that they complied with this requirement, Cubillos and Isaza contend that the BIA applied the wrong legal standard when it concluded that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that the respondents specifically informed Mr. Flowers of the instant motion and gave him an opportunity to respond in a timely manner.\u201d The petitioners' contend that <em>Lozada </em>does not require, as the BIA suggested, that the attorney be informed that a motion to reopen has been filed but instead requires only that the attorney be informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Even if the petitioners\u2019 interpretation of <em>Lozada </em>is correct, Cubillos\u2019 affidavit does not establish that Flowers was \u201cinformed of the allegations leveled against him\u201d or \u201cgiven an opportunity to respond.\u201d <em>Dak</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number><em>ane, </em>399 F.3d at 1274 (quoting <em>Lozada, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. at 639). Cubillos\u2019 affidavit attested only that: (1) Flowers told her he was going to transfer the case to Nashville, Tennessee, which never happened; (2) while Flowers was preparing the appeal, Cubillos was unable to contact him and he stopped returning her calls; (3) Flowers eventually scheduled an appointment to meet with Cubillos on May 17, 2007 but cancelled the day before the meeting; (4) Flowers informed Cubillos that he could no longer represent her; (5) Flowers told Cubillos that he would send her file back to her, which he never did; and (6) Flowers failed to file a brief in Cubillos\u2019 appeal. Those allegations do not establish that Cubillos ever informed Flowers of her ineffective assistance claims or gave him an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Because the petitioners did not satisfy the second <em>Lozada </em>requirement, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying their motion to reopen. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition insofar as it challenges the denial of the motion to reopen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">. Cubillos and Isaza also contend that the BIA erred by determining that they had not satisfied the third prong of <em>Lozada. </em>In support of their motion to reopen, Cubillos submitted an affidavit, which alleged that she had filed a complaint against Flowers with the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility. Although the affidavit stated that a copy of the bar complaint was attached to the motion to reopen, the record does not reflect that such a complaint was ever attached. In denying the motion to reopen, the BIA noted that the petitioners had failed to produce \"any evidence to substantiate their assertion\u201d of having filed a bar complaint. This Court has never decided whether a mere statement in an affidavit that a bar complaint has been filed, without any supporting evidence, constitutes compliance with the third <em>Lozada </em>requirement. We need not decide that issue in this case because the petitioners failed to satisfy the second requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\">. The petitioners also argue that they were entitled to a rebuttable presumption of prejudice because Flowers failed to file an appellate brief with the BIA. Because a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel must both comply with the <em>Lozada </em>procedural requirements and establish prejudice, <em>see Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1274, we need not decide whether the BIA abused its discretion by determining that the petitioners had not shown prejudice as a result of their former attorney's conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
