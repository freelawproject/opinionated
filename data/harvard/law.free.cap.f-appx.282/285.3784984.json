Jonathan and Laura Oiler were sentenced to 205 months\u2019 and 168 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">On appeal, Laura Oiler contends the district court erred in calculating her attributable drug weight. Additionally, both Jonathan and Laura Oiler contend that the district court erred in refusing to apply downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility. When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Laura Oiler contends the drug weight attributed to Jonathan Oiler should not have likewise been imputed to her. She argues these drugs were purchased outside the scope of the conspiracy from an individual with whom she did not have contact. However, the factual basis ascertained at Laura Oiler\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing established that she took part in the Oiler family\u2019s conspiracy to sell cocaine base. The Presentence Investigation Report indicated that Laura Oiler obtained drugs on a regular basis from Jonathan Oiler for distribution. It further indicated that Laura Oiler was familiar with Jonathan Oiler\u2019s supplier. Moreover, there is nothing in Jonathan Oiler\u2019s statement to indicate that the drugs were purchased for any use other than to promote the object of the conspiracy. The drugs obtained by Jonathan Oiler were therefore not only reasonably foreseeable to Laura Oiler, but also served to further their jointly undertaken criminal activity. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.3 (a)(1)(B) (2006). Consequently, we conclude the district court did not clearly err in its calculation of the total drug weight attributable to Laura Oiler.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Both Jonathan and Laura Oiler contend that the district court erred by refusing to apply downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility. Section 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a downward adjustment to the offense level if a defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility. Because a defendant who pleads guilty is not entitled to a downward adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1 as a matter of right, the Guidelines provide a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered in determining whether the adjustment should be applied, including whether a defendant has voluntarily terminated or withdrawn from criminal conduct. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.l(b)), (n.3) (2006). \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility,\u201d therefore his determinations are \u201centitled to great deference on review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">It is undisputed that both Jonathan and Laura Oiler continued to use cocaine subsequent to indictment. Jonathan Oiler additionally stole money from the Government while working as a confidential source. Based on the Oilers\u2019 failure to disengage themselves from criminal conduct, the district court determined that their behavior was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility and refused to apply downward adjustments. Under these circumstances, we conclude the district court\u2019s determinations were not in error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kidd, </em>12 F.3d 30, 34 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We therefore affirm the judgments of the district court. We deny the motion for leave to file a supplemental brief.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> The Oilers move this court for leave to file a supplemental brief to include argument addressing Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines. As we have previously noted, it is for the district court to first assess pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2000) whether and to what extent defendants may be affected by Amendment 706. <em>See United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367, 373 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
