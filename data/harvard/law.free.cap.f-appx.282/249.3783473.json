The Government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2007), alleging that the conspiracy involved in excess of 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, in excess of five kilograms of cocaine, and in excess of one kilogram of cocaine. Mackins was found guilty by a jury and the district court sentenced him to life imprisonment on the drug conspiracy offense and 240 months on the money laundering conspiracy offense. Although Mackins objected to the presentence report calculation of drug quantity, he did not object to the failure of the jury to find drug quantity. However, Willie argued at sentencing that the district court\u2019s attribution of drug quantity violated his constitutional rights based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), predecessor case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">Mackins appealed and challenged his sentence under <em>Apprendi </em>arguing that the district court erred in using specific drug quantities to determine his sentence when no such quantities were charged in the indictment or found by the jury, and without a finding of a specific drug quantity Mackins could only be subject to a statutory maximum sentence of twenty-years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court sentenced him to life imprisonment based on its attribution of drug quantity. This court found that the district court plainly erred in enhancing Mackins\u2019 sentence above the statutory maximum based on the findings of the jury. However, we declined to notice the error, concluding it did not \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d to warrant notice because the record revealed \u201cthat the conspiracy charged here indisputably involved quantities of cocaine and cocaine base far in excess of the minimum amounts necessary to sustain the sentence! ] pursuant to 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).\u201d <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 408 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">Mackins filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion asserting several claims, including that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance when he failed to object to the district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity that enhanced his sentence beyond the statutory maximum applicable for the quantity of drugs cited in the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ment. He also argued that his counsel was ineffective by failing to interview witnesses that would have provided exculpatory evidence regarding whether Government witnesses were improperly coached and testified falsely against him. On January 4, 2006, the district court dismissed all of Maekins\u2019 claims, with the exception of whether counsel\u2019s representation was constitutionally ineffective based on his failure to object to the district court\u2019s finding on drug quantity based on <em>Apprendi </em>predecessor law and, if so, whether <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applied to Maekins\u2019 sentence. The disti\u2019ict court held an evidentiary hearing on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The district court determined that counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel because he was not aware that Willie\u2019s counsel raised <em>Apprendi </em>precursor arguments. However, the district court held that Maekins was still entitled to relief under <em>Apprendi </em>because the court was \u201cunable to divine any difference between the Petitioner\u2019s case and that of <em>[United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005) ].\u201d The district court rejected the Government\u2019s contention that this court\u2019s decision on the <em>Apprendi </em>error was the law of the case and instead found that the <em>Hughes </em>case conflicted with the court\u2019s prior opinion and therefore merited extraordinary relief due to a \u201ccomplete miscarriage of justice.\u201d The district court also held that even if Maekins was not entitled to relief on the ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing claim, he would still be entitled to relief because his sentence resulted in a substantive Sixth Amendment violation and also was \u201cthe result of a non-constitutional error which involves \u2018a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice\u2019 or is \u2018inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\u2019 \u201d The district court vacated Maekins\u2019 life sentence and entered an amended judgment reducing Maekins\u2019 sentence to 360 months. The Government filed a timely appeal of the amended judgment. Mac-kins filed a timely appeal of the order dismissing the remaining \u00a7 2255 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Maekins appeals from the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 claim that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to interview witnesses who could impeach the credibility of government witnesses. An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Maekins has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Maekins\u2019 appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying in part \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The district court determined that although Maekins did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <em>Apprendi </em>error violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial on drug quantity. It fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ther held that Mackins would also be entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255 because, although the error was non-constitutional and non-jurisdictional, it constituted a fundamental defect which resulted in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Government contends on appeal that the district court erred because this court\u2019s opinion on direct appeal constitutes the law of the case on the <em>Apprendi </em>error and no exception applies to disturb this court\u2019s previous holding, Mackins is procedurally defaulted from raising a Sixth Amendment claim, and Mackins is not entitled to relief based on a non-constitutional claim analysis as utilized by the district court because the claim is constitutional in nature and even if the non-constitutional analysis did apply, because this court found no plain error requiring notice, a complete miscarriage of justice did not result.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The district court applied the law of the case doctrine in analyzing the <em>Apprendi </em>claim. Generally, \u201c \u2018the doctrine [of the law of the case] posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 815-16, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988)). The law of the case must be applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201cin all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal ... unless: (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to the issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sejman v. Warner-Lambert Co., </em>845 F.2d 66, 69 (4th Cir.1988)); <em>see Invention Submission Corp. v. Dudas, </em>413 F.3d 411, 414-15 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing \u201cmandate rule,\u201d which \u201cis a more powerful version of the law of the case doctrine and is based on the principle that an inferior tribunal is bound to honor the mandate of a superior court within a single judicial system,\u201d and exceptions to rule) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1090, 126 S.Ct. 1024, 163 L.Ed.2d 854 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Here, the district court relied on the second and third exceptions to the law of the case doctrine. We believe that the <em>Apprendi </em>claim would be best addressed by our precedent dealing with \u00a7 2255 instead of the law of the case doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Boeckenhaupt v. United States, </em>537 F.2d 1182, 1183 (4th Cir.1976) (defendant cannot relitigate issues previously rejected on direct appeal); <em>United States v. Roane, </em>378 F.3d 382, 396 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the Defendants have not pointed to any change in the law that warrants our reconsideration of these, claims, we agree with the district court that they cannot relitigate these issues.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The district court\u2019s rationale for granting relief and reducing Mackins\u2019 sentence relies entirely on its determination that <em>Hughes </em>dictates an application of law directly in conflict with our prior decision in Mackins\u2019 direct appeal. The district court held that our previous decision was clearly erroneous, in light of <em>Hughes, </em>therefore requiring a different result on collateral review. In so holding, the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">In <em>Hughes, </em>we held that the defendant demonstrated that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under the then mandatory Sentencing Guidelines based on facts not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the error affected his substantial rights. We noticed the error because the sentence imposed was four times higher than that which would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>been proper based only on the quantity found by the jury and there was no indication as to how the district court would have sentenced the defendant under an advisory Guidelines scheme. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 555-56. In <em>Hughes, </em>we remanded for resentencing, without addressing the evidence supporting the enhancement or whether that evidence was overwhelming or uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">A year later in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>441 F.3d 254, 272-73 (4th Cir.2006), we held that overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence supporting an enhancement negates noticing plain <em>Booker </em>error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reasoned that although the Sixth Amendment requires that the jury, rather than the judge, find drug quantity since the evidence of drug quantity was overwhelming and uncontroverted, upon finding the defendant guilty of the offenses, unquestionably the jury also found that the offenses involved the quantity charged in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 272-73. In <em>Smith, </em>we specifically cited <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 632-34, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), in which the Supreme Court held that when the evidence of a sentencing factor is overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted, there is no basis for noticing plain <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The district court relied upon the dissent in <em>Smith </em>in reaching its decision that <em>Hughes </em>changed our plain error analysis. It did not discuss the majority holding in <em>Smith </em>\u2014 a holding that directly conflicted with its contention that, had we decided Mackins\u2019 direct appeal applying the <em>Hughes </em>plain error review standard, we would have noticed the error. In sum, because the district court erred in finding that <em>Hughes </em>changed this circuit\u2019s plain error analysis, Mackins cannot demonstrate a change in the law warranting our reconsideration of the issue. <em>See Roane, </em>378 F.3d at 396 n. 7. We therefore vacate the amended criminal judgment and remand for the district court to reimpose the original life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">No. 06-4955 <em>DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">No. 06-7581 <em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\">. The statutory maximum without regard to drug quantity was twenty years.
