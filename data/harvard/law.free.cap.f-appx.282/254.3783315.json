He failed to appear at his original sentencing hearing and was arrested approximately seven weeks later in Ohio. At his rescheduled sentencing hearing, the district court gave Lewis a two-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice for his failure to appear under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3C1.1 (2007), comment. (n.4(e)) and, for the same reason, declined to credit him with acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.4). On appeal, Lewis argues that the district court erred by declining to give him credit for acceptance of responsibility given his decision to plead guilty. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">It is the defendant\u2019s burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his offense, <em>United States v. Harris, </em>882 F.2d 902, 906-07 (4th Cir.1989), and the district court\u2019s determination of the matter is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Kise, </em>369 F.3d 766, 771 (4th Cir.2004). A defendant who receives an adjustment for obstruction of justice generally may not receive an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, absent extraordinary circumstances not present in the instant appeal. USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4); <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>272 F.3d 260, 263-64 (4th Cir.2001). We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s decision to deny Lewis credit for acceptance of responsibility. <em>Id. </em>at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
