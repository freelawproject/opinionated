The district court sua sponte dismissed Adi\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, finding that Adi\u2019s claims necessarily implicated the validity of his confinement and were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). A dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed de novo. <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-20\">Although Adi attempts to couch his challenge to his confinement in terms of unconstitutional state administrative action, such a challenge is \u201cjust as close to the core of habeas corpus as an attack on the prisoner\u2019s conviction, for it goes directly to the constitutionality of his physical confinement itself and seeks either immediate release from that confinement or the shortening of its duration.\u201d <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 489, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Because Adi\u2019s claims clearly implicate the duration and fact of his confinement, as opposed to the procedures affecting his confinement, and because he has not alleged that his conviction or sentence has been reversed or expunged, his claims are barred by <em>Heck. See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Cook v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice Transitional Planning Dep\u2019t, </em>37 F.3d 166, 168 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-21\">Adi has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim. Adi\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see also Hamilton v. Lyons, </em>74 F.3d 99, 102 (5th Cir.1996)(stating that a \u00a7 1983 claim which falls under the rule in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>Heck </em>is legally frivolous). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Adi is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Adi that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Adi should review any pending appeals and withdraw any that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
