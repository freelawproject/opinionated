Harksen appeals the district court\u2019s orders dismissing without prejudice his action filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), and denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>motion. Harksen asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was denied free or gift publications in violation of the First Amendment. The district court held that the prison regulation banning receipt of free or gift publications was constitutional. However, the case on which the district court relied to reach that conclusion was reversed on appeal. <em>See Zimmerman v. Simmons, </em>260 F.Supp.2d 1077 (D.Kan.2003) (applying four-part test in <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), and concluding that regulation banning receipt of gift publications was constitutional), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. Jacklovich v. Simmons, </em>392 F.3d 420, 428-32 (10th Cir.2004) (finding genuine issues of material fact existed regarding behavior management and security rationales proffered by defendants in support of policy denying access to publications and to remaining <em>Turner </em>factors); <em>see also Prison Legal News v. Lehman, </em>397 F.3d 692, 698-701 (9th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Turner </em>and holding that ban on nonsubscription bulk mail and catalogs requested by inmate was unconstitutional). Although we express no view on the merits, we conclude that it is appropriate to vacate the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of Harksen\u2019s First Amendment claims regarding receipt of free or gift publications. On remand the district court should consider the state\u2019s justification for its regulation and resolve any factual issues relevant to the merits of Harksen\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">With regard to Harksen\u2019s remaining claims, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm those claims for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Harksen v. Braxton, </em>No. 7:04-cv-00243 (W.D.Va. Nov. 9, 2004; Dec. 10, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
