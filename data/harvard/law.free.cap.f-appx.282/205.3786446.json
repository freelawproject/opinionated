Cupples commenced this action, alleging that AmSan\u2019s investigation of the harassment complaints was pretextual and that AmSan discharged him based on his age. He was 62 years old. The district court granted AmSan\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b230-18\">Cupples began working in 1974 as a salesman for a predecessor of AmSan, which distributes janitorial and sanitary products, and he ultimately became the sales manager at its Huntersville, North Carolina location.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>In July 2004, AmSan employee Grace Foure complained to Jim Core, the general manager of AmSan\u2019s Huntersville location, that Cupples had sexually harassed her. Specifically, she claimed that Cupples had pinched her rear and had said, \u201cI just had to do that,\u201d and that these acts made her feel uncomfortable. When asked about the incident, Cupples admitted that he had touched Foure but claimed he only accidentally brushed against her with his briefcase and that he said, \u201cSorry, I shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Foure also told Core about an earlier situation in which she had complained to Cupples that other male employees were making inappropriate comments about her breasts. Cupples explained that he responded to Foure by speaking to one of the offending employees and telling him to refrain from such behavior in the future, but the employee had no memory of this discipline, and his file contained no record of it. Cupples admitted that he counseled Foure in that incident, saying that when \u201ca bunch of guys ... see a nice-looking woman they\u2019re going to have crazy thoughts,\u201d so even though \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t say anything to [her] about that,\u201d she should \u201ckeep [herself] from being in those positions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In response to Foure\u2019s complaint about Cupples, Core directed Cupples to avoid all further contact with Foure. Notwithstanding this direction, however, Cupples approached Foure the next morning to apologize \u201cif I have said or done anything inappropriate,\u201d which he thought was the \u201cgentleman thing to do.\u201d Later that same day, he again approached Foure to ask if they were \u201cO.K.\u201d and to say he hoped the situation \u201cdoesn\u2019t go any further, it could ruin my reputation.\u201d Foure became upset by Cupples\u2019 contacts with her and, following a discussion with Core, filed a written complaint against Cupples. The written complaint triggered a formal investigation under AmSan\u2019s harassment policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Core consulted with AmSan\u2019s corporate executives during the week of July 12, 2004. Terrance Collins, the Vice President for human resources, located in Illinois, took over the investigation and by telephone interviewed Cupples and at least nine other employees at the Huntersville location. One employee, Tena Davis, told Collins that in March 2004, Cupples had engaged in behavior toward her similar to what Foure had described. Collins also learned about other similar prior conduct from Foure, Davis, and at least two other female employees. They reported that Cupples routinely made comments to them and touched them in ways they considered inappropriate for the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Cupples generally confirmed the incidents but described them as minimal or accidental and good-natured. He said he touched other female employees \u201cin a kidding manner\u201d and made comments that he thought of as \u201ccompliment[s],\u201d but he denied saying anything overtly sexual or inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">While Collins was conducting his investigation, Cupples approached Daws and spoke with her about the complaint against him, asking her if she would serve as a \u201ccharacter witness\u201d for him. This violated the express and undisputed instructions from Core and Collins not to discuss the complaint or investigation with anyone, because to do so would violate the confidentiality provisions of the company\u2019s harassment policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">On Thursday, July 29, 2004, Core notified Cupples that he was suspended without pay and should leave the premises. The following Thursday, August 5, 2004, Cupples was summoned back to AmSan for a meeting with Core and Collins, who had traveled from Illinois to Huntersville for the purpose of terminating Cupples\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>employment. Michael Mulhern, the CEO of AmSan, had directed Collins to fire Cupples for the accumulated complaints of his inappropriate workplace behavior, for his insubordination, and for his breach of confidentiality in discussing the complaint and investigation with others. Collins offered Cupples a 90-day severance package if he agreed to resign. When Cupples refused the package, AmSan paid him 80 days\u2019 salary in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, which provided that either party could end their relationship without cause on 30 days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">After filing a charge of discrimination and receiving a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Cupples commenced this action, alleging that AmSan terminated his employment in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>He also sued Foure and Davis for tortious interference with contract, and he asserted defamation claims against all defendants. The gravamen of his complaint, at least as relevant to this appeal, was that AmSan\u2019s investigation of Foure\u2019s complaint was at once inadequate because it failed to explore Foure\u2019s veracity or get a better sense of \u201cwhat kind of person\u201d Cupples was, and overly aggressive because it actively sought additional complaints against him and accepted as true the versions of events thus obtained. Cupples alleges that AmSan used the claims and investigation against him as a pretext for firing him when the real reason for his discharge was his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Following discovery, Cupples produced the following evidence on which he now relies to support his age discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><em>First, </em>a few months prior to filing her complaint against him, Foure had been among a group of employees who watched a sexual harassment training video, after which she was overheard commenting, \u201cIf they make me mad, I know how to get them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\"><em>Second, </em>Collins testified during his deposition that he did not further investigate Foure\u2019s alleged comment after he learned about it, nor did he pursue assertions made by other AmSan employees that they thought Cupples was being \u201cset up\u201d or that Foure had a history of promiscuity and of making unfounded complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\"><em>Third, </em>H.V. Nelson, a former AmSan executive and the owner of the predecessor company, testified during his deposition that the culture among long-time employees at the company was casual, affectionate, and family-like, including goodnatured touching, like pats on the back and shoulder rubs. He testified that he believed Cupples was innocent of the conduct for which he was fired. Nelson also related a series of hearsay comments by John Muthe, the former CEO of AmSan, that payroll and healthcare costs were being driven up by older employees and thus they should \u201cweed out\u201d older employees to control costs. (These comments were coiroborated by two other former executives.) Nelson observed that several AmSan employees aged 50 or older had been \u201cforced out\u201d over the years, but he admitted that he had little real information as to why they had been let go. He acknowledged that his observation was mostly \u201cspeculation based on experience and based on conversations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\"><em>Fourth, </em>AmSan\u2019s former Vice President of human resources, Morris Taormina, declared in an affidavit that it was \u201cunprecedented at AmSan\u201d to terminate an employee \u201cwith the years of service of Jim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Cupples\u201d for \u201cone complaint of sexual harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, ruling that Cupples\u2019 claims failed as a matter of law. On appeal, Cupples challenges only the district court\u2019s ruling on his ADEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Cupples contends that the district court misapplied the burden-shifting test we articulated in <em>Taylor v. Virginia Union University, </em>193 F.3d 219 (4th Cir.1999) (en banc), for claims of disparate treatment with respect to being disciplined by being discharged, and that he was disciplined as a pretext for age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In <em>Taylor, </em>we established that in order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case for such a claim, a plaintiff must show (1) that he is a member of a protected class (here, the class of workers at least 40 years old protected by the ADEA, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631(a)); (2) that the prohibited conduct for which he was disciplined was \u201ccomparable in seriousness to misconduct of employees outside the protected class;\u201d and (3) that his discharge was more severe discipline for his misconduct than that received by the employees outside the protected class. <em>Taylor, </em>193 F.3d at 234 (citing <em>Cook v. CSX Transp. Coup., </em>988 F.2d 507, 511 (4th Cir.1993)). If the plaintiff makes this showing, a presumption of illegal discrimination arises, and the burden of production shifts to the employer, \u201cwho must articulate a non-discriminatory reason for the difference in disciplinary enforcement.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>988 F.2d at 511. If the employer articulates such a reason, \u201cthe burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer\u2019s reasons are not true but instead serve as a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Importantly, \u201c[a]l-though intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under this framework, \u2018[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (quoting <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">The district court ruled that Cupples succeeded minimally in making out a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination but that he had offered no evidence to demonstrate that AmSan\u2019s non-discriminatory reasons were a mere pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Contending that the district court committed \u201cplain error\u201d in awarding summary judgment to AmSan, Cupples argues that AmSan failed to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason to explain the difference in discipline he received. But Cupples\u2019 argument fails to account for the fact that AmSan <em>did </em>articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for allegedly disciplining him more severely. As Mulhern explained during his deposition, the decision to terminate Cupples was based on <em>multiple </em>complaints of behavior by Cupples in violation of the company\u2019s harassment policy, Cupples\u2019 breach of the confidentiality of the investigation into Foure\u2019s complaint by discussing the investigation with Davis, and Cupples\u2019 insubordination by approaching both Foure and Davis after being instructed not to have contact with them. The assertion by Taormina, the former Vice President of human resources for AmSan, that it was \u201cunprecedented\u201d to fire a long-term AmSan employee for \u201cone complaint of sexual harassment\u201d is thus virtually irrelevant because AmSan\u2019s termination of Cupples was based on <em>far more </em>than just \u201cone complaint of sexual harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>We conclude, however, that Cupples\u2019 case fails at a far more basic level. Although it is undisputed that Cupples, who was 62 years old, was a member of the class of workers protected by the ADEA, there is no evidence in the record from which to conclude that his alleged misconduct was \u201ccomparable in seriousness to misconduct of employees outside the protected class,\u201d or that his discipline was \u201cmore severe\u201d than theirs. <em>Taylor, </em>193 F.3d at 234. While Cupples did provide examples of discipline or the lack of discipline of other employees, as to none did he supply the necessary details that made those other incidents comparable and therefore relevant. He did not show that the person disciplined was outside the protected class or that the person\u2019s conduct was comparable in seriousness to his conduct. The most that could be concluded from what he presented was that for a <em>single </em>complaint of harassment, the termination of the employee might not be warranted. But, as we have already noted, Cupples was charged with multiple complaints of harassment, along with other incidents of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Also, Cupples offered no probative evidence of discriminatory animus. He points only to Nelson\u2019s testimony about the comments of former AmSan CEO James Muthe regarding the payroll and healthcare costs of older workers (which was corroborated by other executives) and Nelson\u2019s own observation that older workers were being weeded out to control costs. But this testimony was hardly probative. It referred to comments made in 2001, three years before Cupples was terminated. Moreover, Muthe himself had been discharged at the end of 2002 and therefore played no role in Cupples\u2019 firing some two years later. Finally, there is no indication or suggestion that Mulhern and Collins, the decisionmakers in Cupples\u2019 case, held such views or had any discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Moreover, Nelson\u2019s testimony about Muthe\u2019s comments referred to a company policy in place at an earlier time to reduce healthcare and payroll costs. But even if it were not remote in time, forcing out employees in furtherance of such a policy would not be based on the \u201cprohibited stereotype\u201d regarding older workers that is addressed by the ADEA. <em>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, </em>507 U.S. 604, 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993). \u201cAn employee\u2019s age is analytically distinct from his\u201d healthcare and payroll costs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Finally, Cupples makes much of his criticism that AmSan\u2019s investigation into his misconduct was either inadequate or overly aggressive. But focusing on the quality of internal investigations misses the point. A federal court \u201cdoes not sit as a kind of super-personnel department weighing the prudence of employment decisions made by firms charged with employment discrimination.\u201d DeJar<em>nette v. Corning, Inc., </em>133 F.3d 293, 299 (4th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cOur sole concern is whether the reason for which the defendant discharged the plaintiff was discriminatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the employer\u2019s reason for termination is not forbidden by law, \u201cit is not our province to decide whether the reason was wise, fair or <em>even correct, </em>ultimately, so long as it was truly the reason for the plaintiffs termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Cupples failed to present evidence sufficient to prove age discrimination, and accordingly we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
