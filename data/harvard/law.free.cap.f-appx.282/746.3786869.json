On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), based on his managerial role. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir.2005). We do not require a district court \u201cto make any specific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. DeVaron, </em>175 F.3d 930, 940 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Section 2D1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines assigns: (1) a base offense level of 38 to a defendant who is accountable for 1.5 or more kilograms of cocaine base; and (2) a base offense level of 32 to a defendant who is accountable for at least 50 grams but less than 150 grams of cocaine base. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l)(4) (2006). Section 3Bl.l(c) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level enhancement if a \u201cdefendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity other than described in [subparagraphs] (a) or (b).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Among other factors, a court should consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIV\">the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-7\"><em>Id. </em>comment, (n.4). However, each factor does not need to be present to support the enhancement. <em>Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In the instant case, the record evidence amply supports the enhancement. Notably, Johnson recruited and directed accomplices in the conspiracy. <em>Cf. United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000) (affirming \u00a7 3Bl.l(e) enhancement where defendant asserted control or influence over co-conspirator during the course of the conspiracy); <em>United States v. Ramsdale, </em>61 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.1995) (affirming \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement where the defendant recruited an accomplice who followed the defendant\u2019s instructions and received drugs at a discount as compensation). He also claimed a greater share of the proceeds, planned offense conduct, and was involved in all levels of the offense conduct. On this record, the district court did not clearly err by applying the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
