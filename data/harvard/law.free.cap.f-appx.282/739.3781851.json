Appellant now appeals the court\u2019s decision, arguing that the district court erroneously determined that his claims regarding the \u201cGrady Hospital Incident\u201d were barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and that his claims regarding the \u201cState Court Incident\u201d were legally insufficient.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-20\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s determination of frivolity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cA claim is frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-21\">For personal injury actions brought under \u00a7 1983, federal courts apply the forum state\u2019s statute of limitations. <em>Porter v. Ray, </em>461 F.3d 1315, 1323 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 516, 166 L.Ed.2d 371 (2006). Under Georgia law, the statute of limitations applicable to appellant\u2019s claims involving the \u201cGrady Hospital Incident\u201d is two years. <em>Id. </em>(citing Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-3-33). Because that incident occurred nearly five years before appellant filed his complaint, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>that the statute of limitations was a bar. <em>See Porter, </em>461 F.3d at 1323. We turn, then, to the claims based on the \u201cState Court Incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Supervisory officials cannot be held liable for the unconstitutional actions of their subordinates based on a theory of respondeat superior under \u00a7 1983. <em>Gray ex. rel. Alexander v. Bostic, </em>458 F.3d 1295, 1308 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2428, 167 L.Ed.2d 1129 (2007). \u201cInstead, supervisors can be held personally liable when either (1) the supervisor personally participates in the alleged constitutional violation, or (2) there is a causal connection between the actions of the supervisor and the alleged constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Appellant alleged unconstitutional actions by deputies who passed around mug shots of him and followed him and family members. He sought, however, to hold Fulton County Sheriff Myron Freeman liable for those actions. Appellant cannot recover against the Sheriff because a supervisor cannot be held vicariously liable for his subordinates\u2019 conduct under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Bostic, </em>458 F.3d at 1308. With respect to the remaining defendants named in appellant\u2019s complaint, including a lawyer, a state court judge, and Fulton County Commissioners, the complaint recites no facts that would give rise to a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-14\">. The complaint seeks damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A2XJ\">. Appellant does not address the district court\u2019s decision not to invoke supplemental jurisdiction and entertain his state law claims. This issue is therefore abandoned. <em>Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
