The offenses were committed in South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, and were transferred with Schuler\u2019s consent to the District of South Carolina for disposition. Schuler appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in departing above the advisory guideline range pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (USSG) \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">Between April 11, 2006, and his arrest on July 11, 2006, Schuler burglarized twenty-five banks. Schuler began this series of burglaries while he was on supervised release, a week after he finished serving a 63-month federal sentence for burglarizing eight banks in Florida in 2000. In addition, he had previously served a one-year federal sentence for burglarizing two banks in Florida in 1998, as well as a one-year state sentence for another bank burglary committed the same year. In departing upward, the district court considered both prior sentences that were not counted in Schuler\u2019s criminal history score because they were outside the applicable time period, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(e), and the fact that Schuler had been convicted and imprisoned twice before for burglarizing banks, and upon release each time immediately committed the same offense again.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-19\">A district court may depart upward based on the inadequacy of the defendant\u2019s criminal history if \u201creliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.... \u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">Here, the court could properly consider, as a basis for departure, outdated sentences that provided \u201cevidence of similar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct. ...\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.8). Not all of Schuler\u2019s early criminal conduct was of this kind; however, he had three unscored sentences for grand theft and two unscored sentences for retail theft. Moreover, Application Note 2(B) to \u00a7 4A1.3 states that \u201cthe court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal record.\u201d In this regard, the court properly considered Schuler\u2019s repeated burglaries of banks and his immediate resumption of the same criminal conduct as soon as he was released from custody for two prior convictions for bank burglary. Notably, Schuler committed an increasing number of burglaries after each prior sentence. We conclude that the court\u2019s decision to depart was not unreasonable, particularly in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, directing appellate courts to review sentences outside the advisory guidelines range for abuse of discretion only. In addition, the extent of the departure was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 164-65 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
