Riley appeals his sentence, contending that the district court clearly erred in finding that he abused a position of trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.3 (2006). For the reasons explained below, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">When he committed the offense, Riley was a state probation officer in Henry County, Virginia. He was arrested after he made a controlled purchase from a cooperating defendant, Calvin Rayfield Moore.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s determination that the defendant held a position of trust under \u00a7 3B1.3, and reviews the factual findings that support the adjustment for clear error. <em>United States v. Ebersole, </em>411 F.3d 517, 535-36 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Caplinger, </em>339 F.3d 226, 235-36 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">Riley concedes that he held a position of trust, but contends that the government produced no evidence that his position enabled him to commit or conceal the offense. Application Note 1 to \u00a7 3B1.3 states: \u201cFor this adjustment to apply, the position of public or private trust must have contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense <em>(e.g., </em>by making the detection of the offense or the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the offense more difficult).\u201d The district court accepted the probation officer\u2019s speculation that Riley\u2019s position must have facilitated his commission and concealment of the offense by giving him knowledge of the activities of law enforcement officers in the county and allowing him to associate with convicted criminals without arousing suspicion. However, no specific evidence was produced to show that Riley\u2019s position actually aided him in this way. The government\u2019s argument at sentencing was focused entirely on the damage Riley\u2019s actions caused to the reputation of the criminal justice system in the county, which is not a basis for giving the adjustment. <em>See United States v. Wadena, </em>152 F.3d 831, 856-57 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">A sentence is reviewed for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); see <em>also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guideline range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guideline range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Here, in the absence of evidence that Riley\u2019s position \u201ccontributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense,\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.3, comment. (n.l), we cannot affirm the district court\u2019s application of the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing. On remand, the district court should not impose the \u00a7 3B1.3 adjustment unless it finds that the necessary evidentiary support exists. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-12\"> Moore died before Riley was sentenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
