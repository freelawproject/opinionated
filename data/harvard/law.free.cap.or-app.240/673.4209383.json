J.</author>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Appellant Tamara Sawyer (Sawyer)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenges a judgment of summary contempt, ORS 33.096, based on her refusal to produce documents and answer certain questions in a judgment debtor examination arising from a money judgment that plaintiffs secured against the defendant corporation, Starboard, LLC. She argues, in part, that the trial court erred in directing her to answer those questions and produce documents, and in imposing sanctions, notwithstanding her invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination pursuant to Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. As amplified below, we conclude that the trial court erred in determining that Sawyer was not entitled to invoke the privilege and, consequently, in imposing contempt sanctions for her refusal to comply with its directives. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. In May 2008, plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Starboard, seeking payment on several delinquent promissory notes. In March 2009, plaintiffs obtained a judgment against Starboard for over $900,000, including interest and attorney fees. After the judgment was entered, Tamara and Kevin Sawyer were ordered to appear for a judgment debtor examination, ORS 18.265(1), and to produce certain documents pertaining to Starboard\u2019s property and its financial affairs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Previously, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Tamara Sawyer had made public statements as to her and her husband\u2019s involvement with Starboard\u2019s assets and its business dealings.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">At the time the judgment debtor examination was to be held, published reports indicated that the Sawyers and Starboard were the subjects of a criminal investigation by the FBI and that Starboard was under investigation by the IRS. Indeed, it is undisputed for the purposes of our review that Tamara Sawyer was, in fact, a \u201ctarget\u201d of a continuing federal criminal investigation involving, <em>inter alia, </em>Starboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The debtor examination, held May 18, 2009, was attended by the Sawyers and counsel for Starboard. The Sawyers, invoking the privilege against self-incrimination, refused to answer plaintiffs\u2019 questions or produce any documents, whereupon plaintiffs initiated contempt proceedings against them seeking \u201cremedial\u201d sanctions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The first contempt hearing was held on August 6, 2009. At that hearing, the Sawyers again stated their intention to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination as to plaintiffs\u2019 questions and requests for the production of documents. The trial court determined that the best course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>action was to continue the hearing so that it could preside over the debtor examination and rule on the Sawyers\u2019 invocations of the privilege on a \u201cquestion-by-question basis.\u201d <em>See Empire Wholesale Lumber Co. v. Meyers, </em>192 Or App 221, 226, 85 P3d 339 (2004) (privilege \u201cmust be invoked, and ruled upon, on a question-by-question, document-by-document basis\u201d). Accordingly, the trial court continued the contempt proceedings to October 5, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">At the October 5 hearing, plaintiffs, Kevin Sawyer, and Tamara Sawyer \u2014 who was represented by counsel\u2014 appeared. No person appeared for Starboard, and Starboard was not represented by counsel. Kevin Sawyer was first sworn and called to testify. Plaintiffs asked Kevin Sawyer about his \u201cposition past or present with Starboard,\u201d and he invoked the privilege under Article I, section 12, and the Fifth Amendment. Tamara Sawyer\u2019s counsel contended that Kevin Sawyer\u2019s invocation of the privilege was proper because answering plaintiffs\u2019 question</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201cwould be potentially subjecting him to disclosure of information that could be used against him in the pending criminal investigation because Starboard * * * we\u2019ve * * * read in the newspaper is a focus of this criminal investigation. So obviously, an officer or director of, of a company could be, that answer could be used against them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The trial court, reasoning that, because Kevin Sawyer\u2019s status with respect to Starboard \u201cshould be a public record, and so it\u2019s discoverable [in] * * * other ways,\u201d ruled that the privilege did not apply and held Kevin Sawyer in contempt for not answering.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Plaintiffs then asked Kevin Sawyer, \u201c[W]hich of [the requested] documents have you produced today?\u201d and Kevin Sawyer again invoked the privilege. The trial court, after hearing further argument as to what sanction for contempt against Kevin Sawyer should he imposed, took the matter under advisement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Tamara Sawyer was next placed under oath, and plaintiffs asked the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">\u201c[W]hat has been <em>your past and your present </em>connection with Starboard LLC?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">(Emphasis added.) Sawyer refused to answer, invoking the privilege under Article I, section 12, and the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asserted that \u201c[t]he Fifth Amendment does not apply to that broad a question.\u201d Sawyer\u2019s counsel, renewing the contentions that had been expressed with respect to Kevin Sawyer, remonstrated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cThe fact that something may be discoverable through an independent source such as the public record does not affect the validity of the privilege assertion on the part of the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201cSo I respectfully disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis with respect to the, whether she is required to answer questions about whether she holds a position with Starboard. I believe she does in fact have a good-faith basis to believe that an answer to that question could be used against her in the ongoing criminal investigation and criminal proceedings and, therefore, it\u2019s her privilege which I would urge the Court to honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The trial court then asked Sawyer\u2019s counsel to explain why an answer to that question was potentially incriminating, and counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">\u201cStarboard is, by published report, the subject of allegations of a criminal nature with respect to the management of funds and other things. The acknowledgement by someone that they are in a position of responsibility in that company, irrespective of whether it could be proved some other way, demonstrates knowledge and an admission on their part that could be used to establish their responsibility for the conduct of the entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">\u201cWith the, say, public record, someone could attempt to persuade a jury, for example, that the person holds that position and is responsible, but they don\u2019t have the admission by the person that they hold the position. And that\u2019s very different.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The trial court, apparently rejecting that reasoning, advised Sawyer that her answer was not privileged and ordered her to respond. Again, she declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Plaintiffs then asked Sawyer whether she had \u201cbrought any of [the] * * * documents today as ordered\u201d by their subpoena and the court\u2019s citation to the debtor examination. Sawyer again invoked the state and federal privileges against self-incrimination, whereupon the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201c[Sawyer\u2019s counsel]: The act of production privilege, Your Honor, the personal interests of a person can involve not merely the substantive answer, but also whether or not they\u2019re knowledgeable about the existence of records from which can be inferred a knowledge of the contents. Therefore, a person who has a reason to believe that they are under criminal investigation has a right to decline as a constitutional matter both state and federal, the request to produce documents, because the act of production may tend to incriminate them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you believe the case law supports your theory of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201c[Sawyer\u2019s counsel]: Absolutely. The act of production privilege has been well-documented and recognized by the United States Supreme Court. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u00absf\u00ed ifc sfc <em>% </em>\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\u201c[PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, this, again the record is clear already, we can belabor this for hours, but it\u2019s very apparent that the, both defendants, * * * Kevin Sawyer, Tammy Sawyer, and the defendant Starboard [are] subject to this Court\u2019s order, both prior to today and then in the presence of the Court in open defiance of this Court\u2019s order, have refused to answer even the most general of questions, improperly hiding behind the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">\u201cAnd this Court indulged them to the point of having this hearing so you could piecemeal take up valid objections, not global \u2018I\u2019m not going to answer anything, I won\u2019t bring anything\u2019 objection * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\">\u201c* * * I can\u2019t conduct a debtor\u2019s exam as ordered by this Court with no documents and no answers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The trial court issued the following ruling from the bench at the conclusion of the October 5 hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">\u201cI am holding [Tamara Sawyer] in contempt as well in her capacity [sic]. You know, one would argue that they\u2019re here both individually as well as with regard to their capacity with Starboard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u201cThey are, the Court is finding that both of them are in contempt with regard to the questions that were answered, and * * * they\u2019ve insisted that the Fifth Amendment applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The court once again continued the hearing \u2014 to October 30\u2014 to entertain arguments from the parties as to what sanctions to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">On October 30, the trial court reiterated its determination that the Sawyers were both in summary contempt. The court ordered both Sawyers to relinquish their passports and Tamara Sawyer to report to custody on November 6, 2009. Thereafter, the court issued a judgment, entered November 5, 2009, in which it stated that it had found Tamara Sawyer to be in summary contempt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sawyer filed a notice of appeal from that judgment the same day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">On appeal, Sawyer raises five assignments of error. In her first two assignments of error, Sawyer challenges the trial court\u2019s rulings that she must respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 questions as to her connection to Starboard and for the production of documents over her assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination. Sawyer\u2019s third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error pertain to the procedural propriety of the trial court\u2019s imposition of summary contempt, <em>see </em>ORS 33.096, and the sanction it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>With respect to whether Sawyer properly invoked the privilege against self-incrimination, the parties generally reprise and refine the arguments they made before the trial court. In particular, Sawyer contends that the trial court \u201cemployed incorrect standards under both the Oregon and federal constitutions in rejecting [Sawyer\u2019s] assertion of privilege.\u201d Plaintiffs respond, in essence, that Sawyer failed to establish that her fear of incrimination was reasonable under the circumstances because plaintiffs\u2019 questions did not elicit incriminating information. Rather, plaintiffs maintain, Sawyer\u2019s \u201crefusal to follow the court\u2019s order was * * * motivated [solely] to prevent plaintiffs from conducting a debtor\u2019s examination * * * concerning Starboard\u2019s assets.\u201d We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the trial court erred in its determination that Sawyer\u2019s invocation of the privilege was unavailing. Accordingly, we reverse on that basis and do not address the other, alternative, assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Before turning to the merits, we clarify our standard of review. Here, the operative facts are uncontroverted. Specifically, the parties do not dispute either that Sawyer willfully violated the court\u2019s order to testify or that, at the time that she refused to comply with the court\u2019s directives, she was, in fact, the \u201ctarget\u201d of a federal criminal investigation pertaining, in part, to Starboard. Rather, the dispute centers on whether the trial court erred in overriding Sawyer\u2019s invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. We review the trial court\u2019s conclusion as to the applicability of a privilege in this context for errors of law. <em>See State v. Langley, </em>314 Or 247, 263, 839 P2d 692 (1992), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>318 Or 28, 861 P2d 1012 (1993) (reviewing, for errors of law, the trial court\u2019s determination that the psychotherapist-patient privilege did not apply).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Although Sawyer invoked the privilege under Article I, section 12, as well as the Fifth Amendment, both parties have conflated their analyses of the two constitutional provisions, with neither proposing a distinct analysis under Article I, section 12, or arguing against our adoption of the federal standard. Indeed, in material respects, much of the parties\u2019 briefing focuses on cases construing the privilege\u2019s application under the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, although we typically consider arguments raised under the Oregon Constitution before considering those raised under federal constitution, <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or 260, 262-68, 666 P2d 1316 (1983) (describing methodology), we will focus on the privilege as it applies under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. K. L. R., </em>235 Or App 1, 5, 230 P3d 49 (2010) (choosing to analyze privilege only under the Fifth Amendment where the appellant did not \u201cdevelop[ ] a separate analysis under the Oregon Constitution\u201d). <em>But cf. State v. Tenbusch, </em>131 Or App 634, 641, 886 P2d 1077 (1994), <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 587, <em>cert den, </em>516 US 991 (1995) (analyzing the Oregon and federal constitutional privileges together \u201cbecause the protections are similar\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"> The Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be * * * compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d That privilege protects a person from being compelled to testify in any proceeding \u2014 ^including civil proceedings \u2014 when the answers may incriminate the person in a future criminal prosecution. <em>See, e.g., Maness v. Meyers, </em>419 US 449, 464, 95 S Ct 584, 42 L Ed 2d 574 (1975) (reaffirming the principle, in the context of a civil case, that \u201cthe privilege against self-incrimination can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The privilege pertains not only to inquiries that would be directly incriminating, but also \u201cembraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence\u201d needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>to prosecute a crime. <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 US 479, 486, 71 S Ct 814, 95 L Ed 1118 (1951). Thus, as we have previously explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">\u201cA person\u2019s assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege does not depend on the court\u2019s assessment of the likelihood of prosecution. <em>United States v. Miranti, </em>253 F2d 135, 139 (2d Cir 1958). Nor does it depend on whether a criminal prosecution is pending. <em>United States v. Rendahl, </em>746 F2d 553, 556 (9th Cir 1984). \u2018Once the court determines that the answers requested would tend to incriminate the witness, it should not attempt to speculate whether the witness will in fact be prosecuted.\u2019 <em>United States v. Jones, </em>703 F2d 473, 478 (10th Cir 1983); <em>accord Miranti, </em>253 F2d at 138-39. The appropriate inquiry is whether the testimony in question would provide evidence of a particular crime. <em>United States v. Edgerton, </em>734 F2d 913, 921 (2d Cir 1984).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\"><em>Empire Wholesale Lumber Co., </em>192 Or App at 226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In determining whether the privilege applies, the trial court must evaluate, with respect to each question for which the privilege is claimed, whether \u201cthe answer to that particular question would subject the witness to a real danger of * * * crimination,\u201d as opposed to \u201ca mere imaginary possibility of increasing the danger of prosecution.\u201d <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>340 US 367, 374-75, 71 S Ct 438, 95 L Ed 344 (1951) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Marchetti v. United States, </em>390 US 39, 53, 88 S Ct 697, 19 L Ed 2d 889 (1968) (stating the standard as \u201cwhether the claimant is confronted by substantial and \u2018real,\u2019 and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\"> In making that assessment, the witness must not be \u201crequired to prove the hazard in the sense in which a claim is usually required to be established in court,\u201d lest the witness \u201csurrender the very protection which the privilege is designed to guarantee.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>341 US at 486. Accordingly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">\u201c[t]o sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered <em>might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 486-87 (emphasis added). Although the witness claiming the privilege bears the burden of establishing that an answer could be injurious, the court must construe the privilege liberally \u201cin favor of the right it was intended to secure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. Thus, it must be <em>\u201cperfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness [claiming the privilege] is mistaken, and that the answers <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency to incriminate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Further, the protections afforded by the privilege are not abrogated merely because the government may have access from another source to the same information sought to be compelled from the witness. That is so for at least two reasons. First, as a practical matter, such an exception would substantially subvert \u2014 and perhaps abrogate \u2014 the constitutional protection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, evidence compelled from \u201cthe speaker\u2019s own mouth\u201d can convey inculpatory implications that are uniquely, qualitatively different than those attending other evidence. <em>See, e.g., Grunewald v. United States, </em>353 US 391, 421-22, 77 S Ct 963, 1 L Ed 2d 931 (1957) (witness was justified in invoking privilege in grand jury proceedings, despite decision to testify at trial, based on legitimate concern that he \u201cwould have provided the Government with incriminating evidence from his own mouth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Finally, the privilege can also extend to protect against the act of production in circumstances where the production of documents has a \u201cprotected testimonial aspect[ ],\u201d <em>United States v. Hubbell, </em>530 US 27, 36 n 19, 120 S Ct 2037, 147 L Ed 2d 24 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>viz., </em>the act \u201cexplicitly or implicitly * * * relate[s] a factual assertion or disclose[s] information.\u201d <em>Doe v. United States, </em>487 US 201, 210, 108 S Ct 2341, 101 L Ed 2d 184 (1988). The act of production may communicate such statements of fact, where, for example, \u201c[b]y producing documents in compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>with a subpoena, the witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession or control, and were authentic.\u201d <em>Hubbell, </em>530 US at 36 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">With those principles in mind, we return to the specific circumstances and questions posed to Sawyer in this case. Here, the potential for self-incrimination was patent. At the time Sawyer invoked the privilege against self-incrimination, published reports indicated that she was under federal investigation for conduct relating to the financial affairs and business dealings of Starboard \u2014 and, as noted, it is undisputed that she was, in fact, the target of a pending federal criminal investigation. The information sought by the creditors in this case \u2014 indeed as evinced by plaintiffs\u2019 express focus in the debtor examination \u2014 was calculated to explore and expose precisely the nature and contours of Sawyer\u2019s relationship to Starboard and its (potentially criminally inculpatory) financial affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In that context, it was not \u201cperfectly clear,\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>341 US at 488 (emphasis omitted), that a responsive answer to plaintiffs\u2019 initial, \u201cbroad\u201d question to <em>Sawyer </em>\u2014 viz., \u201cwhat has been <em>your past and your present </em>connection with Starboard LLC?\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 \u201c[could not] possibly have [a] tendency to incriminate\u201d or that \u201cinjurious disclosure\u201d would not result. <em>See Hoffman, </em>341 US at 487-88 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). By answering that question, Sawyer risked disclosing the nature, duration, and degree of her involvement with and authority (if any) over the affairs of Starboard \u2014 evidence that might well be used in a future criminal proceeding to establish her responsibility for the activities that were under investigation by the FBI and the IRS. Although some of that same information may have been available from other sources, including public records or Sawyer\u2019s own public statements months before, at the very least, some aspects of a responsive answer to that question would have necessarily disclosed potentially inculpatory information that was only available from Sawyer herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">We reach the same result as to plaintiffs\u2019 question as to whether Sawyer, in her personal capacity, had \u201cbrought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>any of [the] * * * [Starboard] documents today as ordered\u201d by their subpoena and the court\u2019s citation to the debtor examination. That request essentially called on Sawyer to \u201cexplicitly or implicitly * * * relate a factual assertion or disclose information,\u201d as to the existence of the documents, her knowledge or possession of them, her belief that the records were those described in the subpoena, and, conceivably, their authenticity. <em>See Doe, </em>487 US at 210. In light of the totality of the uncontroverted circumstances of this case, there was a \u201csubstantial,\u201d <em>Marchetti, </em>390 US at 53, and \u201creal danger,\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>340 US at 374 (internal quotation marks omitted), that such testimonial assertions could be used to \u201cfurnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute * * * [a] <em>crime,\u201d Hoffman, </em>341 US at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In the end, we, like the trial court, appreciate that plaintiffs have a real and valid interest in executing their judgment against Starboard. Nor are we unmindful of their frustrations in being constrained in that effect, at least so long as Sawyer\u2019s purported criminal involvement with Starboard remains unresolved. Nevertheless, so long as that proximate exposure to criminal liability remains, Sawyer\u2019s invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination as to the inquiries at issue here cannot be contravened.

A hearing on that motion was held on November 6, 2009, and the trial court denied her request. Sawyer immediately renewed her motion before this court, pursuant to ORAP 7.35, and the court granted a temporary stay of seven days, which was subsequently extended to remain in effect pending disposition of this appeal. <em>See </em>ORS 19.350.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b745-5\"> In <em>Empire Wholesale Lumber Co., </em>we stated, without textual elaboration, that \u201c[t]he determination of the availability of the privilege is <em>committed to the discretion </em>of the trial court.\u201d 192 Or App at 226 (emphasis added). As support for that statement, we referred to <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>340 US 367, 374, 71 S Ct 438, 95 L Ed 344 (1951), and <em>U.S. v. Boothe, </em>335 F3d 522, 525 (6th Cir 2003), <em>cert den, </em>541 US 975 (2004). Upon close examination, the reference to \u201cdiscretion\u201d in those and related cases appears to relate to the prudential deference to be accorded a trial court\u2019s determination in circumstances in which the witness\u2019s susceptibility to inculpatory consequences is uncertain or ambiguous. Where, however, it is uncontroverted that the party invoking the privilege is, in fact, the subject of a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>investigation or prosecution pertaining to the subject matter of the inquiry and the inculpatory potential of the inquiry is manifest, \u201cdiscretion\u201d is inapposite. <em>See State v.
