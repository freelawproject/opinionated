Employer contends that the board erred in failing to consider certain evidence, in discounting other evidence, in providing inadequate reasoning for its decision, and in denying employer the opportunity to make the last presentation of evidence. We conclude that the board\u2019s order is supported by substantial evidence and substantial reason and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The board found that claimant began to experience neck pain on December 11, 2007, while raising his arms to load coffee products into a delivery truck. The board found that claimant\u2019s pain worsened with a sneeze. An MRI revealed that claimant had a C4-5 disc herniation, as well as mild to moderate spondylosis at C5-6 and C6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Employer denied claimant\u2019s claim for C4-5 disc herniation, and claimant requested a hearing. Multiple medical reports were submitted by the parties. Employer sought to establish that claimant had a preexisting arthritic condition and that the preexisting condition had combined with any possible work injury. Employer further contended that the work was not the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s cervical condition. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 656.266(2)(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, employer also sought to submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>an addendum report by Dr. Duff, who had conducted an independent medical examination (IME) on behalf of employer, as the \u201clast presentation of evidence and argument on the issue.\u201d <em>See </em>OAR 438-006-0023; <em>SAIF v. Kollias, </em>233 Or App 499, 227 P3d 188 (2010). Claimant objected to the admission of the report, and the ALJ excluded it. The ALJ further found, based on the other medical evidence in the record, that claimant\u2019s work activities on December 11, 2007, were the major contributing cause of the C4-5 disc herniation and set aside employer\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">On appeal to the board, employer contended that Duffs report should have been admitted. The board did not address that contention, however, because it concluded that, even considering Duffs report, it would conclude that claimant\u2019s condition is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Employer further contended before the board that claimant\u2019s account of his injury was not credible and that claimant did not experience an injury on the job. In the alternative, employer contended that any possible work injury combined with a preexisting arthritic condition that was the major contributing cause of the combined condition. The board addressed employer\u2019s challenge to claimant\u2019s credibility. It made an explicit finding, supported by a lengthy explanation, that claimant was credible and that the record showed that claimant\u2019s symptoms arose at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Having determined that claimant\u2019s symptoms arose at work, the board turned to the evidence of medical causation. Drs. Greenberg and Soldevilla, claimant\u2019s attending physician and surgeon, respectively, opined that claimant\u2019s neck condition was work related. They based their opinions on claimant\u2019s description of the onset of pain while loading heavy items into a truck at work. In contrast, Drs. Duff and Denekas, who provided employer with IMEs, opined that claimant\u2019s C4-5 disc herniation was not related to work. Underlying their opinions was the assumption that claimant\u2019s symptoms were associated with sneezing or coughing, rather than with a work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The board determined that the opinions of Greenberg and Soldevilla were more consistent with claimant\u2019s credible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>version of the events, specifically with his description of the origin of his symptoms. Based on that determination, the board found the opinions of Greenberg and Soldevilla more persuasive than those of Duff and Denekas and concluded that claimant had met his initial burden to prove an \u201cotherwise compensable injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Denekas and Duff had also offered the opinion that any work activity that might have precipitated claimant\u2019s symptoms would have combined with a preexisting degenerative disease to cause the cervical disc herniation. They further opined that the preexisting degenerative condition was the major contributing cause of the combined condition. Based on their opinions, employer contended that the otherwise compensable injury was not the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s disability or need for treatment. ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The board once again rejected the IME doctors\u2019 opinions. The board explained that those opinions were not persuasive, because the doctors</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cconsistently reiterated their belief that claimant\u2019s symptoms were not associated with work but were associated with sneezing instead. Thus, they discussed a hypothetical \u2018combined condition\u2019 without weighing the contribution of claimant\u2019s work injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201c* * * Because Drs. Denekas and Duff did not weigh the relative contribution of claimant\u2019s work injury to the herniation, their opinions do not prove that the otherwise compensable injury was not the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s disability or need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Thus, the board\u2019s decision once again turned on the question of claimant\u2019s credibility and the board\u2019s determination that claimant was credible and had experienced his neck symptoms while working. In light of its rejection of the IME reports, the board further held that employer had failed to establish that claimant had a preexisting condition that was the major contributing cause of his disability or need for treatment. ORS 656.266(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>On review, in four separate assignments of error, employer continues to dispute claimant\u2019s account of his injury, complaining that the board\u2019s credibility determination and its determination that claimant suffered an injury on the job are not supported by substantial evidence or substantial reason, because the board ignored, or did not adequately explain away, credible evidence showing that claimant did not experience an injury at work. Although there is conflicting evidence in the record on this point, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s findings that claimant was credible and experienced his injury on the job, and we do not address that issue any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Employer further challenges the board\u2019s determination that, even if employer had met its burden to show that claimant had experienced a combined condition, nonetheless, employer had failed to meet its burden to prove that the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d was not the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition. ORS 656.266(2)(a). In its order, the board described the opinions of Denekas and Duff and their view that any on-the-job activity would have combined with a preexisting degenerative disease to cause the cervical disc herniation and that the preexisting degeneration was the major contributing cause of the combined condition. The board rejected those opinions as unpersuasive, primarily because the opinions assumed that the origin of claimant\u2019s symptoms was a sneeze rather than an incident at work as described by claimant, and the doctors therefore did not consider or weigh a contribution from claimant\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Employer contends that the board erred in discounting the opinions of Denekas and Duff for that reason and, further, that the board did not adequately explain its rejection of those opinions. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the board adequately explained its decision to rely on the opinions of Greenberg and Soldevilla and that its order is supported by substantial evidence and substantial reason. <em>See Schoch v. Leupold &amp; Stevens, </em>325 Or 112, 118, 934 P2d 410 (1997) (substantial reason requirement necessitates \u201ca sufficient explanation to allow a reviewing court to examine the agency\u2019s action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Finally, employer contends that the board erred in excluding Duffs addendum report. In that addendum report, Duff stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">\u201cAs to the disk herniation occurring with such activities as sneezing, coughing, etc., and other events of everyday life, this will likely occur if, in fact, the disk has degenerated to the point that only a very minor increase in pressure on the disk is sufficient to actually cause a herniation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Like the board, we do not reach the issue of the admissibility of the report,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because we conclude that, even if the board had considered the report, as the board said, it would not have reached a different outcome. The report was based on the same underlying premise that the board had rejected \u2014 that claimant\u2019s symptoms were triggered by a sneeze rather than by work activity; thus, any error in not admitting the report was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\u201cIf an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the combined condition is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> ORS 656.266 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">\u201c(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, for the purpose of combined condition injury claims under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">\u201c(a) Once the worker establishes an otherwise compensable injury, the employer shall bear the burden of proof to establish the otherwise compensable injury is not, or is no longer, the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> We note that, in <em>Kollias, </em>233 Or App at 505, we held that, because the burden to establish that a claimant\u2019s \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d is not the major contributing cause of the disability or the need for treatment encompasses proof that (1) the claimant suffers from a preexisting condition, as defined in ORS 656.005(24), and (2) the claimant\u2019s condition is a combined condition, the employer is entitled to put on rebuttal evidence under OAR 438-007-0023 to establish that the claimant has a combined condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
