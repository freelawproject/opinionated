In each of the cases, the trial court ordered that defendant not be considered for any sentence modification programs that would reduce her sentence. In this consolidated appeal, defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to deny sentence modification programs was not based on substantial and compelling reasons, as required by ORS 137.750(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the trial court\u2019s denial of eligibility for programs was \u201cbased explicitly on defendant\u2019s prior criminal history,\u201d and that, because her criminal history has already been taken into account in calculating her sentence, it does not furnish a substantial and compelling reason to deny sentence modification programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s characterization of the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision. Although it is clear that the court relied on defendant\u2019s criminal history, it was not the <em>sole </em>basis for its decision. In a colloquy with the court before it announced the sentence, defendant admitted that she has a history of drug dependence and continued to use drugs. In stating its decision, the court found that defendant is a drug dependent person, that prior attempts at rehabilitation had not been effective for her, and that she presents a high risk of engaging in future criminal activity. Defendant does not challenge those findings as insufficiently substantial and compelling. Although we express no opinion as to whether they are sufficient, defendant\u2019s failure to challenge them is fatal to her appeal. Accordingly, we need not address whether defendant\u2019s criminal history furnished a substantial and compelling reason to deny eligibility for sentence modification programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
