We review for substantial evidence and errors of law, ORS 183.482(8), and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Claimant sustained a June 2003 back injury while lifting a tire at work and filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer accepted a claim for an L4-5 disc herniation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> About one month after the injury, claimant underwent a left L4 hemilaminotomy with L4-5 diskectomy. Claimant\u2019s condition was determined to be medically stationary as of November 2003, and the claim was closed the following month with an award of 37 percent unscheduled permanent partial disability for claimant\u2019s low back. In April 2004, the board approved a claim disposition agreement (CDA) in which claimant released all rights to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the accepted condition, except for medical services under ORS 656.245.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Claimant continued to have low back and left leg pain after closure of his claim. In March 2006, claimant sought medical treatment following two non-work-related incidents that had increased his low back and left hip pain. That same month, claimant underwent a \u201c[r]eop left L4-5 microlaminotomy and diskectomy with microdissection\u201d performed by Dr. Keiper, whose post-operative diagnosis concluded that claimant had suffered from a \u201clarge recurrent disk herniation on the left at L4-5.\u201d The insurer paid for the March 2006 surgery but, apparently, did not process any claims or requests from claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>After the March 2006 surgery, claimant continued <em>to </em>have discomfort in his back and left leg. A lumbar MRI showed a large recurrent left-posterior disc extrusion at L4-5, and Keiper recommended further surgery. Claimant also consulted another neurosurgeon, Dr. Noonan, who similarly concluded that claimant required further surgery and requested authorization from the insurer to perform the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">At the insurer\u2019s request, Dr. Yodlowski performed a medical evaluation and identified disc dessiccation at L2-3 and L4-5 as preexisting conditions, which she concluded combined with claimant\u2019s 2003 work injury to cause the disability and require treatment in 2003. Furthermore, Yodlowski believed that one of claimant\u2019s non-work-related injury incidents had combined with the preexisting condition to become the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s condition after March 2006, based on an assumption that claimant had been free of symptoms and did not require medical treatment between 2003 and 2006. In contrast, Noonan concluded that claimant\u2019s \u201cleft L4-5 recurrent disk herniation was caused in major part by a combination of the initial work injury and the two subsequent surgeries paid for by the workers\u2019 compensation insurer.\u201d In June 2007, the insurer denied claimant\u2019s \u201crequest for authorization of a L4-5 redo Micro Lumbar discectomy and L4-5 transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with iliac crest bone graft from J. Christopher Noonan, MD.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Claimant requested a hearing, which resulted in an order by an administrative law judge (ALJ) setting aside the insurer\u2019s denial on the ground that \u201cclaimant\u2019s recurrent L4-5 disc herniation condition and need for medical services is materially related to the accepted June 26, 2003 work injury.\u201d Employer appealed to the board, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order. Before the board, employer renewed its argument that the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s worsened condition was an injury occurring outside the course and scope of his employment, which, under ORS 656.273(1), meant that claimant\u2019s condition was not compensable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>board disagreed and concluded that, \u201c[i]n light of the April 2004 CDA, claimant has released his aggravation rights and, therefore, ORS 656.273 does not apply. Instead, the only issue that can be litigated is medical services.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Based on that reasoning, the board concluded that the compensability of the proposed surgery for claimant\u2019s L4-5 disc condition was subject to a material contributing cause standard, which it found to be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">The board also reached an alternative conclusion on that issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">\u201c[E]ven if we assume that the employer may raise an affirmative defense under ORS 656.273(1), we find that the employer has not sustained its burden of proving that \u2018the major contributing cause of the worsened condition is an injury not occurring within the course and scope of employment!.]\u2019 In that regard, we agree with the AL J\u2019s finding that the June 26, 2003 work injury was the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s need for the treatment of the recurrent L4-5 disc herniation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In addition, the board addressed employer\u2019s alternative argument that the ALJ had erred in applying a material cause standard because, according to employer, claimant has a preexisting condition under ORS 656.005(24)(a)(B)(iii) and, therefore, on the facts in this case, a combined condition, making the major contributing cause standard applicable to the claim. <em>See </em>ORS 656.245(l)(a) (explaining that, if treatment is sought for a combined or consequential condition, the insurer need only pay for \u201cmedical services directed to medical conditions caused in major part by the injury\u2019). Noting that ORS 656.005(24)(a)(B)(iii) applies only to \u201cclaims for a worsening pursuant to ORS 656.273 or 656.278[,]\u201d the board rejected employer\u2019s argument because \u201cthis is a claim for medical services pursuant to ORS 656.245(1)\u201d and <em>\u201cnot </em>a claim \u2018for a worsening pursuant to ORS 656.273.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Furthermore, the board agreed with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the \u201c \u2018major contributing cause\u2019 standard in ORS 656.245(l)(a) does not apply because the medical records do not establish that claimant\u2019s L4-5 disc condition is a combined or consequential condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>On judicial review, employer first assigns error to the board\u2019s determination that the 2004 CDA barred employer from asserting the defense, otherwise available under ORS 656.273(1), that claimant\u2019s recurrent L4-5 disc herniation is not compensable because its major contributing cause is a non-work-related injury. As explained below, we agree with employer that the board did so err. We begin by discussing the relevant statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Under ORS 656.245(l)(a) and (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> workers with accepted claims generally are entitled to medical services for conditions caused in material part by a compensable injury, and insurers must provide compensable medical services for accepted conditions for the life of the worker. <em>See, e.g., Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., Inc. v. Watkins, </em>347 Or 687, 690-91, 227 P3d 1134 (2010). However, once a worker is determined to be medically stationary,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ORS 656.245(1)(c) provides that only limited types of medical services remain compensable. <em>See SAIF v. January, </em>166 Or App 620, 625, 998 P2d 1286 (2000) (noting that ORS 656.245(l)(c) limits the disability compensation available to a medically stationary worker).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">For medical services of the type at issue here, that is, surgery for a condition that has worsened after a worker has become medically stationary, the medical benefit is available only through an accepted aggravation claim under ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>656.273 or an order of the board issued pursuant to its own-motion authority under ORS 656.278 if the worker\u2019s aggravation rights under ORS 656.273 have expired. ORS 656.245(l)(c)(F), (G).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under ORS 656.273, an injured worker may obtain additional medical services <em>and </em>disability compensation for a worsened condition by filing an aggravation claim with the insurer or self-insured employer within five years of the notice of closure or, alternatively, the date of injury in certain circumstances. ORS 656.273(1) - (4). However, ORS 656.273(1) establishes that a worsened condition is not compensable if the major contributing cause of the worsened condition is an injury that occurred outside the course and scope of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">As discussed above, the board reasoned that the 2004 CDA foreclosed claimant\u2019s ability to pursue an aggravation claim under ORS 656.273 and, thus, that the affirmative defense set out in ORS 656.273(1) does not apply to this case. However, a CDA cannot release a worker\u2019s right to medical services, and surgery of the type at issue here is a medical service that a worker whose compensable condition has become medically stationary can receive pursuant to an accepted aggravation claim under ORS 656.273.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>resolved the conundrum that its reasoning <em>created </em>\u2014 viz., that the 2004 CDA prevents claimant from filing an aggravation claim, but a CDA cannot release a worker\u2019s right to receive medical services and the medical services at issue here are medical services that a worker is entitled to receive pursuant to an accepted aggravation claim- \u2014 by concluding that claimant must thereby be entitled to pursue a claim for medical services for his recurrent L4-5 disc herniation pursuant to ORS 656.245(l)(a), which generally provides that workers are entitled to receive medical services for conditions that are materially caused by a work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">We reject the board\u2019s reasoning for two reasons. First, it would lead to the paradoxical effect that workers who enter into a CDA would receive a broader range of medical services than those who do not enter into one. A worker in claimant\u2019s circumstances who has not entered into a CDA would be required to have an accepted claim for aggravation in order to be entitled to receive the medical services at issue here. That means that the claim would have to meet the causation standard for a worsened condition and be subject to the affirmative defense under ORS 656.273(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to the board\u2019s analysis, however, a worker who has entered into a CDA would not be required to meet the standards set forth in ORS 656.273 in order to receive the same medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Second, and most importantly, the board fails to confront the fact that a worker whose condition has become medically stationary is not entitled to receive medical services of the type at issue here <em>except </em>by establishing an aggravation claim. ORS 656.245(l)(c)(F). As explained above, workers cannot release their right to medical services through a CDA. ORS 656.236(1); <em>Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., Inc., </em>347 Or at 694. Accordingly, the 2004 CDA did not release claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>right to receive medical services, including the surgery proposed here to address claimant\u2019s recurrent L4-5 disc herniation. However, to exercise that right, a worker in claimant\u2019s circumstance must pursue an aggravation claim pursuant to ORS 656.273. <em>See </em>ORS 656.245(l)(c)(F). It follows that claimant is entitled to pursue such a claim in order to receive the medical services notwithstanding the 2004 CDA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The board erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Employer asserts in its second assignment of error that the board erred in concluding that, if the affirmative defense under ORS 656.273(1) applies, then employer failed to prove that defense. As previously discussed, the board found that \u201cthe employer has not sustained its burden of proving [under ORS 656.273(1)] that \u2018the major contributing cause of the worsened condition is an injury not occurring within the course and scope of employment[.]\u2019 \u201d The board further explained, \u201cIn that regard, we agree with the ALJ\u2019s finding that the June 26, 2003 work injury was the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s need for treatment of the recurrent L4-5 disc herniation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Employer contends that the board erred in relying on the ALJ\u2019s finding regarding the major contributing cause of \u201cclaimant\u2019s <em>need for </em>treatment\u201d to resolve whether employer had met its burden to prove the \u201cmajor contributing cause of the <em>worsened </em>condition,\u201d because those are not the same thing, that is, they involve different compensability standards. (Underlining omitted; emphases added.) Additionally, employer asserts that the board\u2019s conclusion is not supported by substantial reason because the board never explained how a \u201cfailure to satisfy one standard (major cause of the need for treatment) equated to a failure to satisfy the other standard (major cause of the worsened condition).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>In some cases, the nature of the treatment and the condition may result in the major cause of one being synonymous with the other. <em>See, e.g., Robinson v. SAIF, 147 </em>Or App 157, 162, 935 P2d 454 (1997) (noting that, in that case, there was no difference between the major contributing cause of the claimant\u2019s hernia and the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the hernia); <em>SAIF v. Nehl, </em>149 Or App 309, 313, 942 P2d 859 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>326 Or 389 (1998) (\u201cIn <em>Robinson, </em>we did not need to distinguish between the major cause of claimant\u2019s combined condition and the major cause of claimant\u2019s need for treatment, because they were the same.\u201d). We need not decide whether that is the case here because of our resolution of the third assignment, in which we remand the case to the board for reconsideration. On reconsideration, the board will be able to address employer\u2019s objections to the board\u2019s finding that employer had not carried its burden under ORS 656.273(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">In employer\u2019s third assignment of error, it argues that the board committed legal error in analyzing whether claimant has a preexisting condition and, in turn, a combined condition. As a consequence of that, employer asserts, the board\u2019s rejection of the major contributing cause standard for the compensability of claimant\u2019s surgery is also flawed. In particular, employer argues that, \u201c[ujnder ORS 656.005(24)(a)(B)(iii), the term \u2018preexisting condition\u2019 in \u2018claims for worsening pursuant to ORS 656.273\u2019 includes a qualifying condition that \u2018precedes the onset of the worsened condition.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, employer asserts that, because claimant was diagnosed with \u201cdegenerative disc disease\u201d at the L4-5 level\u201d in September 2003 \u2014 that is, after his initial injury but before the current worsening \u2014 the board erred in concluding that the claim did not involve a preexisting condition. As the following discussion explains, we conclude that the board erred by failing to apply ORS 656.005(24)(a)(B)(iii) in resolving whether claimant has a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">As previously discussed, an injured worker is generally entitled under ORS 656.273 to additional medical services for worsened conditions resulting from the original injury. Concomitantly, once a worsened condition has been established, the worker\u2019s injury is necessarily no longer medically stationary and the worker is once again entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>broader suite of medical services available under ORS 656.245(l)(a) for conditions caused in material part by the original compensable injury. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(17) (a worker\u2019s injury is medically stationary when \u201cno further material improvement would reasonably be expected from medical treatment, or the passage of time\u201d). However, ORS 656.245(l)(a) also provides that, \u201cfor consequential and combined conditions described in ORS 656.005(7), the insurer or the self-insured employer shall cause to be provided only those medical services directed to medical conditions caused in major part by the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) provides, in turn, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">\u201c[i]f an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the combined condition is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Further, ORS 656.005(24)(a) defines \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d to include an injury or disease that contributes to disability or need for treatment, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">\u201c(A) * * * the worker has been diagnosed with such condition, or has obtained medical services for the symptoms of the condition regardless of diagnosis; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">\u201c(B)(i) In claims for an initial injury or omitted condition, the diagnosis or treatment precedes the initial injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">\u201c(ii) In claims for a new medical condition, the diagnosis or treatment precedes the onset of the new medical condition; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-10\">\u201c(iii) In claims for a worsening pursuant to ORS 656.273 or 656.278, <em>the diagnosis or treatment precedes the onset of the worsened condition.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">The board concluded that ORS 656.005(24)(a)(B)(iii) does not apply to this case based on its conclusion that \u201cthis is <em>not </em>a claim \u2018for a worsening pursuant to ORS 656.273.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) As explained above, the board erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>in concluding that ORS 656.273 does not apply to claimant\u2019s claim for medical services for his worsened condition. It follows that it also erred in failing to apply ORS 656.005(24)(a)(B)(iii) to the claim. Hence, the board must address the application of that statute to this case on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\"> The insurer\u2019s notice of acceptance identified the accepted condition as a right-side herniation, but that appears to have been a clerical error.
