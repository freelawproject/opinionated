On appeal, he assigns as error the denial of his motion to continue the trial of the above charges. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Defendant was indicted on the above charges on July 27, 2007, in Washington County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant retained counsel to represent him with regard to the charges and appeared on September 12,2007, at which time he pleaded not guilty. After a pretrial conference was held on September 24, the court set trial on the indictment for November 14, 2007. On November 7, 2007, defendant moved for a continuance of the November 14 trial date on the ground that defense counsel was not prepared to proceed at that time. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, but did not immediately reschedule the case for trial. On February 11,2008, the court rescheduled trial to commence on May 20, 2008. However, defendant\u2019s retained counsel moved to withdraw as his attorney on May 6, 2008, and the court allowed counsel to withdraw on May 16. At the same time, the court also rescheduled trial for July 15,2008, and set a pretrial conference for July 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On May 20, 2008, a different attorney notified the court that he would be representing defendant on the charges. On May 28, 2008, that attorney moved for a continuance of the July 15 trial date on the ground that the date conflicted with the trial of an older case that he was trying in another county. The motion was heard on the same date by the court; the court denied the motion but suggested that it would be willing to reconsider the motion in the event that counsel and the prosecutor could come up with dates \u201cthat are agreeable to everybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>On June 10, 2008, defendant again moved for a continuance of the July 15 trial date, based on the conflict with the case in the other county. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion on June 12, 2008. Defense counsel then withdrew as counsel of record on June 24, 2008.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Defendant appeared for trial on July 15 without counsel. The court inquired of defendant after learning from the prosecutor that defendant desired a continuance of the trial date in order to retain new counsel. Defendant explained to the court that his first attorney resigned due to a dispute about the amount of fees being charged. According to defendant, that attorney was \u201cdouble charging me for trial,\u201d and there was \u201c$3,800 worth of discrepancies\u201d in the charges. Defendant had retained his new counsel on the Monday after his initial counsel was allowed to withdraw by court order. According to defendant, his new lawyer told him that \u201con the 15th[,] I can\u2019t do it, but there should be no reason for why we can\u2019t get a postponement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Defendant explained that he was present at the hearing on his new counsel\u2019s motion to continue the July 15 trial date when the court denied his motion to continue the trial but indicated that it was willing to consider rescheduling the trial date if the parties could agree on a new date. Defendant stated to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know what happened with [defense counsel] contacting everybody to come up with a new date. I\u2019m not really sure on that. He said that he tried, but there was no debate. There was no \u2014 there was no leniency on a postponement. He tried again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Defendant recounted that, approximately a week later, he was told by his new counsel that counsel \u201cwas going to have to file a motion to withdraw because there is no way he can make it here without being \u2014 you know, because of his prior client.\u201d However, defendant claimed that, unlike when his first attorney had withdrawn, he had received \u201cno paperwork\u201d in the mail notifying him that his counsel had withdrawn as a matter of record until the Friday before his trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Defendant ended his explanation of his circumstances to the court with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">\u201cSo I had no idea that my attorney was able to withdraw until Friday and then being the weekend and then tomorrow \u2014 you know, yesterday was Monday. I live in Central Oregon. I had to come in here. I haven\u2019t had time to even try to get another attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201cAnd from what I\u2019m understanding from my first \u2014 I mean, my second attorney, nobody\u2019s going to touch this case with \u2014 with only three or four days to prepare. There\u2019s over a thousand \u2014 from what I\u2019m understanding \u2014 there\u2019s over a thousand pages of discovery, and I don\u2019t even have all the discovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to continue the July 15 trial date so that he could obtain new counsel, and defendant proceeded to trial without counsel, resulting in the convictions that are on appeal. The court ruled that \u201cthe State would be prejudiced by a reset.\u201d The court explained that this was the third trial setting, which provided the opportunity for what the court characterized as \u201cwitness fatigue.\u201d The court amplified its explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cI like that term, because that\u2019s what happens when people, basically, are at a point where they are decided maybe that they just won\u2019t show up the next time and that\u2019s how they will state their dissatisfaction. So, I think it does end up with a prejudice to the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">As to defendant\u2019s circumstances, the court pointed out that defendant knew on June 24 from a conversation with his second counsel that that counsel was withdrawing and had been unable to obtain a continuance of the July 15 trial date. It concluded that, under the circumstances, defendant should have anticipated the need to retain new counsel and not waited until receiving formal notice of his counsel\u2019s withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">On appeal, defendant argues that the court exceeded its discretion when it denied his motion to continue the trial. He points out that the state offered no evidence that any witnesses would become unavailable if the trial were delayed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>In his view, the court erroneously required him to predict a ruling on his new counsel\u2019s second motion to withdraw when he was reasonably entitled to written notice that withdrawal had been permitted by the court. Defendant concludes that he was \u201ccaught in a situation not of his own making, [and] was forced to [bear] the consequences of two competing trial courts who could not agree to accommodate each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The state disagrees. In its view,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\u201cthe record revealls] that defendant had known at least two months before the scheduled trial date that the court was unwilling to reset the date to accommodate defendant\u2019s then-attorney\u2019s schedule. Moreover, at least three weeks before the scheduled trial date, the court again ruled that it would not reset the trial date and defendant\u2019s then-attorney told defendant that he would have to withdraw as counsel for defendant because he would be unavailable for trial. Even though defendant knew he had a \u2018set in stone\u2019 trial date at which his attorney would not be available, he failed to act upon that knowledge at that time and procure new representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In deciding the issue framed by the parties, we consider first the proper standard of review to be applied to the analysis. A motion for a continuance of a trial date is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court will only reverse such a ruling in the event that the court has exceeded the boundaries that define its discretion. <em>State v. Wolfer, </em>241 Or 15, 17, 403 P2d 715 (1965). That standard expresses deference by a reviewing court to a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion of continuance because of the familiarity of the trial court with all of the circumstances surrounding the making of such a motion and the consequences of granting it. The Oregon Supreme Court has since explained that the term \u201cdiscretion\u201d refers to the authority of a trial court to choose among several legally correct outcomes. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (applying the term \u201cdiscretion\u201d to rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence). A court exceeds its discretion only when its ruling is outside the purview of permissible legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>choices. For example, in <em>State v. Hug, </em>186 Or App 569, 572-73, 64 P3d 1173, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 510 (2003), we applied the <em>Rogers </em>definition of \u201cdiscretion\u201d and affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for continuance, concluding that the trial court\u2019s ruling might not have been the only legally correct choice but, regardless, we could not properly substitute our judgment for that of the trial court simply because we might have resolved the issue differently. 186 Or App at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Thus, we implicitly recognized in <em>Hug </em>that, in the abstract, there may be some cases in which either the denial or the allowance of a motion for continuance is a permissible legal choice. We summarized in <em>Hug </em>the test as to whether a court\u2019s ruling on a motion for continuance is a permissible legal choice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u201cWhen assessing a request for continuance to obtain new counsel, a trial court must balance a defendant\u2019s right to choice of counsel against the need of the public and of all defendants for expedition in the court system. <em>State v. Pflieger, </em>15 Or App 383, 387, 515 P2d 1348 (1973), <em>rev den </em>(1974); <em>see also State v. Lingren, </em>79 Or App 324, 327, 719 P2d 61 (1986) (right to counsel must be balanced against the state\u2019s need to conclude the case in a timely manner). As the United States Supreme Court has stated, \u2018There are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.\u2019 <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 US 575, 589, 84 S Ct 841, 11 L Ed 2d 921 (1964).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">186 Or App at 572-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">We turn to the circumstances of this case and apply the above test. Although we are sensitive to the needs of witnesses whose lives could be significantly disrupted by repetitive appearances in court, the record before us lacks any factual information that there would have been witnesses who would have been unavailable to the state if the continuance had been granted. 'Witness fatigue\u201d under some circumstances may be a proper consideration, but ultimately the test contemplates whether the state\u2019s need to conclude the case in a timely manner is affected. In this case, the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>based only on counsel\u2019s generalization, was insufficient for the trial court to have concluded that the state would have been prejudiced by a grant of defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">On the other hand, the effect on defendant in requiring him to go to trial without counsel was significant. If convicted, defendant faced the potential of a substantial deprivation of his liberty. Moreover, the case was a complex case involving multiple charges and a codefendant. Indeed, defendant\u2019s trial to the jury occurred over a four-day period and involved a large quantity of evidence. Finally, a continuance of the trial of this case would not have involved an inordinate delay; approximately 12 months had expired at the time of trial since defendant had been reindicted. On balance, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, defendant\u2019s right to counsel at trial outweighed the public\u2019s interest in concluding the case on the dates set for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\"> Defendant was previously indicted on March 8, 2007, with trial on that indictment set for July 27, 2007. The state moved to dismiss that charge and reindicted defendant simultaneously.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\"> The court may not have received counsel\u2019s notice until June 30, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\"> During argument to the court, the prosecutor stated, \u201c[T]here are certain witnesses in this case who are starting to experience what I would refer to as witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>fatigue. They\u2019re simply \u2014 they\u2019re civilian witnesses and they\u2019re just tired of being subpoenaed, making themselves available, having the case reset time and time again.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
