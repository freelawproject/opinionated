J.</author>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Petitioners seek review of a Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) decision regarding the City of Newberg\u2019s Economic Opportunities Analysis (EOA), a part of its comprehensive plan. Newberg originally adopted an EOA in January 2006. In February 2010, the city council passed, over petitioners\u2019 opposition, an ordinance adopting a revised and updated EOA. Petitioners appealed to LUBA, advancing six assignments of error. LUBA rejected some of those assignments but sustained others, resulting in a remand of the ordinance. Petitioners now seek review in this court of the assignments that LUBA rejected. We affirm, and write to address only one of those assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">One function of an EOA is to allow local governments to \u201ccompare the demand for land for industrial and other employment uses to the existing supply of such land,\u201d OAR 660-009-0015, in order to provide a reasoned basis for planning, OAR 660-009-0000. To accomplish that comparison, a city\u2019s EOA must (1) identify types of industrial or other \u201cemployment uses\u201d that, based on trends, are projected to locate or expand in the city, and (2) specify the number of sites that are needed to accommodate such uses. OAR 660-009-0015. The dispute in this case involves the parties\u2019 differing interpretations of the rule for classifying sites. That rule provides that the EOA \u201cmust identify the number of sites by type reasonably expected to be needed to accommodate the expected employment growth based on the <em>site characteristics typical of expected uses.\u201d </em>OAR 660-009-0015(2) (emphasis added). Thus, for example, if a city projects that 10 warehouses will be needed to accommodate projected job growth, the EOA will specify that it projects the need for 10 sites that have \u201csite characteristics\u201d that are \u201ctypical of\u2019 warehouses (for example, large size, access to major highways, etc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Complicating matters, however, OAR 660-009-0005(11) provides that \u201csite characteristics\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">\u201cmeans the attributes of a site <em>necessary </em>for a particular industrial or other employment use to operate. Site characteristics include, but are not limited to, a minimum acreage or site configuration including shape and topography, visibility, specific types or levels of public facilities, services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>or energy infrastructure, or proximity to a particular transportation or freight facility such as rail, marine ports and airports, multimodal freight or transshipment facilities, and major transportation routes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, while OAR 660-009-0015(2) refers to site characteristics that are \u201ctypical of\u2019 certain uses, OAR 660-009-0005(11) provides that a site characteristic is a characteristic that is <em>necessary </em>for such uses. Therein lies the dispute. As petitioner explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">\u201c \u2018Site characteristics\u2019 are important because they define what existing urban land can be used to accommodate economic growth. If a site characteristic such as minimum acreage is defined broadly \u2014 for example if one assumes that an industry needs 50-acre contiguous parcels \u2014 existing urban land is less likely to suffice, and the EOA will suggest expanding the Urban Growth Boundary to urbanize more farmland. If, on the other hand, site characteristics are defined narrowly, to include only what an industry actually needs in order to operate, existing urban lands are more likely to accommodate that development.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">To illustrate, presume that a warehouse <em>absolutely cannot exist </em>unless it is on a site that is at least two acres, yet, <em>typically, </em>warehouses not only need two acres, but they also need level ground and access to major highways. It is more likely that qualifying sites are available within the Urban Growth Boundary if the only criterion for such sites is that they contain two acres, than it is if the criteria also include level ground and access to major highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Petitioners therefore focus on the word \u201cnecessary.\u201d They argued before the Newberg city council, and then to LUBA, that, under the ordinary definition of the word \u201cnecessary,\u201d a site characteristic must be something \u201cthat cannot be done without\u201d or that \u201cmust be had\u201d in order for an industrial or other employment use to operate. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1511 (unabridged ed 2002). The city, however, argued that it could adopt as site characteristics those attributes that would give the city a competitive advantage with respect to attracting industrial and employment uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>LUBA rejected both petitioners\u2019 and the city\u2019s respective interpretations of the term \u201csite characteristics.\u201d LUBA explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">\u201cApplying [the ordinary methodology for interpreting administrative rules] here, the text of OAR 660-009-0005(11) itself suggests [the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC)] did not intend that a site characteristic must be an attribute that cannot be done without or an attribute that must be had. OAR 660-009-0005(11) includes a non-exclusive list of examples. Given a properly motivated developer, it is hard to see how a specific site \u2018shape\u2019 or \u2018visibility\u2019 could ever be an attribute that could not be done without. Perhaps more importantly, both petitioners and the city ignore the language in OAR 660-009-0015(2), quoted above, which is the rule that actually requires the city to identify sites based on site characteristics. OAR 660-009-0015(2) directs that identification of needed sites is to be \u2018based on the site characteristics <em>typical </em>of expected uses.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) The choice of the word \u2018typical\u2019 in OAR 660-009-0015(2) strongly suggests that LCDC intended the word \u2018necessary\u2019 in OAR 660-009-0005(11) to mean something other than \u2018cannot be done without.\u2019 While \u2018typical\u2019 attributes would presumably include those attributes that are absolutely necessary to construct and operate a business, \u2018typical\u2019 attributes would also likely include those attributes that while not \u2018necessary,\u2019 in the dictionary sense of the word, are nevertheless typically required for a business to operate successfully.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">LUBA continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">\u201cIf the words \u2018attributes of a site necessary for a particular industrial or other employment use to operate,\u2019 in the definition of\u2018site characteristics\u2019 are viewed in context with the language of 660-009-0015(2), we believe that site characteristics are properly viewed as attributes that are <em>(1) typical of the industrial or employment use and (2) have some meaningful connection with the operation of the industrial or employment use. If the record demonstrates that an attribute is both typical and has some meaningful connection with the operational requirements of the industrial or employment use, we believe OAR 660-009-0005(11) and 660-009-0015(2) would permit the city to list it as a site characteristic. </em>OA(R 660-009-0005(11) and 660-009-0015(2) do not require that the city go further, as petitioners argue, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>demonstrate that the site characteristic is essential, in the sense it would not be possible to construct or operate the industrial or employment use without the attribute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">LUBA then considered the revised EOA in light of that understanding of the administrative rules and determined that the \u201cshort findings and the material in the record cited by the city are simply not sufficient to establish that the [challenged] siting standards * * * are \u2018typical\u2019 of the industries the city seeks to attract. Additional findings and perhaps additional evidence will be required to make that demonstration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Petitioners are not satisfied with LUBA\u2019s remand to the city. In their petition for judicial review, they contend that LUBA\u2019s test \u2014 that is, whether the site characteristic is \u201ctypical\u201d and has \u201csome meaningful connection\u201d to the use\u2014 effectively \u201creads the \u2018necessity\u2019 requirement out of the rule * * They further contend that there is no evidence in the record that the challenged site characteristics meet that more stringent standard (\u201ccannot be done without\u201d), and they urge us to send the case back to LUBA with instructions to reverse the city\u2019s decision!</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\"> We review LUBA\u2019s decision \u2014 more specifically, its construction of the administrative rule at issue, OAR 660-009-0005(11) \u2014 to determine whether the decision is \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a); <em>Stewart v. City of Salem, </em>231 Or App 356, 358, 219 P3d 46 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 415 (2010). Our objective is to determine the intent of LCDC, the body that promulgated the rule. <em>Wetherell v. Douglas County, </em>235 Or App 246, 256, 230 P3d 976, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 57 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Papineau, </em>228 Or App 308, 311, 208 P3d 500, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 590 (2009)). In making that determination, we use the same methodology used to interpret a statute, starting with an examination of the text of the rule in context. <em>Wetherell, </em>235 Or App at 256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Here, as set out above, the parties\u2019 dispute centers on the meaning of the term \u201cnecessary\u201d as it appears in the phrase \u201cattributes of a site necessary for a particular industrial or other employment use to operate * * OAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>660-009-0005(11). Petitioners urge us to use the <em>Webster\u2019s </em>dictionary definition, whereas the city defends LUBA\u2019s two-pronged \u201ctypical plus some meaningful connection\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Although \u201cnecessary\u201d is commonly used to denote something \u201cindispensable,\u201d the word has long proved more elastic in legal parlance. Nearly a century ago, in <em>State v. Young, </em>74 Or 399, 406, 145 P 647 (1915), the Oregon Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">\u201cThe word \u2018necessary must be construed in the connection in which it is used. It is a word susceptible of various meanings. It may import absolute physical necessity, or that which is only convenient or useful or essential: 5 Words and Phrases, p. 4705. The courts have many times construed the word \u2018necessary,\u2019 and it has almost universally been held to mean needful or convenient; especially is this the case where the word is used in conjunction with other and stronger terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Little has changed since <em>Young </em>to make the term \u201cnecessary,\u201d so far as it appears in statutes or administrative rules, any less ambiguous when read in isolation. As <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1029 (6th ed 1990) explains,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">\u201cThis word must be considered in the connection in which it is used, as it is a word susceptible of various meanings. It may import absolute physical necessity or inevitability, or it may import that which is only convenient, useful, appropriate, suitable, proper, or conducive to the end sought. It is an adjective expressing degrees, and may express mere convenience or that which is indispensable or an absolute physical necessity. <em>It may mean something which in the accomplishment of a given object cannot be dispensed with, or it may mean something reasonably useful and proper, and of greater or lesser benefit or convenience, and its force and meaning must be determined with relation to the particular object sought.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>(Emphasis added.) <em>See, e.g., 1000 Friends of Oregon v. LCDC (Lane Co.), </em>305 Or 384, 395, 752 P2d 271 (1988) (noting that \u201chistoric battles were fought over the meaning of \u2018necessary' in the United States Constitution\u201d) (citing <em>McCulloch v. Maryland, </em>17 US 316, 4 Wheat 316 (1819) (national bank could be considered \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d clause of Article I, section 8, of the United States Constitution)); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Rev. v.

We further believe that the meaning of the term \u2018reasonably necessary\u2019 is indicated with sufficient clarity by its context.\u201d); <em>In re Feehely\u2019s Estate, </em>182 Or 246, 256, 187 P2d 156 (1947) (\u201cLitigation is necessary, in the sense of the [statutory phrase \u201cnecessary litigation\u201d], if it is reasonable, useful and proper.\u201d); <em>Oregon Shores v. Oregon Fish and Wildlife, </em>62 Or App 481, 490-91, 662 P2d 356, <em>rev den, </em>295 Or 259 (1983) (holding that the term \u201cnecessary\u201d expresses \u201cnon-completed legislation\u201d that could be interpreted as \u201creasonably necessary\u201d rather than \u201cindispensable\u201d); <em>cf.

For purposes of Division 9, LCDC defines \u201csuitable\u201d to mean \u201cserviceable land designated for industrial or other employment use that provides, or can be expected to provide the appropriate site characteristics for the proposed use.\u201d OAR 660-009-0005(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>In that statutory and regulatory context, we agree with LUBA that \u201csite characteristics\u201d need not be \u201cindispensable\u201d to a particular use in order to be \u201cnecessary for a particular industrial or other employment use to operate.\u201d The intent of Division 9 is to ensure that there is an \u201cadequate supply of land for economic development and employment growth in Oregon,\u201d OAR 660-009-0000, which is vital to the health, welfare, and prosperity of the state. <em>See </em>ORS 197.712(1) (finding and declaring that \u201cthe provision of adequate opportunities for a variety of economic activities throughout the state is vital to the health, welfare and prosperity of all the people of the state\u201d). That overriding intent to allow and plan for anticipated economic growth \u2014 in part, through the identification of \u201csite characteristics\u201d that make the land \u201csuitable\u201d to meet the needs of anticipated growth\u2014 suggests something other than petitioners\u2019 strict \u201cindispensability\u201d test that would take into consideration only those \u201csite characteristics\u201d without which particular industry and employment uses could not operate. Rather, the planning scheme (based on projections and economic trends) suggests, as LUBA adopted, a more pragmatic approach toward accommodating economic growth: That \u201cnecessary\u201d site characteristics are those attributes that are reasonably necessary to the successful operation of particular industrial or employment uses, in the sense that they bear some important relationship to that operation. In our view, LUBA\u2019s formulation of the relevant inquiry adequately captures the concept of reasonable necessity that is embodied in the rule. Accordingly, we conclude that LUBA did not err in rejecting petitioners\u2019 proffered dictionary definition of the term \u201cnecessary,\u201d given the context in which that term appears.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">As noted above, LUBA articulated the relevant \u201csite characteristic\u201d test as involving two prongs: (1) that the attribute be \u201ctypical of the industrial or employment use\u201d and (2) that it have \u201csome meaningful connection with the operation of the industrial or employment use.\u201d The first of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>prongs, that the attributes be \u201ctypical,\u201d appears expressly in OAR 660-009-0015(2), which refers to \u201csite characteristics typical of expected uses.\u201d Petitioners do not challenge that aspect of LUBA\u2019s remand, and we do not discuss it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\"> Indeed, later editions of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>have abandoned any effort to offer a singular definition of the word \u201cnecessary,\u201d instead defining it only with respect to particular terms or phrases in which it is used. <em>See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1130 (9th ed 2009) (separately defining terms such as \u201cnecessary and proper,\u201d \u201cnecessary damages,\u201d \u201cnecessary deposit,\u201d \u201cnecessary diligence,\u201d \u201cnecessary inference,\u201d \u201cnecessary party,\u201d and \u201cnecessary repair\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-5\"> Indeed, as LUBA pointed out, the second sentence of the definition of \u201csite characteristics\u201d includes \u201cshape\u201d and \u201cvisibility,\u201d OAR 660-009-0005(11), attributes that, although important to industrial and employment uses, would not normally be considered \u201cindispensable\u201d \u2014 further contextual support that cuts against petitioners\u2019 dictionary definition of the term \u201cnecessary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
