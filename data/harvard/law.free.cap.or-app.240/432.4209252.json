Defendant argues that the sentence violates ORS 161.605, which provides that the \u201cmaximum term of an indeterminate sentence,\u201d combining incarceration and post-prison supervision, for a Class C felony \u2014 such as public indecency, ORS 163.465(2)(b)\u2014is 60 months. <em>See State v. Mitchell, </em>236 Or App 248, 253, 235 P3d 725 (2010). Although defendant admits that his assignment of error is unpreserved, he argues that the circumstances in this case are similar to those in <em>Mitchell, </em>that the error is apparent on the face of the record, and that for the reasons discussed in <em>Mitchell, id. </em>at 251-56, we should exercise our discretion to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The state concedes that the sentence was unlawful, but argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment was erroneous only because it violated OAR 213-005-0002(2)(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides that the post-prison supervision for a category 6 crime, like defendant\u2019s, shall be two years. Furthermore, OAR 213-005-0002(1) states that \u201c[departures on the duration of post-prison supervision shall not be allowed.\u201d According to the state, combining the 36 months of incarceration imposed and the 24 months of post-prison supervision allowed under the rules, defendant\u2019s sentence would be within the 60-month maximum term. For that reason, the state argues that we need not remand for resentencing, but instead, should remand with instructions to amend the judgment to impose only a two-year term of post-prison supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We agree with defendant that the trial court committed plain error for the reasons discussed in <em>Mitchell, </em>and that remand for resentencing is necessary. Contrary to the state\u2019s characterization, defendant\u2019s assignment of error clearly challenges the entire sentence, not simply the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>of post-prison supervision. Although the state is correct that the trial court is required under OAR 213-005-0002(2)(a) to impose two years of post-prison supervision, the court is not required, when considering the statutory maximum under ORS 161.605, to impose the same 36 months of incarceration on remand.
