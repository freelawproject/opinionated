ORS 426.130. At the commitment hearing, the court indicated that \u201cthere is clear and convincing evidence in my mind that [appellant] will not soon be able to safely survive by meeting her basic needs if she is discharged.\u201d On appeal, we review the record to determine whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination. A discussion of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. The state concedes that the evidence in the record is legally insufficient to support the court\u2019s determination. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
