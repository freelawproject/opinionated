Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009). Although defendant did object to the admission of the diagnosis as scientific evidence, it is unclear that his objection was sufficient to preserve his current argument that admission of the diagnosis was improper pursuant to <em>Southard. </em>However, the trial court\u2019s error in admitting that evidence is plain error and, for the reasons set forth in <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 522, 228 P3d 666 (2010), and <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 513-14, 228 P3d 688 (2010), we exercise our discretion to correct that error. In light of our resolution of that issue, we do not reach defendant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
