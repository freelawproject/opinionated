J.</author>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Husband appeals from a dissolution judgment, raising three assignments of error. Specifically, husband challenges: (1) the amount and duration of the award of spousal support to wife; (2) the trial court\u2019s valuation of husband\u2019s chiropractic business; and (3) the court\u2019s allocation of a tax liability to husband. We reject husband\u2019s first and third assignments of error without discussion and write only to address the second assignment, pertaining to the valuation of husband\u2019s business. As amplified below, we conclude that the trial court erred in adopting a valuation of husband\u2019s chiropractic business that was predicated on the assumption that husband would execute a noncompetition covenant. Accordingly, we remand with instructions for the trial court to modify the judgment with respect to the property division but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Although we review <em>de novo,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>many of the facts material to our review are undisputed. The parties were married in 1990, and, at the time of the dissolution, in 2007, husband was 38 and wife was 40. The couple had four children, ages 15, 13, 5, and 3. Wife has not worked outside the home since graduating from college in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Husband is the owner of a very successful chiropractic business in Prineville, Paul J. Slater, DC, PC, dba Slater Chiropractic, which is organized as an S corporation. Husband purchased the business in 1996 for $157,500, which included payments of $37,000 for goodwill and the previous owner\u2019s patient list and another $75,000 for the previous owner\u2019s execution of a noncompetition covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In 2001, Slater Chiropractic generated $446,367 in revenue, which thereafter increased every year to $633,536 in revenue in 2006. The revenues from Slater Chiropractic are substantially above the national average for chiropractic offices, which is less than $250,000 annually. In 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>husband\u2019s gross income from Slater Chiropractic was approximately $25,000 a month. However, a short time before trial, husband underwent back surgery and was expected to be in recovery and unable to work for three to six months. Husband had written a letter to his patients encouraging them to seek treatment from an employee associate chiropractor, Dr. Miller, in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">About 60 percent of Slater Chiropractic\u2019s business comes through insurance, including husband\u2019s contract as a \u201cpreferred provider\u201d with a health insurance company that covers local government employees. Slater Chiropractic also attracts business through word-of-mouth, referrals, and by advertising in the Yellow Pages. Husband, through Slater Chiropractic, is also actively engaged in the Prineville community, and wife contributed to that involvement during their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Slater Chiropractic employs a receptionist, three chiropractic assistants, and, since 2006, the associate chiropractor, Miller. As part of his employment agreement, Miller executed a noncompetition covenant with Slater Chiropractic for five years. Husband, in contrast, does not work under an employment contract with Slater Chiropractic and has not entered into a noncompetition covenant with the business. Husband testified that he \u201cplants] to work in the chiropractic profession in Prineville until I retire\u201d and that, were he to sell his practice \u201cat [his] current stage of life,\u201d he would \u201c[absolutely\u201d refuse to enter into such a covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">At trial, two experts testified as to the value of Slater Chiropractic. Wife\u2019s expert, Svendsen, used two methods to estimate the fair market value of Slater Chiropractic \u2014 the capitalization of earnings approach and the capitalization of excess earnings approach \u2014 both of which valued the tangible (such as equipment) and intangible (such as client files and goodwill) assets of the business. He then averaged the resulting values from those two methods to reach a final, estimated fair market value of $610,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Husband\u2019s expert, Holmer, used four methods to value Slater Chiropractic. The first, the adjusted book value approach, valued the net tangible assets of Slater Chiropractic but not its intangible assets, including goodwill value. Pursuant to that method, husband\u2019s expert concluded that the fair market value of Slater Chiropractic\u2019s net tangible assets was $200,422. Husband\u2019s expert relied on three other valuation methods, <em>viz., </em>the capitalization of earnings approach and capitalization of excess earnings approach \u2014 which both take into account the tangible and intangible assets of a business \u2014 and the comparable transaction approach, which relied in part on a separate expert\u2019s appraisal of the intangible asset value of Slater Chiropractic, to reach a composite, total fair market value for Slater Chiropractic of $504,152.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Both experts agreed that Slater Chiropractic has goodwill, <em>i.e., </em>some value above the value of its net tangible assets, but disagreed as to whether, or to what extent, that added value should be characterized as \u201centity goodwill,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>goodwill attributable to the business, or \u201cpersonal goodwill,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>goodwill attributable to husband individually.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wife\u2019s expert did not explicitly identify in his appraisal what part of Slater Chiropractic\u2019s total value was attributable to goodwill. However, he did testify that that amount could be calculated simply by deducting the net tangible assets of Slater Chiropractic (which he valued at $160,902) from his estimated fair market value of $610,000, yielding a total goodwill value of $449,098.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wife\u2019s expert fiirther testified that he believed that <em>all </em>of Slater Chiropractic\u2019s goodwill was attributable to the business \u2014 and that <em>none </em>of that goodwill was \u201cpersonal goodwill on behalf of Dr. Slater[.]\u201d Given that testimony, wife argued that \u201cSlater Chiropractic is a business that is independent of Husband\u2019s efforts\u201d and, as such, that its goodwill value should be characterized as \u201centity goodwill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Conversely, husband presented evidence that the value of Slater Chiropractic\u2019s goodwill was $303,730.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Husband\u2019s expert further determined that 10 percent of that goodwill value ($30,373), based on the percentage of collected revenues, was attributable to Miller\u2019s practice and that the balance of the goodwill, $273,357, was attributable to the \u201congoing personal services of husband.\u201d Because Miller was an employee and had entered into a noncompetition covenant, husband\u2019s expert determined that the value of Miller\u2019s goodwill was properly included as an asset of the business. However, in the expert\u2019s view, the goodwill attributable to husband individually was not properly considered a business asset. Accordingly, in husband\u2019s view, for purposes of dissolution, the total value of the chiropractic business was $230,795, i.e., $504,152 minus $273,357.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Related to their disagreement as to whether goodwill was predominately or entirely a business asset of Slater Chiropractic or was personal to husband, husband and wife also disagreed about whether it was proper when valuing the business to assume that husband would execute a noncom-petition covenant. Both experts agreed that, if husband were to sell his practice, it would be necessary for him to enter into such an agreement. Wife\u2019s expert testified that, because a noncompetition covenant would be required at the time of sale, it was proper to include the value of such a covenant in calculating the fair market value of the business. Consistently with that premise, wife did not present evidence specifying how much of the intangible asset value in Slater Chiropractic would be assignable to a hypothetical noncom-petition covenant. However, wife\u2019s expert did testify that, if Slater Chiropractic were sold without a noncompetition covenant binding husband, the business would be valued at less than $610,000 because of the risk that the new owner would receive the net tangible asset value of the business but (with husband as a viable competitor) \u201cwould lose the revenue stream that should go along with it\u201d \u2014 and, in that event, its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>net asset value ($160,902) \u201cwould be a floor\u201d for that valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Husband countered that it was not proper, when valuing a business for purposes of calculating a property distribution at divorce, to include the value of a putative noncom-petition covenant because he had no intention to retire, change careers, or sell his business. In husband\u2019s view, the assumption that he would execute a noncompetition covenant \u201cconstitutes [a] taking of his post-divorce income,\u201d which is separate nonmarital property, in order to enhance the value of the property divided at the time of the divorce.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, according to husband, the value of such a hypothetical covenant corresponds to the value of the goodwill \u201cpersonal\u201d to husband, <em>i.e., </em>$273,357. Accordingly, husband contended that the proper value of Slater Chiropractic was <em>$230,795 </em>\u2014 viz., the total value of the business (including the goodwill related to Miller\u2019s practice), $504,152, minus the value of the putative noncompetition covenant binding husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">During closing arguments before the trial court, wife and husband defended the methodologies their respective experts employed in valuing Slater Chiropractic \u2014 and, especially, as relevant here, took issue with the other\u2019s treatment of goodwill value, particularly with respect to the value of the putative noncompetition covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The trial court ultimately valued Slater Chiropractic at $500,000, which included the value of the business\u2019s net tangible assets and its goodwill value, assuming the execution of a noncompetition covenant. The trial court explained that, although \u201cthere is no indication that [husband] has any intention of selling the business, I have no doubt that if he were[,] the value of $500,000 would be a fair and reasonable asking price.\u201d The trial court further observed that, although Oregon appellate courts have yet to rule on the issue of whether the value of a putative noncompetition covenant is cognizable as a component of goodwill in valuing a business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>for the purposes of the property division in a marital dissolution, \u201cgoodwill is more than the value of a covenant not to compete.\u201d In that regard, the trial court noted that at least some of the goodwill value in Slater Chiropractic was attributable to husband\u2019s active involvement in the community, which was made possible, at least in part, by wife\u2019s efforts. Based in part on its valuation of Slater Chiropractic, the trial court awarded wife an \u201coffsetting judgment\u201d of $78,524.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">On appeal, the parties generally reprise the arguments they made before the trial court. On <em>de novo </em>review, we agree with husband that the trial court erred in predicating its valuation of the business \u2014 and, particularly, its goodwill \u2014 on the assumption that husband would execute a non-competition covenant. Accordingly, as explained below, we remand with instructions for the trial court to modify the property division.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">At the outset, it is essential to define the content of some predicate terms, including, especially, the meaning of \u201cgoodwill\u201d \u2014 a concept of chameleon capability. Our cases have generally defined \u201cgoodwill\u201d to mean the value of a business \u201cover and above the value of its assets.\u201d <em>Maxwell and Maxwell, </em>128 Or App 565, 568, 876 P2d 811 (1994). <em>See also, e.g., Weakley and Weakley, </em>177 Or App 363, 368, 33 P3d 1045 (2001); <em>Adams and Adams, </em>121 Or App 187, 190, 854 P2d 501 (1993); <em>Goger and Goger, </em>27 Or App 729, 732, 557 P2d 46 (1976). \u201cGoodwill\u201d is commonly understood to refer to the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201c \u2018favor or advantage in the way of custom that a business has acquired beyond the mere value of what it sells whether due to the personality of those conducting it, the nature of its location, its reputation for skill or promptitude or any other circumstance incidental to the business and tending to make it permanent.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary, </em>979 (unabridged ed 1993).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><em>Weakley, 177 </em>Or App at 368-69. <em>See also McDuffy and McDuffy, </em>184 Or App 359, 365, 56 P3d 449 (2002) (quoting <em>Weakley); Huang v. Department of Revenue, </em>TC 4880, WL 2217751 at *3 (July 27, 2009) (defining goodwill as \u201cthe value of a business above the value of its physical assets\u201d; \u201c[t]hat value is attributable to such factors as expected profits, business location, reputation for good service, and other qualities that make the business attractive to individuals seeking its services\u201d). In sum, \u201cgoodwill\u201d generally refers to those intangible assets of a business, such as its relationships with suppliers, customers, and employees, as well as its location, name recognition, and reputation, that engender customer loyalty regardless of who works there. <em>See generally </em>Christopher A. Tiso, <em>Present Positions on Professional Goodwill: More Focus or Simply More Hocus Pocus?, </em>20 J Am Acad Matrimonial L 51, 52 (2006). That definition generally comports with well-accepted accounting and economic understandings of the term. <em>See </em>Allen Parkman, <em>The Treatment of Professional Goodwill in Divorce Proceedings, </em>18 Fam LQ 213, 213-15 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The matter becomes less simple, and more confusing, when the term \u201cgoodwill\u201d is qualified by reference to the purported source of a business\u2019s enhanced value beyond the value of its physical assets. In particular, complication and potential misunderstanding arise from reference to \u201cbusiness goodwill\u201d and \u201cpersonal goodwill.\u201d The former is, in fact, functionally the same as simple \u201cgoodwill\u201d as defined above \u2014 that is, it connotes enhanced value attributable to factors related to, or inhering in, the <em>entity.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The latter connotes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>increased earning capacity of a business attributable to an <em>individual\u2019s </em>(often, the principal\u2019s) skills, efforts, personality, or reputation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The semantic and analytic confusion is especially marked \u2014 both in our case law and in the case law of our sister states \u2014 when it comes to assessing the goodwill of a professional practice or a closely held business or corporation, specifically in determining whether a principal owner\u2019s individual skills and qualities are properly included in that valuation. <em>Compare Lankford and Lankford, </em>79 Or App 742, 746, 720 P2d 407 (1986) (holding that there was no goodwill in closely held corporation where \u201cthe success or failure of the business depend[ed] on husband\u2019s personal services and his ability to negotiate contracts\u201d), <em>with Reiling and Reiling, </em>66 Or App 284, 288, 673 P2d 1360 (1983), <em>rev den, </em>296 Or 536 (1984) (listing factors important for determining goodwill as \u201chealth, professional reputation, skill, knowledge, work habits[,] and the nature and duration of [the business]\u201d); <em>see also McReath v. McReath, </em>789 NW2d 89, 90 (Wis Ct App 2010) (observing that this area of law \u201chas been hotly debated in jurisdictions across the county for at least thirty years\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Nevertheless, aside from some slippage at the margins, our cases, like those of the majority of courts that have considered the issue, <em>see </em>Tiso, 20 J Am Acad Matrimonial L at 57-59 (describing case law), have generally distinguished between the intangible income-producing assets of a business \u2014that is, its \u201cgoodwill\u201d \u2014 from the value that inheres to the personal traits of that business\u2019s employees or owners. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Indeed, the import of those decisions is that \u201cpersonal goodwill\u201d is not, in fact, \u201cgoodwill\u201d for purposes of valuation in the marital dissolution context. Our decisions in <em>Lankford, Maxwell, McDuffy, </em>and <em>Weakley </em>are illustrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><em>Lankford </em>involved the valuation of a logging business of which the husband was sole owner. 79 Or App at 744. The wife contended that, as a going concern, the business had a value of roughly $224,000. <em>Id. </em>at 745. Conversely, the husband presented evidence that the business had no value aside from the value of the equipment and that \u201cthere was generally no goodwill in such an operation unless the owner personally promised his services to accompany the sale of the business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further testimony clarified that, with respect to a logging operation, the goodwill \u201cwouldn\u2019t be worth, really anything because, * * * [t]he good job that another operator has done wouldn\u2019t necessarily reflect that [a new owner] would do the same job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The trial court ultimately valued the business at $90,000. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On appeal, the wife reiterated that the husband\u2019s logging business should be valued as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d and, thus, that the trial court erred in failing to account for the business\u2019s goodwill. <em>Id. </em>We disagreed and held that, because the evidence on <em>de novo </em>review established \u201cthat the success or failure of the business depends on [the] husband\u2019s personal services and his ability to negotiate contracts in a fluctuating and depressed market,\u201d the trial court correctly determined the value of the business. <em>Id. </em>at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We reached similar conclusions in <em>Maxwell </em>and <em>McDuffy. </em>In <em>Maxwell, </em>we held that the trial court erred in assigning a goodwill value to the husband\u2019s business, a sole proprietorship, where the evidence established that the business\u2019s success was \u201ccompletely dependent on [the husband\u2019s] creative, personal services.\u201d 128 Or App at 569. Similarly, in <em>McDuffy, </em>we sustained the trial court\u2019s determination that there was no goodwill in the trucking company awarded to the husband, where the parties had agreed before the trial court that there was no goodwill and the evidence established that the husband ran the business by himself, there were no steady customers, and \u201cif husband left the business, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>would be nothing left to the trucking company other than the assets.\u201d 184 Or App at 362-63, 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In contrast, in <em>Weakley, </em>we determined that the trial court correctly rejected the husband\u2019s argument that there was no goodwill value in the specialized logging company of which he was part owner. 177 Or App at 369. Central to that determination was evidence that the husband was not the sole shareholder or representative of the logging business and that 50 percent of the company\u2019s business came from fixed contracts, as opposed to bid contracts that go \u201cto the lowest qualified bidder, regardless of the bidder\u2019s reputation or experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366. Additionally, and significantly, there was \u201cno evidence in the record that [the company\u2019s] business [was] dependent on husband\u2019s personality or reputation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369. Thus, although the husband\u2019s expert testified that he believed that there was no goodwill in the business, the husband failed to present evidence that would substantiate that opinion. <em>Id.; see also Adams, </em>121 Or App at 190-91 (upholding trial court\u2019s finding that corporations, which relied substantially on the husband\u2019s personal services for their profitability, had goodwill value).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Taken together, our cases demonstrate that, for purposes of valuation in this context, cognizable \u201cgoodwill\u201d refers to the value of a business \u201cover and above the value of its assets\u201d irrespective of the owner\u2019s or professional\u2019s continued \u201cpersonal services,\u201d <em>Lankford, </em>79 Or App at 746, or \u201cpersonality or reputation,\u201d <em>Weakley, </em>177 Or App at 369. Accordingly, where a business has no value above and beyond its assets absent \u201cthe owner personally promis[ing] his [or her] services to accompany the sale of the business,\u201d <em>Lankford, </em>79 Or App at 745, there is no goodwill. <em>See also McDuffy, </em>184 Or App at 363, 365. At the same time, a closely held business may have goodwill value where the \u201csuccess or failure,\u201d <em>Lankford, </em>79 Or App at 746, of that business does not rest entirely on the business owner\u2019s personal services, personality, or reputation. <em>See Weakley, </em>177 Or App at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">That understanding comports with the view of the majority of state courts, many of which have reasoned that it is improper to treat an individual principal\u2019s or professional\u2019s reputation as \u201cgoodwill\u201d or as a divisible marital asset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>because it is indistinguishable from that individual\u2019s probable future earning capacity. In other words, to the extent that the enhanced earnings of a closely held business or professional practice are due to an individual\u2019s skills, qualities, reputation, or continued presence, those earnings are attributable to the individual, not to the business entity. <em>See, e.g., Held v. Held, </em>912 So 2d 637, 639 (Fla 4th Dist Ct App 2005), <em>rev den, </em>928 So 2d 335 (Fla 2006) (discussing Florida cases holding that \u201cpersonal goodwill represented a person\u2019s probable future earning capacity\u201d); <em>Jay Myoung Yoon v. Sunsook Yoon, </em>711 NE2d 1265, 1269 (Ind 1999) (adopting the view that \u201c \u2018personal goodwill\u2019 represents nothing more than the future earning capacity of the individual and is not divisible\u201d); <em>Gaskill v. Robbins, </em>282 SW3d 306, 314 (Ky 2009) (following <em>Yoon).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Against that comprehensive backdrop, we return to the precise question presented here: Did the trial court err in premising the value of husband\u2019s chiropractic business on the assumption that husband would be bound by a noncompetition covenant? Although no Oregon appellate decision has addressed that question, courts in other jurisdictions have. Among those courts, there is a split of authority, with most having concluded that, to the extent that a noncompetition covenant corresponds to the business\u2019s future earning capacity attributable to an individual\u2019s skills, qualities, reputation, or continued presence, the value of that covenant is not cognizable in a marital property division. <em>See, e.g., Kricsfeld v. Kricsfeld, </em>8 Neb App 1, 18, 588 NW2d 210, 221 (1999) (canvassing case law); <em>Marriage of Monaghan, </em>78 Wash App 918, 927, 899 P2d 841, 846 (1995) (same); <em>but see McReath, </em>789 NW2d at 100 (holding that salable professional goodwill represented by a noncompetition covenant is a marital asset).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We agree with the majority approach. When executed incident to a sale of a business, a noncompetition covenant ensures that the former business owner will not take any customers or patients with him or her and will not compete against the new business owner in the same general area for a reasonable period of time. The value of that covenant depends, at least in part, on the ability of the covenantor to attract future business based on his or her personal services and personality or reputation, separate and apart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>his or her association with the business. As the Nebraska Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\">\u201cThe reasoning of the courts which have excluded covenants not to compete from the value of a professional practice are persuasive and consistent with the rationale * * * that any \u2018asset\u2019 that does not have a value independent of the presence or reputation of a particular individual is not a marital asset. * * * [T]he value of a typical covenant prohibiting or restricting an individual from competing with another is, by definition, dependent upon the presence or reputation of the individual who gives the covenant. For example, if an individual loses his or her license to practice medicine, he or she ceases to be \u2018present\u2019 in a competitive sense. Consequently, it is unlikely that any value would be paid to that person for a covenant not to compete, as he or she could not compete anyway. To the extent that the value of a covenant not to compete is solely dependent on the presence or reputation of an individual, it is not a marital asset.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><em>Kricsfeld, </em>8 Neb App at 18-19, 588 NW2d at 221-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Thus, the same rationale that warrants exclusion of enhanced earnings uniquely referable to an individual\u2019s or principal\u2019s skills, qualities, reputation, or continued presence from the calculation of a business\u2019s goodwill, <em>see, e.g., McDuffy, </em>184 Or App at 363, 365; <em>Maxwell, </em>128 Or App at 569; <em>Lankford, </em>79 Or App at 746, also pertains to the treatment of the value of a putative noncompetition covenant. Both correspond, at least broadly, to a component of earnings attributable to the individual, and not the entity, that the business would lose if the individual withdrew from the business and, especially, opted to compete. In this context, each is a function of the individual\u2019s earning capacity, with the value of the noncompetition covenant corresponding to the present value of the forgone stream of future earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The consequence of the foregoing is that the valuation of Slater Chiropractic as a marital asset could not properly be predicated on an assumption that, at the time of a putative sale, husband would be bound by a noncompetition covenant, thus enhancing the value of the business. Or, stated conversely, any valuation of Slater Chiropractic so predicated must concomitantly be reduced by the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>putative noncompetition covenant, corresponding to the value of enhanced earnings above the business\u2019s tangible assets, which are attributable to husband\u2019s individual skills, qualities, reputation, or continuing presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Here, wife made no attempt to present a valuation of the business differentiating between enhanced earnings attributable to the entity and enhanced earnings attributable to husband individually. Rather, wife\u2019s expert testified that <em>none </em>of the enhanced value of Slater Chiropractic was attributable to husband personally and that all of the business\u2019s value over and above its assets was divisible goodwill. Nonetheless, however, wife\u2019s expert agreed that, if husband were to sell his business, it would be necessary for him to execute a noncompetition covenant. That acknowledgement is irreconcilable with the position that husband\u2019s personal skills, services, and continued presence are immaterial to the business\u2019s enhanced earnings. If that were so, the assumption of a noncompetition covenant would be inapposite to valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"> To be sure, the evidence establishes that Slater Chiropractic has <em>some goodwill </em>\u2014 viz., that attributable to Miller\u2019s practice. Nevertheless, the evidence substantiates husband\u2019s position that the goodwill inhering to Slater Chiropractic as an entity is minimal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Husband is the sole shareholder of Slater Chiropractic, and he named the business after himself. Over half of Slater Chiropractic\u2019s business comes from husband\u2019s status as a preferred provider, and there is no evidence that that status can be transferred to the business or to a new owner. Finally, although in no way determinative of the value of Slater Chiropractic\u2019s goodwill in 2006, we note that when husband purchased the business in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>an arm\u2019s-length transaction 10 years earlier, his payment for his predecessor\u2019s noncompetition covenant was substantially more than his payment for the business goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Given those factors, on <em>de novo </em>review, we adopt as reasonable husband\u2019s expert\u2019s calculation that $273,357 of the value in the business was \u201cpersonal\u201d to husband. We further adopt husband\u2019s expert\u2019s total valuation of $504,152. That, in turn, after deduction of that component attributable to husband personally, yields an asset value, for purposes of marital property division, of $230,795 \u2014 and not $500,000, as determined by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In sum, we hold that the trial court erred in including the value of a hypothetical noncompetition covenant when it valued Slater Chiropractic and, consequently, erred in determining the value of the business. The difference between the trial court\u2019s valuation of the business ($500,000) and our valuation on <em>de novo </em>review ($230,795) is $269,205. That difference requires a substantial reconfiguration of the trial court\u2019s property division beyond a simple elimination of the equalizing judgment ($78,524) in wife\u2019s favor. We remand for the trial court to determine a proper division consistently with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Vacated and remanded for reconsideration of property division; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> The notice of appeal in this case was filed before June 4, 2009; accordingly, the 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415(3) (which give the appellate court discretion as to whether it reviews facts <em>de novo </em>in most equity cases) do not apply, and our standard of review is governed by the 2007 version of the statute. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> In its letter opinion, the trial court found that wife\u2019s expert had attributed a value of $570,000 to Slater Chiropractic, which was wife\u2019s expert\u2019s valuation of Slater Chiropractic as of December 31, 2005. However, wife\u2019s expert updated his valuation for Slater Chiropractic in advance of trial to reflect its value as of December 31, 2006, and relied on those updated figures in his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-5\"> We address the content of those amorphous terms below. <em>See </em>240 Or App at 37-42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\"> That calculation is based on wife\u2019s expert\u2019s valuation as of December 31, 2006. <em>See </em>240 Or App at 33-34 n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b61-5\"> Husband\u2019s expert reached that figure by subtracting the fair market value of the net tangible assets, <em>i.e., </em>the adjusted book value of the business or $200,422, from the composite value he calculated using capitalization of earnings, capitalization of excess earnings, and comparable transaction approaches, <em>viz., </em>$504,152.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\"> In so asserting, husband invoked <em>Stewart v.
