J.</author>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">In this domestic relations case, the trial court granted respondent mother\u2019s motion, pursuant to ORCP 21 E, to strike appellant father\u2019s motion to modify the parenting contact provision of the judgment of dissolution. Father challenges that order on a variety of grounds. As explained below, we conclude that the trial court erred in that the allegations of the motion to modify and incorporated submissions were not, in their totality, \u201csham, frivolous, or irrelevant.\u201d ORCP 21 E. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">On February 24, 2004, while the parties were married, father committed a variety of egregious violent and sexual crimes, including attempted aggravated murder, against mother. Father was subsequently convicted of those crimes and sentenced to nearly 40 years in prison. At the time of those crimes, the parties had two children, one who was approximately three years old and the other who was approximately five months old. In October 2004, the trial court entered a general judgment of dissolution of marriage, which included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201cWife is a fit and proper person to be awarded custody of the parties\u2019 minor children * * * and custody of the children is awarded to Wife. Husband shall have no right to visit or contact the children, except indirectly through [RW]. Husband may write to the children, at [RW\u2019s] address, quarterly (4 times per year). Husband may not include letters to Wife in this correspondence. Husband shall have no contact, direct or indirect, with Wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">RW is one of father\u2019s relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">In December 2008, father filed a motion for an order to show cause regarding modification of the parenting contact provision of the dissolution judgment. In that motion and the incorporated submissions, father asserted that mother had violated the parenting contact provisions by \u201csevering] all contact\u201d between father and the children, including \u201csevering] contact with [RW].\u201d Father proposed wholesale and detailed revisions, which would impose substantial responsibilities on mother to communicate with father on a regular basis regarding the children, entitle father to weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>correspondence and telephone communication with the children, and mandate at least one yearly visit between the children and father at his place of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Mother responded with a motion \u201cto strike the modification proceeding filed by [father] on the grounds that it is sham, frivolous, and irrelevant.\u201d In advancing that motion, mother contended that father\u2019s proposed modifications would, singly and collectively, subvert the purpose of the existing provision, which, mother asserted, was designed to \u201cenable [mother] to start a new life without fear of [father] ever finding her, and to allow her children to live normal, healthy lives without any influence of their violent father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The trial court, after hearing argument on the motion to strike, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cI do not believe there is sufficient evidence to have this case proceed any further. In my mind, there is no evidence that the mother violated the terms of the parenting agreement. And so that \u2014 rather than go into all the issues that have been raised I think that\u2019s sufficient and there\u2019d be no purpose served by proceeding any further. I don\u2019t see any other conclusion reached if we were \u2014 if we were going on and have a full hearing. So that would be all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The court subsequently entered an order granting mother\u2019s ORCP 21 E motion to strike father\u2019s motion to modify, and father appeals from that order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">ORCP 21E provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">\u201cUpon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 10 days after the service of the pleading upon such party or upon the court\u2019s own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken: (1) any sham, frivolous, or irrelevant pleading or defense or any pleading containing more than one claim or defense not separately stated; (2) any insufficient defense or any sham, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>frivolous, irrelevant, or redundant matter inserted in a pleading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In reviewing the allowance (or denial) of a motion to strike pursuant to ORCP 21 E, we employ the same standard that pertains to rulings on motions to dismiss pursuant to ORCP 21 A: \u201cWe * * * accept as true all well-pleaded allegations and any facts that might be adduced as proof of those allegations.\u201d <em>Doyle v. Oregon Bank, </em>94 Or App 230, 232, 764 P2d 1379 (1988), <em>rev den, </em>307 Or 571 (1989). <em>See also Erwin v. Oregon State Bar, </em>149 Or App 99, 108, 941 P2d 1094 (1997) (applying that standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">At least one of our decisions implies that the proper standard of review for an ORCP 21 E ruling is \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See Turczynski v. Grill, </em>134 Or App 351, 354, 895 P2d 787 (1995). However, that reference in <em>Turczynski </em>was predicated on a citation to <em>Greulich v. The City of Lake Oswego, </em>12 Or App 235, 504 P2d 1390, <em>rev den </em>(1973). In <em>Greulich, </em>the only reference to \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d review was to whether the trial court, after allowing the motion to strike, had erred in also denying leave to replead. Thus, properly understood \u2014 and consistently with <em>Doy le- </em>\u2014 -\u201cabuse of discretion\u201d pertains not to the determination of whether matter in a pleading is, in fact, \u201csham, frivolous, or irrelevant\u201d (which is a question of law), but, instead, to the court\u2019s determination to strike such matter and to any preclusion of further pleading. <em>See Greulich, </em>12 Or App at 240-41 (trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking second amended complaint without leave to replead where \u201cthe plaintiffs had twice been given clear and explicit warnings by two different judges concerning their failure to plead an adequate complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The identification of our standard of review, in turn, implicates the substantive referent for that standard: What is the meaning, for purposes of ORCP 21 E, of \u201csham, frivolous, or irrelevant\u201d? The origin of those terms \u2014 of that phrase \u2014 long antedates the adoption of the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See </em>General Laws of Oregon, Civ Code, ch I, title IX, \u00a7 74, p 120 (Deady &amp; Lane 1843-1872) (\u201cSham, frivolous and irrelevant answers and defenses may be stricken out on motion, and upon such terms as the court may in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>discretion impose.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at title XI \u00a7 84, p 122 (\u201cIf irrelevant or redundant matter be inserted in a pleading, it may be stricken out on motion of the adverse party[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The content of those terms has remained roughly consistent for at least the last 150 years. \u201cSham\u201d pleadings are those that are false in fact on their face and, hence, not pleaded in good faith. <em>See, e.g., Andrysek v. Andrysek, </em>280 Or 61, 69 n 8, 569 P2d 615 (1977) (\u201cA sham plea is one good in form but false in fact; it is a pretense because it is not pleaded in good faith.\u201d); <em>Foren v. Dealey, </em>4 Or 92, 95 (1870) (to justify striking answer as \u201csham,\u201d \u201cit must be obviously false, or it must be shown to be false and in bad faith\u201d); <em>Kashmir Corp. v. Nelson, </em>37 Or App 887, 892, 588 P2d 133 (1978) (\u201cA pleading may be stricken as sham when its allegations appear false on the face of the pleading.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">A \u201cfrivolous\u201d pleading \u201cis one which, although true in its allegations, is totally insufficient in substance.\u201d <em>Andrysek, </em>280 Or at 69 n 8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Kashmir Corp., </em>37 Or App at 892 (\u201cA frivolous plea is one which does not raise any issue in the proceeding.\u201d); <em>cf. Greulich, </em>12 Or App at 237-40 (court did not err in striking as \u201cfrivolous,\u201d and without leave to replead, second amended complaint that was replete with material the court had previously stricken). Because the <em>sine qua non </em>of a \u201cfrivolous\u201d pleading is its legal insufficiency, there can be considerable overlap between an ORCP 21E motion to strike as \u201cfrivolous\u201d and a motion to dismiss pursuant to ORCP 21 A(8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cAlthough ORCP 21 E does not specifically state that the motion is used to test the \u2018legal sufficiency\u2019 of an allegation, \u2018[a] legally insufficient allegation * * * is, in effect, a nullity, and may be stricken as either frivolous or irrelevant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\"><em>Lane v. Maass, </em>309 Or 671, 675, 790 P2d 1137 (1990) (quoting <em>Davis v. Tyee Industries, Inc., </em>295 Or 467, 482-83 n 14, 668 P2d 1186 (1983)) (omission in <em>Lane). See also Erwin, </em>149 Or App at 108-09 (trial court erred in striking as \u201cfrivolous\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>claim for declaratory relief because \u201cthe allegations [met] the minimal pleading requirements for a declaratory judgment action\u201d); <em>Masse I v. Dept. of </em>Rev., 18 OTR 100, 107 (2004) (concluding that, because taxpayer \u201cfailed to state ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a claim[,] * * * those assertions are frivolous or irrelevant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">A focused, but nonexhaustive, canvassing of the case law pertaining to ORCP 21 E and its antecedents reveals no particularized definition of \u201cirrelevant\u201d in this context. Rather, reported opinions address the distinction between \u201csham\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d pleadings and, occasionally, conflate \u201cirrelevant\u201d with the latter. Accordingly, \u201cirrelevant\u201d as used in ORCP 21 E would appear to have the same meaning that it does generally \u2014 that is, as pertaining to matters that are not logically or legally germane to the substance of the parties\u2019 dispute. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>906 (9th ed 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We return to this case. Assuming, without deciding, that an ORCP 21E motion to strike can properly be directed against a motion to modify in a domestic relations proceeding,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court erred in allowing mother\u2019s motion. In allowing that motion, the court struck father\u2019s motion in its entirety and, effectively, precluded any further proceedings. Although it may be that certain of father\u2019s allegations were factually false, that was not discernible from the face of his motion and incorporated submissions; much less is it patent that father\u2019s motion was so pervasively false that the entire motion must be stricken as \u201csham.\u201d So too with respect to any treatment of father\u2019s motion as \u201cfrivolous\u201d: Assuming the truth of \u201call well-pleaded allegations and any facts that might be adduced as proof of those allegations,\u201d <em>Doyle, </em>94 Or App at 232, the breakdown of the sole mechanism provided in the dissolution judgment for potential contact between father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>and the children could constitute a legally sufficient basis for modification of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">We appreciate the extraordinary circumstances that gave rise to the existing provision and the purposes it serves. Nor do we discount mother\u2019s expressed concerns that modification proceedings could, without rigorous oversight, be an occasion, intentionally or inadvertently, for perpetrating or perpetuating trauma. Nevertheless, striking father\u2019s motion as \u201csham,\u201d \u201cfrivolous,\u201d or \u201cirrelevant\u201d so as to preclude further proceedings, including the presentation of evidence in support of legally sufficient allegations, was not a legally permissible means of addressing those concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-11\"> Given the totality of the circumstances, including the trial court\u2019s comments in granting mother\u2019s motion, it is patent that the trial court deemed its ruling to be dispositive and preclusive of further proceedings on the motion to modify. Accordingly, the court\u2019s order was a post-judgment order that \u201caffect[ed] a substantial right\u201d of appellant father. ORS 19.205(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\"> Given that definition, the Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201csham\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d are not merely disjunctive \u2014 but, rather, mutually exclusive \u2014 terms and has repeatedly admonished trial courts that the terms are not interchangeable. <em>See, e.g., Warm Springs Forest Products Ind. v. EBI Co., </em>300 Or 617, 626 n 1, 716 P2d 740 (1986); <em>Andrysek, </em>280 Or at 69 n 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\"> ORCP 21E provides for the striking of \u201cpleading[s],\u201d \u201cdefense[s],\u201d or \u201cmatter inserted in a pleading.\u201d A motion is not, as least for purposes of general usage under the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure, a \u201cpleading.\u201d <em>Compare </em>ORCP 13 A (defining \u201cpleading\u201d), <em>and </em>ORCP 13 B (listing types of \u201cpleadings\u201d), <em>with </em>ORCP 14 A (defining \u201cmotion\u201d). Given our analysis and ultimate disposition, we need not resolve, and neither express nor imply any view as to, whether, or to what extent, those definitions pertain to various post-judgment matters in the domestic relations context.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
