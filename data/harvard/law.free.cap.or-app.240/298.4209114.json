Youth argues that, although insurance carriers and the account are \u201cvictims\u201d for the purpose of restitution in criminal cases, they are not \u201cvictims\u201d for the purpose of restitution in juvenile delinquency cases. For the reasons explained below, we reject youth\u2019s argument and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. The state filed a petition alleging that youth was within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute sexual abuse in the third degree. ORS 163.415. The petition alleged three counts of such acts, against three different victims. The juvenile court found that youth committed the acts as alleged. The state subsequently asked the juvenile court to order youth to pay restitution to an insurance carrier and the account for money they expended on behalf of the one of the victims for counseling. Youth objected, arguing that neither the insurance carrier nor the account qualified as a \u201cvictim\u201d for the purpose of restitution in a juvenile delinquency case. The juvenile court rejected youth\u2019s argument and ordered him to pay restitution of $761.20 to the insurance carrier and $311.80 to the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">On appeal, youth again argues that the insurance carrier and the account are not \u201cvictims\u201d for the purpose of restitution in juvenile delinquency cases. Youth\u2019s argument presents a question of statutory interpretation, requiring us to determine the meaning of the term \u201cvictim\u201d for the purpose of the juvenile restitution statute, ORS 419C.450, set out below. When interpreting a statute, our task is to discern the intent of the legislature. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). To do so, we begin with an examination of the text of the statute, in context, which is \u201cthe best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">ORS 419C.450, which governs restitution in juvenile delinquency cases, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u201c(l)(a) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to encourage and promote the payment of restitution and other obligations by youth offenders as well as by adult offenders. <em>In any ease within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to ORS 419C.005 in which the youth offender caused another person any physical, emotional or psychological injury or any loss of or damage to property, the victim has the right to receive prompt restitution. </em>The district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, prior to or at the time of adjudication, evidence of the nature and amount of the injury, loss or damage. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered injury, loss or damage, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">\u201c(A) Include in the judgment a requirement that the youth offender pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s injury, loss or damage as determined by the court[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">ORS 419C.450 does not define \u201cvictim\u201d or \u201crestitution.\u201d But another statute, ORS 419A.004, defines terms for the Juvenile Code, and it provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\u201cAs used in this chapter and ORS chapters 419B and 419C, unless the context requires otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u00edf\u00ed ^ \u2021 iji</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201c(23) \u2018Restitution\u2019 has the meaning given that term in ORS 137.103.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">ORS 137.103, in turn, defines terms for the Criminal Code\u2019s restitution statutes, and it provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">\u201cAs used in ORS 137.101 to 137.109, 161.675 and 161.685:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">\u00edJ\u00ed ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">\u201c(3) \u2018Restitution\u2019 means full, partial or nominal payment of economic damages to a victim. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-14\">\u201c(4) \u2018Victim\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-15\">\u201c(a) The person against whom the defendant committed the criminal offense, if the court determines that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>person has suffered economic damages as a result of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">\u201c(b) Any person not described in paragraph (a) of this subsection whom the court determines has suffered economic damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">\u201c(c) The Criminal Injuries Compensation Account, if it has expended moneys on behalf of a victim described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201c(d) An insurance carrier, if it has expended moneys on behalf of a victim described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">To summarize, under ORS 419C.450(l)(a), a \u201cvictim\u201d in a juvenile delinquency case has the right to receive prompt \u201crestitution.\u201d ORS 419C.450 does not define \u201cvictim\u201d or \u201crestitution,\u201d but ORS 419A.004(23) provides that, unless the context requires otherwise, \u201c \u2018Restitution\u2019 has the meaning given that term in ORS 137.103.\u201d In turn, ORS 137.103(3) provides that \u201c \u2018Restitution\u2019 means full, partial or nominal payment of economic damages to a victim.\u201d Notably, the definition of \u201crestitution\u201d includes the term \u201cvictim,\u201d and \u201cvictim\u201d is defined \u2014 for the purposes of the Criminal Code\u2019s restitution statutes, including the definition of \u201crestitution\u201d in ORS 137.103(3) \u2014 to include insurance carriers and the account. ORS 137.103(4)(c), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Thus, the legislature has incorporated ORS 137.103(3)\u2019s definition of \u201crestitution\u201d into the Juvenile Code, and that definition contains specially defined terms, including \u201cvictim.\u201d We conclude that, when the legislature incorporated the definition of \u201crestitution,\u201d it incorporated the whole definition, including the statutory definitions of its component parts. To conclude otherwise would be inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s expressed intent that the term \u201crestitution\u201d has the same meaning in the criminal and juvenile codes\u2014 that is, \u201crestitution\u201d would mean payment of economic damages to one group in the Criminal Code, and payment of economic damages to a different group in the Juvenile Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Nevertheless, youth argues that, for the purpose of restitution, the term \u201cvictim\u201d does have different meanings in the criminal and juvenile codes. Youth acknowledges, as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>must, that the Juvenile Code does not specifically define the term \u201cvictim\u201d for the purpose of restitution. Youth asserts that \u201c[t]he definition of \u2018victim\u2019 for the purposes of juvenile restitution * * * is embedded in the juvenile restitution statute,\u201d ORS 419C.450(l)(a). Youth relies on the portion of that statute that provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">\u201cIn any case within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to ORS 419C.005 in which the youth offender caused another person any physical, emotional or psychological injury or any loss of or damage to property, the victim has the right to receive prompt restitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">ORS 419C.450(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">As we understand it, youth\u2019s argument is that, for the purpose of restitution in a juvenile delinquency case, a \u201cvictim\u201d is a \u201cperson\u201d who has suffered \u201cany physical, emotional, or psychological injury or any loss of or damage to property\u201d as a result of a youth\u2019s conduct. Youth emphasizes that ORS 419C.450(l)(a) uses the term \u201cperson,\u201d a term which, in youth\u2019s view, does not apply to insurance carriers or the account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>We do not understand the language on which youth relies to define the term \u201cvictim.\u201d It does not do so expressly, and there is no reason for it to be interpreted as doing so when, as discussed above, the term \u201crestitution\u201d itself includes the specially defined term \u201cvictim.\u201d Instead, we read the language on which youth relies as creating a condition precedent to an award of restitution: that a person suffers injury or loss of or damage to property. If that condition is satisfied, then a juvenile court can award restitution to a \u201cvictim,\u201d as defined by ORS 137.103(4), including to an insurance carrier or the account. Therefore, if, as here, a person has suffered an injury caused by a youth offender and an insurance carrier or the account has expended money on behalf of that person, then a juvenile court can order the youth to pay restitution to the insurance carrier or the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Accordingly, the trial court did not err in awarding restitution to the account and the insurance carrier in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> Youth argues that his definition of \u201cvictim,\u201d which he finds embedded in ORS 419C.450(l)(a), is consistent with ORS 419A.004(31), the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the Juvenile Code. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201c \u2018Victim\u2019 means any person determined by the district attorney, the juvenile department or the court to have suffered direct financial, psychological or physical harm as a result of the act that has brought the youth or youth offender before the juvenile court. When the victim is a minor, \u2018victim\u2019 includes the legal guardian of the minor. The youth or youth offender may not be considered the victim. WThen the victim of the crime cannot be determined, the people of Oregon, as represented by the district attorney, are considered the victims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">ORS 419A.004(31) was added to the Juvenile Code in 2007 as part of a bill to incorporate procedures to protect victims\u2019 constitutional rights in juvenile delinquency cases. HB 2127 (2007). It is a general definition and it applies \u201cunless the context requires otherwise.\u201d ORS 419A.004. Here, we conclude that the context does require otherwise. As discussed above, the Juvenile Code expressly incorporates the Criminal Code\u2019s definition of \u201crestitution,\u201d which, in turn, includes a special definition of \u201cvictim.\u201d That statutory framework has been in place since 1993. Or Laws 2009, ch 33, \u00a7 2. Nothing in the text of ORS 419A.004(31), HB 2127, or its legislative history indicates that the general definition in ORS 419A.004(31) was intended to alter our understanding that the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d in ORS 137.103(4) applies in this context and, to conclude otherwise, would have the effect of limiting those who could be awarded restitution in juvenile delinquency cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
