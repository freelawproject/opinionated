ORS 426.005(l)(e)(A). Pursuant to ORS 19.415(3), unless we exercise our discretion to review the matter <em>de novo, </em>we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact that are supported by any evidence in the record; we further review the court\u2019s dispositional conclusions, predicated on those findings, for errors of law. <em>State v. D. R., </em>239 Or App 576, 579, 244 P3d 916 (2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, we do not exercise our discretion to engage in <em>de novo </em>review;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nevertheless, as explained below, we conclude that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant was a danger to herself. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"> We state the facts \u201cconsistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings,\u201d <em>D. R., </em>239 Or App at 579, as supplemented with uncontroverted contextual information from the record. At the time of the hearing, appellant was a 31-year-old woman. Symptoms of her mental illness included psychosis, paranoia, auditory \u201ccommand hallucinations,\u201d and visual hallucinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The incidents triggering appellant\u2019s commitment proceeding took place in October 2009. On October 7, appellant was brought to Providence Hospital in Portland after an incident in which she fell while running with her nine-month-old child in her arms. As a result of her fall, appellant incurred \u201ccuts, abrasions and discolored swelling * * * on her left che[e]k and above her left eye.\u201d Appellant told Monaco, a precommitment investigator who interviewed her two days later (on October 9), that she had been running because she was frightened and that the baby did not get hurt during the fall. Appellant told Monaco that she was afraid of B, her boyfriend and the father of her child, who she believed wanted to \u201cget rid\u201d of her because, according to appellant, he had another girlfriend.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although she denied having a mental illness and also denied having any thoughts of harm towards herself or others, appellant was held on a psychiatric hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Later that same day, on October 9, Port of Portland Police Officer Hemsworth received a call regarding appellant, who was inside the airport, at a security checkpoint, wearing hospital scrubs and no shoes. Hemsworth had difficulty communicating with appellant because \u201c[t]here was clearly some form of a language barrier\u201d and because appellant appeared confused and disorganized in her thinking. Appellant told Hemsworth that she was attempting to fly to Arizona to get her baby, but she was not carrying any identification, a plane ticket, or any means to procure a plane ticket. Appellant was also not able to answer Hemsworth\u2019s questions about what day it was, where she was, her address, her date of birth, or when she had last eaten, and \u201chad no plan to get anywhere other than to Arizona.\u201d Appellant did tell Hemsworth that she did not want to go back to the hospital because \u201cshe believed that she would die or they would kill her there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Eventually, Hemsworth was able to identify appellant based on the hospital bracelet she was wearing. Hemsworth ultimately determined that appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>unable to care for herself and was a danger to herself, and he took her to Portland Adventist hospital in Portland.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Monaco interviewed appellant again at the hospital a few days later. Appellant indicated that she had fled to the airport because \u201cit wasn\u2019t safe\u201d for her to be at Providence and that she had believed that her child and B had moved to Minnesota \u2014 in fact, they were still living in Portland \u2014 that she was supposed to follow them there, and that the \u201cvoices told her that she wouldn\u2019t need identification or money to board a plane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">At the commitment hearing, the state presented the testimony of Hemsworth and admitted the nonhearsay portions of Monaco\u2019s precommitment report, which recounted the facts above. B and Goss, a Department of Human Services (DHS) worker, also testified for the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">B, who spoke through a translator, testified that he and appellant lived together and that appellant\u2019s behavior had started to change about three months before the commitment hearing and had appeared to become progressively worse in the weeks before the hearing. B explained that appellant would accuse him of making statements when he had not, in fact, said anything and that she thought she could hear other people talking about her when they were in a separate car or when she was in their home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">B also testified that appellant had abruptly quit her job a few weeks before the commitment hearing. When B asked appellant about why she had quit her job, she responded, in part, that she planned to go to another state because \u201c[ejverybody is after me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">On October 2, B took appellant to see a doctor because he was concerned about her hearing voices and was afraid that she might harm their child. However, after they had checked in and were waiting, appellant ran out to the hospital parking lot. She told B that she had run away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>because she \u201cneed[ed] to go to another state\u201d and that she did not want to talk to the doctor or nursing staff. Afterwards, appellant and B returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">On October 7, B returned home from work to find that appellant and their child were missing and that they had been taken to Providence. B testified that, when he first saw appellant at Providence that evening, she did not want to see him or her father and that she seemed confused. After appellant was hospitalized at Portland Adventist two days later, on October 9, she still seemed angry and confused and held B and her father responsible for her being \u201cin jail\u201d at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Goss, the DHS worker, interviewed appellant the day before the commitment hearing. Goss reported that appellant admitted that she had always heard voices, but claimed that they had only become \u201cnegative\u201d since she and B had gotten involved. She also denied having a mental illness and indicated her desire to be released from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Appellant testified regarding the events of October 7 and October 9. With respect to the former, she stated that she was running away from her father \u2014 who, she said, was pressuring her to stay with B, when she fell on October 7 \u2014 but later stated that she ran away because it \u201csmelled like a dead body just left the house\u201d and that her \u201cchild [was] wearing clothes all full of blood.\u201d As to the incident on October 9, appellant stated that a \u201cvoice,\u201d perhaps belonging to \u201cthe devil,\u201d had told her that \u201c[s]omebody will kill you, and you better leave this state and go somewhere else.\u201d Appellant denied having a mental illness and claimed that her plan, upon release, was to pray and \u201clive through God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Both of the mental health examiners testified. Dr. McCubbin rendered the opinion that appellant suffered from a mental disorder and that she was a danger to herself and unable to provide for her basic needs. McCubbin testified that appellant was a danger to herself \u201conly in the sense of putting yourself in difficult situations like going to the airport to fly out someplace * * * and not fully clothed, and expect to get on an airplane, which is unreasonable.\u201d Dr. O\u2019Malia agreed that appellant suffered from a mental disorder (schizophrenia) and that the disorder caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>delusions and hallucinations that appellant \u201cresponds to * * * very strongly, very impulsively, unpredictably and irrationally.\u201d O\u2019Malia also concluded that that disorder rendered appellant unable to provide for her basic needs, but determined that appellant was only a danger to others, and not a danger to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The trial court determined that appellant had a mental disorder and, because of that disorder, was a danger to herself. The trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201c[W]hat concerns me most about her circumstances in this case is the command hallucinations and her response to them. And I have in the record at least three times in which she\u2019s responded to the voices in her head, such that have placed herself in what I consider harm\u2019s way * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\u201cOnce was when she * * * became frightened by the voices and took off running and fell. She was injured at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201cShe heard voices when she was at the hospital on the [9]th of October, voices telling her that she wasn\u2019t safe at Providence, that she should flee, and she fled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201cShe then heard voices to tell her that the father was taking the child to another state and she needed to go and follow and get the child. And so she got herself on MAX * * * got on without paying for a ticket, and took it out to the airport, at which point she\u2019s stymied because she can\u2019t go any further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201cBut I find [that] placed her at risk. She\u2019s out there, confused, disorganized, unable to provide any identifying information to people wanting to help her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">\u201cAnd so I believe that these three \u2014 at least these three incidents, there\u2019s also the fleeing from the doctor\u2019s office. I don\u2019t know what was going on at that point, there was not enough information to know if that was based on voices. But I believe * * * at this point in time she responds very unpredictably and impulsively to the * * * command hallucinations and she\u2019s established a pattern of doing so, and that I believe that untreated she\u2019ll likely follow that pattern again and will again place herself in harm\u2019s way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The trial court committed appellant to the Oregon Health Authority for a period not to exceed 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>On appeal, appellant does not contest that she has a mental disorder, but she argues that the trial court\u2019s determination that she was a danger to herself rests on insufficient evidence. In particular, appellant contends that \u201cthere was no evidence that she placed herself in imminent danger by fleeing a situation that she perceived as dangerous.\u201d The state counters that the trial court correctly determined that appellant was a danger to herself because the incidents in which appellant fell and injured herself and in which she traveled to the airport either \u201cresulted in harm or created situations likely to result in harm. <em>State v. [Judd], </em>206 Or App 146, 152, 135 P3d 397 (2006).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We conclude, for the following reasons, that the evidence of appellant\u2019s conduct, viewed most favorably to the state, is legally insufficient to support a determination that appellant was a danger to herself for purposes of ORS 426.005(1)(e)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Generally, a person may be involuntarily committed if the person is found to be \u201cmentally ill.\u201d ORS 426.130(l)(b)(C). As relevant here, a person is \u201cmentally ill\u201d if the person has a \u201cmental disorder\u201d and, as a result of that disorder, \u201cis * * * [d]angerous to self * * ORS 426.005(l)(e)(A). Although historically reviewed <em>de novo, </em>our cases have uniformly imposed a rigorous threshold with respect to what the state is required to show to establish that an individual is \u201c[d]angerous to self,\u201d ORS 426.005(l)(e)(A), as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">To establish that a person is \u201c[d]angerous to self,\u201d the state must present evidence that the person\u2019s \u201cmental disorder would cause him or her to engage in behavior that is likely to result in physical harm to himself or herself in the near term.\u201d <em>State v. Olsen, </em>208 Or App 686, 691, 145 P3d 350 (2006). That requires evidence that the person\u2019s mental disorder \u201chas resulted in harm or created situations likely to result in harm\u201d in the \u201cnear future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, our cases have established that the threatened \u201charm\u201d must, at minimum, involve \u201cactual physical harm,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 693, and that the physical harm must be \u201cserious,\u201d <em>State v. North, </em>189 Or App 518, 525, 76 P3d 685 (2003). <em>See also Judd, </em>206 Or App at 153 (discussing standard for \u201charm\u201d). Indeed, a number of our cases have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>suggested that the potential harm must be \u201clife-threatening\u201d or involve some \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d activity. <em>Id. </em>(noting case law) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">In a related sense, we have explained that \u201ca person can be deemed dangerous to self if he or she has established a pattern in the past of taking certain actions that lead to self-destructive conduct, and then he or she begins to follow the pattern again.\u201d <em>State v. Roberts, </em>183 Or App 520, 524, 52 P3d 1123 (2002). Consistently with that understanding, although a person can be committed on the \u201cdanger to self\u2019 basis before he or she is on the \u201cbrink of death,\u201d the prospect of serious physical harm must be more than merely \u201cspeculative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, we have repeatedly admonished that \u201c \u2018apprehensions, speculations and conjecture are not sufficient to prove a need for mental commitment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Ayala, </em>164 Or App 399, 404, 991 P2d 1100 (1999)) (brackets omitted). <em>See also Olsen, </em>208 Or App at 691 (quoting <em>Roberts, Ayala, </em>and similar language from <em>State v. Stanley, </em>117 Or App 327, 330, 843 P2d 1018 (1992)). Such restraint comports with the fundamental principle that the power to civilly commit a person must not be used \u201cas a \u2018paternalistic vehicle\u2019 to \u2018save people from themselves.\u2019 \u201d <em>Olsen, </em>208 Or App at 692 (quoting <em>State v. Powell, </em>178 Or App 89, 95, 35 P3d 1084 (2001)). Accordingly, \u201cdelusional or eccentric behavior \u2014 even behavior that may be inherently risky \u2014 is not necessarily sufficient to warrant commitment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Our decisions addressing putative \u201cdanger to self\u2019 commitments based on \u201charm\u2019s way\u201d concerns highlight the proper application of the foregoing legal principles. For example, in <em>Olsen </em>we held that evidence that the appellant, who suffered from delusions, had \u201cpoor judgment,\u201d and had a tendency to \u201ctravel aimlessly\u201d and to \u201cwalk into people\u2019s homes\u201d was insufficient to establish the requisite danger to self. 208 Or App at 689, 690 (internal quotation marks omitted). In so holding, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201cEvidence of delusions, general lack of judgment, and failure to plan for release, * * * is simply not the kind of evidence of a particularized, near-term threat that is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to justify [the] appellant\u2019s involuntary commitment on the ground that he is a danger to himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Similarly, in <em>Powell, </em>we concluded that the facts that the appellant lacked self-control, had lost a significant amount of weight, and had repeatedly hit her head against a Plexiglass divider separating the front and back seats in a police car, was insufficient to sustain a commitment based on danger to self. We emphasized that, \u201c[t]here is no evidence that appellant\u2019s poor judgment and lack of self-control have resulted in harm, so we are left to speculate about how her condition might lead her to harm herself in the future.\u201d 178 Or App at 94. <em>See also Roberts, </em>183 Or App at 522, 525 (concluding that, although the appellant had \u201cwander[ed] the streets in a confused state of mind\u201d when not on her medication and, while in that state, had \u201c \u2019stepped off the curb\u2019 some unspecified number of times at some unspecified times in the past,\u201d where there was no evidence that she had ever been injured or in peril, the record was insufficient to establish a danger to self) (brackets in <em>Roberts </em>omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We fully appreciate that each of those cases was subject to <em>de novo </em>review. Nevertheless, our disposition in each instance ultimately derived from legal principles that apply and control regardless of the standard of appellate review pertaining to the predicate facts. Specifically, the requisite danger to self cannot be based on mere unsubstantiated apprehension or speculation. Rather, it must partake of a \u201cparticularized,\u201d <em>Olsen, </em>208 Or App at 693, and \u201chighly probable,\u201d <em>North, </em>189 Or App at 525, threat to appellant\u2019s safe survival, including a risk of substantial harm, in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Applying those fixed principles, the record in this case was legally insufficient to support commitment based on \u201c[d]anger[ ] to self.\u201d Here, the evidence establishes that appellant had a pattern of \u201cunpredictably and impulsively\u201d running away when the voices she hears tell her that she or her child is in some kind of danger. On at least three occasions, apparently guided by her command hallucinations, appellant ran away: first into a parking lot on October 2, then when she fled from her home on October 7, and finally when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>she escaped from Providence on October 9 and traveled to the airport with the aim of flying to Arizona. Additionally, because of her mental disorder, appellant was \u201cout there, confused, [and] disorganized,\u201d and, at least on one occasion, was \u201cunable to provide any identifying information to people wanting to help her.\u201d The trial court was concerned that, given that history, appellant would eventually place herself in \u201charm\u2019s way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">However, as our cases have consistently emphasized, this sort of \u201cdelusional or eccentric behavior\u201d that appellant manifested, even if \u201cinherently risky * * * is not necessarily sufficient to warrant commitment.\u201d <em>See Olsen, </em>208 Or App at 691. Appellant\u2019s conduct in \u201cunpredictably and impulsively\u201d running away is not materially different from conduct that we have repeatedly held was insufficient to support civil commitment on a \u201c[d]angerous to self\u2019 basis. <em>See id. </em>at 692-93 (reversing civil commitment where evidence showed that the appellant exercised \u201cpoor judgment\u201d and had a tendency to \u201ctravel aimlessly\u201d); <em>Roberts, </em>183 Or App at 522 (reversing civil commitment where the appellant \u201cwandered] the streets in a confused state of mind\u201d). Further, nothing in the evidence establishes that appellant\u2019s \u201cunpredictable\u201d and \u201cimpulsive\u201d behavior resulted in any serious harm or substantial proximate risk of such harm, much less that a reoccurrence of such conduct will present a nonspeculative risk in the near future. Although appellant was physically injured when she tripped and fell while responding to the command hallucinations that told her to flee with her child, her resulting injury \u2014 some \u201ccuts, abrasions and discolored swelling * * * on her left che[e]k and above her left eye\u201d\u2014 was not the sort of \u201cserious,\u201d much less \u201clife-threatening,\u201d harm that our cases have required. <em>See, e.g., North, </em>189 Or App at 525 (evidence failed to show the appellant suffered \u201cany serious harm\u201d); <em>State v. Turel, </em>182 Or App 235, 242, 48 P3d 175 (2002) (evidence insufficient to show how the appellant\u2019s conduct \u201ccould present a life-threatening condition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In sum, the record in this case is legally insufficient to support a determination that, as a result of her mental disorder, appellant was \u201c[d]angerous to self,\u201d ORS 426.005(l)(e)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\"> As we recently explained in <em>D. R., </em>although we have historically reviewed civil commitment cases, like other equitable proceedings, \u201canew upon the record,\u201d ORS 19.415(3) (2007), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 2, the legislature modified that statute to change our standard of review for cases \u2014 like this one \u2014 in which the notice of appeal was filed on or after June 4, 2009. 239 Or App at 578-79 n 3. <em>See generally DHS v. Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold, </em>236 Or App 535, 538-39, 238 P3d 40 (2010) (discussing amendment). ORS 19.415(3)(b) now provides that, \u201c[u]pon an appeal in an equitable action or proceeding * * * the Court of Appeals, <em>acting in its sole discretion, </em>may try the cause anew upon the record or make one or more factual findings anew upon the record.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> Pursuant to a temporary amendment to ORAP 5.40, the Court of Appeals will exercise that discretion only in \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d ORAP 5.40(8)(c). Here (notwithstanding that the notice of appeal was filed on November 9, 2009), it appears that appellant erroneously assumed that our standard of review was <em>de novo </em>and did not request that we exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo, </em>much less explain why we should do so. Absent such a request and justification, and given the \u201cpresumption against the exercise of discretion\u201d to engage in <em>de novo </em>review, ORAP 5.40(8)(c), we do not engage in such review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\"> Appellant said that she knew about the girlfriend because she had heard voices from \u201coutside\u201d talking about her and that the voices had shown her the girlfriend \u201cin the distance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\"> B also testified regarding appellant\u2019s interactions with their child, some of which involved conduct that was arguably unsafe. However, the trial court ultimately declined to predicate commitment on a \u201cdanger to others\u201d ground based on that alleged conduct, and the state does not urge \u201cdanger to others\u201d as an alternative basis for affirmance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
