The state concedes that the trial court erred in that regard. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. J. F. B., </em>230 Or App 106, 115, 214 P3d 827 (2009) (holding that \u201c[t]he judgments\u2019 failure to find that none of the circumstances enumerated in ORS 419B.498(2) is applicable is fatal\u201d and concluding that, \u201c[b]ecause those judgments do not comply with the above statutes, they must be reversed and remanded\u201d). Accordingly, we reverse and remand without addressing mother\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Permanency judgment reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\"> Although mother also appeals the jurisdictional judgment in this case, she raises no issues concerning that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
