J.</author>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment revoking his probation, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to exclude hearsay evidence offered through his probation officer on the ground that the admission of that evidence violated his due process right to confront witnesses. <em>State v. </em>Johnson, 221 Or App 394, 190 P3d 455, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 418 (2008). We agree with defendant, and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The pertinent facts are few. The state filed a motion to revoke defendant\u2019s probation on the ground that defendant had violated a \u201cno contact\u201d order. At the hearing on the motion, defendant\u2019s probation officer, Hubbard, testified that he had \u201creceived a call from [the] Medford Police that [defendant] had been involved in a domestic dispute with his victim,\u201d and that he had received a follow-up call from that agency \u201cthat they had located [defendant] and he had admitted to violating his no contact provision.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the quoted testimony, arguing that it was hearsay and that its admission would violate defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him and, thus, it should be excluded under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The prosecutor replied, \u201c[W]e have always had hearsay in these hearings. This is no different.\u201d The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. The prosecutor did not adduce any further evidence, and defendant did not cross-examine Hubbard. The trial court found that defendant had violated his probation and revoked it. This appeal followed.-</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">We have recently summarized the state of the law in this area in <em>State v. Wibbens, </em>238 Or App 737, 741-42, 243 P3d 790 (2010):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201cAlthough a probationer is afforded fewer procedural safeguards than a defendant in a criminal trial, some due process protections attach to probation violation proceedings. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 US 471, 489, 92 S Ct 2593, 33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>L Ed 2d 484 (1972) (articulating requirements for parole revocation hearings); <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 US 778, 782, 93 S Ct 1756, 36 L Ed 2d 656 (1973) (extending requirements to probation revocation proceedings). Those protections include \u2018the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses,\u2019 unless the government shows good cause for not producing the witnesses. <em>Morrissey, </em>408 US at 489. That right, at its core, requires that a probationer \u2018receive a fair and meaningful opportunity to refute or impeach the evidence against him in order to \u201cassure that the finding of a [probation] violation will be based on verified facts.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Martin, </em>984 F2d 308, 310 (9th Cir 1993) (citations omitted). Nonetheless, due process in this setting is a flexible concept and confrontation may give way where other evidence provides an adequate alternative: \u2018While in some cases there is simply no adequate alternative to live testimony, we emphasize that we did not in <em>Morrissey </em>intend to prohibit use where appropriate of the conventional substitutes for live testimony, including affidavits, depositions, and documentary evidence.\u2019 <em>Gagnon, </em>411 US at 782 n 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">\u201cIn order to determine whether admission of hearsay evidence at a probation revocation proceeding violates a probationer\u2019s right to confrontation, we have adopted the Ninth Circuit\u2019s balancing approach, which weighs the probationer\u2019s interest in confrontation against the government\u2019s good cause for denying it. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>221 Or App 394, 401, 404, 190 P3d 455, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 418 (2008); <em>see also [United States v. Comito, </em>177 F3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir 1999)] (explaining general principles and applying balancing test). The relevant factors in that analysis include \u2018(1) the importance of the evidence to the court\u2019s finding; (2) the probationer\u2019s opportunity to refute the evidence; (3) the difficulty and expense of obtaining witnesses; and (4) traditional indicia of reliability borne by the evidence.\u2019 <em>Johnson, </em>221 Or App at 401 (citing <em>United States v. Walker, </em>117 F3d 417, 420 (9th Cir 1997)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cIn <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant\u2019s probation was revoked for violating conditions of probation that required him to report to his probation officer, follow the officer\u2019s directions, and inform the officer of his current address. <em>Id. </em>at 396. At the probation revocation hearing, the state offered the defendant\u2019s probation officer\u2019s sworn affidavit, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>attested to the defendant\u2019s failure to report and provide his address. The state also introduced the contents of the defendant\u2019s probation file through the testimony of another probation officer. <em>Id. </em>at 397. The defendant objected on the ground that the affidavit and testimony regarding the file were hearsay that, if admitted, would violate his due process right to confront witnesses against him. <em>Id. </em>The state, through its witness, asserted that the defendant\u2019s probation <em>officer </em>\u2014 i.e., the author of the affidavit and probation file \u2014 could not be produced on the originally scheduled hearing date because he was \u2018caught in traffic\u2019 and could not appear at the rescheduled hearing because he was \u2018ill.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>The trial court admitted the hearsay evidence over the defendant\u2019s objection. <em>Id. </em>at 398.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cApplying the balancing test on appeal, we held that the defendant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process right to confront adverse witnesses was not violated by admission of the hearsay evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 405-06. We explained that, although the challenged evidence was important to the state\u2019s case and the state made only a \u2018perfunctory\u2019 showing of why the declarant was unavailable, several other factors militated in favor of admitting the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 405. \u2018First, the evidence bore several traditional earmarks of reliability. Not only was the evidence admissible under a well-established exception to the hearsay rule, but it was also cabined in a sworn affidavit that subjected its author to penalty for false swearing.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>Second, we noted that the facts proved by the hearsay were \u2018few and straightforward\u2019 and did not involve matters of opinion or interpretation. <em>Id. </em>Third, the hearsay was partially corroborated. <em>Id. </em>Lastly, we explained that the defendant did not meaningfully challenge the evidence \u2014 thus, its admission did not prejudice him. <em>Id. </em>at 405-06.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 741-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In <em>Wibbens, </em>we concluded that the trial court had erred in allowing the defendant\u2019s probation officer to testify that he had received a telephone call from a sheriffs deputy who told him that the defendant \u201csmelled of alcohol\u201d and \u201cappeared to be intoxicated,\u201d in violation of a condition of the defendant\u2019s probation prohibiting him from using alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at 739. Applying the <em>Johnson </em>factors, we began by holding that the evidence was indispensable to the state\u2019s case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>because it was the \u201csole evidence relied on by the trial court in finding that defendant violated the conditions of his probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743. \u201cIt is equally clear,\u201d we explained, \u201cthat the state did not make even a perfunctory showing of why the declarant * * * could not be produced at the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With regard to the fourth <em>Johnson </em>factor \u2014 the reliability of the hearsay testimony \u2014 we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\">\u201c[The declarant\u2019s] unsworn oral allegation was hearsay that bore no characteristics of reliability. The statement was made during a telephone conversation. It was not contained in a report, affidavit, or other documentary substitute for live testimony. There is no recognized hearsay exception for the deputy\u2019s statement, and he is not subject to penalty if it proved to be false. <em>* </em>* * Moreover, the facts to be proved by the hearsay were based on [the declarant\u2019s] sensory perception (\u2018he <em>smelled </em>of alcohol\u2019 and \u2018he <em>appeared </em>to be intoxicated.\u2019 * * * Unlike the facts <em>in. Johnson, </em>they are matters that are subject to errors of judgment or interpretation. We know nothing about the bases for the deputy\u2019s factual conclusions or the context in which they were formed. Those observations are precisely the kind of unverified facts that the right to confrontation is designed to test. Furthermore, the hearsay evidence was not corroborated by any other source. So far as the record indicates, [the deputy] was the only person to observe defendant. There is no documentary evidence to support his conclusions. Indeed, there is no other evidence in this case whatsoever. Thus, given the failure to explain the witness\u2019s unavailability and the unreliability of the evidence, it seems that \u2018there is nothing at all to put on the Government\u2019s side of the scale.\u2019 <em>Comito, </em>177 F3d at 1172.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">\u201cFinally, although defendant did not present any of his own evidence to contravene the facts underlying the hearsay statement, defendant did both deny the charge and contest the accuracy and reliability of the evidence when he argued that the trial court did not know the basis of the deputy\u2019s conclusion and that the evidence was therefore insufficient. Without the deputy\u2019s presence, he could do little more \u2014 he did not have a meaningful opportunity to refute the hearsay evidence.* * * Given that the sole evidence of a probation violation was Tilley\u2019s hearsay statement, the state could not have met its burden without the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>of the hearsay evidence. For that reason, the admission of the hearsay was not harmless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 743-44 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Here, as in <em>Wibbens, </em>the challenged evidence consisted of unsworn oral assertions that constituted hearsay and, as in <em>Wibbens, </em>we conclude that those assertions did not bear adequate characteristics of reliability. The assertions were not \u201ccontained in a report, affidavit, or other documentary substitute for live testimony\u201d and did not satisfy any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We reject the state\u2019s attempt to qualify the unsworn assertions under the public records hearsay exception by virtue of the police report. That report was not received in evidence and, when Hubbard recited the challenged hearsay assertions, he did not state that he was relying on the police report. Indeed, Hubbard only mentioned the report after he was asked by the court if he had received such a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Moreover, the state failed to show why the police officers could not have been called to testify; the hearing took place at the Jackson County Courthouse in Medford, and the declarants were Medford police officers. As we explained in <em>Wibbens </em>\u2014 where the hearing took place at the Douglas County Courthouse and the declarant was a Douglas County sheriffs deputy \u2014 in this case \u201cthere is no basis to infer any excuse for [the declarants\u2019] absence,\u201d and, thus, that factor also weighs against admission of the hearsay evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 743. Moreover, without the opportunity to cross-examine the officers, defendant\u2019s ability to refute the evidence was severely impaired. Although defendant failed to assert that he had not violated the no contact order, his counsel did argue that, without the ability to cross-examine the officers, it was impossible to determine the veracity of the hearsay testimony. Accordingly, that factor also weighs against its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Finally, the hearsay assertions at issue here were central to the state\u2019s case; indeed, they were the only evidence that defendant had violated the no contact order, and, thus, the state could not have met its burden without them. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>follows that their admission was not harmless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Wibbens, </em>238 Or App at 744. Because all four of the <em>Johnson </em>factors weigh against admission of the hearsay evidence, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude that evidence. As we held in <em>Wibbens,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">\u201c[i]n light of the importance of defendant\u2019s interest in confrontation, and the absence of good cause for denying it, the balance weighs in favor of confrontation. Based on the <em>Johnson </em>factors, the admission of the hearsay evidence violated defendant\u2019s due process right to confront an adverse witness, and the trial court erred in admitting that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Id. </em>So too, here.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> Hubbard testified that he had received a police report detailing the incident, but that report was not offered or received into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> We reject the state\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s admission that he violated the no contact order during the dispositional phase of the hearing rendered admission of the hearsay harmless. When defendant made that admission, the trial court had already found him in violation of his probation. As the Ninth Circuit has explained, the due process right of a probationer to confront witnesses against him requires that a probationer \u201creceive a fair and meaningful opportunity to refute or impeach the evidence against him in order to \u2018assure that the <em>finding of a [probation] violation </em>will be based on verified facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>984 F2d 308, 310 (9th Cir 1993) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, an evaluation of the harmfulness of the admission of hearsay testimony encompasses the totality of the proceedings <em>prior </em>to the finding of a probation violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
