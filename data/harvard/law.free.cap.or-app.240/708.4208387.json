His driver\u2019s license was suspended at the time, as a result of a conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants. When he noticed a police car following him, defendant sped away down a residential street and turned off his car\u2019s headlights. Eventually, he ran a stop sign and collided with another car. The driver of the other car sustained severe injuries; she died 10 days later. Based on those events, defendant was tried and convicted for first-degree manslaughter, ORS 163.118; second-degree assault, ORS 163.175; driving under the influence of intoxicants, ORS 813.010; and driving while suspended, ORS 811.182(4). Defendant appeals his judgment of conviction for those crimes and raises five assignments of error. We write to address one of them \u2014 that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant to waive his right to a jury trial and to try the case to the court \u2014 and reject the others without discussion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Before trial, defendant asked the trial court for its consent to allow him to waive his right to a jury trial and to try the case to the court. The court denied the request after discussing it with the prosecutor and defense counsel in chambers. At the beginning of the trial, the following colloquy occurred about the pretrial discussion and the court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: * * * I would like to simply for the record point out that Article I, Section 11 of the Oregon Constitution sets out the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury trial and it specifically sets * * * out the defendant\u2019s right to waive a jury, with the Court\u2019s consent, I\u2019m aware of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">\u201cI understand the Court didn\u2019t grant that consent. I respect that. We\u2019re ready to proceed with a jury trial. I do want the record to reflect what happened yesterday, that we had a meeting in chambers, that the prosecutor objected to our waiver of a jury. In this case, the specific grounds were that he felt that the extreme indifference to the value of human life was a community standard that a jury and not a Judge should decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201cI would simply argue that it\u2019s a legal standard like any others that we\u2019re dealing with. The Court\u2019s certainly capable of determining whether the facts meet that or not. And I would just point out that I don\u2019t think the State has any authority to intervene or object to a waiver. That\u2019s a defendant\u2019s right, again, with the Court\u2019s consent. You made your decision, I accept that. But I bring this up because I believe that it will have some bearing, some relationship with what we\u2019ll talk about in terms of [the] causation issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Is there anything you want to say for the record on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Simply I \u2014 I didn\u2019t object. I just did \u2014 I did request that the Court exercise its discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Well, it\u2019s been my policy over the years to try to be in a situation where if someone had an objection to me acting as the finder of fact that I would not, in fact, act in that capacity. And, so, based upon the State\u2019s request here, I do not give my consent to \u2014 to allow the defendant to waive his right to jury trial and that\u2019s the end of the matter, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting his request to waive trial by jury. In defendant\u2019s view, the court effectively turned the decision whether to grant his jury-waiver request over to the state by denying the request on the basis that the state wanted to try the case to a jury rather than to the court. He reasons, in turn, that that conflicts with Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, as interpreted in <em>State v. Baker, </em>328 Or 355, 359-60, 976 P2d 1132 (1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Baker, </em>the court held that ORS 136.001,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which gives the state the right to a jury trial, conflicts with Article I, section 11, because the latter provision gives a defendant the right to waive a jury trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>subject only to the requirement that the trial court consent to the waiver. Hence, according to defendant, the trial court violated Article I, section 11, and thereby abused its discretion by relying on the state\u2019s request for a jury trial as the basis on which to reject defendant\u2019s jury-waiver request.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"> As noted, Article I, section 11, gives defendants in noncapital cases the right to waive a jury trial and be tried by the court. However, the trial court has discretion whether to grant such a request. <em>Baker, </em>328 Or at 364. Accordingly, we review for abuse <em>of </em>discretion a trial court\u2019s decision to deny a defendant\u2019s jury-waiver request. <em>Id. </em>Discretion \u201crefers to the authority of a trial court to choose among several legally correct outcomes.\u201d <em>Wells v. Santos, </em>211 Or App 413, 418, 155 P3d 887, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 160 (2007) (citing <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000)). \u201c \u2018If the trial court\u2019s decision was within the range of legally correct discretionary choices and produced a permissible, legally correct outcome, then the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rogers, </em>330 Or at 312).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Resolution of this case ultimately reduces to whether the trial court ceded to the state the decision whether to grant defendant\u2019s jury-waiver request. As the following discussion explains, we conclude that the record does not establish that the trial court did that.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The provision of Article I, section 11, at issue in this case \u2014 that is, the one that permits a defendant to waive the right to trial by jury in noncapital criminal cases \u2014 was adopted by Oregon voters as an amendment to the Oregon Constitution in the 1932 general election. The 1932 Voters\u2019 Pamphlet contained the following legislative explanation of the proposed amendment to Article I, section 11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">\u201cThe purpose of this proposed constitutional amendment is to permit the accused in criminal cases, with the consent of the trial judge, to waive trial by jury and be tried by judge alone. This would apply to trial of all crimes excepting capital offenses. <em>Although not expressly required by the wording of the amendment, it is nevertheless thought the consent of the district attorney should be obtained as well as that of the judge before whom the case may be tried.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201cUnder present requirements of the constitution, jury trial is compulsory in criminal cases. There are many cases that may be tried by judge, and without jury, speedily, economically and fully protecting the right of the accused. <em>The requirement that consent of accused and judge must both be obtained, with the suggestion that the approval of the district attorney be secured also in applying the measure, assure its carefully considered and reasonable use.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-4\">\u201cSimilar provisions are effective in many states. Rights of the state and accused are fully preserved and the adoption of the amendment should accomplish a substantial saving in the time and expense now incurred in criminal trials. Where adopted its use is general and the percentage of court trials has been large.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">\u201cIt should be kept in mind [that] the right to waive trial by jury, provided herein, applies only to criminal cases and requiring consent of accused and trial judge, cannot be used oppressively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Official Voters\u2019 Pamphlet, General Election, Nov 8, 1932, 6 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">As the Voters\u2019 Pamphlet statement indicates, the 1932 amendment to Article I, section 11, was principally intended to promote the efficient use of judicial resources in noncapital criminal cases by changing the constitutional rule that required criminal charges to be tried by a jury. <em>See also State v. Hambrick, </em>189 Or App 310, 322, 75 P3d 462 (2003) (Schuman, J., dissenting) (history of 1932 amendment to Article I, section 11, suggests that its primary purpose was to promote judicial economy). The statement also reveals that, although a defendant\u2019s election to waive jury trial in a non-capital criminal case depends on the consent of only the defendant and the court, the state\u2019s position on whether the court should grant a requested jury waiver was intended to be an appropriate factor for a court to consider in exercising its discretion to grant or deny a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">As defendant correctly asserts, if the trial court\u2019s decision was based simply on the fact that the state opposed defendant\u2019s jury-waiver request, that is, if the court effectively gave the state veto power over defendant\u2019s request, then the court\u2019s ruling violated Article I, section 11. That is because, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Baker, </em>Article I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>section 11, \u201cgrants to only one person the power to defeat a defendant\u2019s choice to be tried by the court sitting without a jury \u2014 the trial judge. The power to withhold consent is not granted to any other person or institution.\u201d 328 Or at 360. In this case, defendant points to the trial court\u2019s statement that it denied defendant\u2019s waiver \u201cbased upon the [s]tate\u2019s request,\u201d and asserts that the court\u2019s decision thus \u201cvitiated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d because it \u201cwas simply based on the state\u2019s objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s assertion because, viewed in context, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s statement is susceptible of an understanding that does not run afoul of Article I, section 11. The court said that its policy was \u201cto <em>try </em>to be in a situation where if someone had an objection to me acting as the finder of fact that I would not, in fact, act in that capacity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We understand that to mean that the court would not automatically and invariably accede to a party\u2019s objection to the court acting as a fact-finder. The statement implies that the court would consider the arguments and positions of the parties in making its decision on a jury-waiver request and might decide to act as the factfinder notwithstanding a party\u2019s objection. In other words, the court\u2019s decision to deny the motion to waive jury does not reflect an understanding that the court had no choice but to deny the waiver request simply because the state wanted to try the case to a jury. Accordingly, in light of the above considerations and on this record, we cannot conclude that the trial court ceded to the state the decision whether to grant defendant\u2019s waiver request and thereby violated Article I, section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal on the jury-waiver issue is that the court violated Article I, section 11, in denying his waiver request and thereby abused its discretion in acting on the request. He does not challenge the court\u2019s waiver decision on any other basis. Consequently, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the waiver request.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\"> Article I, section 11, provides, as pertinent, that \u201cany accused person, * * * with the consent of the trial judge, may elect to waive trial by jury and consent to be tried by the judge of the court alone[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\"> ORS 136.001 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">\u201c(1) The defendant and the state in all criminal prosecutions have the right to public trial by an impartial jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">\u201c(2) Both the defendant and the state may elect to waive trial by jury and consent to a trial by the judge of the court alone, provided that the election of the defendant is in writing and with the consent of the trial judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
