J.</author>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Under Oregon law, a public utility is allowed to build into its rates the amount that the utility expects to pay in income taxes. There was, for a long while, no regulatory mechanism to subsequently verify whether the utilitys tax projections \u2014 and the amount assumed in rates \u2014 bore any relationship to the amount of taxes actually paid by the utility. In 2005, the Oregon legislature passed a law intended to close that loophole, thereby prohibiting public utilities from charging ratepayers for taxes far in excess of what the utilities actually pay. The law requires a public utility to annually file a tax report with the Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC), which the commission then reviews to determine the difference between the amount of taxes assumed for rate-making purposes and taxes ultimately paid either by the utility or by the utility\u2019s affiliated corporate group that are \u201cproperly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility.\u201d ORS 757.268(4). If the commission determines that the difference between the taxes assumed in rates and the taxes paid is $100,000 or more, it triggers an automatic adjustment to the rate schedule, otherwise known as an \u201cautomatic adjustment clause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">This case involves an automatic adjustment clause that resulted from the PUC\u2019s review of the 2006 tax report filed by PacifiCorp, an Oregon-regulated utility that filed its 2006 federal income tax returns as part of an affiliated corporate group. Because PacifiCorp filed its 2006 tax returns as part of an affiliated corporate group, the PUC was required to determine what share of the taxes paid by the affiliated group was \u201cproperly attributed\u201d to PacifiCorp\u2019s Oregon-regulated activities. In doing so, the PUC applied its own administrative rule, OAR 860-022-0041, which establishes a methodology for determining the \u201camount of income taxes paid that is properly attributed to regulated operations of the utility.\u201d Applying that methodology, the PUC concluded that the taxes assumed in PacifiCorp\u2019s rates were actually considerably <em>less than </em>the taxes paid that were \u201cproperly attributed\u201d to PacifiCorp\u2019s regulated operations, thereby triggering a rate adjustment in favor of the utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>On judicial review, Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities (ICNU) \u2014 -intervenor in the proceedings below\u2014 challenges various aspects of the PUC\u2019s review of PacifiCorp\u2019s 2006 tax report. First, ICNU perceives an inconsistency between the authorizing statute, ORS 757.268, and the methodology set out in OAR 860-022-0041 for determining whether taxes paid are \u201cproperly attributed\u201d to the regulated operations of a utility; the rule, ICNU argues, impermissibly allows a utility to calculate its taxes based on \u201chypothetical numbers\u201d rather than actual tax payments, thereby thwarting the very purpose of the statute. Second, ICNU contends that the PUC abused its discretion in refusing to amend a protective order that, according to ICNU, unduly restricted its access to PacifiCorp\u2019s documents and made it impossible for ICNU to effectively participate in the PUC proceedings. And third, ICNU contends that the PUC acted inconsistently with the commission\u2019s own rules and delegated authority by striking the testimony of ICNU\u2019s expert. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">I. THE ADMINISTRATIVE SCHEME</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">At the center of this case is Senate Bill (SB) 408,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a bill aimed at closing the gap between what utilities were collecting from ratepayers for taxes and what the utilities were actually paying in taxes. The problem stemmed, for the most part, from the difference between the way that tax liability was calculated for ratemaking purposes and the way that it was calculated under state and federal tax laws. The PUC permitted a utility to charge ratepayers for \u201ctaxes that assume the utility is not part of an affiliated group of corporations for tax purposes.\u201d ORS 757.267(l)(c). In reality, however, utilities were filing their taxes as part of an affiliated corporate group, whereby losses from within the affiliated group had the potential to reduce or eliminate the utilities\u2019 tax liability. Under that system,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">\u201c[t]he parent company of a utility [could] employ accounting methods, debt, consolidated tax return rules and other techniques in a way that resultfed] in a difference between the tax liability paid to units of government by the utility, or the affiliated group of corporations of which the utility is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>a member, and the amount of taxes collected, directly or indirectly, from customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">ORS 757.267(l)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"> SB 408 represented a legislative effort to square the amount of taxes assumed in rates with the taxes actually paid by the utility or its affiliated corporate group \u2014 or, as legislators explained it, to \u201ctrue up\u201d the difference once the utility or its affiliated group had actually paid its taxes. To that end, SB 408 requires every Oregon public utility to \u201cfile a tax report with the Public Utility Commission annually, on or before October 15 following the year for which the report is being made\u201d that \u201ccontain[s] the information required by the commission,\u201d including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201c(a) The amount of taxes that was paid by the utility in the three preceding years, or that was paid by the affiliated group and that is properly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility, determined without regard to the tax year for which the taxes were paid; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201c(b) The amount of taxes authorized to be collected in rates for the three preceding years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">ORS 757.268(1). The commission then reviews that tax report and any other information that the commission has obtained. ORS 757.268(4). If, after reviewing the tax report and accompanying information, the commission determines that the \u201camount of taxes assumed in rates or otherwise collected from ratepayers for any of the three preceding years differed by $100,000 or more from the amount of taxes paid to units of government by the public utility, or by the affiliated group and properly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility,\u201d <em>id., </em>the commission must require the utility to adjust its rates to account for the difference. <em>See </em>ORS 757.268(6) (Adjustment shall ensure that \u201cratepayers are not charged for more tax than: (a) The utility pays to units of government and that is properly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility; or (b) In the case of an affiliated group, the affiliated group pays to units of government and that is properly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>In calculating what taxes are \u201cproperly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility\u201d for purposes of SB 408, the following limitation applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u201c[TJaxes paid that are properly attributed to the regulated operations of the public utility may not exceed the lesser of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201c(a) That portion of the total taxes paid that is incurred as a result of income generated by the regulated operations of the utility; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201c(b) The total amount of taxes paid to units of government by the utility or by the affiliated group, whichever applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">ORS 757.268(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The PUC, charged with implementing SB 408, adopted OAR 860-022-0041, which concerns the filing of utility tax reports and the commission\u2019s review of those reports. The rule, among other things, sets out a methodology for determining \u201c[t]he amount of income taxes paid that is properly attributed to regulated operations of the utility\u201d under SB 408. At this point, it is unnecessary to quote the technical rule in all its excruciating splendor; it suffices to say that the rule uses a multipart calculus to determine what taxes are \u201cproperly attributed\u201d to the utility, including, under section (3), what is known as the \u201capportionment methodology.\u201d As part of the \u201capportionment methodology,\u201d the rule establishes a floor \u2014 calculated, in part, from the utility\u2019s \u201cstandalone tax liability\u201d \u2014 below which the amount of \u201cproperly attributed\u201d taxes cannot fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The apportionment methodology in section (3) is, dizzyingly, only the beginning of the calculus under OAR 860-022-0041. The amount of \u201cproperly attributed\u201d taxes under section (3) of the rule is one of three figures in the required tax report that are then compared in order to determine which of the three is the <em>lowest </em>amount. OAR 860-022-0041(4)(d). The lowest of the three figures is then compared with the taxes that the utility collected in rates, in order to determine whether the utility has over- or under-collected for taxes. OAR 860-022-0041(4)(f). If that comparison yields a discrepancy of $100,000 or more, the commission then determines whether to implement a surcharge or surcredit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>through a rate adjustment to square the difference. OAR 860-022-0041(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">II. THE PUC PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">After SB 408 was passed by the legislature, the PUC opened a contested case proceeding, Docket UE 177, to examine PacifiCorp\u2019s tax reports on an annual basis and to order rate adjustments as necessary. <em>See </em>OAR 860-022-0041(7) (commission to establish an ongoing docket for tax report filings). ICNU intervened in that proceeding. In January 2006, the commission adopted a protective order to govern the review of PacifiCorp\u2019s confidential tax information by intervenors like ICNU. <em>See </em>ORS 757.267(l)(g) (recognizing, as part of SB 408, that \u201c[t]ax information of a business is commercially sensitive. Public disclosure of tax information could provide a commercial advantage to other businesses\u201d). The protective order went beyond the PUC\u2019s standard protective order and included such additional protections as a \u201csafe-room discovery mechanism\u201d whereby parties that had signed the protective order were permitted to inspect information designated \u201chighly confidential,\u201d but only in a safe room in Portland after 24 hours advance notice. Under the protective order, intervenors like ICNU were allowed to take limited notes but were not permitted to take \u201chighly confidential\u201d documents out of the safe room or make copies of those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">On October 15, 2007, PacifiCorp filed its 2006 tax report with the PUC pursuant to SB 408; the report was reviewed, like PacifiCorp\u2019s previous reports, as part of Docket UE 177. PacifiCorp was, for most of 2006, part of a group of affiliated companies that filed a 2006 federal income tax return as a single consolidated taxpayer, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. and Subsidiaries (Berkshire Hathaway). Using the methodology set out in OAR 860-022-0041, PacifiCorp reported that its share of taxes paid that were properly attributed to Oregon regulated operations for the 2006 tax period was $88.9 million.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> PacifiCorp further reported that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>had collected only $54.4 million of that amount in rates, and that a surcharge was necessary under SB 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">ICNU, meanwhile, opposed the requested surcharge. ICNU\u2019s access to PacifiCorp\u2019s tax information, however, was significantly limited by the protective order that had been in place in Docket UE 177. In December 2007, ICNU moved to modify the protective order, arguing that the restrictions of that order \u201cmade it impossible for ICNU to effectively participate in these proceedings.\u201d Specifically, ICNU argued that it was unworkable for its consultant, who lived in Texas, to be limited to viewing PacifiCorp\u2019s documents in a Portland safe room, and that the consultant would not be able to review and understand the tax report in time to prepare testimony by the due date in January 2008. Accordingly, ICNU requested the protective order be modified so that its consultant could obtain copies of the relevant information or view the documents in a safe room in Texas. The PUC denied the motion, adhering to its earlier determination that the safe-room discovery procedure was necessary and concluding that \u201cICNU has failed to provide an adequate basis to amend or eliminate those safeguards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In January 2008, ICNU filed testimony by its Texas consultant, Blumenthal, which focused primarily on whether OAR 860-022-0041, and, in particular, the rule\u2019s use of the apportionment methodology and \u201cstand-alone tax liability,\u201d was consistent with the legislative mandate in SB 408. PacifiCorp, in response, moved to strike portions of Blumenthal\u2019s testimony, arguing that much of her testimony consisted of \u201clegal argument\u201d rather than facts or expert opinion and that, in any event, the testimony was not relevant to any issues in the proceeding. An administrative law judge (ALJ) agreed with PacifiCorp and granted the motion. At a subsequent hearing, ICNU objected to the ALJ\u2019s ruling and was permitted to make an offer of proof regarding Blumenthal\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">On April 11,2008, the PUC entered its final order on PacifiCorp\u2019s 2006 tax report. In that order, the commission adopted PacifiCorp\u2019s 2006 tax report, as modified by PUC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>staffs recommendations, and determined that a rate adjustment was appropriate, in the form of a $34.5 million surcharge to ratepayers. The commission explicitly \u201cdisregarded] ICNU\u2019s arguments\u201d with respect to the validity of OAR 860-022-0041, reasoning that \u201ca separate proceeding is the proper procedure\u201d for challenging the validity of the rule. ICNU then sought judicial review of the final order, arguing, in part, that the PUC erred in refusing to address the validity of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">After ICNU filed its opening brief in this court, the PUC elected to reconsider the final order and withdrew its previous refusal to consider ICNU\u2019s challenge to OAR 860-022-0041. In its order on reconsideration, the PUC considered and rejected the substance of ICNU\u2019s rule challenge. ICNU then sought judicial review of the order on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">III. ISSUES ON JUDICIAL REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In light of the PUC\u2019s order on reconsideration, there are three issues before us: (1) the validity of OAR 860-022-0041; (2) the motion to amend the protective order; and (3) the exclusion of Blumenthal\u2019s testimony. We begin with ICNU\u2019s challenge to OAR 860-022-0041.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In its first assignment of error, ICNU argues that OAR 860-022-0041 \u201cshould be invalidated because it fails to implement the policy directive of SB 408.\u201d We review the rule to determine whether it \u201c[e]xceeds the statutory authority of the agencyL]\u201d ORS 183.400(4)(b). In doing so, we look to \u201cthe wording of the rule itself (read in context) and the statutory provisions authorizing the rule.\u201d <em>Wolf v. Oregon Lottery Commission, </em>344 Or 345, 355, 182 P3d 180 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">As we understand ICNU\u2019s challenge, it reduces to this: The rule calculates \u201cproperly attributed\u201d taxes in terms of a utility\u2019s \u201cstand-alone tax liability,\u201d a \u201cfiction\u201d that fails to reflect the taxes actually paid by the utility. As discussed above, OAR 860-022-0041 uses a multipart calculus to determine whether a utility has overcharged or undercharged its ratepayers for taxes. Part of that calculus, section (3) of the rule, employs the \u201capportionment methodology.\u201d That section provides, in part, that the \u201camount of income taxes paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that is properly attributed to regulated operations of the utility is calculated as follows\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">\u201c(a) The amount of federal income taxes paid to units of government that is properly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility is the product of the values in paragraphs (3)(a)(A) and (B), subject to subsection (3)(b) of this rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u201c(A) The total amount of federal income taxes paid by the federal taxpayer, to which is added:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u201c(i) The current tax benefit, at the statutory federal income tax rate, of tax depreciation on public utility property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201c(ii) The tax benefits associated with federal investment tax credits related to public utility property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">\u201c(iii) Imputed tax benefits on charitable contributions and IRC section 45 renewable electricity production tax credits of the affiliated group, except those tax benefits or credits associated with regulated operations of the utility; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">\u201c(B) The average of the ratios calculated for the utility\u2019s gross plant, wages and salaries and sales, using amounts allocated to regulated operations of the utility as set forth in the utility\u2019s results of operations report in the numerator and amounts for the federal taxpayer in the denominator^]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">OAR 860-022-0041(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In less sophisticated terms, subsection (3)(a) provides that the amount of \u201ctaxes paid to units of government that is properly attributed to regulated operations of the utility\u201d is the product of two things: (1) the actual taxes paid by the parent corporation and (2) the average ratio of the utility\u2019s reported plant costs, wages and salaries, and sales, to the parent company\u2019s costs in each of those three categories.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The following subsection \u2014 which is the focus of much of ICNU\u2019s argument \u2014 then qualifies that calculation, and it does so in terms of \u201cstand-alone tax liability\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">\u201cThe amount of federal income taxes paid that is properly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility under subsection (3)(a) of this rule <em>shall not he less than </em>the amount of the federal stand-alone tax liability calculated for the regulated operations of the utility, reduced by the product of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201c(A) The imputed negative tax associated with all federal income tax losses of entities in the utility\u2019s federal taxpayer group; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201c(B) The average of the ratios for the utility\u2019s gross plant, wages and salaries and sales, using amounts allocated to the regulated operations of the utility as set forth in the utility\u2019s results of operations report in the numerator and amounts for the system regulated operations in the denominator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">OAK 860-022-0041(3)(b) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In other words, subsection (3)(b) starts with \u201cstand-alone tax liability\u201d to establish a floor beneath which the amount of \u201cfederal income taxes paid that is properly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility under subsection (3)(a)\u201d shall not fall. \u201cStand-alone tax liability,\u201d meanwhile, is defined in the rule as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">\u201cthe amount of income tax liability calculated using a pro forma tax return and revenues and expenses in the utility\u2019s results of operations report for the year, except using zero depreciation expense for public utility property, excluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>any tax effects from investment tax credits, and calculating interest expense in the manner used by the Commission in establishing rates[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-3\">OAR 860-022-0041(2)(p).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">ICNU argues that, because the floor in subsection (3)(b) is based on tax <em>liability </em>instead of taxes <em>paid, </em>the rule has the potential to establish an artificially inflated amount for \u201ctaxes paid.\u201d According to ICNU,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">\u201c[i]n essence, the Rule either makes the phrase \u2018taxes paid\u2019: a) a fiction by aligning it with fictional tax liability; or b) the Rule literally mandates an unnecessary inflation of actual taxes paid, with ratepayers forced to bear the burden of excessive costs. Either result is contrary to the intent of SB 408.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The PUC and PacifiCorp respond- \u2014 correctly, in our view \u2014 that ICNU ignores the context of subsection (3)(b). Read in isolation, subsection (3)(b) appears to operate as ICNU contends, <em>i.e., </em>it appears to establish a \u201cstand-alone tax liability\u201d calculation that equals or exceeds the amount of \u201ctaxes paid\u201d by the utility\u2019s affiliated group. However, when read in conjunction with the rest of the rule \u2014 and, in particular, section (4) of the rule \u2014 it is apparent that subsection (3) (b) does not have that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Once again, the \u201capportionment methodology\u201d under section (3) is merely one of the myriad, alternative calculations under OAR 860-022-0041 that are used to generate the share of taxes paid that is \u201cproperly attributed\u201d to the regulated operations of a utility. <em>See </em>OAR 860-022-0041(2)(j) (\u201c \u2018Properly attributed\u2019 means the share of taxes paid that is apportioned to the regulated operations of the utility as calculated in section (3), <em>subject to subsections (4)(a), (4)(b), (4) (g) and (4)(h), of this rule[.T </em>(Emphasis added.)). Section (4) of OAR 860-022-0041, sets forth the information that must be contained in a utility\u2019s tax report, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">\u201c(a) The amount of federal and state income taxes paid to units of government by the taxpayer, as adjusted pursuant to subparagraphs (3)(a)(A)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u201c(b) The amount of the utility\u2019s federal and state income taxes paid that is incurred as a result of income generated by the regulated operations of the utility * * * [calculated in terms of federal and state stand-alone tax liability];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">\u201c(c) The amount of federal and state income taxes paid to units of government by the taxpayer that is properly attributed to the regulated operations of the utility, as calculated in section (3) of this rule[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The amounts under (4)(a), (b), and (c) are then compared to one another to determine which of the three is the <em>lowest </em>amount, OAR 860-022-0041(4)(d), and that lowest figure then becomes the benchmark for determining whether a rate adjustment is necessary. OAR 860-022-0041(4)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Importantly, the amount under subsection (4)(a) corresponds to the actual tax payments by the taxpayer or its affiliated group.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, if the amount of taxes paid by the federal taxpayer is <em>lower than </em>the amount of the \u201cfloor\u201d calculation under subsection (3)(b), the PUC will not use the subsection (3)(b) calculation. In other words, subsection (4)(a) prevents the \u201cstand-alone tax liability\u201d floor under subsection (3)(b) from exceeding actual tax payments by the federal taxpayer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We turn, briefly, to another thread of argument that runs throughout ICNU\u2019s first assignment of error: that the rule involves a \u201cfictional\u201d accounting because it uses a methodology that merely \u201capproximates\u201d the amount of taxes that are actually paid by the utility. That argument, as the PUC and PacifiCorp correctly point out, conflates two different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>concepts under SB 408: \u201ctaxes paid\u201d by the utility or a consolidated taxpayer, and those \u201cproperly attributed\u201d to the utility. SB 408 plainly contemplates that, when a utility does not itself make a tax payment to units of government but instead does so as part of an affiliated group, it is necessary to \u201cproperly attribute,\u201d to the utility, part of the \u201ctaxes paid\u201d by the consolidated taxpayer. In that circumstance, there are no \u201ctaxes paid\u201d by the utility itself, and any effort to \u201cproperly attribute\u201d the payment to the utility is a type of legal fiction. The PUC adopted a different legal fiction from the one ICNU desired, but we are not persuaded that the PUC exceeded its statutory authority in doing so. Accordingly, we reject ICNU\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We turn, then, to ICNU\u2019s contention that the PUC committed reversible error in refusing to modify the protective order that governed ICNU\u2019s review of PacifiCorp documents. That protective order, as previously described, prohibited ICNU\u2019s consultant, Blumenthal, from viewing PacifiCorp\u2019s \u201chighly confidential\u201d information anywhere but in the Portland safe room. On judicial review, ICNU argues that the commission\u2019s decision to deny its motion to amend the protective order was (1) outside the range of the commission\u2019s delegated discretion and (2) was not supported by substantial evidence or reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Our review of PUC orders is the same as our review of orders in contested cases. ORS 756.610(1). Thus, we must determine whether the commission\u2019s order embodies an exercise of discretion that is \u201c[o]utside the range of discretion delegated to the agency by law,\u201d and whether \u201cthe order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(b)(A), (c). In conducting our review, we bear in mind that we may not substitute our judgment for that of the commission \u201cas to any issue of fact.\u201d ORS 183.482(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The protective order at issue in this case was already in place in Docket UE 177 when PacifiCorp filed its tax report in October 2007. <em>See </em>ORS 757.268(11) (expressly authorizing PUC to prepare a protective order governing disclosure of sensitive tax information to intervenors). Two months after that report was filed, ICNU filed a motion to amend the protective order, requesting that Blumenthal \u201cbe allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>have a copy of the tax report, workpapers, and discovery materials in her possession under strict confidentiality or to have the documents be kept in a Safe Room in Houston, Texas.\u201d ICNU argued that the protective order had made it impossible to \u201ceffectively participate\u201d as an intervenor in the proceedings, considering that \u201cthe corporate structure that PacifiCorp is a part of is extremely complex\u201d and a thorough examination of the 2006 tax report would \u201cinvolve a significantly greater amount of time compared to other utilities subject to the requirements of Senate Bill 408[.]\u201d Moreover, ICNU argued, \u201cit is simply cost prohibitive to have [Blumenthal] be located in Portland, Oregon while preparing her testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The PUC denied ICNU\u2019s motion to amend the protective order on a number of grounds. First, the PUC explained that, in initially adopting the protective order, the commission had \u201cacknowledged the inconvenience imposed by the use of a safe room\u201d but that \u201cthe potential harm of the public release of the highly confidential information outweighed the inconvenience to parties.\u201d The PUC then described various other provisions that had been added to the protective order to alleviate some of that inconvenience, including restricting the type of information that could be designated \u201chighly confidential,\u201d requiring utilities to designate one person to coordinate all scheduling matters, and requiring a private conference room to be provided adjacent to the safe room. \u201cFinally,\u201d the PUC explained, \u201cwe recognized the difficulties presented by the use of an out-of-state consultant, encouraged the utilities to make special arrangements to address such situations, and indicated that we would entertain a request for increased intervenor funding to cover additional expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">After describing those efforts to reduce the burden of the protective order when it was first adopted \u2014 and noting that it had \u201calready approved ICNU\u2019s request for increased intervenor funding based, in part, on its stated need to cover additional expenses resulting from the Protective Order\u201d\u2014 the PUC concluded that ICNU\u2019s arguments did not \u201cwarrant an amendment to the Protective Order.\u201d Indeed, the PUC concluded that, if anything, ICNU had demonstrated a need for even greater protection of the tax documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201cGranted, PacifiCorp\u2019s filing is complex due to the utility\u2019s inclusion in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s consolidated tax group. This fact, however, actually increases the need for heightened protection. The harm resulting from any disclosure\u2014 whether intentional or inadvertent \u2014 has increased, as PacifiCorp\u2019s tax report now contains sensitive tax information from the hundreds of unregulated companies that are included in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s consolidated filing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The PUC, however, offered another independent reason to deny the motion. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d the PUC ruled, \u201cany party seeking to amend a Protective Order must show that it has made a reasonable attempt to work within the Protective Order procedures before filing its motion.\u201d The PUC found the facts relevant to that issue to be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">\u201cICNU was aware that PacifiCorp would make its tax filing on October 15, 2007, and that the terms of the Protective Order required review of that report in the Portland safe room. ICNU was also aware that SB 408 provides the parties and the Commission with a relatively short amount of time in which to review the tax reports, and agreed to a procedural schedule requiring intervenors to file opening testimony on January 22, 2008. Despite this knowledge, ICNU did not retain a consultant \u2014 local or otherwise \u2014 until after the tax report was filed. ICNU also failed to participate in two informal workshops conducted by Staff, and did not visit the Portland safe room to review the tax report until December. Furthermore, based on PacifiCorp\u2019s unrebutted assertions, ICNU also cut short a December 4, 2007, meeting between its consultant and PacifiCorp, did not request an overview or general explanation of PacifiCorp\u2019s tax report, and failed to take advantage of PacifiCorp\u2019s offer to provide copies of documents that did not contain tax data of unregulated third parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Based on those findings, the PUC concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201cICNU\u2019s claim that it does not have sufficient time to review PacifiCorp\u2019s tax report and prepare effective testimony is not persuasive. Given ICNU\u2019s awareness of the safe-room restrictions, the complexity of PacifiCorp\u2019s corporate structure, and the SB 408 time constraints, ICNU could have acted earlier in hiring a consultant and commenced discovery immediately after PacifiCorp filed its report. We agree with PacifiCorp that the protections afforded the highly confidential tax information should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>be compromised because ICNU waited so long to become fully engaged in this docket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">\u201cWe adhere to our prior conclusion that the safe-room discovery mechanism is required to protect the highly confidential tax information contained in PacifiCorp\u2019s tax report and supporting information. ICNU has failed to provide an adequate basis to amend or eliminate those safeguards. Accordingly, ICNU\u2019s petition to amend [the protective order] is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">By denying the motion to amend the protective order, ICNU argues, the PUC acted outside the range of its delegated discretion under SB 408, which expressly addresses the subject of protective orders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">\u201cThe commission may not use the tax information obtained by the commission under this section for any purpose other than those described in subsections (1) to (10) of this section. An intervenor in a commission proceeding to review the tax report or make rate adjustments described in this section may, <em>upon signing a protective order prepared by the commission, obtain and use the information obtained by the commission that is not otherwise required to be made publicly available under this section, according to the terms of the protective order.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">ORS 757.268(11) (emphasis added). The PUC order exceeds the scope of authority delegated under that statute, according to ICNU, because \u201cSB 408 expressly permits the very right that the [commission] denied \u2014 possession and use of all utility tax report information.\u201d Furthermore, ICNU argues, the PUC denied the motion to amend after concluding that a \u201csafe-room discovery mechanism\u201d was <em>\u201crequired </em>to protect the highly confidential tax information contained in PacifiCorp\u2019s tax report and supporting information,\u201d and the PUC\u2019s order does not include facts or reasoning sufficient to justify that conclusion. (Emphasis by ICNU.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The problem with ICNU\u2019s arguments on judicial review is that they do not track with its own motion or the PUC\u2019s ruling on that motion. The issue before the PUC was not solely whether the safe-room restrictions were consistent with the language in SB 408, or whether those restrictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>were \u201crequired\u201d in the first instance; those issues previously had been litigated and addressed by an earlier PUC order. Thus, ICNU\u2019s motion to amend posed a different question in a different procedural posture: whether the protective order should be amended because the safe room restriction had proved unworkable under later circumstances and was preventing ICNU from preparing its written testimony by the January 2008 due date.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">When the PUC\u2019s order is viewed in its proper context as a motion to amend an earlier order, we are not persuaded that the commission acted outside the range of its delegated authority or failed to ground its decision in substantial evidence. The PUC\u2019s authority to amend an earlier order is a product of statute. ORS 756.568 provides that the PUC \u201cmay at any time, upon notice to the public utility or telecommunications utility and after opportunity to be heard as provided in ORS 756.500 to 756.610, rescind, suspend or amend any order made by the commission.\u201d The text of the rule \u2014 the PUC \u201cmay\u201d rescind, suspend, or amend any order \u2014 grants the commission broad discretion in that regard; nothing in the statute <em>requires </em>the PUC to amend an earlier order, particularly if there are prudential reasons not to do so. In this case, the PUC exercised its discretion <em>not </em>to amend the protective order on the ground that ICNU had failed to show (1) that anything had materially changed since its earlier order and (2) that the safe-room mechanism \u2014 as opposed to ICNU\u2019s own lack of diligence \u2014 had been the source of ICNU\u2019s difficulties in reviewing PacifiCorp\u2019s tax report.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We agree with PacifiCorp and the PUC that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s justifications for denying the motion to amend \u2014 most notably, evidence that ICNU had not taken advantage of options that either the commission or PacifiCorp had provided that would have alleviated some of the burden of the safe-room procedure. As the PUC points out in its order, the record contains \u201cunrebutted assertions\u201d by PacifiCorp to the effect that ICNU \u201ccut short a December 4, 2007, meeting between its consultant and PacifiCorp, did not request an overview or general explanation of PacifiCorp\u2019s tax report, and failed to take advantage of PacifiCorp\u2019s offer to provide copies of documents that did not contain tax data of unregulated third parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ICNU, for its part, never engages on judicial review with that evidence. Instead, ICNU attempts to explain away the commission\u2019s \u201cextensive critique of ICNU\u2019s \u2018attempt to work within the Protective Order\u2019 \u201d on the ground that it is \u201cbeside the point\u201d because \u201cthat fact would do nothing to support [the PUC\u2019s] conclusion that a safe room mechanism is ineluctably \u2018required\u2019 to protect PacifiCorp\u2019s information.\u201d ICNU, however, miscasts the PUC\u2019s order. The PUC\u2019s order did not answer, on a blank slate, the question whether the safe-room discovery mechanism was \u201cineluctably required.\u201d Quoted in full, the sentence on which ICNU relies states, \u201cWe <em>adhere to our prior conclusion </em>that the safe-room discovery mechanism is required to protect the highly confidential tax information contained in PacifiCorp\u2019s tax report and supporting information.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The next sentence of the order is even more explicit as to the basis for the PUC\u2019s denial of the motion to amend: \u201cICNU has failed to provide an adequate basis to amend or eliminate those safeguards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In short, ICNU frames the wrong inquiry. The question before us is not whether the PUC\u2019s initial protective order was too broad in the first instance, or whether it would have been the better course for the PUC to dial back the restrictions. Rather, the questions before us are whether the commission acted within its statutory authority in denying ICNU\u2019s motion to amend its earlier order, and whether it sufficiently grounded its order on substantial evidence. So framed, we agree with PacifiCorp and the PUC that the commission acted within its statutory authority, and that its order is supported by substantial evidence and substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In its final assignment, ICNU contends that the PUC erred by excluding Blumenthal\u2019s testimony regarding the validity of OAR 860-022-0041 and the legality of the protective order. As previously discussed, the PUC initially refused to consider ICNU\u2019s rule challenge but, on reconsideration, reversed course and addressed the merits of that challenge. In reconsidering the rule challenge, the PUC also revisited its earlier exclusion of Blumenthal\u2019s testimony regarding the rule and, the second time around, considered her testimony. For that reason, the PUC argues, ICNU\u2019s final assignment of error is now moot as to Blumenthal\u2019s testimony regarding the validity of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ICNU, however, does not agree that the order on reconsideration resolved this assignment of error. Although the PUC considered Blumenthal\u2019s testimony, it considered it as \u201ccomment\u201d rather than \u201cevidence.\u201d For that reason, ICNU argues, the PUC\u2019s order on reconsideration did not actually cure its earlier error, and ICNU\u2019s final assignment of error\u2014 that Blumenthal\u2019s testimony should have been admitted <em>as evidence </em>\u2014 remains a live issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">ICNU, however, does not explain how the distinction that it draws \u2014 between considering the testimony as \u201ccomment\u201d as opposed to \u201cevidence\u201d \u2014 had any effect on the lawfulness of the PUC\u2019s order in this case. Nothing in the record suggests that the PUC would have attributed any different weight to Blumenthal\u2019s testimony had it been labeled differently. For that reason, we decline to address ICNU\u2019s assignment of error as to Blumenthal\u2019s testimony concerning the validity of OAR 860-022-0041.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The PUC also excluded Blumenthal\u2019s testimony regarding the infirmities of the protective order. The commission reasoned that, because the motion to amend the protective order had already been denied, Blumenthal\u2019s subsequent testimony regarding the protective order was no longer relevant to an issue in the case. As part of its final assignment of error, ICNU argues that, because the earlier order denying the motion to amend the protective order was erroneous, the PUC likewise erred in excluding Blumenthal\u2019s later testimony regarding the protective order. We have already rejected ICNU\u2019s predicate argument regarding the denial of the motion to amend, and we therefore reject this contingent argument as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> The bill was enacted as Oregon Laws 2005, chapter 845, sections 2 to 5, parts of which are codified at ORS 757.267, ORS 757.268, and ORS 757.210.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> PacifiCorp reported $86.9 million in its original tax report but later revised that figure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\"> The approach in subsection (3)(a) of the rule \u2014 which pertains to federal income taxes \u2014 is mirrored in other subsections regarding state and local taxes.
