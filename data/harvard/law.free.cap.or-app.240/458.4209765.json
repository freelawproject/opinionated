He raises three assignments of error on appeal: (1) the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences for the felon in possession convictions; (2) the trial court erred in entering two separate convictions on the felon in possession charges; and (3) the trial court erred in entering two separate convictions of first-degree burglary. We reject defendant\u2019s first two assignments of error without discussion and write only to address defendant\u2019s third assignment of error. As to that assignment, defendant contends that, under <em>State v. White, </em>341 Or 624, 147 P3d 313 (2006), the trial court committed plain error when it entered two separate burglary convictions based on the same incident and differing only with respect to the crime that defendant was alleged to have intended to commit in the burglarized building. The state concedes that the record in this case \u201csupports a finding of only a single entry into the victim\u2019s home\u201d and that, under <em>White, </em>the trial court plainly erred in entering two separate burglary convictions. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>See State v. Sauceda, </em>236 Or App 358, 239 P3d 996 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a single conviction for first-degree burglary, reflecting that defendant was convicted on multiple theories, and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
