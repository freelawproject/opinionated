J.</author>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Defendant, who was convicted of first-degree assault, ORS 163.185, appeals, raising three assignments of error. We write to address only defendant\u2019s first assignment, which challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA). As amplified below, we conclude that (a) the evidence was legally insufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction on the sole theory that the state argued to the jury, <em>viz., </em>that defendant was liable for aiding and abetting a first-degree assault perpetrated by another person; and (b) in the circumstances of this case, defendant\u2019s conviction cannot be affirmed on a theory of principal liability that was never litigated or presented to the jury. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for first-degree assault and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In reviewing the denial of an MJOA, we view the facts and reasonable attendant inferences in the light most favorable to the state. <em>See State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998). Consistently with that standard, the facts material to our review are as follows: On New Year\u2019s Eve 2007, defendant, Nicholas Cufaude, and the victim were all guests at a party. All three were intoxicated, and the host provided methamphetamine to all three. Thereafter, when the host and the victim became involved in a physical confrontation, Cufaude intervened and knocked the victim down with one or two punches. Cufaude, who was wearing steel-toed boots, then kicked the victim three or four times in the face, \u201clike somebody kicking a football.\u201d A bystander intervened to pull Cufaude away from the victim, who was unconscious. Cufaude then walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Defendant and the victim had a hostile relationship. As Cufaude assaulted the victim, defendant stood nearby, without participating. Approximately a minute and a half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>after Cufaude had been pulled away, defendant approached the victim, who was lying face up, and \u201cstomped\u201d him on the chest \u201ca couple of times.\u201d Defendant then rolled the victim over, so that he was face down, grabbed his hair, and then \u201cpile-drived\u201d or \u201cslammed\u201d the victim\u2019s face into the muddy ground several times, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t ever disrespect me again.\u201d Finally, and before stopping, defendant punched the victim in the face several times in the same area where the victim had been kicked by Cufaude. After bystanders carried the victim away for medical care, defendant and Cufaude \u201chigh-fived,\u201d congratulating each other. There was, however, no evidence that defendant and Cufaude had jointly planned or otherwise coordinated their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The victim suffered, among other injuries, a fractured right eye socket, which required reconstructive surgery, several other facial fractures, including to his jaw, and a lacerated arterial vein in his left temple. Ultimately, at trial, no expert medical testimony was presented relating or apportioning those injuries, or their degree or severity, to Cufaude\u2019s and defendant\u2019s respective conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Defendant and Cufaude were both charged with, <em>inter alia, </em>first-degree assault. ORS 163.185.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The indictment charging defendant alleged, without elaboration, that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and intentionally cause serious physical injury to [the victim] by means of a dangerous weapon,\u201d without referring to either principal or accomplice liability. Although Cufaude waived a jury, and defendant did not, the two were tried jointly; thus, defendant was tried before a jury while Cufaude was tried simultaneously before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In opening statement, the prosecutor propounded the state\u2019s exclusive contention that defendant was guilty of first-degree assault by reason of having aided and abetted Cufaude\u2019s assault on the victim. Specifically: (1) Cufaude, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>principal, had employed a \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d his steel-toed boots \u2014 \u201c[i]n this case the weapons are the steel-toed work boots that Mr. Cufaude was wearing\u201d \u2014 to inflict \u201cserious physical injuries\u201d to the victim; and (2) defendant, through his own conduct, had aided and abetted that assault by \u201ccompound[ing]\u201d the injuries that Cufaude had inflicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state did not contend that defendant could be alternatively and independently liable for first-degree assault as a principal \u2014 -and, particularly, did not identify any \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d other than Cufaude\u2019s steel-toed boots.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, contending, in part, that the only dangerous weapon in the case was Cufaude\u2019s steel-toed boots and that the state had failed to establish a legally cognizable connection between those boots and defendant, in that defendant\u2019s conduct with respect to the victim \u201cwas subsequent to, not in conjunction with, Mr. Cufaude.\u201d In that regard, defense counsel emphasized that \u201cthere is really no evidence that the two were colluding on this\u201d and that \u201cwhat we have according to the state\u2019s evidence at this point is sequential events.\u201d Defense counsel concluded, \u201c[T]hey must tie him in through an aiding and abetting theory to Mr. Cufaude, but they\u2019ve failed to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In opposing the MJOA, the state adhered to, and reiterated, its aid-and-abet theory against defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">\u201cIn the light most favorable to the state, the first defendant, Mr. Cufaude, used a dangerous weapon, which if the court has felt those, they weigh about five pounds each, to kick in the face of the victim. His intent was to seriously injure the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201cThe question for the court is in the light most favorable to the state did an act on the part of [defendant] further that injury, further that goal on the part of the codefendant and it absolutely did, because he went for the same place. He\u2019s taken his fist and poundfed] him in the face, turning his head over and slamming it into the ground and that clearly, by an act, made easier the commission, furthered the commission, of the injury caused by Mr. Cufaude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The state did not contend that, regardless of the sufficiency of the evidence as to accessory liability, the evidence was alternatively sufficient to establish defendant\u2019s independent culpability as a principal for first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The trial court denied the motion. In so ruling, the court noted that \u201cthe boots can be considered a dangerous weapon\u201d and that, viewing the evidence most favorably to the state, there was a triable issue of fact for the jury as to \u201cwhether or not there was aiding and abetting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In closing argument to the jury, as throughout the case, the state relied solely on a theory of accomplice liability. Again, the prosecutor referred to Cufaude\u2019s boots \u2014 and only those boots \u2014 as the referent and requisite \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d Again, as in opening statement, the prosecutor referred at length to principles of accomplice liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Again, there was no suggestion that defendant could be independently culpable, as a principal, for first-degree assault.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The jury, which received standard instructions on accomplice liability, convicted defendant of first-degree assault, and the court imposed a Ballot Measure 11-prescribed sentence of 90 months\u2019 imprisonment, with three years of post-prison supervision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">On appeal, defendant, reiterating his arguments before the trial court, contends that the court erred in denying his MJOA. The gravamen of defendant\u2019s position is that Cufaude\u2019s assault on the victim, involving the use of a dangerous weapon, was completed before defendant had any physical contact with the victim and, consequently, in the absence of any evidence of cooperative or concerted action, he cannot be deemed to have aided and abetted that already completed first-degree assault. Defendant contends that we should remand with instructions to the trial court to enter a judgment of acquittal on Count 1 or, failing that, we should vacate defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The state, as respondent, does not attempt to dispute defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish accomplice liability. Rather, the state asserts that the denial of the MJOA must be sustained because there was sufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s conviction, albeit on a theory that the state never presented in the trial <em>court </em>\u2014 viz., that defendant could be liable as a <em>principal </em>with respect to his own <em>seriatim </em>first-degree assault on the victim. Specifically, the state posits, for the first time, that (1) by analogy to <em>State v. Reed, </em>101 Or App 277, 279, 790 P2d 551, <em>rev den, </em>310 Or 195 (1990) (concrete sidewalk was a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d when the defendant struck the victim\u2019s head against it), the muddy ground into which defendant \u201cpile-drived\u201d the victim\u2019s head was a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d; and (2) a trier of fact could reasonably infer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>that the victim had suffered serious physical injuries as a result of defendant\u2019s use of that \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d The state emphasizes that the indictment was broadly worded, without reference to accomplice liability, and that the trial court, albeit instructing the jury on accomplice liability, did not explicitly inform the jury that it could convict only on that theory. Given those circumstances, the state concludes, \u201cas long as sufficient evidence existed to convict defendant as <em>either </em>the principal <em>or </em>an accomplice, the conviction must stand.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Finally, and alternatively, the state posits that, even if we do not affirm defendant\u2019s conviction for first-degree assault, we should, nevertheless, \u201creform the conviction to one for second-degree assault.\u201d In that regard, the state asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u201cIf the evidence was insufficient to establish that defendant intentionally inflicted the serious physical injury <em>by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon, </em>it nonetheless sufficed to establish that defendant intentionally inflicted serious physical injury on the victim, making him guilty of second-degree assault pursuant to ORS 163.175(l)(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Defendant remonstrates that the state\u2019s newly minted theory of principal liability on first-degree assault comes much too late \u2014 and, indeed, to affirm defendant\u2019s conviction on a qualitatively different theory of the case that was never presented to the jury, that was presumably never considered by the jury, and that is predicated on facts that were not necessarily found by the jury, would violate principles of fundamental fairness. In that regard, defendant asserts that, if the state had invoked a theory of principal liability with respect to first-degree assault, rather than relying exclusively on accomplice liability, the case may very well have been litigated differently, with the record as to certain matters developed very differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">\u201cFor example, defendant did not have the opportunity nor any reason to develop the factual record regarding whether the actual muddy ground conditions <em>could </em>have constituted a dangerous weapon. Nor did he seek to develop the medical evidence regarding the degree of likelihood, if any, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>serious physical injury suffered by the victim was caused by his use of the muddy ground rather than the codefendant\u2019s steel-toed boots- \u2014 a critical issue under the state\u2019s new theory. The development of such issues could have led to both legal and factual challenges to the state\u2019s theory that defendant could have raised by motion before the court, and argued to the jury had the motion failed.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">(Footnote omitted; emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">As amplified below, we agree with defendant that, as the state does not dispute, the evidence was legally insufficient to support a conviction of defendant as an accomplice to Cufaude\u2019s first-degree assault. We further agree with defendant that, in the circumstances of this case, it would be fundamentally unfair to sustain the denial of the MJOA \u2014 and, consequently, to affirm defendant\u2019s conviction \u2014 based on a qualitatively different theory of culpability that was never litigated in the trial court and is predicated on facts that the jury did not necessarily determine in rendering its verdict. Finally, we conclude that, given the idiosyncratic procedural posture, the appropriate disposition is neither (as defendant principally urges) to direct the trial court to enter a judgment of acquittal on Count 1, nor (as the state urges) to direct entry of a judgment of conviction for first-degree assault. The former would preclude further proceedings with respect to the purported lesser-included offenses that were properly submitted to the jury; the latter assumes facts not necessarily found by the jury. Accordingly \u2014 and consistently with defendant\u2019s alternative suggested disposition \u2014 we vacate defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">We begin with the legal insufficiency of evidence to establish accomplice liability for first-degree assault. As noted, under ORS 163.185, a person commits first-degree assault if the person \u201c[intentionally causes serious physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon.\u201d A person may be culpable for that conduct as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>accomplice if \u201c[w]ith the intent to <em>promote or facilitate </em>the commission of the crime the person * * * [a]ids or abets or agrees or attempts to aid or abet such other person in <em>planning or committing </em>the crime[.]\u201d ORS 161.155(2)(b) (emphasis added). Thus, to be culpable as an accomplice to Cufaude\u2019s use of the steel-toed boots, defendant must have \u201c[a]id[ed] or abet[ted]\u201d Cufaude in the \u201cplanning or commi[ssion]\u201d of the assault with the boots \u201c[w]ith the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Although \u201cthe least degree of concert or collusion between accomplices suffices\u201d to establish culpability as an aider or abettor, mere presence or acquiescence alone are not sufficient. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Holloway, </em>102 Or App 553, 557, 795 P2d 589 (1990). <em>See also State v. Lavadores, </em>230 Or App 163, 171, 214 P3d 86 (2009) (relying on <em>Holloway); State v. Anlauf, </em>164 Or App 672, 674, 995 P2d 547 (2000) (same). Additionally, as we have recently reiterated, although \u201c \u2018actions <em>after </em>the commission of a crime * * * may be used as evidence that earlier activities were aiding and abetting,\u2019 those actions \u2018cannot alone constitute aiding or abetting.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>240 Or App 475, 488, 248 P3d 10 (2011) (quoting <em>State v. Moriarty, </em>87 Or App 465, 468 n 1, 742 P2d 704, <em>rev den, </em>304 Or 547 (1987) (emphasis in <em>Moriarty)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The facts in <em>Anlauf </em>are analogous to those in this case. There, the defendant and his accomplice, Scheidemantel, assaulted a 14-year-old boy with their fists and beer bottles. 164 Or App at 674. Toward the end of the assault, Scheidemantel threatened the boy with a knife that he had in his pocket. <em>Id. </em>There was no evidence that the defendant participated in Scheidemantel\u2019s conduct with the knife or even knew that Scheidemantel was carrying the knife. <em>Id. </em>Among other crimes, the defendant was charged with the unlawful use of a weapon for the knife on a theory of accomplice liability and, after the trial court denied his motion for judgment of acquittal, he was ultimately convicted on that charge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On appeal, the defendant asserted that, although he participated in the assault on the boy, there was no evidence that he aided or abetted in Scheidemantel\u2019s planning or commission of the unlawful use of the knife. <em>Id. </em>at 675. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>agreed, and, in so holding, we noted that, although the defendant and Scheidemantel both assaulted the victim \u201cduring the course of the common criminal episode * * *[,] [t]here was nothing to link [the] defendant to the knife offense here except his \u2018mere presence\u2019 when it occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">So too here. Although defendant assaulted the victim about a minute and a half after Cufaude had broken off his assault, there is nothing \u2014 aside from defendant\u2019s \u201cmere presence\u201d when Cufaude was kicking the victim \u2014 to establish that Cufaude\u2019s conduct and defendant\u2019s conduct constituted anything more than uncoordinated, <em>seriatim </em>assaults. Absent some evidence of collusion or concerted action between Cufaude and defendant, defendant\u2019s actions <em>after </em>Cufaude\u2019s commission of the predicate first-degree assault cannot be used to hold defendant culpable for aiding and abetting that offense. <em>See Wilson, </em>240 Or App at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We proceed to the state\u2019s proffered alternative basis for sustaining the denial of the <em>MJOA </em>\u2014 viz., that, regardless of the sufficiency of the evidence of accomplice liability, the record included evidence that, viewed most favorably to the state, would have permitted the imposition of principal liability for first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In the totality of the circumstances of this case, our affirmance of defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis that the state <em>advances </em>\u2014 viz., that defendant\u2019s use of the muddy ground made it a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d for the purposes of establishing his culpability as a principal for first-degree assault \u2014 would be fundamentally unfair. Here, as noted, the state\u2019s exclusive theory of culpability for first-degree assault \u2014 as articulated in opening statement, in opposing defendant\u2019s MJOA, and in closing argument \u2014 was that defendant aided and abetted Cufaude\u2019s assault of the victim and that Cufaude\u2019s steel-toed boots were the predicate \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d There was no suggestion that defendant could be liable as a principal for first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">It is axiomatic that principal liability and accomplice liability are qualitatively different theories that implicate materially different operative facts. <em>See generally State v. Burney, </em>191 Or App 227, 234, 82 P3d 164 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 182 (2004) (noting the \u201cexistence of different substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>requirements of proof between charges based on direct liability and those based on vicarious criminal liability\u201d). Accordingly, the record might very well have developed differently if the state had ever advanced and attempted to prove an alternative theory that defendant had acted as a principal in committing the first-degree assault. In particular, as defendant notes, because the state never suggested that defendant had employed the muddy ground as a \u201cdeadly or dangerous weapon,\u201d defendant had no reason to adduce evidence as to the condition, including pliancy, of the ground on that New Year\u2019s Eve night. Nor, in a related sense, did the state adduce proof pertaining to the nature and severity of the victim\u2019s injuries caused by the use of that \u201cweapon,\u201d as opposed to defendant\u2019s other conduct <em>(e.g., </em>punching the victim in the face). Consequently, the jury had no reason or occasion to consider any of those matters, much less render a verdict on that basis. We will not usurp the jury\u2019s constitutionally exclusive function by deciding those never-litigated factual matters in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Our reticence in that regard broadly comports with the principles underlying our analysis and disposition in <em>State v. Barrie, </em>227 Or App 378, 206 P3d 256 (2009). In <em>Barrie, </em>the defendant had been charged with second-degree manslaughter, and the trial court, following a bench trial, acquitted him of that charge but nevertheless convicted him of the lesser-included offense of criminally negligent homicide. <em>Id. </em>at 380. The court did so notwithstanding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\u201c(1) neither party had requested that the lesser-included offense be considered; (2) the prosecutor had expressly eschewed pursuit of the lesser-included offense; and (3) the record demonstrates that defendant had no actual notice of the court\u2019s consideration of the lesser-included offense before the court rendered its oral verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">We reversed, concluding that that \u201cconfluence of factors,\u201d with the defendant\u2019s consequent lack of \u201cactual notice that the lesser-included offense was under consideration,\u201d rendered the defendant\u2019s conviction irreconcilable with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201coverriding principles of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384. In so holding, we emphasized that \u201c[a]t no point in the record did defendant or the prosecutor argue, or the court suggest, that the lesser-included offense, which involved a different mental state, was or should have been under consideration.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">We appreciate that the circumstances in <em>Barrie </em>differed in some significant respects from those presented here. For example, unlike in <em>Barrie, </em>the prosecutor here never explicitly disavowed the basis on which the state now seeks affirmance. Nevertheless, as a <em>practical </em>matter \u2014 as a matter of \u201cactual notice\u201d and how cases are actually tried (and defended) \u2014 the same \u201coverriding principles of due process,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 384, still pertain and compel a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><em>State v. Goddard, </em>178 Or App 538, 37 P3d 1046, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 121 (2002), which the state invokes, is not to the contrary. There, although we affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction on an alternative basis, that alternative basis was predicated on facts <em>necessarily </em>found by the jury, which the defendant had fair opportunity to contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In <em>Goddard, </em>the defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of first-degree sodomy and endangering the welfare of a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 540. The issue was whether the trial court had erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the endangering charge. <em>Id. </em>Before the trial court, the state had argued that the defendant had endangered the welfare of the child victim by allowing the child to \u201cwitness an act of sexual conduct\u201d in a pornographic video before engaging her in an act of oral sodomy, for which the defendant was also charged. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">On appeal, the state conceded that the statutory reference to \u201cwitness an act of sexual conduct\u201d referred only to <em>live </em>acts of sexual conduct, but argued that we should nevertheless affirm that conviction because the defendant had caused the child to \u201cwitness an act of sexual conduct\u201d when he sodomized her. <em>Id. </em>at 540-41. We agreed. Significantly, in <em>Goddard </em>\u2014 and unlike in this case \u2014 the alternative basis for conviction urged by the state was predicated on facts that the jury had found in convicting the defendant of the sodomy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>charge; that is, by causing the child to engage in an act of sodomy (\u201can act of sexual conduct\u201d) the defendant <em>necessarily </em>also caused the child to \u201cwitness\u201d it. Thus, those operative facts were both fully litigated by the parties and necessarily determined by the jury at trial, effectively forestalling the concerns about fundamental fairness. That did not occur here. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction for first-degree assault must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">That does not, however, conclude our consideration. The admittedly abstruse question of the correct disposition remains: Is defendant entitled (as defendant principally urges) to an unqualified judgment of acquittal on Count 1? Should we (as the state suggests) direct entry of a judgment of conviction for second-degree assault? Or should we (consistently with defendant\u2019s alternative disposition) vacate defendant\u2019s conviction for first-degree assault and remand for further proceedings?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We reject out of hand the state\u2019s suggested disposition because, like the state\u2019s proffered alternative basis for affirming the first-degree assault conviction, it would require us to usurp the jury\u2019s factfinding function. Here, because the jury convicted defendant of first-degree assault as an accomplice, it had no occasion to determine whether he had personally \u201c[intentionally or knowingly cause[d] serious physical injury\u201d to the victim. ORS 163.175(l)(a). Although there was arguably sufficient evidence from which the jury could have made that determination, it did not do so either expressly or by necessary implication in rendering its verdict. We cannot do so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Conversely, defendant\u2019s preferred disposition would also preempt the jury\u2019s function, albeit in a very different way. Entry of an unqualified judgment of acquittal, without a concomitant remand, on Count 1 would preclude any consideration of the lesser-included offenses encompassed within that count on which the jury was instructed, <em>see </em>240 Or App at 646-47 n 5, but which the jury never considered because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>convicted defendant on the erroneously submitted greater-included offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The sole remaining option is defendant\u2019s suggested alternative disposition: a remand permitting a retrial of the lesser-included offenses that the jury would have considered but for the erroneous denial of the MJOA against the first-degree assault charge. We acknowledge that such a remand is an imperfect disposition, both practically and prudentially, in that it may afford the state the opportunity to improve and refine its presentation and proof with respect to those charges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, such consequences inhere in any remand allowing a retrial of previously litigated matters and, in the circumstances presented here, are not preclusive. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for first-degree assault and remand for further proceedings pertaining to consideration of the lesser-included offenses on which the jury was instructed, <em>viz., </em>second-degree assault and fourth-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Defendant\u2019s conviction for assault in the first degree reversed; remanded for further proceedings; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\"> The basis for that disposition is explained below. 240 Or App at 654-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Our disposition obviates any consideration of defendant\u2019s two other assignments of error, which pertained, respectively, to (a) the imposition of a Ballot Measure 11 sentence for a conviction predicated on accomplice liability, <em>but see State v.

Although it is patent that the state\u2019s theory of the case with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>respect to first-degree assault was predicated solely on accomplice liability, the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument appear to suggest to the jury that it could convict on either of the proffered lesser-included offenses \u2014 that is, second-degree assault or fourth-degree assault \u2014 on the basis of either principal or accomplice liability. Thus \u2014 and critically with respect to our disposition and ultimate scope of remand, <em>see </em>240 Or App at 651-55 \u2014 as to the putative lesser-included offenses that the jury never reached and considered, the prosecution was not predicated solely on accomplice liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> The court convicted Cufaude of first-degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> Defendant also posits that, if the state had, in fact, advanced alternative theories of principal and accomplice liability for first-degree assault in his jury trial, that would have implicated the jury concurrence concerns addressed in <em>State v.
