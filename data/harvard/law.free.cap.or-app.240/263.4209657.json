Plaintiffs, who filed suit seeking compensation under Measure 37, appeal the subsequent dismissal of that suit on mootness grounds precipitated by the enactment of Measure 49. On appeal, they advance two general arguments: (1) they have a \u201cvested right\u201d in their \u201ccause of action for compensation\u201d under Measure 37 and, if Measure 49 operates retroactively to abolish that right, then application of Measure 49 to plaintiffs\u2019 suit violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) the trial court had discretion to enter judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>in favor of plaintiffs on their Measure 37 claims, and plaintiffs\u2019 situation warranted such a ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In other cases, we have already considered and rejected arguments substantially similar to those raised by plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g., Powell v. DLCD, </em>238 Or App 678, 682, 690, 243 P3d 798 (2010) (rejecting the plaintiffs contention that retroactive application of Measure 49 to her pending Measure 37 litigation violated her right to substantive due process under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by depriving her of a \u201cvested right in her Measure 37 litigation\u201d); <em>Bleeg v. Metro, </em>229 Or App 210, 213, 217-18, 211 P3d 302 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 56 (2010) (concluding that, because the plaintiffs\u2019 Measure 37 claims for just compensation were ongoing at the time Measure 49 became effective, Measure 49 superseded those claims, deprived the trial court\u2019s corrected judgments, which were entered <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>of continuing viability, and rendered the plaintiffs\u2019 cases nonjusticiable). In this case, we write to address only those aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>not considered in those prior cases and, for the reasons that follow, affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Plaintiffs own approximately 19 acres of property in Multnomah County, which they purchased in 1973 from a family member. In June 2005, pursuant to Measure 37, <em>former </em>ORS 197.352 (2005), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 424, \u00a7 4, <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 195.305 (2007), plaintiffs submitted a \u201cwritten demand for compensation\u201d to each of defendants based on the reduction in value of their property as a result of state and county land use regulations that restricted the use of their property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs obtained a state waiver of some, but not all, of the state land use regulations that plaintiffs alleged reduced the value of their property. The county did not act on plaintiffs\u2019 demand because it determined that plaintiffs\u2019 claim was not complete. In September 2006, pursuant to section 6 of Measure <em>37, former </em>ORS 197.352(6), plaintiffs filed suit against defendants seeking monetary compensation for the reduction in value of their property;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> plaintiffs also sought a declaration that any waivers issued by defendants under Measure 37 would be transferable to a subsequent owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The case went to trial on November 5, 2007, the day before Measure 49 was adopted by the voters in a special election. On November 14, 2007, while Measure 49 was not yet in effect, the trial court orally ruled in favor of plaintiffs, finding that certain state and county land use regulations reduced the fair market value of their property in the amount of $750,000. The court also orally ruled that defendants were not obliged to pay plaintiffs compensation in the liquidated amount, but, rather, that defendants could elect to do so. Plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment with findings of fact and conclusions of law to defendants, who thereafter filed objections to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">On December 6, 2007, while those objections were pending before the trial court, Measure 49 became effective. \u201cMeasure 49 set out a different compensation allowance for a reduction in fair market value caused by a post-acquisition land use regulation, and reduced the degree of residential development allowed under a previously requested Measure 37 <em>waiver.\" Norwood v. Washington County, </em>239 Or App 542, 545, 245 P3d 659 (2010). Specifically, for Measure 37 claims filed on or before June 28, 2007, section 5 of Measure 49 allowed three types of relief for property owners \u2014 none of which recognized an entitlement to monetary compensation. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 424, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Defendants subsequently filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 suit under ORCP 21 A on the grounds that plaintiffs\u2019 Measure 37 claims were moot and did not state facts on which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response to those motions, plaintiffs argued, among other things, that (1) Measure 49 did not retroactively apply to \u201ccauses of action\u201d brought under Measure 37; and (2) plaintiffs had a \u201cvested right\u201d to relief under Measure 37 that was protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The trial court agreed with defendants and issued a letter opinion concluding that Measure 49 applied to all of plaintiffs\u2019 Measure 37 claims, that no constitutional impediment prevented the retroactive application of Measure 49, and that the litigation was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Plaintiffs then filed a motion that alleged that the trial court had \u201crendered a judgment\u201d in plaintiffs\u2019 favor on November 14,2007, and that the trial court should enter that judgment <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>At the hearing on the motion, the trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request, concluding that it lacked the necessary discretion to do what plaintiffs wanted, although it agreed with plaintiffs that the equities weighed in their favor. The trial court subsequently entered orders granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for entry of judgment <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Plaintiffs now appeal from the resulting general judgment, which dismissed their claims and awarded defendants costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We review for errors of law and, as noted above, write only to address those aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on appeal that have not been addressed in preceding cases. We begin with plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they have a \u201cvested right\u201d in their \u201ccause of action for compensation\u201d under Measure 37 that is protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and cannot be destroyed by the retroactive application of Measure 49. In support of their argument, plaintiffs place heavy reliance on a case decided by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Oregon Supreme Court more than 75 years ago: <em>Fisk v. Leith, </em>137 Or 459, 299 P 1013, <em>on reh\u2019g, </em>3 P2d 535 (1931). Plaintiffs contend that <em>\u201cFisk </em>stands for the proposition that a statutory right to damages can become vested simply by accrual, and that the injured party has an inviolable right to secure judgment on those damages.\u201d We did not address the implications of <em>Fisk </em>in our analysis in <em>Powell </em>under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In <em>Powell, </em>we ultimately rejected the plaintiffs contention that retroactive application of Measure 49 unconstitutionally deprived her of a \u201cvested right in her Measure 37 litigation.\u201d 238 Or App at 682, 690. Thus, we now consider the reasoning in <em>Fisk </em>and whether it is controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The core issue presented to the court in <em>Fisk </em>was whether the prevailing plaintiffs\u2019 suit for an injunction and damages survived the repeal of a certain statute. At the time that the plaintiffs commenced their suit, the statute was in effect and provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201c \u2018No public utility * * * shall henceforth begin the construction of a line, plant or system, or any part thereof, in or into any territory already served by a similar utility without having first obtained from the public service commission of Oregon * * * a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require, or will require such construction[.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Fisk, </em>137 Or at 461 (quoting Oregon Code, title LXI, ch 3, \u00a7 61-301 (1930)). The plaintiffs in <em>Fisk </em>included the first public utility company to serve the territory of Gold Beach. The defendants included a competing public utility company that had applied for, and been denied, the statutorily required certificate, but which had constructed improvements and served customers in the plaintiffs\u2019 territory. As a result of the defendants\u2019 allegedly unlawful competition, the plaintiffs sued and alleged that the defendants\u2019 conduct deprived them of numerous customers, resulting in $4,000 in damages. <em>Id. </em>at 461, 464. The trial court ultimately issued an order of injunction against the defendants and awarded the plaintiffs $2,000 in damages caused by the allegedly wrongful acts of the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 461. Pending the defendants\u2019 appeal, however, the statute requiring the certificate was repealed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The Supreme Court initially concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">\u201cIn view of the repeal of the statute requiring the certificate it is clear that no injunctive relief can be granted although it may have been proper to do so at the time the decision was rendered in the circuit court. No person has a vested right in a remedy. It would be an absurd thing to enjoin defendants from engaging in the business of furnishing light and power until a certificate * * * had been obtained from the Public Service Commission when, in fact, such commission has no longer authority to issue the certificate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 462. The court then went on to consider \u201c[t]he more difficult question [of] whether equity should retain jurisdiction to assess damages for the wrongful acts of defendants while the law was in force and effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court prefaced its analysis of that question by distinguishing the repealed statute at issue from the statutes repealed in other contexts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201cThere is strong language in the texts and encyclopedias supporting the theory of defendants that the statute repealed precludes any recovery by plaintiff, but when the facts in the cases cited in support thereof are closely examined, it will be found that statutory remedies, procedure, or penalties were involved. * * * Neither are we concerned with the repeal of a statute expressly creating a cause of action * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 462-63. It was in that context \u2014 one where the repealed statute did not provide either the cause of action itself or the remedy for the cause of action \u2014 that the court engaged in the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">\u201cIn the instant case the statute repealed conferred upon the plaintiff a right as distinguished from a remedy. It protected the plaintiff * * * from competition by the other public utilities in the same territory until the Public Service Commission issued them a certificate * * *. This statutory right thus to engage in business was a property asset \u2014 a vested right \u2014 and, a cause of action having accrued by reason of interference therewith, such could not be destroyed by subsequent legislation. The cause of action which accrued prior to the repeal of the statute is property in the same sense in which tangible things are property, and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>destruction would amount to the taking of property without due process of law[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Plaintiffs in the present case read <em>Fisk </em>as determining that a cause of action is property and is entitled to protection from the retroactive application of a change in the law under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs read <em>Fisk </em>too broadly. In <em>Hall v. Northwest Outward Bound School, </em>280 Or 655, 663, 572 P2d 1007 (1977), the Oregon Supreme Court underscored the narrowness of its decision in <em>Fisk </em>by explaining that <em>Fisk </em>\u201cdecided only that a plaintiff was entitled to damages from an illegal competitor for the period before the illegality was removed by a repealing act even though the repeal foreclosed an injunction against further competition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The litigation in <em>Fisk </em>concerned what was, in essence, a claim in tort. The repealed statute was relevant to that claim only insofar as it established the standard of conduct that the defendants allegedly transgressed and thereby caused the plaintiffs injury. The repeal of the statute in no way repealed the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action \u2014 their claim in tort \u2014 or their requested remedy \u2014 monetary damages for the defendants\u2019 past conduct. By contrast, Measure 49 replaced and altered the remedies previously available under Measure 37 for reduction in property value caused by land use regulations. Therefore, to the extent that <em>Fisk </em>remains good law, despite its use of a \u201cvested rights\u201d analysis, it is inapposite and fails to aid plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Further, to the extent that <em>Fisk </em>is based on \u201cthe much-maligned <em>Lochner </em>era\u2019 of [United States] Supreme Court jurisprudence,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] during which the court exercised stringent review of economic regulation\u201d under substantive due process, that jurisprudential foundation \u201chas been repeatedly and emphatically repudiated.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>238 Or App at 685 (discussing the repudiation of <em>Lochner). </em>Therefore, in this case, we hold to our decision in <em>Powell: </em>\u201cGiven the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>current state of substantive due process jurisprudence, we decline plaintiffls\u2019] invitation to rouse the \u2018ghost of Lochner\u2019 through a \u2018vested rights\u2019 analysis of economic regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687 (footnote and citation omitted). Further, when \u201c[evaluated under the more modern substantive due process framework \u2014 that is, whether the statute and its retroactive application have a \u2018legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means\u2019 \u2014 Measure 49 plainly passes muster.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Nor are we persuaded that the retroactive application of Measure 49 to plaintiffs\u2019 claims runs afoul of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs argue that, \u201c[t]o the extent the cause of action is viewed as actual property, protection under the Fifth Amendment is also an appropriate vehicle.\u201d We understand plaintiffs to again rely, primarily, on <em>Fisk </em>for their contention that a cause of action is property. For all the reasons discussed above, <em>Fisk </em>is unavailing. More to the point, however, \u201c[a] vested right must be something more than a mere expectation based upon the anticipated continuance of existing laws; it must have become a title legal or equitable to the present or future enjoyment of property.\u201d <em>DeMendoza v. Huffman, </em>334 Or 425, 449, 51 P3d 1232 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As we explained in <em>Smejkal v. DAS, </em>239 Or App 553, 561, 246 P3d 1140 (2010), \u201cMeasure 37 did not inhibit the Legislative Assembly or the people from enacting regulations on the use of [a] plaintiffs properties.\u201d In other words, Measure 37 did not embody a contractual commitment by the government to allow plaintiffs\u2019 Measure 37 suit for monetary compensation to continue unabated. Further, as we explain below, plaintiffs had not yet achieved a final, unreviewable judgment on their Measure 37 claims when Measure 49 became effective. Plaintiffs\u2019 takings argument fails because they have identified no cognizable property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Finally, plaintiffs argue that the trial court should have entered judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>in their favor on their Measure 37 claims. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is premised on their assertion that the trial court \u201chad rendered its judgment\u201d on November 14, 2007. As an initial matter, plaintiffs are wrong to characterize the trial court\u2019s oral ruling as a \u201cjudgment.\u201d The legislature has specifically defined \u201cjudgment\u201d in ORS 18.005(8) as \u201cthe concluding decision of a court on one or more requests for relief in one or more actions, <em>as reflected in a judgment document.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Here, the trial court\u2019s oral ruling was never incorporated by the trial court into a written document. There simply was no \u201cjudgment\u201d in this case before the effective date of Measure 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"> Further, and more importantly, the trial court did not err in failing to enter judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>based on its oral ruling, because plaintiffs\u2019 case was mooted by Measure 49. \u201cMeasure 49 pertains to <em>all </em>Measure 37 claims, successful or not, and regardless of where they are in the Measure 37 process.\u201d <em>Corey v. DLCD, </em>344 Or 457, 465, 184 P3d 1109 (2008) (emphasis in original). However, \u201cwhen a claim is reduced to a final judgment, the underlying claim is extinguished, \u2018merging\u2019 into the judgment; as a result, the \u2018rights upon the judgment are substituted for the former claim.\u2019 <em>Barrett and Barrett, </em>320 Or 372, 378, 886 P2d 1 (1994).\u201d <em>State ex rel English v. Multnomah County, </em>348 Or 417, 430, 238 P3d 980 (2010). Thus, in <em>English, </em>the court held that a landowner\u2019s Measure 37 claim \u201cwas extinguished once her claim was reduced to a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that case, the county had dismissed its appeal, and the Court of Appeals had issued the appellate judgment; as a result, the landowner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>rights under Measure 37 were replaced with her rights under the trial court judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">By contrast, in <em>Bleeg, </em>we determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 Measure 37 claims were ongoing at the time Measure 49 became effective, regardless of the fact that the trial court had entered corrected judgments <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to the day before Measure 49 became effective. 229 Or App at 213, 217. Because Measure 49 superseded the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we concluded that the trial court\u2019s judgments were deprived of continuing viability and that the plaintiffs\u2019 cases were no longer justiciable. <em>Id. </em>at 217-18. Similarly, here, because plaintiffs\u2019 Measure 37 claims had not been extinguished by a final, unreviewable, judgment by December 6, 2007, they were superseded by Measure 49 and were no longer justiciable. The trial court did not err in dismissing them or in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for entry of judgment <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\"> The Fifth Amendment provides, in part, \u201cNo person shall be * * * deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d The Fourteenth Amendment provides, in part, \u201cNo State shall * * * deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-5\"> State defendants cross-assign error to intermediate rulings by the trial court that (1) denied the state\u2019s earlier motion to dismiss under the Administrative Procedures Act and (2) concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to Measure 37 relief. Given our disposition of plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error, we do not reach those cross-assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 197.352(1) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201cIf a public entity enacts or enforces a new land use regulation enacted prior to December 2,2004, that restricts the use of private real property or any interest therein and has the effect of reducing the fair market value of the property, or any interest therein, then the owner of the property shall be paid just compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 197.352(6) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">\u201cIf a land use regulation continues to apply to the subject property more than 180 days after the present owner of the property has made written demand for compensation under this section, the present owner of the property, or any interest therein, shall have a cause of action for compensation under this section in the circuit court in which the real property is located, and the present owner of the real property shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees, expenses, costs, and other disbursements reasonably incurred to collect the compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b308-5\"> Section 5 of Measure 49 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201cA claimant that filed a claim under ORS 197.352 on or before the date of adjournment sine die of the 2007 regular session of the Seventy-fourth Legislative Assembly [June 28, 2007] is entitled to just compensation as provided in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">\u201c(1) Sections 6 or 7 of this 2007 Act, at the claimant\u2019s election, if the property described in the claim is located entirely outside any urban growth boundary and entirely outside the boundaries of any city;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">\u201c(2) Section 9 of this 2007 Act if the property described in the claim is located, in whole or in part, within an urban growth boundary; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">\u201c(3) A waiver issued before the effective date of this 2007 Act [December 6, 2007] to the extent that the claimant\u2019s use of the property complies with the waiver and the claimant has a common law vested right on the effective date of this 2007 Act to complete and continue the use described in the waiver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Section 6 of the measure requires approval of up to three lots, parcels, or dwellings under certain circumstances; section 7 permits discretionary approval of up to 10 homesites under a more narrow set of circumstances; section 9 provides that owners of property within the urban growth boundary of a city may qualify to develop one to 10 single-family dwellings under specified circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\"> ORCP 21 A(l) provides for dismissal of a claim on the ground that there is a \u201clack of jurisdiction over the subject matter\u201d; ORCP 21 A(8) provides for dismissal of a claim on the ground that there is a \u201cfailure to state ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> <em>Lochner v.

We observe that, under <em>Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., </em>332 Or 83, 124, 23 P3d 333 (2001), the Oregon Supreme Court described the analysis under Oregon\u2019s remedy clause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201c[I]n analyzing a claim under the remedy clause, the first question is whether the plaintiff has alleged an injury to one of the absolute rights that Article I, section 10 protects. Stated differently, when the drafters wrote the Oregon Constitution in 1857, did the common law of Oregon recognize a cause of action for the alleged injury? If the answer to that question is yes, and if the legislature has abolished the common-law cause of action for injury to rights that are protected by the remedy clause, then the second question is whether it has provided a constitutionally adequate substitute remedy for the common-law cause of action for that injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">However, because plaintiffs failed to present to the trial court their contention that retroactive application of Measure 49 violates Article I, section 10, it is unpreserved, and we do not discuss it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
