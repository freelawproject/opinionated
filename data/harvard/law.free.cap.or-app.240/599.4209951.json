She survived, and defendant was convicted of multiple offenses, including, as relevant to this appeal, two counts of unlawful use of a weapon, ORS 166.220(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant raises three assignments of error, the first of which we reject without discussion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in declining to merge his convictions on the two counts of unlawful use of a weapon, one of which alleged a violation of ORS 166.220(l)(a), and the other of which alleged a violation of ORS 166.220(l)(b). Defendant acknowledges that this case is partially controlled by <em>State v. Crawford, </em>215 Or App 544, 171 P3d 974 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 280 (2008), but argues that, in light of subsequent developments in the law, <em>Crawford </em>should be abandoned. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The pertinent facts are few and, in the context of defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s refusal to merge his convictions, we take the facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Camarena-Velasco, </em>207 Or App 19, 21, 139 P3d 979 (2006). Defendant and his sister, R, lived at home with their mother. On the day defendant shot her, R arrived at the home in the afternoon and found that defendant had locked the side door. Defendant was asleep inside the home. R did not have a key and began pounding on the door with her hands and feet. Defendant awoke, retrieved a pistol from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>under his pillow, went to the door, opened it, and shot R in the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Defendant was charged by indictment with, among other offenses, two counts of unlawful use of a weapon. The first count, Count Four of the indictment, charged defendant with \u201cunlawfully and intentionally discharging] a firearm within the city limits of the city of Portland, Oregon, at or in the direction of a person within the range of said weapon without having legal authority for such discharge.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 166.220(l)(b). The second count, Count Five of the indictment, charged defendant with \u201cunlawfully attempting] to use, carry with intent to use and possess with intent to use unlawfully against another person, a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 166.220(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Following his conviction on those two counts, defendant asked the trial court to merge the convictions into a single conviction under ORS 161.067(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant argued that the two convictions should merge because \u201cthe attempt to use a deadly weapon is merely an alternate theory of the intentional discharge within the city limit.\u201d According to defendant, \u201cthe way that [Count Four is] pled, there is nothing in Count Five that isn\u2019t covered in Count Four, because one is a substantial step towards. Just like any attempt might be a lesser included.\u201d In reply, the state argued that \u201cthere are elements in Count Four * * * that are not pled or required to prove Count Five. Specifically, there\u2019s no requirement in Count Five that * * * defendant intentionally discharged a firearm. There\u2019s also no proof \u2014 required element in Count Five that discharge occurred within the city limits of Portland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Defendant agreed that Count Four had different elements from Count Five, but nonetheless urged the trial court to merge the convictions because Count Five \u201cdoesn\u2019t charge anything that\u2019s not included in four. * * * I would agree that four clearly has different elements. I\u2019m just arguing that five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>is akin to a lesser included, because it\u2019s the attempt to use a deadly weapon against another person.\u201d The trial court queried defendant\u2019s counsel on that point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">\u201cThe Court: So, you\u2019re argument is everything that the state would have to prove to establish count five they would also have to prove to establish count four?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\u201cDefense Counsel: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">\u201cDefense Counsel: Well, in the sense that any time an attempt is always a lesser included.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">\u201cThe Court: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">\u201cDefense Counsel: So, I get that in \u2014 to prove five you would not have to prove that the weapon went off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">\u201cThe Court: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">\u201cDefense Counsel: So \u2014 but in that sense, like an attempt is a lesser included, it\u2019s just covered. By proving five, it\u2019s within the pleading of four.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">The trial court declined to merge defendant\u2019s convictions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">As noted, defendant acknowledges that the issue at hand is partially controlled by our opinion in <em>Crawford, </em>where we held that ORS 166.220(1)(a) and (l)(b) are \u201cseparate statutory provisions\u201d for purposes of the anti-merger statute. Defendant nevertheless argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decisions in <em>State v. White, </em>346 Or 275, 211 P3d 248 (2009), and <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 211 P3d 262 (2010), demonstrate that our analysis of the merger issue in <em>Crawford </em>was erroneous. Specifically, defendant argues that <em>White </em>and <em>Parkins </em>show that \u201cthe Supreme Court has rejected the \u2018separate and distinct legislative concerns\u2019 test in favor of the broader one unified legislative objective test.\u201d Defendant argues that, when this \u201cbroader\u201d test is applied to ORS 166.220(1), it becomes apparent that both subsections of the statute are intended to \u201cprevent the harm that results from the use of weapons against or in the vicinity of other people,\u201d and, thus, both subsections address a single, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>unified legislative objective and are not separate statutory provisions. It follows, defendant concludes, that our contrary conclusion in <em>Crawford </em>was erroneous and defendant\u2019s convictions should merge. Defendant also renews his argument that his convictions should merge on the ground that Count Five is a lesser-included offense of Count Four, because \u201cto prove that a person intentionally discharged a firearm at or in the direction of a person, the state must prove that the person attempted to use a deadly weapon against another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The state first replies that defendant failed to preserve his argument that ORS 166.220(l)(a) and (l)(b) are not separate statutory provisions. In any event, the state reasons, that question is controlled by our opinion in <em>Crawford. </em>With regard to defendant\u2019s argument that Count Five is a lesser-included offense of Count Four, the state points out that Count Five included an element \u2014 carrying the weapon with intent to use it \u2014 that was not included in Count Four, and, thus, the trial court properly declined to merge defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">We disagree with the state\u2019s argument that defendant failed to preserve his argument that ORS 166.220(l)(a) and (l)(b) are not separate statutory provisions. As set out above, defendant argued to the trial court that Count Five was simply an \u201calternate theory\u201d of Count Four. The trial court understood defendant\u2019s argument. As the Supreme Court recently emphasized in <em>O\u2019Hara v. Board of Parole, </em>346 Or 41, 47, 203 P3d 213 (2009),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201c[r]ules of preservation in court proceedings serve several purposes, including encouraging the parties to sharpen the issues and to present them fully and fairly to the trial court in the first instance, so that the trial court has an opportunity to make an informed ruling and develop an adequate record and the opposing party and the reviewing court are not taken by surprise later.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Defendant\u2019s use of the phrase \u201calternate theory\u201d was sufficient to alert the trial court to his argument that counts four and five did not allege violations of separate statutory provisions. The phrase \u201calternate theory\u2019 has consistently been used by this court and the Supreme Court in assessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>whether or not separately pleaded violations of statutory subsections should merge following a defendant\u2019s convictions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Barrett, </em>331 Or 27, 10 P3d 901 (2000) (holding that aggravating factors embodied in aggravated murder statute were \u201calternative theories\u201d of committing single crime of aggravated murder); <em>State v. White, </em>217 Or App 214, 175 P3d 504 (2007), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>346 Or 275, 211 P3d 248 (2009) (considering question of whether ORS 164.405(1)(a) and (l)(b) set out alternative theories of second-degree burglary or were two separate statutory provisions under ORS 161.067(1)). Although defendant\u2019s argument could have been more robust, his use of the phrase \u201calternate theory,\u201d along with his general argument under ORS 161.067(1), adequately alerted the trial court to the argument that he advances on appeal. As the Supreme Court has cautioned, \u201cproblems may arise if the preservation onion is sliced too thinly,\u201d <em>State v. Amaya, </em>336 Or 616, 629, 89 P3d 1163 (2004), and the state\u2019s argument in this case invites just such a slice. We decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The parties\u2019 arguments on the merits turn on the continued vitality of our opinion in <em>Crawford. </em>In that case, the defendant, who was in the backseat of a car that had pulled up in front of a house, beckoned to the victim and when the victim approached him, began firing a gun in the victim\u2019s direction, narrowly missing another person standing nearby. 215 Or App at 546. For that conduct, the defendant was indicted on two counts of unlawful use of a weapon, one count under ORS 166.220(l)(a) and another count under ORS 166.220(l)(b). <em>Crawford, </em>215 Or App at 546. The defendant was convicted and asked the trial court to merge his convictions; the trial court declined to do so. <em>Id. </em>After reviewing the controlling analysis set out by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Crotsley, </em>308 Or 272, 279, 779 P2d 600 (1989), <em>State v. Kizer, </em>308 Or 238, 779 P2d 604 (1989), <em>Barrett, </em>and <em>State v. White, </em>341 Or 624, 147 P3d 313 (2006), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision not to merge the convictions. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">\u201cIt is undisputed that defendant\u2019s conduct arose from a single criminal episode and that ORS 166.220(l)(a) and (b) contain different elements. ORS 166.220(l)(a) provides that a person commits the crime of unlawful use of a weapon if he or she attempts to use the weapon against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>another or carries or possesses the weapon with the intent to use it unlawfully against another. In contrast, subsection (l)(b) applies when the person actually discharges the firearm, and does so either at an individual, a building, a structure, or a vehicle. The question whether subsections (l)(a) and (l)(b) constitute two statutory provisions, that is, whether they address separate and distinct legislative concerns, is a close one. However, we conclude that they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201cBy its terms, subsection (l)(a) is directed toward the risk posed by individuals carrying weapons with the intent to unlawfully use them against a person, whereas subsection (l)(b) is concerned with the actual discharge of a weapon in a manner that creates a risk to people, buildings, or vehicles in urban areas. To be sure * * * the text suggests that the ultimate legislative concern of both subsections is preventing harm to persons; however * * * the structure and legislative history of the statute demonstrates that a more particularized focus is appropriate. First, * * * ORS 166.220(1) is divided into multiple subsections with different elements. <em>But more importantly, </em>the history of that statute <em>demonstrates a legislative intent </em>to distinguish between the risk of harm to an intended victim of a person who carries a weapon, subsection (l)(a), and the risk of harm to bystanders in drive-by shooting incidents, subsection (l)(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201cIn its early iterations, the statute prohibited only the acts that are now described in subsection (l)(a). <em>See, e.g., </em>Or Laws 1975, ch 700, \u00a7 1. Then, in 1991, the legislature enacted subsection (l)(b). In doing so, the legislature intended to enact a law to protect against drive-by shootings that put bystanders at risk. Minutes, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 638, Mar 13,1991; Minutes, House Committee on Judiciary, Apr 24, 1991, Ex I. One person who testified in support of the bill observed that current law (what is now subsection (l)(a)), provided police with little recourse in such shootings, because people who commit drive-by shootings \u2018may intend to target a house or a vehicle.\u2019 Minutes, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Mar 13, 1991. In other words, in drive-by shootings, the shooter need not have a specific human target or victim in mind and may simply intend to discharge a firearm. But, in doing so in an urban area, the shooter creates a risk that the bullets may strike cars, houses, businesses, and their occupants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201cIn short, ORS 166.620(l)(b) was enacted to address risks not adequately covered by the existing law. Those additional risks were implicated in this case; not only did defendant possess a gun with the intent to use it against a particular victim, but he also shot at a vehicle and a house. Although the two statutory provisions fall broadly within the same statute, they are set out in different subsections, involve different elements, and address separate and distinct legislative concerns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">215 Or App at 554-56 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">As is apparent from the above-quoted portion of our opinion in <em>Crawford, </em>our inquiry into whether ORS 166.220(l)(a) and (l)(b) should merge was not a mechanical exercise. Rather than relying solely on what defendant characterizes as \u201cthe now rejected test of \u2018separate and distinct legislative concerns,\u2019 \u201d set forth in <em>Crotsley, </em>our inquiry was consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent case law. In <em>White, </em>the Supreme Court set out the scope of the inquiry into whether statutory subsections are \u201cseparate statutory provisions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201cFirst, as discussed above and as articulated by this court in <em>White </em>and <em>Barrett, </em>the appropriate inquiry is <em>whether the legislature intended </em>to create a single crime or two crimes; the fact that a statute addresses two legislative concerns may be a useful guide when analyzing the legislature\u2019s intent, but it is not dispositive. Second, every statutory section that \u2018requires proof of an element that the others do not,\u2019 ORS 161.067(1), necessarily involves a distinct legislative concern \u2014 otherwise there would be no need for the additional element. And, we know from <em>Crotsley, </em>308 Or at 278 and <em>Barrett, </em>331 Or at 32, that whether an additional element must be proved and whether there are \u2018two or more statutory provisions\u2019 are separate inquiries under ORS 161.067(1). As a result, we cannot focus solely on the fact that the legislature may have had separate reasons for enacting each section of a statute. <em>Instead, we view the statute as a whole, looking to the text, context, and, when appropriate, legislative history of the statute. That analysis includes consideration of whether the sections, although addressing different concerns, also may address, on a more general level, one unified legislative objective.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>346 Or at 283-84 (emphasis added). The court relied on that passage in setting out its analysis of the defendant\u2019s merger claim in <em>Parkins. See </em>346 Or at 348 (\u201cTo resolve that issue, we begin with our recent decision in <em>State v. White, </em>in which we synthesized this court\u2019s prior merger cases discussing the phrase \u2018statutory provisions.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Our analysis in <em>Crawford </em>was consistent with the court\u2019s subsequent elucidation of the proper analysis under ORS 161.067(l)(b). As in <em>White, </em>our analysis in <em>Crawford </em>considered not only the structure of the statute, but also the intent of the statute as reflected in the legislative history and particular wording of each provision of ORS 166.220(l)(a) and (l)(b). And as <em>White </em>counseled, our inquiry in <em>Crawford </em>began with a consideration of the proper level of abstraction from which it was appropriate to ascertain the reasons the legislature enacted the statute. <em>See Crawford, </em>215 Or App at 553-54 (discussing levels of abstraction). Accordingly, we decline defendant\u2019s invitation to revisit <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We turn to defendant\u2019s second argument, that Count Five is a lesser-included offense of Count Four, because, in defendant\u2019s view, \u201cto prove that a person intentionally discharged a firearm at or in the direction of a person, the state must prove that the person attempted to use a deadly weapon against another person.\u201d The state argues that Count Five included an element not included in Count Four; that is, Count Five required the jury to find that defendant had carried a weapon with the intent to use it, whereas Count Four only required the jury to find that defendant had intentionally discharged the firearm. Unlike in <em>Crawford, </em>where the parties had not disputed whether offenses charged under ORS 166.220(l)(a) and (l)(b), as pleaded, each contained an element that the other did not, defendant\u2019s argument in this case implicates the second inquiry under ORS 167.067(1): whether \u201ceach statutory provision * * * requires proof of an element that the other does not.\u201d <em>State v. Blake, </em>348 Or 95, 98, 228 P3d 560 (2010). As the court explained in <em>Blake, </em>\u201cif one offense contains X elements, and another offense contains X + 1 elements, the former offense does not contain an element that is not also found in the latter offense. In that situation, under ORS 161.067(1), there is only one separately punishable offense.\u201d Id. at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Count Four of the indictment charged defendant, in the words of the statute, with \u201cunlawfully and intentionally discharging] a firearm within the city limits of the city of Portland, Oregon, at or in the direction of a person within the range of said weapon without having legal authority for such discharge.\u201d Thus, to convict defendant on Count Four, the state was required to prove that defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">1. Unlawfully and intentionally discharged a firearm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">2. Within the city limits of Portland, Oregon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">3. At or in the direction of a person within the range of said weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">4. Without having legal authority for such discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Count Five of the indictment charged defendant, in the words of the statute, with \u201cunlawfully attempting] to use, carry with intent to use and possess with intent to use unlawfully against another person, a deadly weapon.\u201d Thus, to convict defendant on Count Five, the state was required to prove that defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">1. Unlawfully attempted to use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">2. Carried or possessed with intent to use unlawfully;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">3. Against another person, a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Applying the analysis in <em>Blake, </em>we conclude that each count of the indictment required proof of an element that the other did not. Count Four required the state to prove that defendant had (a) unlawfully discharged a firearm, (b) within the city limits of Portland, Oregon, neither of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>which had to be proved in order to convict defendant on Count Five. Likewise, Count Five required the state to prove that defendant carried or possessed the firearm with the intent to use it unlawfully against another person, an element not required to convict defendant on Count Four. Although Count Four did require the state to prove that defendant intentionally discharged the firearm \u201cat or in the direction of a person within the range of said weapon without having legal authority for such discharge,\u201d Count Five required defendant to carry or possess the firearm with the intent to use it unlawfully with regard to <em>\u201canother </em>person,\u201d not any person within the range of the firearm. Moreover, as the state points out, a defendant need not \u201ccarry\u201d a firearm in order to unlawfully discharge it, as, for example, when a defendant rigs a gun to fire in his absence. Accordingly, Counts Four and Five of the indictment each required proof of an element that the other did not. The trial court did not err in declining defendant\u2019s request to merge his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\"> That statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">\u201cA person commits the crime of unlawful use of a weapon if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">\u201c(a) Attempts to use unlawfully against another, or carries or possesses with intent to use unlawfully against another, any dangerous or deadly weapon as defined in ORS 161.015; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201c(b) Intentionally discharges a firearm, blowgun, bow and arrow, crossbow or explosive device within the city limits of any city or within residential areas within urban growth boundaries at or in the direction of any person, building, structure or vehicle within the range of the weapon without having legal authority for such discharge.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-10\"> In his third assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that they could find him guilty by a nonunanimous verdict. The trial court did not err. <em>State v. Bowen, </em>215 Or App 199, 168 P3d 1208 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>220 Or App 380, 185 P3d 1129 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 415, <em>cert </em>den, _ US _, 130 S Ct 52 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"> That statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode violates two or more statutory provisions and each provision requires proof of an element that the others do not, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are separate statutory violations.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b667-14\"> We have set out the elements as they are provided in OES 166.220, because, in conducting our inquiry under ORS 167.067(1), only the statutory elements of the offenses are compared; if different, the facts as alleged in the indictment or found by the factfinder are not relevant. <em>State v. Walraven, </em>214 Or App 645, 653-54, 167 P3d 1003 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 280 (2008); <em>State v. Sumerlin, </em>139 Or App 579, 584, 913 P2d 340 (1996). However, when a statute contains alternative forms of a single crime (as, for example, unlawful use of a weapon, which can be committed either by (1) carrying or possessing a dangerous weapon or by (2) attempting to use one), we will look to the indictment to determine which form is charged, and we use the elements of the charged version in the merger analysis. <em>State v. Cufaude, </em>239 Or App 188, 192-93, 244 P3d 382 (2010). This case does not fall within the exception we identified in <em>Cufaude </em>because Counts Four and Five here were based on separate statutory subsections, and not on the alternative theories of unlawful use of a weapon contained in ORS 166.220(l)(a) at issue in <em>Cufaude.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
