J.</author>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">This case is on remand from the Oregon Supreme Court, which reversed our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further proceedings concerning several cross-assignments of error that we had no occasion to address in light of our disposition. <em>Ram Technical Services, Inc. v. Koresko, </em>215 Or App 449, 171 P3d 374 (2007) <em>(Ram I), adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>217 Or App 463, 177 P3d 10 (2008) <em>(Ram II), rev\u2019d, </em>346 Or 215, 208 P3d 950 (2009) <em>(Ram III). </em>The issues on remand concern the trial court\u2019s denial of various motions to dismiss under ORCP 21. Specifically, we must determine whether the trial court erred in denying various defendants\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motions to dismiss (1) under ORCP 21 A(8) for failure to state a claim; (2) under ORCP 21 A(9) on statute of limitations grounds; and (3) under ORCP 21 A(3) because \u201can earlier action already was pending in Pennsylvania.\u201d Further, we must determine whether the trial court erred in denying a motion to dismiss defendant Koresko under ORCP 21 A(2) on the ground that it lacked personal jurisdiction over him in light of the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine.\u201d As explained below, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the motions. Accordingly, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ram III </em>and our rejection of the Corben and Crosswhite defendants\u2019 and the VEBA defendants\u2019 cross-assignments of error, we reverse and remand on appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">I. THE FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The facts and procedural history of this case are complex. For that reason and to provide context, we begin with a general overview of the undisputed procedural facts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>To the extent that resolution of the issues on remand requires that we augment those facts, we do so in the context of addressing the parties\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">In July 2003, plaintiffs filed an action against defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. In their complaint in that action,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201cplaintiffs pleaded, <em>inter alia, </em>claims for \u2018rescission\u2019 and \u2018constructive trust\u2019 based on purported misrepresentations that induced plaintiffs, in 2000, to establish a \u2018voluntary employee benefits association\u2019 (VEBA) benefit plan for employees of plaintiff Ram Technical Services, Inc., and to purchase life insurance policies as a means of funding the VEBA plan. In particular, plaintiffs alleged that they had been told by certain defendants that they would not be required to make annual contributions to sustain the plan; however, by no later than June 11, 2002, plaintiffs first learned that those representations were false and that they were, in fact, required to make annual payments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\"><em>Ram I, </em>215 Or App at 452-53. Pursuant to 29 USC section 1132(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), plaintiffs sought either rescission of their agreement or imposition of a constructive trust on payments that they had made to defendants. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim under ERISA, and the district court granted their motion, noting that \u201can action to rescind an employee benefit plan because of fraud in the inducement arises, if at all, under state law.\u201d <em>Ram III, </em>346 Or at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In April 2004, while the federal litigation was still pending, two of the VEBA defendants filed a complaint against plaintiffs as well as defendant Great Southern in Pennsylvania state court (the Pennsylvania action). In general, those VEBA defendants raised, <em>inter alia, </em>fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims against Great Southern and the Corben and Crosswhite defendants based on alleged statements concerning the operation, benefits, and tax consequences of the benefit plan and a claim to rescind the underlying insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Then, in October 2004, also during the pendency of the federal action (and during the pendency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Pennsylvania action), plaintiffs filed this action in Clackamas County Circuit Court. In their complaint, plaintiffs</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">\u201calleged claims of fraud and \u2018constructive trust\u2019 that were based on the same circumstances [that gave rise to the federal action], specifically, defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations and plaintiffs\u2019 alleged detrimental reliance on those representations, which were the bases of plaintiffs\u2019 claims in the federal litigation. Indeed, the allegations of the parties\u2019 conduct were a virtual \u2018cut-and-paste\u2019 of the parallel, operative allegations in the federal court complaint * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><em>Ram I, </em>215 Or App at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The Corben and Crosswhite defendants filed various motions to dismiss the case pursuant to ORCP 21. As pertinent to the issues on remand, the Corben and Crosswhite defendants contended that this case should be dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to ORCP 21 A(8) on the ground that the dismissal of the federal action \u201cwas on the merits and has a <em>res judicata </em>effect against all claims plaintiffs raised or could have raised\u201d in that action. Alternatively, the Corben and Crosswhite defendants contended that, because plaintiffs filed this case in October 2004 \u2014 more than two years after they knew of the alleged misrepresentations \u2014plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations and the trial court should have dismissed it pursuant to ORCP 21 A(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The VERA defendants also filed various motions to dismiss pursuant to ORCP 21. Two of those motions command the bulk of our consideration on remand. <em>See </em>240 Or App at 629-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">First, the VERA defendants moved to dismiss this case under ORCP 21 A(3) because the Pennsylvania action was pending. Specifically, they contended that the court should dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims in this case because the Pennsylvania action \u201cwill <em>necessarily adjudicate </em>the claims\u201d whether or not plaintiffs assert a counterclaim in that action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>(Emphasis in original.) In response, plaintiffs asserted that, under basic preclusion principles, \u201c[b]ecause there are no compulsory counterclaims in Pennsylvania, and because plaintiffs have not sought any affirmative relief in Pennsylvania, the pending action in Pennsylvania does not preclude this action,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, accordingly, the court should not dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Second, the VEBA defendants moved to dismiss defendant Koresko under ORCP 21 A(2) on the ground that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him in light of the fiduciary shield doctrine.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They urged the trial court to adopt that doctrine and explained that, because \u201cthe fiduciary shield doctrine provides protection to Mr. Koresko, who was acting in his capacity for [defendant] Penn-Mont[,]\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclaims against him should be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.\u201d Plaintiffs responded that the court should not adopt the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine\u201d but that, even if it did, the doctrine would not apply under the circumstances of this case because the evidence submitted in opposition to the VEBA defendants\u2019 motions supported the allegations in their complaint and demonstrated that \u201cKoresko acted at least in part on behalf of himself \u2019 rather than \u201csolely in his capacity as counsel for and agent for Penn Mont[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Ultimately, the trial court, without elaboration, denied the various defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss under ORCP 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Thereafter, defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that claim preclusion and the statute of limitations provided complete defenses to plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The gravamen of defendants\u2019 claim preclusion argument was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 common-law fraud claim could have been brought by way of supplemental jurisdiction in the federal litigation and that no recognized exception to claim preclusion applied in these circumstances. <em>Ram I, </em>215 Or App at 455. The trial court granted summary judgment on both grounds and entered judgment in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Plaintiffs appealed, challenging the dismissal on summary judgment of their common-law fraud claim against defendants as being barred by claim preclusion arising from the determination of prior federal litigation between the parties. In <em>Ram I, </em>we held that, because plaintiffs could have raised their common-law claims in their prior federal litigation with defendants, they were precluded from litigating those claims in state court. That holding was essentially predicated on our understanding that \u201cbroadened [federal] supplemental jurisdiction rules not only allow[ed] plaintiffs to litigate both state and federal issues at once in federal court, but they also compelled] plaintiffs to assert all of their transactionally related claims in a single federal forum \u2014 or risk losing them to claim preclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Given that holding and in light of our reasoning, we did not address whether \u201cthe statute of limitations also and independently barred the prosecution of this action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452 n 2. Further, we did not address various cross-assignments of error raised by the Corben and Crosswhite and the VEBA defendants that were directed at the trial court\u2019s denial of various defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss pursuant to ORCP 21 A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">As noted, in <em>Ram III, </em>the Supreme Court reversed our decision. The court held that, \u201c[b]ecause the record demonstrates that the district court would not have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>* * * claim preclusion does not bar plaintiffs from pursuing those claims in state court.\u201d 346 Or at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Having rejected defendants\u2019 contentions concerning claim preclusion, the court then addressed defendants\u2019 alternative argument that, \u201ceven if claim preclusion is not a bar, plaintiffs\u2019 state action is untimely.\u201d Id. As the Supreme Court noted, and as was understood by the parties, the dispositive issue was whether the extended statute of limitations in ORS 12.220 applied to the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 state action is based on the \u2018same claim\u2019 that plaintiffs pled in the federal action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 236, and that \u201cthis is not a case in which the district court\u2019s ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 ERISA claim adjudicated the merits of their state fraud claims,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 235-36. Accordingly, the court held that \u201cthe extended statute of limitations in ORS 12.220 applies\u201d and \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 state action is timely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236-37. As a consequence, the Supreme Court reversed our decision and remanded the case so that we could consider the cross-assignments of error that, because of our analysis, we had no occasion to address in <em>Ram I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">II. THE CORBEN AND CROSSWHITE DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTIONS TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO ORCP 21 A(8) AND ORCP 21 A(9)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Given the Supreme Court\u2019s directive, we turn first to the Corben and Crosswhite defendants\u2019 cross-assignments of error concerning the trial court\u2019s denial of their motions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>dismiss for failure to state a claim \u201con the grounds of <em>res judicata,\u201d </em>ORCP 21 A(8), and statute of limitations, ORCP 21 A(9). We understand those motions to have been predicated on legal premises pertaining to claim preclusion and the operation of ORS 12.220 that the Supreme Court rejected in <em>Ram III </em>in reversing the allowance of summary judgment on those grounds. Accordingly, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition and analysis in <em>Ram III, </em>we reject the Corben and Crosswhite defendants\u2019 cross-assignments of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">III. THE VEBA DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTIONS TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO ORCP 21 A(3) AND ORCP 21 A(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Resolution of the VEBA defendants\u2019 cross-assignments of error, however, requires a detailed discussion. Specifically, the VEBA defendants contend that the trial court \u201cerr[ed] in refusing to dismiss the Oregon action on the grounds that an earlier action already was pending in Pennsylvania,\u201d ORCP 21 A(3), and erred \u201cas a matter of law in not dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims against [defendant Koresko] for lack of personal jurisdiction on the basis of the fiduciary shield doctrine,\u201d ORCP 21 A(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">A. <em>The Denial of Dismissal Pursuant to ORCP 21 A(3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We turn first to their cross-assignment of error concerning the court\u2019s failure to dismiss pursuant to ORCP 21 A(3) because there was another pending action in Pennsylvania that had been filed by two of the VEBA defendants against plaintiffs in this case as well as Great Southern and the Corben and Crosswhite defendants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because it provides context for the parties\u2019 contentions on review, we begin by describing the principles that inform our analysis of that legal ruling. <em>See Eli v. Lampert (A116201), </em>194 Or App 280, 282, 94 P3d 170 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 57 (2005) (reviewing ruling pursuant to ORCP 21 A(3) \u201cfor errors of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>ORCP 21 A(3) provides for the dismissal of an action when \u201cthere is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause.\u201d In <em>Lee v. Mitchell, </em>152 Or App 159, 164, 165, 953 P2d 414 (1998), we recognized that a dismissal for another action pending under ORCP 21 A(3) furthers the same purpose as that underlying the application of general claim preclusion <em>principles </em>\u2014 viz., to \u201cprevent[ ] requiring a party to litigate the same claim twice on the merits.\u201d Thus, there is a \u201cclose connection\u201d between dismissal under ORCP 21 A(3) and the claim preclusion doctrines of merger and bar, and \u201cdetermining whether either applies involves similar considerations.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>152 Or App at 164-65. Accordingly, \u201c[i]f entry of a judgment in the other pending actions would preclude plaintiffs from asserting any claims in this case, the court should dismiss those claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">In making that determination, we are guided by claim preclusion principles that we outlined in <em>G. B. v. Morey, </em>229 Or App 605, 608-09, 215 P3d 879 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 608 (2010). Specifically, in that case, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">\u201cThe doctrine of claim preclusion prohibits a party from relitigating the same claim or splitting a claim into multiple actions against the same opponent. The rule forecloses a party who has litigated a claim against another from further litigation on that same claim on any ground or theory of relief that the party could have litigated in the first instance. A \u2018claim\u2019 is defined broadly as a group of facts which entitled the plaintiff to relief. In deciding whether a group of facts is part of the same claim, we inquire whether the transactions were related in time, space, origin, or motivation, and whether they form a convenient unit, as well as whether they were substantially of the same sort and similarly motivated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">229 Or App at 608-09 (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Although claim preclusion principles operate generally to prohibit \u201cclaim splitting,\u201d there are some recognized rules that allow such splitting under certain circumstances. As pertinent here, one of those rules is that, in the absence of a compulsory counterclaim statute, \u201cclaim preclusion does not apply when the plaintiff in the second case failed, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>defendant in the first case, to raise a counterclaim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609 (emphasis omitted). <em>See also Lee, </em>152 Or App at 166. Without such a rule, application of the principles of claim preclusion \u201cwould, in effect, create a law of compulsory counterclaim in Oregon\u201d even though \u201c[t]he law in this state is to the contrary.\u201d <em>Burlington Northern v. Lester, </em>48 Or App 579, 583, 617 P2d 906 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">That rule, however, is subject to an <em>exception </em>\u2014 viz., \u201cif the first case <em>necessarily adjudicated </em>the claim that the plaintiff pleads in the second case, that claim is precluded.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>G. B., </em>229 Or App at 609 (emphasis added). As amplified below, the necessarily adjudicated\u201d exception is the predicate and lynchpin of the VERA defendants\u2019 invocation of ORCP 21 A(3). Accordingly, we address its provenance and content in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception derives from a statement in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gwynn v. Wilhelm, </em>226 Or 606, 610, 360 P2d 312 (1961). In that case, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">\u201c[I]n the absence of a compulsory counterclaim statute, the defendant is not required to set up a counterclaim and his failure to do so does not preclude him from bringing a separate action against the plaintiff on the separate cause of action which was available to him as a counterclaim. This rule, however, is subject to the qualification that <em>a party can not recover in a separate action on a cause of action which he failed to plead in a prior action by way of setoff or counterclaim but which was necessarily adjudicated by the former judgment.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">226 Or at 610 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Although the \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception has developed in the context of claim preclusion, the Supreme Court recently elucidated that the exception is, in fact, predicated on principles of issue preclusion. In <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>rel English v. Multnomah County, </em>348 Or 417, 433 n 11, 238 P3d 980 (2010), the court, quoting the italicized statement from <em>Gwynn, </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u201c[I]f the defendant actually raises a counterclaim in the first action, the rule of bar applies as though the defendant was a plaintiff in the first action. Further, the rules of issue preclusion apply so that \u2018a party can not recover in a separate action on a cause of action which he failed to plead in a prior action by way of setoff or counterclaim but which was necessarily adjudicated by the former judgment.\u2019 <em>Gwynn[, </em>226 Or at 610].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> Unlike claim preclusion, issue preclusion, in broad terms, \u201cprecludes future litigation on a subject issue only if the issue was <em>actually </em>litigated and determined in a setting where its determination was essential to the final decision reached.\u201d <em>Drews v. EBI Companies, </em>310 Or 134, 139, 795 P2d 531 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Accordingly, and given the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of the underpinnings of the \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception, we understand that it applies when the factual and legal issues that the plaintiff raises in the second case were <em>actually </em>adjudicated and essential to the determination of the first case. Indeed, that understanding comports literally with the Supreme Court\u2019s description of the exception, <em>viz., </em>\u201cwhich <em>was </em>necessarily adjudicated,\u201d <em>Gwynn, </em>226 Or at 610 (emphasis added) \u2014 and not \u201cwhich <em>will be </em>necessarily adjudicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">With those principles in mind, we turn to the VEBA defendants\u2019 contention that, \u201c[u]nder ORCP 21 A(3), the Circuit Court should have dismissed this action in favor of the first-filed Pennsylvania case filed by the VEBA Defendants.\u201d Specifically, the VEBA defendants assert that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">\u201c[b]ecause of the relationship between Rule 21 A(3) and principles of claim preclusion, the real question under ORCP 21 A(3) is whether a judgment in the first-filed action * * * would bar plaintiffs from bringing the claim at a later time because the claim arises out of the same transaction. Because both cases arise out of the same transaction and the first-filed Pennsylvania action will decide the dispositive issue of whether or not there was fraud, Rule 21 A(3) requires dismissal in Oregon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>\u201cPlaintiffs do not dispute that the precise factual issues being litigated in Pennsylvania \u2014 whether Great Southern\u2019s agent Crosswhite misrepresented the terms of its insurance policy and specifically whether yearly contributions were mandatory \u2014 are the same issues raised in this action. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims in Oregon are premised upon the existence of this alleged fraud. Therefore, if on remand this action is allowed to proceed, there is a high potential for inconsistent results. For example, Great Southern and its agents might prevail in one state and not prevail in another, resulting in a policy that is rescinded in one state but not another. Great Southern and its agents might be subject to multiple and duplicative damages awards. This kind of inconsistency is precisely what ORCP 21 A(3) is intended to prevent. There could also be an unseemly race to judgment in Pennsylvania and Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">(Internal quotation marks and citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In sum, the VEBA defendants recognize that the availability of dismissal under ORCP 21 A(3) depends on the \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception. Specifically, the VEBA defendants appear to acknowledge that, because counterclaims are not compulsory in Pennsylvania,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> preclusion would not prohibit plaintiffs, who failed to raise counterclaims as defendants in the first-filed Pennsylvania action, from raising their current claims unless the \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception applies. In invoking that exception, the VEBA defendants contend that the dispositive issue is \u201cwhether the first-filed Pennsylvania case <em>will necessarily adjudicate </em>the fraud claim in this later filed case\u201d \u2014 and not that issues essential to the Oregon claims <em>have actually been adjudicated </em>in the Pennsylvania action. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">For their part, plaintiffs disagree that the \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception applies. Specifically, they disagree with the VEBA defendants\u2019 characterization of the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>as requiring a speculative examination of whether the first-filed Pennsylvania action <em>will necessarily adjudicate </em>their claims. Instead, they posit that the exception does not apply because the Pennsylvania action had not yet been adjudicated. Alternatively, they assert that, \u201c[e]ven assuming [that] the Pennsylvania action makes its way to trial and * * * [the pertinent VEBA defendants prevail], plaintiffs in this case will not receive the relief to which they are entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">As framed by the parties, the dispositive legal issue is whether the \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception applies under the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As previously described, that exception applies only when the factual and legal issues that a plaintiff raises in a second action were <em>actually </em>adjudicated and essential to the determination of the first-filed action. <em>See </em>240 Or App at 632. Because we understand that the Pennsylvania action has not been adjudicated, the exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In so holding, we emphasize three salient considerations. <em>First, </em>as noted \u2014 and consistently with <em>Gwynn\u2019s \u201cwas </em>necessarily adjudicated\u201d formulation, 226 Or at 610 (emphasis added) \u2014 the \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception finds its origin in issue preclusion principles that require the <em>actual </em>litigation and determination of pertinent legal and factual issues. <em>Second, </em>any determination that the Pennsylvania action <em>will </em>necessarily adjudicate the claims that plaintiffs raised here is speculative until a judgment is entered disposing of that case \u2014 indeed, the Pennsylvania action could settle without an adjudication of the merits. <em>Third, </em>applying the VEBA defendants\u2019 proposed \u201cwill necessarily adjudicate\u201d construct would completely abrogate the rule <em>(viz., </em>in the absence of a compulsory counterclaim statute, a plaintiff who, as a defendant, did not assert a counterclaim in the first action is not barred from raising that claim in the second action) that the \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception was intended to merely qualify. That is so, because defendant\u2019s formulation would, in effect, transmute noncompulsory counterclaims into compulsory ones. <em>See Burlington </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>Northern, </em>48 Or App at 583 (stating the general rule that, in the absence of a compulsory counterclaim statute, claim preclusion does not apply when the plaintiff in the second case failed, as a defendant in the first case, to raise a counterclaim; reasoning that the rule is necessary to avoid requiring compulsory counterclaims where the law does not otherwise so provide).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Plaintiffs are not precluded from raising their current claims. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the VEBA defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to ORCP 21 A(3) on the ground that there was another action pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">B. <em>The Denial of Dismissal Pursuant to ORCP 21 A(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We proceed, finally, to the VEBA defendants\u2019 cross-assignment of error challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion to dismiss defendant Koresko under ORCP 21 A(2), for \u201clack of jurisdiction over the person.\u201d In particular, they assert that such a dismissal is compelled under the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine.\u201d According to the VEBA defendants, the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine\u201d is a principle that \u201cbars this court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over an individual who <em>at all times </em>was acting within his official capacity and scope of duty as an officer of a corporate defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In <em>Kotera v. Daioh Int'l U.S.A. </em>Corp., 179 Or App 253, 262, 40 P3d 506 (2002), we explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">\u201c[i]n reviewing the denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, we assume the truth of all well-pleaded allegations. <em>Sutherland v.

We construe pleadings and affidavits liberally to support jurisdiction.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]. Id.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">(Emphasis omitted.) Further, \u201c[w]here, as here, the trial court made no express findings, we assume that the court found facts consistent with its judgment\u201d and \u201creview the court\u2019s assumed factual findings to determine whether they are supported by any competent evidence[.]\u201d <em>Sutherland, </em>131 Or App at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cOnce the jurisdictional facts are established, we review the determination of personal jurisdiction for errors of law.\u201d <em>Kotera, </em>179 Or App at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Given that standard, we recount the material content of the pleadings and the parties\u2019 submissions pertaining to jurisdiction in some detail. In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged, in part, that defendants \u201cKoresko and Crosswhite, on behalf of themselves, Corben, Penn-Mont, and Great Southern, told Plaintiffs that annual contributions by the Plaintiffs were not required in order to sustain the VEBAfunded benefit plan\u201d and that plaintiffs were harmed as a result of their reasonable reliance on those representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">As previously described, the VEBA defendants moved to dismiss defendant Koresko for lack of personal jurisdiction under the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine\u201d and submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>a supporting affidavit from Koresko.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, the VEBA defendants explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\">\u201cMr. Koresko is the general counsel of Penn-Mont, alleged by plaintiffs to be the Plan administrator. Supposedly, according to plaintiffs, Mr. Koresko made representations both on behalf of himself as an individual and on behalf of Penn-Mont, but plaintiffs do not specify what representation was made in which capacity. However, Mr. Koresko states in his affidavit that all of his dealings with plaintiff have been in a representative capacity. Based upon this evidence, unless plaintiffs allege and can prove some act or omission by Mr. Koresko outside the scope of his duties for Penn-Mont, jurisdiction over him in Oregon is barred by the fiduciary shield doctrine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Plaintiffs responded with their own argument and evidentiary submissions. Their arguments were two-fold. First, plaintiffs contended that the VEBA defendants \u201cfail[ed] to offer authority to this Court that would support the proposition that Oregon should adopt the fiduciary shield doctrine.\u201d Second and alternatively, plaintiffs contended that, even if the trial court adopted the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine,\u201d it would not apply to the circumstances of this case because plaintiffs\u2019 evidence submitted in opposition to the VEBA defendants\u2019 motion supported the allegations in their complaint that \u201cKoresko acted at least in part on behalf of himself\u2019 rather than \u201csolely in his capacity as counsel for and agent for Penn Mont[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence pertaining to personal jurisdiction included an affidavit from plaintiff Charles Stalnaker and various documents provided to plaintiffs as they considered whether to create the benefit plan that identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Koresko individually as an attorney or certified public accountant without reference to an association with Penn-Mont or any other VEBA defendant. In his affidavit, Stalnaker also states that, in October 2000, he attended a meeting at a hotel in Lake Oswego at which \u201cMr. Koresko specifically told me, in response to my question, that annual contributions were not required in order to sustain the VEBA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\">As previously indicated, the trial court denied the motion without elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">On appeal, the parties essentially reiterate the contentions that they raised to the trial court. For their part, the VEBA defendants again posit that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">\u201c[a]lthough the question is one of first impression in the Oregon state courts, the VEBA Defendants maintain that defendant Koresko is entitled to the protection of the fiduciary shield doctrine. The acts or omissions alleged by plaintiffs, on the undisputed facts, were solely in his capacity as an officer and attorney for the corporate VEBA defendants. Under these circumstances, where the facts are not in dispute and there is no basis for applying the doctrines of alter ego and disregard for the corporate form, the Circuit Court should have found no personal jurisdiction over Koresko under the equitable doctrine of fiduciary shield.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The VEBA defendants\u2019 contentions on appeal are exceptionally narrow in scope. Consistently with their position before the trial court, on appeal the VEBA defendants do not contend that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the court had personal jurisdiction over Koresko under the standards articulated in ORCP 4, which provides various bases for an Oregon court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant. In fact, the VEBA defendants assert that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201cthe issue is not whether the Oregon courts have the constitutional power to exercise jurisdiction over Koresko, but whether they <em>should </em>do so instead of following Pennsylvania in adopting the fiduciary shield doctrine as an equitable limitation on their power when there is no evidence sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and no misuse of the corporate form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>(Emphasis in original.) Thus, we understand the VEBA defendants\u2019 position to be that personal jurisdiction over Koresko is lacking <em>only if </em>(a) the court adopts the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine\u201d as an exception to the requirements of ORCP 4 and (b) the doctrine applies to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">We need not determine whether to adopt the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine\u201d as described by the VEBA defendants.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That is so because, even if the VEBA defendants are correct that the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine\u201d bars the \u201cexercise of personal jurisdiction over an individual who <em>at all times </em>was acting within his official capacity and scope of duty as an officer of a corporate defendant,\u201d plaintiffs submitted evidence in opposition to the VEBA defendants\u2019 motion from which the trial court could have found that Koresko was not <em>at all times </em>acting within his \u201cofficial capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Despite various documents indicating that Koresko was acting in a representative capacity and Koresko\u2019s statements in his affidavit indicating that all of his visits and dealings with plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cwelfare benefit arrangement\u201d were in his capacity as an officer or attorney for Penn-Mont, plaintiffs alleged that Koresko acted, at least in part, on his own behalf and, in support of those allegations, submitted some documentary evidence in which Koresko was held out as an individual without reference to any association with Penn-Mont or any other VEBA defendant. In light of our standard of review, that evidence was sufficient for the trial court to determine that, even if Oregon courts adopted the \u201cfiduciary shield doctrine\u201d as formulated by defendants, it did not apply to the circumstances of this case because Koresko, in his dealings with plaintiffs, did not at all times act \u201cwithin his official capacity and scope of duty as an officer\u201d of any of the VEBA defendants.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The trial court did not err in denying the VEBA defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under ORCP 21 A(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">IV. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">As previously described, plaintiffs appealed following the dismissal of their action after the trial court granted defendants summary judgment on claim preclusion and statute of limitations grounds. Within the context of that appeal, the Corben and Crosswhite defendants raised cross-assignments of error in which they sought to reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling concerning certain ORCP 21 motions. Similarly, the VEBA defendants also sought to reverse the trial court\u2019s rulings concerning two of their ORCP 21 motions. However, rather than raising cross-assignments of error in the context of plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the VEBA defendants filed a cross-appeal. As we previously indicated, that cross-appeal was \u201cmiscast,\u201d and, for purposes of our analysis, we have treated the VEBA defendants\u2019 contentions as cross-assignments of error. Thus, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ram III </em>and our rejection of the Corben and Crosswhite defendants\u2019 and the VEBA defendants\u2019 cross-assignments of error, we reverse and remand on appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Reversed and remanded on appeal; cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\"> As we indicated in <em>Ram </em>I,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">\u201c[t]hree groups of defendants appeared separately before the trial court and on appeal: (1) John J.

Specifically, the VEBA defendants assert that \u201cplaintiffs put into the record documents prepared by third parties * * * mentioning Koresko.
