Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission, over defendant\u2019s objection, of the testimony of a CARES examining physician, Dr. Purvis, in which Purvis recounted her diagnosis that AK \u201chad experienced sexual abuse.\u201d Purvis rendered that diagnosis notwithstanding that her physical examination of AK was \u201cnormal\u201d and without any physical evidence of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that, under <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), which was decided approximately four months after the trial of this matter, the admission of Purvis\u2019s diagnosis was reversible error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state concedes that, under <em>State v. Bainbridge, </em>238 Or App 56, 241 P3d 1186 (2010), which followed <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 234 P3d 117 (2010), the trial court\u2019s admission of Purvis\u2019s testimony recounting her diagnosis was reversible error. That concession is well founded, and we accept it. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial. <em>Bainbridge, </em>238 Or App at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\"> The trial court\u2019s admission of the disputed evidence was predicated, in part, on our disposition in <em>State v. Southard, </em>214 Or App 292, 164 P3d 351 (2007), which the Supreme Court subsequently reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
