Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009). Although defendant did not object to the admission of the diagnosis, he contends that admission of that evidence was plain error under <em>Southard. </em>We agree that the admission of the evidence was plain error and, for the reasons set forth in <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 522, 228 P3d 666 (2010), and <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 513-14, 228 P3d 688 (2010), we exercise our discretion to correct that error.
