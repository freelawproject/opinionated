Hale, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Jason D. Gati attended Western Kentucky University from 2010 to 2011 to pursue a master's degree in mental health counseling. Gati, a disabled veteran, lived close to Elizabethtown but over an hour drive away from WKU's main campus in Bowling Green. Gati sued WKU and two administrators, Dr. Bill Kline and Crissy Priddy, after the university failed to offer courses necessary for completion of his master's degree either at the university's satellite Elizabethtown campus or through interactive technology that would allow him to participate remotely. Gati asserts claims for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Kentucky Civil Rights Act (KCRA), and the Rehabilitation Act, as well as claims for tortious interference with contractual and prospective contractual relations, promissory estoppel, and fraud. This matter is now before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment. Defendants seek summary judgment on all claims asserted by Gati. (Docket No. 38) Gati moved for partial summary judgment with respect to his claims under the ADA, the KCRA, and the Rehabilitation Act. (D.N. 39) After careful consideration and for the reasons explained below, Defendants' motion will be granted, and Gati's motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Gati became permanently disabled after he suffered a serious spine injury during mandatory physical fitness training for the United States Army. (D.N. 33-1, PageID # 442-43) His disability renders him unable to sit for longer than one hour at a time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 498-99) After moving his family to Kentucky, Gati met with WKU Graduate Admissions Counselor Crissy Priddy at the university's Elizabethtown campus to discuss a graduate program in mental health counseling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 439, 489; D.N. 30-1, PageID # 88-89) Priddy's job was to advise WKU graduate students in general without providing them with specific information as to courses and curriculum. (D.N. 30-1, PageID # 85) Quite simply, she would \"help[ ] any students that had any questions about graduate education.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 89) Once a month, she would go to the Elizabethtown campus to assist prospective students who were interested in WKU's graduate programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 88-89) The parties disagree as to what Priddy told Gati during their meeting. Gati asserts that Priddy told him that nothing would interfere with him enjoying a full, unabridged master's degree curriculum at the Elizabethtown campus. (D.N. 33-1, PageID # 448) According to Priddy, her regular practice was to explain that classes would be offered in different locations and in various formats to be determined by\n   individual university departments. (D.N. 30-1, PageID # 89)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2010, WKU admitted Gati to pursue a master's degree in counseling. (D.N. 33-1, PageID # 491) The parties agree that Gati completed two semesters at WKU's Elizabethtown campus without issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 38-1, PageID # 702; D.N. 41, PageID # 776) However, when Gati attempted to register for the fall 2011 semester, he discovered that the classes required for his counseling degree were offered only in Bowling Green. (D.N. 33-1, PageID # 455) Gati then contacted Dr. Bill Kline, the head of the program, and told him that he could not attend classes in Bowling Green due to his disability. (D.N. 36-1, PageID # 647) Kline referred Gati to Student Disability Services, and Gati later applied for disability services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 647-48; D.N. 33-1, PageID # 496) In his application, Gati requested (1) priority registration and class selection and (2) ITV\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and alternative class delivery. (D.N. 33-1, PageID # 496) Gati later clarified that he was also requesting that his classes be physically conducted at the Elizabethtown campus. (D.N. 32-1, PageID # 405)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2011, Howard Bailey, WKU's Vice President for Student Affairs, informed Gati that his accommodation requests had been denied, and that as a result, Gati would need to attend classes at the university's main campus in Bowling Green to maintain full-time enrollment status. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 31-3, PageID # 194-95) Bailey consulted Kline to determine the feasibility of Gati's request to take courses via ITV. (D.N. 32-1, PageID # 382) Kline indicated to Bailey that he would not be able to determine a student's mastery of the course content via television. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Kline testified that the faculty believed ITV would be inappropriate for the delivery of mental health counseling courses. (D.N. 36-1, PageID # 648) \"The faculty believed that the kinds of class interactions that students have with each other, the activities that are conducted in classes and the skills development procedures used in these classes could not be delivered via ITV.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 648-49) According to Kline, the classes at issue required students to \"get in small groups and look at each other in the presence of one another\" so that they could have \"direct counseling interactions ... and receive immediate feedback.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 649) Counseling students needed to learn about body language, posture, and communication style, which would be \"very difficult to discern when somebody is sitting behind a table pushing a button on a microphone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Deborah Wilkins, WKU's General Counsel, explained to Gati why he would not be able to take all the necessary courses in Elizabethtown. (D.N. 31-7, PageID # 298) First, WKU did not have sufficient faculty to teach the courses in Elizabethtown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accreditation standards limited the number of courses that faculty could teach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The limited number of faculty in the department thus limited the number of courses that could be offered at one time at any single location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accreditation standards also required part-time instructors to be properly credentialed, and there simply were not enough credentialed instructors due to market demand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 299) Therefore, the problem could not be remedied by hiring part-time instructors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gati filed a Student Disability Services Grievance Form with WKU. (D.N. 31-3, PageID # 200) In response, WKU granted\n   Gati's request for priority registration but again denied Gati's request that his required courses be offered via ITV and/or in Elizabethtown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 203-04) Bailey reiterated to Gati that the mental health counseling courses required classroom interaction between students and instructor, instructor-supervised skills practice, and small group activities-none of which would be possible in an ITV setting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 203) Bailey also noted that Gati had the option of living on campus in order to attend courses that were going to be offered in Bowling Green only.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 204)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gati alleges that WKU violated the ADA, the KCRA, and the Rehabilitation Act by failing to make reasonable accommodations for him to complete his graduate degree in mental health counseling. (D.N. 1-1) Gati also alleges that Kline and Priddy violated the KCRA by aiding and abetting WKU's discriminatory practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Gati alleges that Priddy is liable to him under theories of tortious interference with contractual and prospective contractual relations, promissory estoppel, and fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Gati sues Kline and Priddy in both their official and individual capacities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kline and Priddy assert that they are entitled to official immunity. (D.N. 38-1, PageID # 708-10) WKU asserts that the accommodations Gati requested were not reasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 713-19)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(D.N. 41, PageID # 782-83)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is well settled that the Eleventh Amendment generally bars a damages action against a state employee sued in his or her official capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675807\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/334/#p342\">\n    574 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   342 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kentucky v.

This is presumably why Gati discusses the possibility of equitable relief in his response to Defendants' motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 41, PageID # 783) However, the distinction between monetary and equitable relief is not dispositive with respect to Gati's claims under the KCRA. Kline and Priddy, both employees of WKU, have been sued in their official capacities, meaning that they are entitled to the same immunity to which WKU would be entitled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675807\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/334/#p342\">\n    574 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   342 ;\n   <em>\n    Yanero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9397757\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/65/510/#p522\">\n    65 S.W.3d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under Kentucky law, sovereign immunity does not prevent suit against the Commonwealth or its entities based upon the KCRA. Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 344.010(1) (defining \"person\" to include the state and any of its subdivisions or agencies);\n   <em>\n    Ammerman v. Bd. of Educ. of Nicholas Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182738\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/30/793/#p797\">\n    30 S.W.3d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 797 (Ky. 2000). Thus, sovereign immunity does not bar Gati's KCRA claims against WKU. And because Kline and Priddy, in their official capacities, are entitled only to the same immunity to which WKU is entitled, sovereign immunity does not protect them from these claims either. However, any recovery against Kline and/or Priddy in their official capacities will be, in effect, recovery against WKU.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grinter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031383\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/532/567/#p572\">\n    532 F.3d at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Court's analysis of Gati's claims against WKU,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B, also applies to Gati's KCRA claims against Kline and Priddy in their official capacities, and the Court will grant summary judgment in their favor on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition, Gati sued Priddy in her official capacity under state law for tortious interference with contractual and prospective contractual relations, promissory estoppel, and fraud. (D.N. 1-1) Again, the Eleventh Amendment generally bars a damages action against a state employee sued in his or her official capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675807\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/334/#p342\">\n    574 F.3d at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A court may, however, grant prospective injunctive relief against a state officer to compel compliance\n   with federal law.\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587071\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/641/#p646\">\n    170 F.3d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646 (6th Cir. 1999). But Gati does not seek to compel Priddy's compliance with federal law. Instead, he alleges these state-law claims seeking damages. (D.N. 1-1; D.N. 41, PageID # 791-95) Therefore, Priddy is entitled to sovereign immunity on Gati's official-capacity claims against her under state law, and the Court will grant summary judgment in her favor on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Individual-Capacity Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Gati also sued Kline and Priddy in their individual capacities for alleged violations of the KCRA. (D.N. 1-1) Kline and Priddy argue that qualified immunity protects them from these claims. (D.N. 38-1, PageID # 709) In Kentucky, qualified official immunity applies to discretionary acts performed in good faith within the scope of the official's authority.\n   <em>\n    T.S. v.

With respect to Priddy, Gati does not challenge her assertion that she used judgment and experience to determine what kind of information to provide to Gati. In fact, Gati does not dispute the Defendants' characterization of their decisions as discretionary but instead asserts incorrectly that they are not entitled to any immunity under the KRCA. (D.N. 41, PageID # 784) Kline and Priddy are entitled to qualified official immunity on Gati's individual-capacity claims against them under the KCRA, and the Court will grant summary judgment in their favor on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition, Gati sued Priddy in her individual capacity under state law for tortious interference with contractual and prospective contractual relations, promissory estoppel, and fraud. (D.N. 1-1) Priddy again asserts that her actions were discretionary in nature and entitle her to qualified immunity. (D.N. 38-1, PageID # 710) As for these claims against Priddy, Gati responds: \"Priddy was involved with [him] only in the realm of the normal course and requirements of her job as Assistant Director of Graduate Admissions in Elizabethtown. Her statements to [him] did not involve discretion, judgment, or personal deliberation.\" (D.N. 41, PageID # 784) However, Gati fails to point to any job requirement that Priddy breached. Priddy's job as Graduate Admissions Counselor was to inform prospective students generally about the graduate study programs offered at WKU. (D.N. 30-1, PageID # 85) Priddy would go to the Elizabethtown campus once a month to assist prospective students who were interested in WKU's graduate programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 89) Priddy and Gati met at the Elizabethtown campus and discussed Gati's interest in WKU's graduate programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 88-89; D.N. 33-1, PageID # 447-48).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This testimony does not prove that Priddy lied or otherwise acted maliciously toward Gati.

The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Gati, reveals at most a mistake, but it does not establish intent to harm.

Thus, Gati's claims necessarily turn on the issue of whether his accommodation requests were reasonable.

(D.N. 32-1, PageID # 405) The Court will discuss these requests separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   WKU argues that offering classes in mental health counseling in ITV format is not a reasonable accommodation because, according to university faculty, such a format would sacrifice the face-to-face interaction that is critical to the program. (D.N. 38-1, PageID #713-16) Gati responds that the interactive nature of ITV makes it a reasonable accommodation request and that, in any event, WKU did not make a fact-specific determination on Gati's accommodation request. (D.N. 41, PageID # 787-89)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Kline, the head of WKU's mental health counseling program, testified that faculty believed that ITV would be inappropriate for the delivery of their courses. (D.N. 36-1, PageID # 648) Specifically, they believed that class interactions among students, in-class activities, and skills development procedures could not be delivered via ITV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 648-49) Further, Kline testified that counseling students needed to learn body language, posture, and style of communication, which would be \"very difficult to discern when somebody is sitting behind a table pushing a button on a microphone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 649) Finally, the classes at issue required students to have face-to-face counseling interactions so that they could receive immediate feedback from their instructors, which also would not be possible in ITV format. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In short, Kline's testimony shows that he believed ITV would substantially modify the program's standards. Although Gati argues that ITV allows interactive communication regardless of location (D.N. 41, PageID # 787), the Court defers to the professional academic judgments of Kline and the other faculty he consulted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaltenberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11800677\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/162/432/#p435\">\n    162 F.3d at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Gati also asserts, however, that WKU's decisional process was flawed in that it did not consider whether ITV was a reasonable accommodation for Gati. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 789; D.N. 39-1, PageID # 753) Gati cites Ninth Circuit case law to argue that universities must understand the specifics of an individual's disability and explore alternatives for accommodating him or her.

(D.N. 38-1, PageID # 717-18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.N. 31-7, PageID # 298-99) More specifically, WKU could not increase the course load of current faculty members or hire non-credentialed part-time instructors without risking its accreditation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Gati responds that he was promised that the entire program would be offered in Elizabethtown and that he would not have needed an accommodation if this promise had been kept. (D.N. 41, PageID # 789-90) Gati does not respond, however, to WKU's argument that it could not offer all classes in Elizabethtown because of insufficient faculty and credentials, leaving that assertion undisputed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2). Loss of accreditation would certainly constitute a substantial modification of program standards-one that the law does not require,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaltenberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11800677\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/162/432/#p435\">\n    162 F.3d at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . WKU thus did not violate the ADA when it declined to offer the entire mental health counseling program at its Elizabethtown campus. Accordingly, the Court will grant summary judgment for WKU on Gati's claims under the ADA, the KCRA, and the Rehabilitation Act, which likewise resolves Gati's KCRA claims against Kline and Priddy in their official capacities.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A. 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, and the Court being otherwise sufficiently advised, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (1) Defendants' motion for summary judgment (D.N. 38) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (2) Gati's motion for partial summary judgment (D.N. 39) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (3) A separate judgment will be entered this date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    ITV refers to \"video conferencing technology that is used in a classroom environment.\" (D.N. 31-6, PageID # 293) The technology utilizes cameras, microphones, and a special computer that sends audio and visual signals through the Internet so that people in different locations can talk to and see each other.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.N. 41, PageID # 778-79; D.N. 32-1, PageID # 374; D.N. 34-1, PageID # 595; D.N. 36-1, PageID # 666) But as the Court's discussion will show, the ultimate issue in this case is the liability of WKU, not that of the individual defendants.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Section III. Since all of the potential decision makers were employed by WKU, it is not critical to the Court's analysis that WKU's decisions be precisely attributed to a specific WKU official. For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that WKU is entitled to summary judgment on all claims asserted by Gati.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Section III.B. Thus, the individual defendants in their official capacities are likewise entitled to summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rosado v.
