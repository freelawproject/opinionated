The motions are now ripe for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted and Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Leader Global Solutions LLC (\"Plaintiff\" or \"LGS\") is a Florida limited liability company with offices located in Coral Gables, Florida,\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def.'s 56.1\") (ECF No. 52) \u00b6 2. LGS provides specialty trading services, including customized trade and supply chain financing to clients around the world.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Pl.'s 56.1\") (ECF No. 61) \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 24, 2015, LGS entered into a Master Sales Agreement (\"MSA\") with Corporaci\u00f3n Yanber S.A. (\"Yanber\"), a large Cosa Rican-based company that manufactures flexible packaging that it distributes throughout the Americas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Samuel Yankelewitz (\"Defendant\" or \"Yankelewitz\") was the president of Yanber, and ran the company for more than forty years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   LGS and Yanber each retained Costa Rican counsel to negotiate\n   the terms of the MSA, including the specific price markups and late fees that would be incurred if Yanber failed to make timely payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the MSA, LGS agreed to purchase the title to raw materials that were physically delivered directly to Yanber, then to resell the title to those materials to Yanber at a later date in exchange for a purchasing fee consisting of the invoiced price of the goods plus a markup (together, the \"Purchasing Fee\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Under the terms of the MSA, Yanber had 150 days to pay the Purchasing Fee without incurring late charges or interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Pursuant to the MSA, if the invoices issued by LGS to Yanber were not timely paid, there would be a seven-day payment grace period, after which such invoices would be \"subject to a modified product markup of 11% and would and shall additionally bear a monthly interest rate equal to 2.75% of the outstanding balance owed by Buyer to LGS ....\" Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 6; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 7. In the MSA, Yanber expressly acknowledged and agreed \"that LGS is not a lender and that the [services it provides] do not constitute a loan.\" Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 11. Yankelewitz viewed LGS as a supplier, not a lender.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a condition of LGS entering into the MSA with Yanber, Yankelewitz executed a personal guaranty relating to Yanber's obligations under the MSA (the \"Guaranty\"). Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Yankelewitz executed the Guaranty on February 24, 2015-the same day that LGS and Yanber executed the MSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 4. The Guaranty was re-executed to correct a typographical error on April 30, 2015, but the April 30th version is otherwise substantively identical to the February 24th version. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to the MSA, Yanber executed promissory notes for each purchase it made from LGS (\"Promissory Notes\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Each note contained different interest rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def's Opp'n 56.1 (ECF No. 65) \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2015, Yanber filed a petition to initiate a pre-bankruptcy proceeding, known as a \"Convenio Preventivo\" (hereinafter \"Convenio\"), in the insolvency court of San Jose, Cosa Rica (the \"Costa Rican Bankruptcy Court\"). Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 7; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 16. Yanber initiated the Convenio because it was insolvent. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 17. Yanber failed to make more than $3 million in payments to LGS owed under the MSA and related Promissory Notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Convenio gave Yanber a chance to negotiate with its various creditors to create a proposal that would prevent Yanber from falling into bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 8, 2015, the Costa Rican Bankruptcy Court accepted Yanber's petition and commenced the Convenio. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 9. During the Convenio, LGS filed a claim in the Convenio seeking to enforce the Promissory Notes, and also filed documents showing that Yanber owed it US $3,467,727.71. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 19; Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 10. LGS's claim was approved by the Cosa Rican Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, Yanber's creditors negotiated with Yanber and Yankelewitz in an effort to reach an agreement pursuant to which Yanber's debts would be repaid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 29, 2016, pursuant to Costa Rican insolvency law, a meeting of Yanber's creditors was held at the Costa Rican Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   LGS attended\n   the Yanber creditors' meeting through its Costa Rican attorneys.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Yankelewitz appeared at the creditor's meeting as the representative of Yanber and on his own behalf as a shareholder. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the course of the creditors' meeting, Yanber, Yankelewitz, and Yanber's creditors reached an agreement (the \"Precautionary Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. The majority of Yanber's creditors provided the necessary approval for the Precautionary Agreement, which became effective on all of Yanber's creditors, and set forth a plan under which Yanber would satisfy its debts. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 20. Thirty-two of thirty-five creditors with voting rights that had filed claims against Yanber voted in favor of the Precautionary Agreement, including LGS. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 21. The Costa Rican Bankruptcy Court approved the Precautionary Agreement on January 29, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Precautionary Agreement contemplates the creditors effectively taking control of the company, securing any proceeds, and distributing them over time. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 22. Although Yankelewitz was not a debtor in the Precautionary Agreement, he agreed to transfer the shares of his 100% interest in Yanber and in another company-Fomento Agricola del Atlantico, S.A. (\"Fomento\")-to a trust for the benefit of Yanber's creditors, including LGS. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23; Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 16. Yankelewitz also relinquished his personal claim of $7,930,000 against Yanber and waived any and all other claims that he might have against Yanber and Fomento. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yankelewitz did not contribute cash to the trust fund. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 26. Finally, none of the parties filed anything in the Convenio explicitly mentioning the Guaranty.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LGS has not received any proceeds from the Precautionary Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. During the process of payment, creditors will have the ability to challenge or change the terms of the Precautionary Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Yankelewitz has not paid LGS the monies Yanber owed to Leader Global under the MSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 18, 2015, LGS filed its first lawsuit against Yankelewitz for breach of the Guaranty in the case styled\n   <em>\n    Leader Global Solutions LLC v. Yankelewitz,\n   </em>\n   No. 15-23092-CIV-SCOLA (S.D. Fla. Aug. 18, 2015) (the \"First Lawsuit\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Within days of LGS's filing of the First Lawsuit, Yankelewitz negotiated a payment extension with LGS and made an initial $780,000 payment to LGS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, Ex. 1 to Def.'s Opp'n 56.1 (ECF No. 65-1). Upon receipt of the $780,000 payment, LGS voluntarily dismissed the First Lawsuit. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 31. Yankelewitz did not make any further payments to LGS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 11, 2016, LGS filed the instant lawsuit against Yankelewitz for breach of the Guaranty, contending that Yankelewitz owed LGS a total of $2,680,285.44.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. This amount included $2,467,727.71 in unpaid principal, $96,282.51 in markups and $116,275.22 in late fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 10, 2016, Yankelewitz moved for summary judgment on the single claim\n   against him for breach of guaranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. (ECF No. 52). The next day, LGS moved for summary judgment on the same claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. (ECF No. 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Specifically, Yankelewitz asserts the following affirmative defenses: (1) the Court \"lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action\" because the claims have been resolved, or are currently being adjudicated, in the Costa Rican courts; (2) Plaintiff's claims are barred by principles of res judicata in that the Costa Rican courts have determined the amount of debt owed by Yanber to Leader Global and have relieved Yankelewitz of all liability; (3) Plaintiff waived its right to seek damages against Defendant by voting in favor of the Precautionary Agreement; (4) Plaintiff's claim is barred in whole or in part due to the usurious interest rates imposed by the MSA and the Guaranty; and (5) Defendant is entitled to a set-off of monies paid to Plaintiff in full or partial satisfaction of its claims by any and all collateral sources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Yankelewitz moves for summary judgment based solely on his defenses pertaining to (1) subject matter jurisdiction, (2) res judicata, and (3) waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 9-10. Yankelewitz also argues that summary judgment is appropriate on his subject matter jurisdiction and res judicata claims in light of the principles of comity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   LGS moves for summary judgment on the grounds that all of Yankelewitz's defenses fail and there is no dispute that Yankelewitz breached the Guaranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 4-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly, the issue on summary judgment is whether any of Yankelewitz's affirmative defenses prevent LGS's enforcement of the Guaranty. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that they do not and that summary judgment in favor of LGS is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Subject Matter Jurisdiction, Res Judicata, and Comity Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Despite the language used in the subject matter jurisdiction defense, Yankelewitz does not argue that the Court actually \"lacks\" subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, Yankelewitz argues that the Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction because \"all potential claims relating to the MSA and Guaranty either have been or are being resolved in the Courts of Costa Rica with the consent of Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. (ECF No. 52) at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15. Relatedly, Yankelewitz argues\n   that the Court should defer to the Costa Rican Bankruptcy Court's judgment-which purportedly absolves Yankelewitz of his liability under the Guaranty-under principles of res judicata and comity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 56-15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n (ECF No. 65) at 14-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court rejects Yankelewitz's arguments for two reasons. First, the Costa Rican Bankruptcy Court explicitly declined to exercise jurisdiction over personal claims against Yankelewitz, thus there is no judgment regarding the Guaranty to defer to. Second, Yankelewitz executed a waiver of these defenses in the Guaranty. Accordingly, the affirmative defenses pertaining to subject matter jurisdiction and res judicata fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

In support, Yankelewitz points to the following sections of the Precautionary Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Section 3.1] Samuel Yankelewitz assigns 100% of the shares of the Debtors as assets, acting as the sole shareholder, to the trust approved by the Creditors' Committee, freeing him of all liability, being this assignment his only obligation. With the physical delivery of the shares and the acceptance by the Committee of the asset assignment, the creditors indicated in point 2.2[.]3. would deem the claims as paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [Section 3.4.3] With the acceptance by the creditors and of course with the actual entry of the shares and the books in the trust, the credits of those whose filings are approved by the insolvency proceeding will be deemed paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Section 3.4.4] It is clear and understood by the trustee creditors that the amounts they eventually receive depend\n   on the sale and sale amount of the shares of the companies or their assets without any obligation to Samuel Yankelewitz to further pay or contribute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Precautionary Agreement (ECF No. 61-7) at 18, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In a vacuum, these excerpts may suggest that Yankelewitz is discharged of any and all obligations to pay any creditor. However, in the context of the entire agreement, it is clear that these sections do not dispose of Yankelewitz's obligations under the Guaranty. First, the Precautionary Agreement, on its face, pertains to claims only against the \"debtors\" who \"established\" the \"proceeding\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Corporaci\u00f3n Yanber S.A. and Fomento Agricola Del Atlantico S.A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 6. In fact, Yankelewitz was not even a \"party\" to the Precautionary Agreement, as conceded by Yankelewitz's Costa Rican law expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Artavia Dep. Tr. (ECF No. 58-1) at 79:10-80:11, 80:20-2. Second, the Precautionary Agreement does not explicitly adjudicate-or even reference-the Guaranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guaranty (ECF No. 61-7). Third, there is no evidence that the Costa Rican Bankruptcy Court reviewed-or was even aware of-the Guaranty because no parties submitted any documentation regarding the Guaranty to the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bauer Deck (ECF No. 61-1) \u00b6 16; Artavia Dep. Tr. 53:17-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, the Costa Rican Bankruptcy Court explicitly states that that the enforcement of personal claims against Yankelewitz are reserved for separate pursuit in other courts. Specifically, the Precautionary Agreement states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    The personal collection of claims against Samuel Yankelewitz Berger is rejected since this person is not insolvent in this matter\n   </strong>\n   and it is not conducive to include him as part of an alleged economic interest group through the filing of claims.\n   <strong>\n    If such declaration is of interest, resort to the corresponding declarative courts.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Precautionary Agreement Part II \u00b6 3 (bolded emphasis added)). The provision makes clear that, to the extent the creditors have personal claims against Yankelewitz-such as LGS's claim arising out of the Guaranty-those claims may be pursued elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Garita Op'n (ECF No. 61-11) at 7 (opining that this language shows that \"the Precautionary Agreement expressly rejected and denied the inclusion of Yankelewitz ....\") This interpretation is not inconsistent with the three provisions cited by Yankelewitz, which all dealt with Yankelewitz's obligations to creditors as sole shareholder and president of Yanber-not in his role as guarantor. This interpretation thus harmonizes the carve-out provision with the three provisions cited by Yankelewitz.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PNC Bank, N.A. v. Progressive Employer Servs. II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034174\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/55/655/#p658\">\n    55 So.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658 (Fla. 4th DCA 2011) (\"[A]n interpretation which gives a reasonable meaning to all provisions of a contract is preferred to one which leaves a part useless or inexplicable.\" (citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, the Costa Rican Bankruptcy Order simply does not address Yankelewitz's personal liability-including under the Guaranty-which is the only issue before this Court. Because the Costa Rican Bankruptcy Court did not adjudicate liability under the Guaranty, there is no judgment or proceeding for this Court to defer to.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Yankelewitz Waived These Affirmative Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In executing the Guaranty, Yankelewitz consented to an extensive set of waiver provisions. In relevant part, the Guaranty provides that the \"Guarantor hereby waives ... any defense based on any event or circumstances described in Section 1(b).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guaranty (ECF No. 61-5) \u00a7 3. Section 1(b) states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations\n   <strong>\n    will be paid strictly in accordance\n   </strong>\n   with the terms of the Sales Agreement, or as applicable, the Local Agreement\n   <strong>\n    regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n   affecting any such terms or the rights of the Guaranteed Party with respect thereto. The obligations of Guarantor under this guaranty shall be\n   <strong>\n    primary obligations\n   </strong>\n   , and the liability of Guarantor under this\n   <strong>\n    Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:\n   </strong>\n   .... (iii)\n   <strong>\n    any present or future action of any governmental authority\n   </strong>\n   amending, varying reducing, or otherwise affecting,\n   <strong>\n    or purporting to amend, vary, reduce or otherwise affect, any of the Guaranteed Obligations or this Guaranty;\n   </strong>\n   ... (vi)\n   <strong>\n    any release or discharge by operation of law\n   </strong>\n   of the Contract Party, Guarantor or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations from any obligation or agreement contained in the Sales Agreement or in the Local Agreement....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Guaranty (ECF No. 61-5) \u00a7 (1)(b). The Guaranty further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The Guarantor further acknowledges and agrees that the\n   <strong>\n    Guaranteed Obligations will survive any bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n   , merger, or dissolution of\n   <strong>\n    any of the Contract Part[ies]\n   </strong>\n   , including without limitation: (i) the commencement of any proceeding for voluntary bankruptcy by the Contract Party; (ii) any assignment for the benefits of creditors by the Contract Party;\n   <strong>\n    (iii) the entry of a decree or order for relief\n   </strong>\n   by a court having jurisdiction in the premises in respect of the Contract Party in an involuntary case under any applicable law; or (iv) the dissolution or winding down of any of the Contract Party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Guaranty \u00a7 (1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Based on these waiver provisions, the Court finds that Yankelewitz waived his right to assert abstention or res judicata affirmative defenses because such defenses are impermissibly based on a bankruptcy proceeding (in violation of section 1(c) of the Guaranty) and on a court order (in violation of section 1(b) of the Guaranty).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court also rejects Yankelewitz's argument that \"[i]f Yanber's debts have been paid in full, Yankelewitz's guaranty is discharged,\" Def.'s Mot. 16-17, for the same reasons. Even if Article 943 of the Costa Rican Commercial Code typically has the effect of releasing a guarantor when the debt underlying the guaranty is discharged, Yankelewitz waived his right to assert a defense based on \"any release or discharge by operation of law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guaranty \u00a7 1(b)(vi). Moreover, the Guaranty preserves Yankelewitz's liability under the Guaranty despite \"any present or future action of any governmental authority\n   amending, varying, reducing or otherwise affecting ... any of the Guaranteed Obligations or this Guaranty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034174\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/55/655/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(b)(iii). Finally, the Guaranty explicitly states that it will \"survive any bankruptcy\" including an \"order for relief\" of any \"Contract Party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guaranty \u00a7 (1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In Florida, \"a contract must be applied as written, absent an ambiguity or some illegality.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.

Yankelewitz argues that by signing the Precautionary Agreement, LGS provided \"written consent\" to depart from the Guaranty. However, as discussed above, the Precautionary Agreement does not address Yankelewitz's liability under the Guaranty. Therefore, the Precautionary Agreement does not contain an intentional relinquishment of LGS's right to enforce the Guaranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DK Arena, Inc. v.
