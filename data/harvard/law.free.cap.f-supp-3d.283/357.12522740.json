Plaintiffs' Concise Statement of Material Facts (Doc. 74) \u00b6 1; Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Concise Statement of Material Facts (Doc. 82) \u00b6 1. The Ordinance became effective on December 30, 2005. Doc. 74 \u00b6 1; Doc. 82 \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In relevant part, the challenged Ordinance provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00a7 623.04 FIFTEEN-FOOT BUFFER ZONE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   No person or persons shall knowingly congregate, patrol, picket, or demonstrate in a zone extending 15 feet from any entrance to the hospital and or health care facility. This section shall not apply to police and public safety officers, fire and rescue personnel, or other emergency workers in the course of their official business, or to authorized security personnel employees or agents of the hospital, medical office or clinic engaged in assisting patients and other persons to enter or exit the hospital, medical office, or clinic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Doc. 74 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 140; Doc. 82 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 140. The Ordinance exempts \"authorized security personnel employees or agents of the hospital, medical office or clinic engaged in assisting patients and other persons to enter or exit the hospital, medical office, or clinic\" from the entirety of Section 623.04. Doc. 74 \u00b6 141; Doc. 82 \u00b6 141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In adopting the Ordinance, the City Council also ratified a preamble, titled \"Intent of Council,\" that described the goals the City sought to accomplish as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The City Council recognizes that access to Health Care Facilities for the purpose of obtaining medical counseling and treatment is important for residents and visitors to the City. The exercise of a person's right to protest or counsel against certain medical procedures is a First Amendment activity that must be balanced against another person's right to obtain medical counseling and treatment in an unobstructed manner; and The City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has been consistently called upon in at least two locations within the City to mediate the disputes between those seeking medical counseling and treatment and those who would counsel against their actions so as to (i) avoid violent confrontations which would lead to criminal charges and (ii) enforce existing City Ordinances which regulate use of public sidewalks and other conduct; Such services require a dedicated and indefinite appropriation of policing services, which is being provided to the neglect of the law enforcement needs of the Zones in which these facilities exist. The City seeks a more efficient and wider deployment of its services which will help also reduce the risk of violence and provide unobstructed access to health care facilities by setting clear guidelines for activity in the immediate vicinity of the entrances to health care facilities; The Council finds that the limited buffer and bubble zones outside health care facilities established by this chapter will ensure that patients have unimpeded access to medical services while ensuring that the First Amendment rights of demonstrators to communicate their message to their intended audience is not impaired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Doc. 74 \u00b6 7; Doc. 82 \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A permanent injunction altered the Ordinance in 2009, requiring,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the City clearly demarcate any buffer zone prior to its enforcement. Order Granting Permanent Injunction (the \"Injunction\"), Civil Action No. 06-393, Doc. 85, \u00b6 1 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 17, 2009). Presently, two \"buffer zones\" are delineated and enforced in the City of Pittsburgh, both of which are located outside of reproductive health care facilities where abortions are performed. Doc. 74 \u00b6 149; Doc. 82 \u00b6 149. One of the two buffer zones is indicated by a bright, yellow semi-circle painted around the entrance of 933 Liberty Avenue, the downtown Planned Parenthood clinic (\"933 Liberty\" or \"downtown Planned Parenthood\"). Doc. 74 \u00b6\u00b6 111, 122; Doc. 82 \u00b6\u00b6 111, 122. The inside of the yellow arc measures 15 feet in radius from the center of the closed\n   front doors of the Planned Parenthood facility. Doc. 74 \u00b6 123; Doc. 82 \u00b6 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to the City, the Ordinance \"applies to any type of protesting within the buffer zone.\" Doc. 74 \u00b6 155; Doc. 82 \u00b6 155. However, \"purely social or random conversations (like going up to someone to ask directions or what time it is) are not intended to be covered by the Ordinance.\" Doc. 74 \u00b6 156; Doc. 82 \u00b6 156. When Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, they believed that the Ordinance completely prohibited their passage through the buffer zone, even if they were not engaging in sidewalk advocacy during such passage. Defendants' Concise Statement of Material Facts (Doc. 71) \u00b6 86; Plaintiffs' Response to Defendants' Concise Statement of Material Facts (Doc. 79) \u00b6 86. However, since then, the City has explained to Plaintiffs that the buffer zone does not apply to \"individuals who are simply walking through the 15 foot zone to get to from one location to another, provided that such passage does not obstruct access to the facility.\" Doc. 74 \u00b6 87; Doc. 82 \u00b6 87; Doc. 74 \u00b6 154; Doc. 82 \u00b6 154. For purposes of this lawsuit, there appears to be no dispute that \"sidewalk counseling\" within the 15 foot buffer zone is prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    History of the Ordinance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Prior to moving to 933 Liberty Avenue, Planned Parenthood maintained its downtown location on Fifth Avenue. Doc. 74 \u00b6 112; Doc. 82 \u00b6 112. In the mid- and late-1990's, there were numerous incidents involving violence, disruption and obstruction of entrances at the Fifth Avenue location. Doc. 71 \u00b6 1; Doc. 79 \u00b6 1. As a result, in the mid-90's, Pittsburgh police deployed crowd-control barriers outside abortion clinics in order to maintain order and security, separating demonstrators from each other and from patients attempting to visit the clinic for health care. Doc. 71 \u00b6 4; Doc. 79 \u00b6 4. After Planned Parenthood moved to the 933 Liberty Avenue location in 2002, the incidents became less frequent and severe; however, there still were regular incidents involving \"pushing,\" \"shoving\" and \"verbal harassment\" at the downtown Planned Parenthood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. App., Ex. J, Hohos Dep. (Doc. 72-10) at 31:23-32:12 (\"New location was, like I said, not as severe, but we still had our incidents. We still had the pushing and the shoving between the escorts and the pro-life folks and, you know, the blocking of the doors, that was still occurring when people would sit in front of doors. Not on a much regular basis as before, but that-that conduct still continued to a large-to a large degree. A lot of it was verbal. Depending on which side the argument you were on or the cause, a lot of it was verbal harassment between both parties, both sides.\");\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 42:2-5 (Sergeant William Hohos explaining that he has personally witnessed \"pro-life individuals forcing literature into patients' pockets\");\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 52:13-15 (\"We were still very active between the years of 2002 to 2005. 'We' being the police.\"). To mitigate these incidents, the Bureau of Police employed an overtime detail of police officers stationed outside the downtown Planned Parenthood. Doc. 71 \u00b6 6; Doc. 79 \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 29, 2003, the City of Pittsburgh was declared a financially distressed municipality by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Department of Community and Economic Development. Doc. 71 \u00b6 14; Doc. 79 \u00b6 14. Following the determination of the City's distressed status, the Bureau of Police discontinued the overtime detail of police officers assigned to the downtown Planned Parenthood, although police would still respond to 911 or other specific calls for law enforcement. Doc. 71 \u00b6 19; Doc. 79 \u00b6 19. Thereafter, on November 29, 2005, the Ordinance was introduced before the City Council. Doc. 74 \u00b6 126; Doc. 82 \u00b6 126. A committee meeting was held on December 7, 2005, followed by hearing for public comment on December 13, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Doc. 74 \u00b6\u00b6 126-128; Doc. 82 \u00b6\u00b6 126-128; Doc. 71 \u00b6 23; Doc. 79 \u00b6 23. At those proceedings, dozens of witnesses offered statements to the City Council, including President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania, Kimberly Evert. Doc. 71 \u00b6 24; Doc. 79 \u00b6 24. Ms. Evert testified that, in January 2005, the City's budget problems \"resulted in the elimination of the police assignment\" to the downtown Planned Parenthood. Doc. 72-3, Exhibit C, at p. 8. Ms. Evert testified that \"without [police] supervision there has been an increase in unlawful behavior that is putting ... patients, their families, pedestrians and even protestors at risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As evidence, Ms. Evert stated that, in 2004, patients made 16 complaints about protestors, whereas from February 2005 to November 2005, \"there were 13 cases of aggressive pushing, shoving and hitting, and 30 complaints of harassing behavior that included shoving literature into people's pockets, hitting them with signs and blocking their entrance into the building.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Commander Donaldson of the Pittsburgh Police Department also addressed the City Council on December 7, 2005. Doc. 74 \u00b6 133; Doc. 82 \u00b6 133. Commander Donaldson stated that, while the City did not arrest any protestors outside 933 Liberty Avenue within the six months prior to the committee meeting, police had been summoned to that location 22 times in that 6-month period. Doc. 74 \u00b6 135; Doc. 82 \u00b6 135; Doc. 72-3, Exhibit C, at pp. 52-54. Commander Donaldson explained that \"[t]ypically, [the police] are called to mediate confrontations between the people going into the clinic and the protestors or the escorts ... and other times it was the doorway was obstructed or they followed the people to the doorway or ... the signs are obstructing the front of the building ...\" Doc. 72-3, Exhibit C, at p. 60. In response to questioning by a Council member, Commander Donaldson acknowledged that, prior to the enactment of the Ordinance, the City already had laws on the books that it could rely upon to arrest and prosecute individuals obstructing traffic, passageways, and doorways. Doc. 74 \u00b6 134; Doc. 82 \u00b6 134. Commander Donaldson explained, however, that those laws were not as effective as a buffer zone in deterring those who attempted to \"block\" patients from entering the downtown Planned Parenthood by obstructing their passage before they reached the front door of the building. Doc. 72-3, Exhibit C, at p. 54 (\"What I am saying is there are laws currently on the book that would address obstructing traffic or passageways or highway. A number of times what the complaints are at the 933 Liberty Avenue is that they are obstructing the access to the clinic itself. Now there are currently laws for obstructing the doorway, but what this would do is it would set a 15-foot parameter [sic]. So it would be clearly defined. It wouldn't be in front of the obstructing the door per say [sic], but you couldn't be within 15 feet of it. I think it would be along the same lines of either obstructing someone's driveway or blocking someone's driveway. They are two clearly different points. One it makes it difficult to get into your driveway. The other one it makes it impossible to get into your driveway.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following these hearings, the City Council passed the Ordinance and the Mayor signed it into law. Doc. 71 \u00b6 26; Doc. 79 \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' \"Sidewalk Counseling\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs regularly engage in anti-abortion activities outside the buffer zone at the downtown Planned Parenthood. Doc. 71 \u00b6 44; Doc. 79 \u00b6 44. Their advocacy takes the form of \"sidewalk counseling,\" through which they \"seek to have quiet conversations and offer assistance and information about options available ... other than abortion to people who are about to enter\n   or who exit the facility.\" Doc. 71 \u00b6 46; Doc. 79 \u00b6 46. Plaintiff Nikki Bruni is the local head of a group participating in the \"Forty Days for Life\" movement, a global anti-abortion campaign whose self-described mission is \"to bring together the body of Christ in a spirit of unity during a focused 40[-]day campaign of prayer, fasting, and peaceful activism, with the purpose of repentance, to seek God's favor to turn hearts and minds from a culture of death to a culture of life, thus bringing an end to abortion.\" Doc. 71 \u00b6 45; Doc. 79 \u00b6 45. Ms. Bruni began sidewalk counseling in early 2010. Doc. 74 \u00b6 25; Doc. 82 \u00b6 25. Plaintiff Julie Cosentino began sidewalk counseling outside the downtown Planned Parenthood in July 2014, generally going to the clinic on Saturdays. Doc. 71 \u00b6 49; Doc. 79 \u00b6 49. Plaintiff Cynthia Rinaldi began sidewalk counseling outside the downtown Planned Parenthood approximately 5 to 6 years ago. Doc. 74 \u00b6 56; Doc. 82 \u00b6 56. Plaintiff Kathleen Laslow began sidewalk counseling outside the downtown Planned Parenthood approximately three years ago. Doc. 74 \u00b6 73; Doc. 82 \u00b6 73. Patrick Malley began sidewalk counseling in 2010 or 2011, and typically goes to the downtown Planned Parenthood facility on Tuesdays and Fridays. Doc. 74 \u00b6\u00b6 91, 93; Doc. 82 \u00b6\u00b6 91, 93. None of the Plaintiffs in this case has experience or knowledge about conditions outside the downtown Planned Parenthood before the passage of the Ordinance in 2005 or the modified Ordinance in 2009. Doc. 71 \u00b6 11; Doc. 79 \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Abortions are performed at the downtown Planned Parenthood on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Doc. 71 \u00b6 52; Doc. 79 \u00b6 52. On those days, between two to four individuals engage in some form of sidewalk counseling or demonstrating outside of the buffer zone. Doc. 71 \u00b6\u00b6 54-55; Doc. 79 \u00b6\u00b6 54-55. During Forty Days for Life and other nationally organized clinic protest campaigns, this number may increase to as many as 35 to 40. Doc. 71 \u00b6 56; Doc. 79 \u00b6 56. Plaintiffs admit that, outside the 15-foot buffer zone, Plaintiffs and their allies are free to walk anywhere on the sidewalk and engage in advocacy, attempting to speak to people who are going to the clinic. Doc. 71 \u00b6 68; Doc. 79 \u00b6 68. The Ordinance also does not prohibit a willing listener from: (1) slowing down or stopping while approaching the buffer zone in order to listen or talk to Plaintiffs, Doc. 71 \u00b6 69; Doc. 79 \u00b6 69; (2) exiting the zone in order to listen or talk to Plaintiffs, Doc. 71 \u00b6 70; Doc. 79 \u00b6 70; or (3) standing inside the buffer zone and having a conversation with Plaintiffs standing a few inches or feet away, outside the zone, Doc. 71 \u00b6 71; Doc. 79 \u00b6 71. Plaintiffs also admit that the Ordinance does not prohibit them from: (1) attempting to engage a person leaving the clinic in a discussion, as that person walks down the sidewalk, Doc. 71 \u00b6 72; Doc. 79 \u00b6 72; (2) beginning a conversation with a person and continuing that conversation outside the buffer zone for as long as they want, Doc. 71 \u00b6 73; Doc. 79 \u00b6 73; or (3) walking with a willing listener to a calmer or quieter location, anywhere outside the buffer zone, to talk further. Doc. 71 \u00b6 74; Doc. 79 \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Several of the Plaintiffs testified or declared that they have had trouble communicating with people outside the downtown Planned Parenthood because of street or traffic noise. Doc. 71 \u00b6\u00b6 89, 90; Doc. 79 \u00b6\u00b6 89, 90. Plaintiff Cosentino testified, however, she has never had trouble communicating with or trying to get a message to people because of street noise or traffic noise. Doc. 71 \u00b6 90; Doc. 79 \u00b6 90. Plaintiffs also cite no specific instances where someone has told any of Plaintiffs that they were unable to hear Plaintiffs' message because of traffic noise or the distance due to the buffer zone. Doc. 71 \u00b6 91; Doc. 79 \u00b6 91. Furthermore, at the preliminary injunction hearing in December 2014, Plaintiff Bruni admitted she had no evidence that the buffer zone impeded her from\n   talking with willing listeners. Doc. 71 \u00b6 58; Doc. 79 \u00b6 58 (citing Hr'g Tr. 32 (\"THE COURT: ... What evidence do you have that people who desire to engage in close conversation with you are not doing so because of the buffer zone? THE WITNESS: I don't have any.\")). Plaintiff Bruni also testified that, between 2009 and the date the Complaint was filed, she has been able to communicate her message to the intended recipients \"occasionally.\" Doc. 71 \u00b6 59; Doc. 79 \u00b6 59. She testified that, rarely, women inside the buffer zone will come out of the zone to have a conversation with her. Doc. 71 \u00b6 60; Doc. 79 \u00b6 60. She admits that sometimes women going to the clinic refuse to talk to her, no matter what her distance from them. Doc. 71 \u00b6 61; Doc. 79 \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Since approximately 2011, Plaintiff Bruni has been keeping a log of instances where people approaching the Planned Parenthood clinic have reportedly been persuaded not to have abortions. Doc. 71 \u00b6 62; Doc. 79 \u00b6 62. The log is titled \"Log of Saved Babies from abortion at Planned Parenthood, 933 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh.\" Doc. 71 \u00b6 62; Doc. 79 \u00b6 62. This log records dozens of instances of sidewalk counselors not only communicating their message to others but reportedly persuading people to not have abortions. Doc. 71 \u00b6 63; Doc. 79 \u00b6 63. Plaintiff Bruni has also \"taken a few women to the Crisis Pregnancy Center\" after encountering them at the Planned Parenthood clinic. Doc. 71 \u00b6 67; Doc. 79 \u00b6 67. Likewise, Plaintiff Rinaldi has \"often\" accompanied women \"to nearby Catholic Charities, in order to connect them to resources such as adoption assistance, monetary assistance, food, education, and day care.\" Doc. 71 \u00b6\u00b6 51, 65; Doc. 79 \u00b6\u00b6 51, 65; Doc. 74 \u00b6 58; Doc. 82 \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   By way of background and procedural history, at the time the Pittsburgh City Council enacted the Ordinance, it contained the following two provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00a7 623.03-EIGHT FOOT PERSONAL BUBBLE ZONE.

The\n   <em>\n    McCullen\n   </em>\n   Court noted that, at certain locations, the MRHCA forced sidewalk counselors to cross the street from the abortion clinics where they sought to counsel-silencing their conversational speech and foreclosing their ability to place leaflets close to patients' hands.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581709\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2518/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2527-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs sidewalk counsel immediately outside the boundary of the buffer zone-they are not pushed to the other side of the street. Doc. 71 \u00b6 68; Doc. 79 \u00b6 68. Nonetheless, several Plaintiffs state that the buffer zone \"exacerbates the difficulty of engaging in close, one-on-one conversations outside the Planned Parenthood facility due to 'loud' street noise along Liberty Avenue,\" and that they must \"raise their voice or even shout to be heard by people 15 feet or more away.\" Doc. 74 at \u00b6\u00b6 96, 165-166. However, Plaintiff Cosentino testified at her deposition she has never had trouble communicating or trying to get a message to people because of street noise or traffic noise. Doc. 71 \u00b6 90; Doc. 79 \u00b6 90. Furthermore, at the preliminary injunction hearing in December 2014, Plaintiff Bruni admitted she had no evidence that the buffer zone impeded her from talking with willing listeners. Doc. 71 \u00b6 58; Doc. 79 \u00b6 58 (citing Hr'g Tr. 32 (\"THE COURT: ... What evidence do you have that people who desire to engage in close conversation with you are not doing so because of the buffer zone? THE WITNESS: I don't have any.\")). Plaintiffs also cite no specific instances where someone has told any of Plaintiffs that they were unable to hear Plaintiffs' message because of traffic noise or the distance due to the buffer zone. Doc. 71 \u00b6 91; Doc. 79 \u00b6 91. Plaintiffs further admit that, rather than yell at a potential patient arriving from the other side of the buffer zone, they can walk through the buffer zone in an attempt to reach that person on the other side. Doc. 71 \u00b6 87; Doc. 79 \u00b6 87. Thus, even crediting Plaintiffs' testimony, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that their ability to engage in one-on-one conversations with patients is substantially burdened by the presence of the buffer zone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs' own records reflect not only that they are able to communicate with patients, but, in some instances, have accomplished their intended goal of persuading women not to have abortions. Doc. 71 \u00b6\u00b6 62-67; Doc. 79 \u00b6\u00b6 62-67. Plaintiffs\n   speculate that they would be able to communicate with more women, and perhaps persuade more of them not to have abortions, if they could walk alongside patients all the way to and from the entrance of the clinic. But Plaintiffs offer no concrete evidence to support this claim. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    McCullen\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiffs engaged in sidewalk counseling both before and after the MRHCA went into effect and stated that the number of people they reached sharply declined after the larger buffer zones were imposed, Plaintiffs admit that they did not engage in sidewalk counseling at the downtown Planned Parenthood before the Ordinance was passed and thus have no basis to compare the efficacy of their speech with and without a buffer zone. Doc. 71 \u00b6 11; Doc. 79 \u00b6 11. Plaintiffs further admit that they have no power or right to force unwilling listeners to engage in conversation with them. Thus, the fact that many people entering and exiting the clinic do not wish to speak to Plaintiffs or take literature from them is not evidence that the Ordinance substantially limits Plaintiffs' speech but rather, more likely, that these individuals simply do not wish to engage with Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , 530 U.S. at 718,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414210\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/703/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[N]o one has a right to press even 'good' ideas on an unwilling recipient.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rowan v.

As Judge Fuentes explains in his Concurrence: \"The adverb supplies the test: the operative question, in this case and others, is whether the proposed alternatives would burden\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     substantially\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   less speech while still furthering the government's interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruni\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322827\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/353/#p357\">\n    824 F.3d at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Here, given the Court's finding that the Ordinance's restriction on speech is minimal, the Court finds that the alternatives considered in\n   <em>\n    McCullen\n   </em>\n   are not, in fact,\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   less-restrictive. Accordingly, the City has no obligation to demonstrate that it tried-or considered and rejected-any such alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   However, even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the City had such an obligation, the Court finds that it has met its burden.

As discussed, during the City Council meeting on December 7, 2005, the President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania, Kimberly Evert, testified that the number of complaints went up considerably after the City stopped stationing police at the downtown Planned Parenthood, explaining that between February 2005 to November 2005, \"there were 13 cases of aggressive pushing, shoving and hitting, and 30 complaints of harassing behavior that included shoving literature into people's pockets, hitting them with signs and blocking their entrance into the building.\" Doc. 72-3, Exhibit C, at p. 8. Moreover, Commander Donaldson of the Pittsburgh Police Department testified that, while the City did not arrest any protestors outside 933 Liberty Avenue within the six months prior to the committee meeting, police had been summoned to that location 22 times in that 6-month period. Doc. 74 \u00b6 135; Doc. 82 \u00b6 135; Doc. 72-3, Exhibit C, at Pages 52-53.

Here, the legislative record clearly shows that the City tried, and considered and rejected, at least two alternative measures prior to enacting the Ordinance. First, the City Council considered Ms. Evert's testimony that the City had previously stationed police at the downtown Planned Parenthood, but that this practice had become too expensive in light of the City's budget problems. Doc. 72-3, Exhibit C, at p. 8. Second, Commander Donaldson testified that the enforcement of the City's anti-obstruction laws would not be as effective as a buffer zone in deterring those who attempted to \"block\" patients from entering the clinic by obstructing their passage before they reached the front door of the building. Doc. 72-3, Exhibit C, at p. 54. After hearing testimony about these two alternative measures (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   maintaining an overtime police presence, and enforcing existing anti-obstruction statutes), the City Council voted to adopt the Ordinance. In doing so, the City Council implicitly rejected the alternatives discussed, presumably for the reasons stated on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the City should have considered any number of other alternatives prior to adopting the Ordinance, including targeted injunctions and/or the enforcement of anti-harassment statutes.

In\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court rejected the plaintiffs' overbreadth challenge to a Colorado statute that created floating buffer zones at the entrances to health care facilities, finding \"the comprehensiveness of the statute [to be] a virtue, not a vice, because it is evidence against there being a discriminatory governmental motive.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , 530 U.S. at 731,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414210\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/703/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   Court relied on that holding in finding that, to the extent that Brown brought a facial overbreadth challenge, \"her attack is foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3485983\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/263/\">\n    586 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   282 n. 21. As this Court previously explained, the\n   <em>\n    McCullen\n   </em>\n   Court did not conduct an overbreadth analysis, and thus\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   's application of the overbreadth doctrine remains good law. Nevertheless, in\n   <em>\n    Bruni\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals found that it was premature to dismiss an overbreadth claim \"absent a well-supported conclusion regarding the proper scope of the Ordinance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322827\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/353/#p357\">\n    824 F.3d at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Following discovery, there remains no dispute as to the scope of the Ordinance as modified by this Court's permanent injunction. As the City argues, the Injunction requires a clear demarcation of any buffer zones, and the City has demarcated only two such buffer zones, both located at the entrances of reproductive healthcare facilities. Doc. 74 \u00b6 149; Doc. 82 \u00b6 149. Plaintiffs cite no evidence that the City has enforced or attempted to enforce the Ordinance at any other locations. Indeed, in their lawsuit, Plaintiffs focus almost exclusively on a single buffer zone located at the downtown Planned Parenthood. Thus, the Court finds no evidence that, as limited by the Injunction, the current Ordinance raises any overbreath issue, and will grant summary judgment to Defendants on this claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As the Court of Appeals held in\n    <em>\n     Bruni\n    </em>\n    , \"Plaintiffs' free press claim is, in this context, properly considered a subset of their broader free speech claim, given that the Freedom of the Press Clause and the Free Speech Clause both protect leafleting from government interference.\"\n    <em>\n     Bruni\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322827\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/353/#p357\">\n     824 F.3d at 373\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Plaintiffs further contend that, when relegated to any distance away from the entrance to the downtown Planned Parenthood, it becomes more difficult for them to identity who is a patient and who is not. Doc. 74 at \u00b6 161. However, as the Court previously found, this is not a burden on their right to free speech. If anything, Plaintiffs engage in more speech, not less, in an effort to disseminate their message to all potential patients. A right to engage in normal conversation and leaflet on a public sidewalk does not equate to a right to know if those with whom you communicate are, indeed, your target audience.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    For instance, Plaintiff Bruni testified that, on some occasions, people inside the buffer zone who observe sidewalk counselors offering them literature reach out their hands to receive such literature, expecting the sidewalk counselors to come to them.
