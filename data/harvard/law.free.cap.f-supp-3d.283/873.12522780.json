Having considered the parties' submissions, the court adopts the following Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Jerald Friedman (\"Friedman\") brings this putative class action against defendants AARP, Inc., AARP Services Inc., AARP Insurance Plan, UnitedHealth Group, Inc., and United Healthcare Insurance Company (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 22-30.) The court has already set forth the basic facts of the case in its prior Order, (Dkt. No. 50), which it repeats here in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2011, Friedman purchased a type of health insurance policy, known as a \"Medigap\" policy, which is designed to offer extra coverage to Medicare beneficiaries beyond the basic Medicare benefits, including coverage of copays and deductibles that would otherwise be the patient's responsibility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Friedman purchased a Medigap policy that was endorsed by AARP, with UnitedHealth as the insurer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 37.) All UnitedHealth Medigap policies are endorsed by AARP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) For every AARP/UnitedHealth Medigap policy sold, AARP receives a payment of 4.95% of the amount paid by the insured individual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On behalf of a putative class, Friedman alleges that AARP improperly acts as an unlicensed insurance agent in actively soliciting insurance purchases for Medigap policies on behalf of UnitedHealth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 52, 55-57, 71-75.) AARP is not a licensed insurance agent in California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Friedman alleges, however, that the 4.95% payment that AARP receives on every AARP/UnitedHealth Medigap policy is an unlawful insurance commission, paid to AARP for its role in \"selling\" the Medigap policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Though Defendants' agreements cast this payment as a royalty, paid in exchange for UnitedHealth's use of AARP's intellectual property in marketing and selling its Medigap coverage, Friedman alleges that this characterization of the 4.95% payment is false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Friedman alleges that \"while Defendants disclose the existence of a payment in general to AARP which they term a 'royalty' paid for the use of AARP's intellectual property, Defendants hide the fact that the cost of AARP Medigap insurance includes a percentage-based commission to AARP that is funded by consumers, in addition to the insurance premium paid to UnitedHealth for coverage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result, Friedman contends that he paid more for his Medigap policy than he would have paid if he had known that 4.95% went to an illegal commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15, 19, 22.) Friedman further alleges that other insurance companies offer comparable plans at lower cost because the premiums for those plans do not include an unlawful 4.95% commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) He contends that this arrangement violates various provisions of the California Insurance Code, and therefore that he has a basis to bring a Unfair Competition Law claim under California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the basis of these allegations, Friedman filed a putative class action, asserting claims under the UCL as well as for money had and received and conversion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.) Subsequently, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). (Dkt. 27.) This court granted the Motion, and dismissed the Complaint with prejudice. (Dkt. 50.) Friedman appealed the dismissal to the Ninth Circuit. (Dkt. 51.) The Ninth Circuit reversed the court's order dismissing the Complaint, and remanded the case to this court so that it could address Defendants' remaining arguments in its Motion to Dismiss regarding the application of the filed-rate doctrine to Friedman's claims.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The threshold issue before the court on remand is whether Friedman's claims are barred by a California filed-rate doctrine. Under this doctrine, \"rates duly adopted by a regulatory agency are not subject to collateral attack in court.\"\n   <em>\n    MacKay v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053313\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/188/1427/\">\n    188 Cal.App.4th 1427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20893\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (2010). The parties dispute whether a filed-rate doctrine exists under California law and, if so, the whether it applies to bar Friedman's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether Friedman's Claims Are Barred by a State Filed-Rate Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As the court noted in its previous order, \"there is currently a split of authority on the issue of whether there exists a general state filed rate doctrine in California.\" (Dkt. 50 at 4 n.2). Defendants argue that a state filed-rate doctrine bars Friedman's claims because he challenges insurance rates approved by a state agency, the California Department of Insurance (DOI). Defendants' key authority in support of a filed-rate doctrine for state insurance rates comes from\n   <em>\n    MacKay v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053313\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/188/1427/\">\n    188 Cal.App.4th 1427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20893\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ct. App. 2010). In\n   <em>\n    MacKay\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that the insurer had not properly considered certain factors in rate-setting, although the rating factors had been duly approved by DOI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1436-37,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20893\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that such a challenge was barred by Section 1860.1 of the California Insurance Code, a provision that is not at issue here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1432-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20893\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1860.1 functions, in essence, as a statutory analog to the filed-rate doctrine, preventing collateral challenges to DOI-approved rates in the courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201860.1\">\n    Cal.

The court observed that \"numerous state courts have applied the filed-rate doctrine to approved insurance rates,\" and indicated that a state filed-rate doctrine could apply to rates approved by DOI.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20893\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also carefully delimited the scope of this prohibition to exclude those cases where \"the underlying conduct challenged was not the charging of an approved rate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1449-50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20893\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that a state filed-rate doctrine exists in the insurance context, it does not bar Friedman's claims because these claims are more akin to challenges to Defendants' alleged misrepresentations, rather than challenges to the approved rate, or challenges to whether the rate is reasonable in light of the statutorily prescribed loss ratios for Medigap insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint alleges that \"Defendants' misrepresentations and omissions regarding AARP Medigap constitute an unfair, deceptive, and misleading practice\" under the UCL. (Compl. \u00b6 69). Had Defendants disclosed the fact that the \"member contribution amount\" included an embedded commission payment to the AARP, Friedman claims that he would have sought out another Medigap policy offering the same services for a lower rate. (Compl. \u00b6 19). As the court held in\n   <em>\n    Canon v. Wells Fargo\n   </em>\n   , \"the gravamen of the complaint is not the premium rate per se, but\n   the failure to disclose the allegedly fraudulent nature of the commission charged to borrowers.\" No. C-12-1376 EMC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20324556\">\n    2014 WL 324556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2014). In other words, the DOI's rate \"determination is different from what is at issue here-whether the lender committed fraud on the borrower by mischaracterizing the nature of the charges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. For this reason, the court concludes that addressing Friedman's claims would not usurp the authority of the DOI to determine the reasonableness of filed rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants counter that the DOI was aware of the alleged commission payments to the AARP as part of its review of the Medigap rates. (Defs.' Supp. Br. at 12). Even if that were so, it does not mean that DOI ratified the existence or amount of the AARP payments. Pursuant to state regulations, DOI approves the overall Medigap rate in accordance with statutorily prescribed loss ratios.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ss(r) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010192.14\">\n    Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 10192.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). Defendants acknowledge that \"[a]side from requiring [that] benefit payments constitute at least 75% of premium revenue, the state and federal Medigap policies do not dictate how insurers may spend the remaining premium revenue.\" (Defs.' Supp. Br. at 13). As the California Insurance Commissioner has observed, \"[c]ommissions have traditionally been recognized as an appropriate component of insurance ratemaking, so long as the overall rate does not exceed the maximum or minimum permitted earned premium under the regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Cannon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20324556\">\n    2014 WL 324556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Thus, the challenged commission payments appear to fall outside of the scope of the DOI's regulatory approval of rates. To the extent that a filed-rate doctrine exists in California, the court concludes that such a doctrine would not apply to the challenged conduct in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nor would a similar doctrine, the primary jurisdiction doctrine, serve to bar Friedman's claims. Primary jurisdiction arises when \"enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body.\"\n   <em>\n    Farmers Ins.

Whether Friedman Has Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition to the filed-rate issue, Defendants raise several corollary issues tied to Friedman's standing to bring the present action. Under the UCL, a plaintiff must have \"suffered injury in fact and ... lost money or property\" as a result of the alleged violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kwikset Corp. v. Sup.

Defendants argue that Friedman suffered no economic harm because he paid the DOI-approved rate as his \"member contribution amount.\" (Defs.' Supp. Br. at 13). Because Defendants must charge the DOI-approved rate, they claim that Friedman could not have paid less for their services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Yet Friedman's theory of economic injury is not limited to the rate charged for\n   Defendants' services. According to the Complaint, \"similar Medigap policies offered without the 'AARP brand' offer identical benefits often at a lower cost in part because those insurers do not secretly charge unlawful insurance agent commissions to consumers.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 77). Put differently, \"Medigap policies across carriers contain identical terms set by the federal government, [so] the only real differentiating factor between Medigap policies with different carriers is the price.\" (Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 23, Dkt. 38). Friedman reasons that, had the fee to AARP been disclosed, he would have sought out another Medigap policy offering the same benefits for a lower cost.

Friedman's standing to seek relief \"must be shown with respect to each form of relief south,\" including injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    Bates v.

Because Friedman no longer holds a Medigap policy with Defendants, there is no likelihood of future harm resulting from Defendants' challenged practices in this case. Accordingly, the court concludes that Friedman lacks standing to seek injunctive relief, and dismisses his request for injunctive relief with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Additional Challenges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants raise two additional challenges in their Motion to Dismiss. First, Defendants challenge whether Friedman's request for disgorgement is permitted under the UCL. The UCL generally limits relief to injunctions and restitution.\n   <em>\n    Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"777211\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/29/1134/#p1144\">\n    29 Cal.4th 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1144,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2029\">\n    131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20P.3d%20937\">\n    63 P.3d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). Thus, disgorgement \"is an available remedy... only to the extent that it constitutes restitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1145,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2029\">\n    131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20P.3d%20937\">\n    63 P.3d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Korea Supply\n   </em>\n   , the California Supreme Court held that the UCL did not allow for disgorgement when \"the money sought to be disgorged was not taken from plaintiff and plaintiff did not have an ownership interest in the money.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1144,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2029\">\n    131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20P.3d%20937\">\n    63 P.3d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Complaint requests \"disgorgement of all sums taken ... by means of deceptive practices, together with all proceeds, interest, income, profits and accessions thereto.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 115, 116.C). The Complaint also contains a separate request for restitution of \"all money or other property\n   taken from identifiable persons by means of unlawful acts or practices.\" (Compl. \u00b6 116.B). Because Friedman's request for disgorgement is not limited to the restitution of amounts paid to Defendants, the court dismisses Friedman's additional request for disgorgement with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the Complaint does not adequately differentiate between the actions of Defendant United Health Group (\"UHG\") and its \"operating division and corporate subsidiary\" Defendant United Healthcare Insurance Company (\"UHC\"). At this juncture in the litigation, the court finds that Friedman has set forth a basis for the inclusion of the parent company UHG, and that the Complaint's allegations adequately provide UHG with notice of the claims brought against it. Therefore, the court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss UHG as a defendant in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part.
