Bury, United States District Judge\n   The Court grants in part and denies in part the Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court finds the McKittrick policy is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with law in violation of the APA. Therefore, the Court grants summary judgment for Plaintiffs under the APA. The Court finds that solely for the purpose of Section 7 of the ESA the Mexican gray wolf is treated as a species proposed to be listed, not as a threatened species. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment for Plaintiffs and finds as a matter of law that Plaintiffs may not proceed under Section 7, with the failure to consult claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Overview: Procedural posture of the case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government responded in relevant part that it would no longer use the knowledge instruction approved by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    McKittrick.\n   </em>\n   It agreed that the intent of Congress in 1978 was to make it clear that the statute only required proof of general, not specific, intent. Nevertheless, the government believed the jury instruction approved in\n   <em>\n    McKittrick\n   </em>\n   wrongly defined the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   required for a misdemeanor conviction under section 1540(b)(1). It reasoned the more analogous\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement was found in a public welfare offense for knowing violations of an Interstate Commerce regulation, which required drivers of motor vehicles transporting any explosive liquids or poisonous gasses to avoid, so far as practicable, driving into or through congested thoroughfares or places were crowds are assembled.\n   <em>\n    Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v.

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Boyce\n   </em>\n   found that the statute's element of intent defeated any argument that it was void for vagueness because to sustain a conviction, the government must prove that the driver could have taken another route which was both practicable and safer and that the driver knew of such a route and deliberately took the more dangerous route, or the driver willfully neglected to inquire into the relevant facts. In other words, \"knowingly\" means knowing the essential facts or willfully neglecting to inquire into them.

The Mexican gray wolf is one of many animal species protected under the ESA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs challenge the DOJ's McKittrick policy regarding the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   \"knowingly\" element of the offense, which includes both its proposed jury instructions and corresponding directives prosecuting cases only if there is evidence that the alleged shooter knew the biological identity of the animal at the time of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the DOJ's adoption of the McKittrick policy violates the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) because it is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 702, 706(2)(A). To prove its APA claim, the Plaintiffs charge that the DOJ's adoption of the McKittrick policy is a complete abdication of its prosecutorial discretion as established under the law set out in the ESA and\n   <em>\n    United States v. McKittrick,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219474\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/1170/#p1177\">\n    142 F.3d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1177 (9th Cir. 1998). Additionally, the Plaintiffs claim that the McKittrick policy violates DOJ's responsibility under \u00a7 7 of the ESA to take no action which may adversely affect a threatened species without first consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, the Defendant reurges arguments made in its Motion to Dismiss, which may be properly reurged to the extent afforded by the differing standard of review on summary judgment. At summary judgment, the Court looks beyond allegations, and Plaintiffs must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts establishing standing and other jurisdictional prerequisites. Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of admissible evidence. The Court will not, however, relook at conclusions of law made when it denied the Motion to Dismiss which did not turn on questions of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    APA Reviewability: the McKittrick policy is an abdication of DOJ's criminal enforcement duties and responsibilities under Section 11 of the ESA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Defendant again challenges this Court's jurisdiction under the APA to review the McKittrick policy because the DOJ has absolute discretion in deciding when to prosecute a crime, including the illegal taking of a Mexican gray wolf, and because the McKittrick policy is NOT a complete abdication of its duty and responsibility to enforce the criminal penalties\n   provision of the ESA for illegal takings of Mexican wolves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both parties agree that anything less than a complete abdication by DOJ of express duties required under the law, and the Defendant prevails on the APA claim. If Defendant prevails on this argument, the DOJ may nevertheless lose on the ESA claim that adoption and ongoing implementation of the McKittrick policy is a violation of DOJ's duty under Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA to enter into consultation with FWS regarding the significant adverse impact the policy has on the DOJ's efforts to conserve and protect the Mexican wolf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the Plaintiffs, \"Importantly, this is not a case in which Guardians challenges-or seeks judicial review of-any particular enforcement decision. Guardians acknowledge that, as a general rule, specific prosecutorial decisions that are made in individual cases-that is, whether the facts and circumstances of a particular case warrants enforcement action-are within the discretion of the Executive Branch, and are largely immune from judicial review.\" (Ps' MSJ (Doc. 87) at 1-2.) \" \"Rather, the complaint seeks a conventionally judicial determination of whether [a] certain fixed polic[y] ... followed by the Justice Department and the United States Attorney's office lies outside the constitutional and statutory limits of 'prosecutorial discretion.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219474\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/1170/#p1177\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nader v.

(Order (Doc. 30) at 10-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court's legal analysis in the Order denying the Motion to Dismiss bears repeating. First, there is a presumption for judicial review of agency actions, pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 702 and 704, which provide: \"A person 'adversely affected or aggrieved' by agency action, including a 'failure to act,' is entitled to 'judicial review thereof,' as long as the action is a 'final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.' \" (Order (Doc. 30) at 11.) The Court does not reconsider the prior determination that the express adoption of the McKittrick policy by Memorandum issued February 12, 1999, was a final agency action. (Order (Doc. 30) at 18-20); (AR (Doc. 75-6) at 149-150.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court presumes judicial review exists but for the narrow exception, pursuant to \u00a7 701(a)(2) of the APA, for actions committed to agency discretion which applies when a statute is so broadly drafted that there is no law for the Court to apply. Then the agency has absolute discretion to act because there is no clear standard by which to assess the agency's exercise of its discretionary authority. So, there is a second presumption of non-reviewability over an agency's decision\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to prosecute or enforce, whether through civil or criminal process, because such a decision is generally committed to an agency's\n   absolute discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 10-14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Heckler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n    470 U.S. at 831-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p832\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, the nonenforcement decision is made by the Attorney General and the United States Attorneys, who have \"broad discretion\" to enforce the Nation's criminal laws which make the presumption against reviewability especially strong.

The discussion and decision in\n   <em>\n    Clavette\n   </em>\n   is directly applicable here because the grizzly bear is another species like the Mexican gray wolf, governed by the ESA provisions at issue here. In\n   <em>\n    Clavette,\n   </em>\n   the court affirmed the defendant's conviction without a jury and also considered the evidence sufficient to support the jury's finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that: 1) defendant knowingly killed a bear; 2) the bear was a grizzly, 3) defendant had no permit to kill a grizzly bear, and 4) defendant did not act in self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Clavette\n   </em>\n   is in keeping with the elements of the offense reflected in the jury instruction approved in\n   <em>\n    McKittrick\n   </em>\n   for the same violation of the same ESA regulation as applied to the listed species, the Mexican gray wolf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Without expressly identifying the ESA as a public welfare regulatory statute, the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    McKittrick\n   </em>\n   relied on two district court cases,\n   <em>\n    St. Onge\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Billie,\n   </em>\n   which treated the ESA like a regulatory public welfare act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Billie,\n   </em>\n   the defendant was charged with taking a Florida panther, an endangered species. He argued that the government was required to prove that he knew the animal he shot was a Florida panther, as opposed to a nonendangered species of panther. The court rejected this argument and ruled that the government \"need prove only that the defendant acted with general intent when he shot the animal in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Billie,\n   </em>\n   667 F.Supp. at 1493. The court in\n   <em>\n    Billie\n   </em>\n   reasoned that the ESA is a regulatory statute, enacted to conserve and protect endangered species, and that its purposes would be eviscerated if the government had to prove that the hunter recognized the particular subspecies protected under the Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1492-93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    St. Onge,\n   </em>\n   the issue was whether the government must prove the defendant knew he was shooting a grizzly bear at the time he pulled the trigger, or whether the government need only prove that he knowingly shot an animal which turned out to be a grizzly bear. The court in\n   <em>\n    St. Onge\n   </em>\n   found that the court's construction of the \"knowingly\" requirement in\n   <em>\n    Billie\n   </em>\n   would best give effect to the regulatory and protective nature of the ESA. \"The purposes of the Endangered Species Act would be thwarted if the court were to adopt the\n   defendant's construction of the Act. The critical issue is whether the act was done knowingly, not whether the defendant recognized what he was shooting. The scienter element applies to the act of taking; thus, defendant could only claim accident or mistake if he did not intend to discharge his firearm, or the weapon malfunctioned, or similar circumstances occurred. Given the regulatory nature of the Act, and its broad purposes to protect listed species, the government cannot be required to prove that he had the specific intent to take a grizzly bear.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Onge,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3968907\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/676/1044/#p1045\">\n    676 F.Supp. at 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Supreme Court has not foreclosed public welfare offenses, and in the Ninth Circuit under\n   <em>\n    McKittrick,\n   </em>\n   the ESA penalty provision, Section 11, has been treated like a public welfare offense that does not require knowledge of every fact of the offense.

Knowledge of the law is never a requirement, and DOJ's instruction reflects this: \"the term knowingly does not require the government to prove that the defendant knew that the animal in question was protected under federal law, that the act he knowingly committed constituted a violation of the law, or that his conduct was illegal or unlawful. The DOJ instructs that the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did knowingly take a wolf, and that an act is done knowingly, \"if the defendant is aware of the act and does not act through ignorance, mistake, or accident.\" The DOJ's deliberate ignorance instruction precludes\n   finding the defendant acted knowingly, if the defendant actually believed the animal was not a wolf or acted based on negligence, mistake or carelessness. The DOJ's instruction requires proof that the defendant knew the biological species taken, i.e., shot, was a wolf, but need not know shooting a wolf is illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Requiring that the shooter know the biological species of the animal comes perilously close to requiring specific intent, the very\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   that Congress intended to amend in 1978 when it changed \"willfully\" to \"knowingly.\" Stated best by Defendant-Intervenors, the New Mexico Cattle Growers, \"[t]he difference between the two types of crimes is whether the defendant's conscious purpose was to cause the forbidden effect (specific intent) or not (general intent).\" (N. Mex. Response (Doc. 93) at 12 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dixon v.

Putting this in perspective, willfulness would require proof the defendant shot an animal intending to shoot a wolf. The Court has a hard time distinguishing this from the \"McKittrick policy-knowingly\" instruction which requires proof the defendant knowingly shot an animal knowing it was wolf. The latter is proof of the former so that under the McKittrick policy, the government has proved specific intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   This standard of proof is in stark contrast to Supreme Court acceptance of lesser\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   to support criminal offenses, even felony offenses. So for example, in 2015 in\n   <em>\n    Elonis,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court considered\n   <extracted-citation index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), which makes it a felony to transmit in interstate commerce \"any communication containing a threat ... to injure the person of another.\"\n   <em>\n    Elonis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589931\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2001/#p2003\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2007-2013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute was silent so the Supreme Court focused on the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   necessary to separate wrongful conduct from otherwise innocent conduct, and applied the presumption that scienter is required for each statutory element criminalizing otherwise innocent conduct. The Court held the crime required proof that the defendant, in making the allegedly threatening internet postings, knew the communications would be viewed as a threat.

There is no basis for the Court to reconsider its previous rejection of this argument. Reconsideration is appropriate only in rare circumstances, such as when the court has patently misunderstood a point, made a decision outside the adversarial issues presented to the court by the parties, made an error not of reasoning but of apprehension, or where there has been controlling or significant change in the law or facts since the submission of the issue to the court.

There is nothing new offered in the Response to the Motion for Summary Judgment, except for the reference in the Chavez Decl. that the FWS discussed the McKittrick policy in its 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 annual law enforcement reports. (D's Objection (Doc. 89) at 17 (citing Chavez Decl., Ex.

This is not new evidence of the type needed for reconsideration because it was available to the Defendant when it previously raised the time bar argument. The Court notes that while the FWS law enforcement annual reports cannot support reconsideration of the statute of limitation issue, they do support the Court's affirmation of its standing decision based on a finding that a causal nexus exists between the Defendant's prosecutorial McKittrick policy and illegal killing of wolves.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    The remainder of Defendant's statutory bar arguments and evidence presented in the Response to the Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment were included in the Motion to Dismiss and rejected by the Court's denial of the Motion to Dismiss.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    (Response (Doc. 89) at 15-18),\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    (Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 24) at 10-13, 13 (discussing tolling),\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    Supp. Decl.

The Court is not persuaded by Intervenor Safari's evidence that one of WildEarth Guardians' named Plaintiffs for purposes of standing, Peter M. Ossorio, was an Assistant United States Attorney at the time the February 12, 1999, memo was distributed. He joined WildEarth Guardians in 2000, but more importantly the memo distributed to AUSAs merely informed them to discontinue use of the jury instruction used in\n    <em>\n     McKittrick.\n    </em>\n    The memo did not include the jury instruction. \"[I]t did not declare it would be [essentially] seeking a specific intent jury instruction for the general intent offense.\" (Order (Doc. 30) at 21, 23.)
