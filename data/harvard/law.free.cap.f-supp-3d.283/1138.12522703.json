The Court previously found that the Defendants improperly denied Plaintiff Antonio Campbell's claim for disability benefits. What remains is Plaintiff's Petition for Attorneys' Fees and Costs. (Doc. 83). The petition is opposed in part by Defendant United of Omaha Life Insurance Company (\"United of Omaha\"). (Doc. 84). The matter is fully briefed and supported by the parties. Upon consideration, the Court finds the petition is due to be granted in part and denied in part as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court previously ruled on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, finding that United of Omaha's benefits determination was not reasonable concerning the period through October 2012. The Court further found that the denial of benefits determination was reasonable beyond that date. After Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, the Court granted the motion and remanded the matter to the Plan administrator for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was awarded \"a fully favorable decision ... on remand.\" (Doc. 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court retained jurisdiction over the case to afford Plaintiff's counsel an opportunity to submit their petition for attorneys' fees pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(2)(B). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 59 at 2, n.3). Plaintiff now seeks $87,623.50 in attorneys' fees and $4,286.26 in costs for a total of $91,909.76. (Doc. 83 at 11). He has requested an hourly rate of $450 to $500 for his lead attorney, Thomas O. Sinclair, and an hourly rate of $225 for Mr. Sinclair's co-counsel, Lee P. Fernon, Jr. (Doc. 83-5). United of Omaha argues that an attorney's fee award of not more than $41,573.00 is appropriate. (Doc. 84 at 18). United of Omaha does not challenge Plaintiff's request for costs.

The Court finds that Plaintiff did achieve the requisite degree of success to warrant an award of attorney's fees. Through the efforts of Plaintiff's counsel, the record demonstrates that Plaintiff was awarded \"a fully favorable decision ... on remand.\" (Doc. 85). The Court concludes Plaintiff has cleared the\n   first hurdle. This requires the Court to move on to the five factors enumerated above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As to the first factor, the \"culpability or bad faith\" of United of Omaha, Plaintiff argues that the defendant \"culpably breached its fiduciary duties and issued an unreasonable decision that ignored and misstated the medical evidence of record.\" (Doc. 83 at 3). Plaintiff further argues that United of Omaha \"compounded that culpability when it chose to uphold that decision and deny Plaintiff's much needed benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[B]ad faith is more than mere negligence; it is the conscious doing of a wrong, where an attorney knowingly or recklessly pursues a frivolous claim or engages in litigation tactics that needlessly obstruct the litigation of non-frivolous claims, or [involves] deliberate deception, gross negligence or recklessness.\"\n   <em>\n    Cross v. Quality Mgmt. Group, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=491%20Fed.%20Appx.%2053\">\n    491 Fed.Appx. 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (11th Cir. 2012) (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is an incredibly high standard to meet. While the Court did find that United of Omaha's denial in this matter was arbitrary and capricious, it did not find that United of Omaha consciously acted to wrong Plaintiff. Additionally, United of Omaha's counsel did not act recklessly, with gross negligence or in a deliberately deceptive manner, or pursue a frivolous claim. Stated another way, United of Omaha simply was wrong in its determination. However, Plaintiff's situation is compelling. His doctors concluded he was disabled. Having had the opportunity to see Plaintiff at a hearing on a motion in this case, the court notes that his debilitating condition was, at that juncture, obvious. United of Omaha's counsel also had an opportunity to see Plaintiff, but that does not warrant a finding against United of Omaha on this first factor. Thus, evaluation of this factor tends to favor United of Omaha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to the second factor-the ability to satisfy an award-there is no dispute United of Omaha has the ability to satisfy an award. Thus, this factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to the third factor-deterrence of other persons acting in similar circumstances-Plaintiff argues that \"the deterrent effect of awarding fees in cases like Plaintiff's cannot be understated because [t]here are no statutory punitive damages in ERISA litigation, so the only real avenue for deterrence is the award of attorneys' fees.\" (Doc. 83 at 4). Plaintiff continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Otherwise, there is simply no reason for an insurer to pay benefits at all because the most they could stand to lose is the past benefits they should have paid in the first place. Given the scant resources of disabled workers, the deferential standard of review, and low rate of return for ERISA attorneys, ERISA insurers are given wide latitude to pressure participants into taking low settlements or simply throwing up their hands and giving up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) United of Omaha \"acknowledges that the prospect of a fee award likely deters other insurance companies in a similar situation.\" (Doc. 84 at 4). However, United of Omaha counters that \"insurers are already bound by duties imposed by law and the particular plan documents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5). It further argues that \"[t]he possibility of a fee award should not be used to push insurers to pay claims that are not payable because doing so would violate the insurer's duties to other participants in the plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Premised on Plaintiff's ability to navigate the difficult path to\n   show that United of Omaha acted unreasonably and the fact that an attorney's fee award is certainly a deterrent to future unreasonable benefits decisions, the Court finds this factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff and an award of attorney's fees in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As to the fourth factor-benefit to others or resolution of a significant legal issue-Plaintiff argues that to the extent this factor has any application, \"his motion for reconsideration did address the legally significant question of the proper remedy in overturning an insurer's denial of benefits.\" (Doc. 83 at 5). He goes on to argue, \"Put in other terms, courts may now review the results of this Court's labor and see that where a claimant asks for remand (particularly where there is some ambiguity in the record), the court is not constrained to rendering a decision on the merits based on the record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) United of Omaha counters that this factor does not apply here, but, even if it did, it favors the denial of the request for fees. Specifically, United of Omaha asserts that the Court did not resolve a significant ERISA legal question in this case or resolve a plan interpretation issue that benefitted other plan participants. (Doc. 84 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the Court issued its initial opinion finding for Plaintiff and ordering United of Omaha to award specific, limited benefits to Plaintiff, he filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the correct course was for the Court to remand the matter to the administrator. The Court agreed, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   As to the second matter, [concerning a remand to the administrator,] the court finds that Campbell's argument is well-founded to the extent the court determined his LTD benefits properly terminated as of October 2012. Despite its prior ruling, the court now believes the proper and prudent recourse is to remand this matter to the Plan administrator for further proceedings premised on the finding that the administrator improperly denied him benefits when his LTD policy became effective. While the administrator will be required to award Campbell the STD and LTD benefits erroneously denied because the decisions were arbitrary and capricious, nothing in this order precludes the administrator from further evaluating the length and duration of Campbell's disability for the purpose of awarding LTD benefits. The administrator is not limited, however, by the court's previous determination concerning the duration or scope of his LTD benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Doc. 79 at 3 (footnote omitted)). United of Omaha is correct that this determination does not benefit other participants in the plan. However, it does provide some persuasive authority for the future when a court must evaluate the proper course in deciding whether to render a decision premised on the record or to remand the case to an administrator. This is particularly noteworthy in this case because, while this Court determined that limited benefits were due to be awarded, the Plan administrator found that full benefits were due. Thus, this factor also weighs in favor of an award of an attorney's fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to the last factor-the relative merits of the parties' positions-Plaintiff argues that his position is \"clearly superior to Defendant's given the deferential standard of review he had to overcome.\" (Doc. 83 at 5). United of Omaha counters that while Plaintiff was successful on his motion to reconsider, the Court also rejected Plaintiff's claims for breach of fiduciary duty and failure to provide plan documents, as well as his argument that the arbitrary and capricious standard should not apply. (Doc. 84 at 6). The Court finds for Plaintiff on this factor. Obtaining relief in cases such as this one is no easy task. The standard for relief is high. Plaintiff's position\n   on the merits was correct, as evidenced by the final determination by the Plan administrator on remand. Thus, this factor weighs in favor of an award of a reasonable fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Upon a consideration of the five factors enumerated above, the Court finds that an award of an attorney's fee is warranted in this case. Plaintiff's petition, therefore, is due to be granted in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having found that Plaintiff is entitled to a fee award, the next matter is to determine whether the requested amount is reasonable. \"In determining what is a 'reasonable' hourly rate and what number of compensable hours is 'reasonable,' the court is to consider the 12 factors enumerated in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Mr. Allenstein is located in Gadsden, Alabama and regularly represents individuals with disability-related claims in this court. He opines that Mr. Sinclair's requested rates are reasonable based \"on [his] knowledge of fees awarded in other cases nationally.\" (Doc. 83-2 at \u00b6 5). He further opines that the requested rate is \"actually at the low end of the usual range awarded to counsel who, like Mr. Sinclair, have a great deal of experience and knowledge in this complex area of the law and have a specialized ERISA plaintiffs' practice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The third declaration was executed by Mr. Patrick DiCarlo with the Alston &amp; Bird law firm in Atlanta, Georgia. It was prepared in May 2011 in a ERISA case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division. In the declaration, Mr. DiCarlo states that he charged an hourly rate of $525.00 in that ERISA case. (Doc. 83-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Lastly is the declaration of Mr. Howard Shapiro with Proskauer Rose LLP in New Orleans, Louisiana, prepared in January 2017 in an ERISA case in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The declaration quotes \"discounted\" ERISA rates of $725.00 to $400.00, depending upon the experience of the attorneys. (Doc. 83-4 at \u00b6\u00b6 12 &amp; 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In opposing Plaintiff's proposed hourly rates, United of Omaha argues the appropriate legal market for determining reasonable rates is the Birmingham, Alabama market. (Doc. 84 at 11-12). It further contends that the Court should utilize an hourly rate of $325 for Mr. Sinclair and $225 for Mr. Fernon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In support of its contentions, United of Omaha relies upon the declaration of Mr. Christopher L. Yeilding with the Balch and Bingham LLP law firm and Mr. John S. Johnson, counsel of record in this case. Mr. Yeilding has been licensed in Alabama since 2002 and currently practices in Birmingham, Alabama. He states that he has \"worked on many ERISA-governed employee benefits lawsuits\" since 2002. (Doc. 84-1 at \u00b6 2). He also states that based on his experience and practice, he is \"familiar with the typical hourly rates obtained for non-contingency fee work for ERISA claims and counseling in the Northern District of Alabama.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). He concludes that the reasonable hourly rate for Mr. Sinclair in\n   this case is no more than$325.00 per hour and for Mr. Fernon is $225.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). In so opining, he states that \"this case included standard ERISA issues for which no specialized knowledge or training was required.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Specifically, he states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   This is a standard ERISA benefits case. There were no disputes as to the appropriate jurisdiction or forum. The Complaint was filed in federal court pursuant to ERISA jurisdiction. The only issue properly before the Court was whether Plaintiff was entitled to disability benefits. Plaintiff's claims of breach of fiduciary duty and failure to provide plan documents should not have ever been alleged as part of this case .... Accordingly, I do not believe it is appropriate to utilize a higher rate more comparable to a national rate or a rate utilized in a larger metropolitan area (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Atlanta, Georgia, New Orleans, Louisiana, or Phoenix, Arizona), as opposed to the typical rates applied in Birmingham.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). He further states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Additionally, it is my opinion that some of the work in this case was unnecessary, particularly on the issue of the appropriate standard of review and the claims for relief for breach of fiduciary duty and failure to provide plan documents. It is my opinion that there was no legitimate basis for the Plaintiff to contend that the standard of review should have been\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .... Moreover, it is my opinion that there was no basis for Plaintiff to include in the Complaint claims for relief for alleged breach of fiduciary duty and failure to provide plan documents. The Court properly dismissed those two claims; however, the parties had to engage in briefing on the Motion to Dismiss which was entirely avoidable if Plaintiff had included the only claim in his Complaint for which he had any basis to allege, instead of adding claims that were not supported.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In Mr. Johnson's affidavit, he states that he has been practicing law since 1997 and he has handled ERISA litigation since 2002. (Doc. 84-2 at \u00b6 3). He further states that he charged United of Omaha $200.00 per hour throughout the proceedings in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He explains that this rate is discounted based on the volume of work he does for United of Omaha. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lastly, he states that his co-counsel, Mr. Henry T. Morrissette, charged $220.00 per hour for his work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court believes that ERISA law is complex and the specialized experience and expertise is necessary \"to effectively and efficiently prosecute ERISA claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosario v. King &amp; Prince Seafood Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%2011519378\">\n    2010 WL 11519378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *6 (S.D. Ga. July 15, 2010). Additionally, the Court finds that it should not overlook the rates charged in the national markets due to the specialized nature of the work. That does not mean, however, that the circumstances in this case require application of national rates. The Court finds that the circumstances do not justify the rates requested by Plaintiff for a number of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, Plaintiff has not met his burden of demonstrating that there are a lack of lawyers who are willing to handle cases such as this in this area. Only Mr. Buchanan states that there are very few attorneys \"in the Eleventh Circuit and in Alabama specifically\" who \"have the skills and knowledge to regularly handle ERISA claims and litigation successfully.\" (Doc. 83-1 at \u00b6 12). This statement is very subjective, speculative, and conclusory. Plaintiff has not met his burden of demonstrating that an exception to the general rule applies in this case. Second, Plaintiff has not offered any evidence showing that he had difficulty in finding counsel to represent\n   him in this matter. Third, the undersigned has not seen any evidence in this case, or otherwise, that ERISA plaintiffs are having difficulty retaining counsel in this jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Court will apply the prevailing market rates applicable to cases filed in the Southern Division of this Court in deciding the reasonable rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The next issue is what is the reasonable rate in the Birmingham, Alabama market. Neither Mr. Buchanan nor Mr. Allenstein testify that they have specifically billed and been paid or been awarded the proposed rates of $450-$500 per hour in cases filed in the Northern District of Alabama, much less Birmingham, Alabama. Thus, their affidavits are not particularly instructive or persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Mr. Sinclair states in his petition that he \"typically charge[s] $575.00 an hour for ERISA litigation.\" (Doc. 83 at 8). He also states that he agreed to a reduced rate of $450 to $500 an hour in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the petition, he also states that his rates \"are well within the rates typically charged for this work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In support of this statement he lists a reference to the \"Dell &amp; Scheffer Law Firm\" in Florida, which states, \"Our hourly attorney fee ranges from $400 to $650 depending on the attorney working on the claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Sinclair also cites to hourly rates awarded in various cases from California, Wisconsin, New York, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. This information, however, is of little use since the Court is unable to evaluate the nature of the claims, the skill set of the lawyers, their experience or their reputation in those other cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549528\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/836/1292/#p1303\">\n    836 F.2d at 1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the affidavits \"do not show that the rates to which they attest were charged in similar cases for similar clients by lawyers of similar skill, experience, and reputation\"). Additionally, they are not rates awarded in this District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In support of the requested rates, Mr. Sinclair also states in his declaration, \"Based on my knowledge of what other ERISA attorneys charge in this area and throughout the country, I believe these rates are reasonable considering the national market for ERISA attorneys.\" (Doc. 83-5 at \u00b6 18). This statement is conclusory. Mr. Sinclair has not offered the requisite detail to justify an award of the requested amounts. For instance, with regard to his billing rate, what an attorney \"typically charges\" may be different from what he actually recovers or what he has been awarded by a court in a fee petition. Mr. Sinclair does not state that he has been awarded such an hourly rate by any court for a case similar to the present one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Additionally, Mr. Yeilding's declaration is not particularly helpful because it is conclusory as well. He opines that the rate he proposes for Mr. Sinclair-$325.00-is \"consistent with the high-end of rates typically charged in Birmingham\" and that the rate he proposes for Mr. Fernon-$225.00-is \"not unreasonable for his level of experience.\" (Doc. 84-1 at \u00b6 6). Mr. Yeilding does not offer any citations to specific cases where the awards were at the levels he posits.

The Court finds that the hours spent on the response to the motion are due to be disallowed in full because the time was not justified. With regard to the preparation of the complaint the Court finds that the hours claimed should be reduced, but only by two hours. The Court does not believe it is necessary or appropriate to disallow the entire period. Instead, the Court has used its experience in determining the reasonable time for the adjustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   United of Omaha next argues that any award should be reduced by 8.8 hours for the time spent during March and April 2014 drafting the complaint to include claims against J &amp; B Importers Welfare Plan because J &amp; B was dismissed from the case. (Doc. 84 at 15). United of Omaha again argues the total time for preparing the complaint should be deducted because Plaintiff failed to segregate the time spent regarding J &amp; B Importers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court agrees with United of Omaha that this time is due to be disallowed, but believes for the reasons discussed above that only a portion of the time should be cut. The Court further believes that the reduction already made concerning the complaint is appropriate to account for this deficiency. Thus, no further reduction will be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   United of Omaha next argues that because the Court repeatedly rejected Plaintiff's arguments for application of the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the time expended on this issue should be deducted as unnecessary. (Doc. 84 at 15-16). It also asserts that all the briefing time should be excluded when challenges concerning the arbitrary and capricious standard were made because it is not possible to tell what part of the total time claimed is attributable to responding to United of Omaha's arguments in this regard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). This challenge involves the following work by Plaintiff's counsel: June 2014-4.3 hours pursuing discovery; March to May 2015 summary judgment briefing-43 hours;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and July and August 2015 briefing concerning an objection to the Administrative Services Agreement-15 hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As to the initial challenge to the 4.3 hours of discovery work, Defendant generally argues that this was an unnecessary and unreasonable expenditure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Counsel's log for this period shows the following relevant entries:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-77\">June 18, 2014 Receipt and review of Defendant's proposed .8 Rule 26 report indicating the Defendant wants to have a Rule 26 meeting; call with defense attorney explaining in detail the effort it is going to take for me to respond to some of the serious problems that his proposed pleading creates with regard to discovery. Explained to him that the burden will be placed upon the Court and on the Plaintiff to correct his client's misrepresentation of what it means to have an ERISA claim pending in the U.S. District Courts. June 19, 2014 Research and review Rule 26 disclosure 2.1 requirements with regard to ERISA claims because of the Defendant's position that they do not have to comply with Rule 26 disclosure requirements. Research and review case law from all available circuits on the Defendant's refusal to participate in meaningful discovery and their arbitrary and capricious assignment of the right for them to determine what constitutes the ERISA record in a matter. Research and review precedent for the Defendant's claims that they do not have to provide pretrial hearing dates and other pretrial matters in their Rule 26 reports because it is an ERISA case. Begin drafting and editing lengthy narratives to respond along with case citations pointing out that the Defendant's views and opinions are without precedent and wholly unsupported by the Constitution, the statute in question, the Rules of Civil Procedure and the local rules. June 25, 2014 Draft discovery requests to United of Omaha to 1.4 includ[e] interrogatories and request for production of documents. Draft initial disclosures, review documents to be 2.2 produced and Bates number same 1-479.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Doc. 83-5 at 9-10). It is difficult to tell from United of Omaha's challenge exactly what \"4.3\" hours is being referenced. It appears this challenge concerns the first three paragraphs quoted above. The Court believes it can discern from a review of the foregoing log entries, its docket sheet, and the relevant pleadings, that portions of the\n   work done in June 2014 was reasonably associated with the prosecution of other aspects of this case. Accordingly, the Court finds it appropriate to reduced the requested time only by two hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Next, United of Omaha argues that the March to May 2015 summary judgment briefing should be excluded in total due to the continued advancement of the arguments on the inapplicability of the arbitrary and capricious standard of review to this case. (Doc. 84 at 16 (\"The Court should reduce these fees because some of them are unnecessary.\")). As a part of this contention, United of Omaha also argues that the 15 hours Plaintiff's counsel spent briefing an objection to the Administrative Services Agreement filed by United of Omaha should be disallowed. United of Omaha asserts its motion concerning the Agreement was necessitated because Plaintiff continued unjustifiably to assert that the arbitrary and capricious standard did not apply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the \"Conclusion\" portion of United of Omaha's opposition to the fee request, United of Omaha also argues without citation that the reduction in this case should be 30% \"based on Plaintiff's counsel's failure to exercise billing judgment.\" (Doc. 84 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In its Memorandum Opinion, the Court applied clear Eleventh Circuit law and found that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies in this case. (Doc. 47 at 22-28). The Court further found that it would not consider the Administrative Services Agreement in ruling on the motions for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-30). This does not mean, however, that all the time Plaintiff's counsel expended in responding to United of Omaha's objection to the Agreement should be excluded. United of Omaha's motion was necessitated by the Court's action in ordering \"United of Omaha to produce a copy of the agreement and affording the parties the opportunity to address the agreement's impact, if any, on the motions for summary judgment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29 (referencing Docs. 40 &amp; 43)). Under the circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiff's counsel's expenditure of 15 hours for responding to the motion concerning the use of the Agreement was reasonable. The time will be allowed. However, the briefing hours on summary judgment will be reduced by 10 hours premised on Plaintiff's continued advancement of the arguments on the arbitrary and capricious standard of review in light of definitive Eleventh Circuit precedent on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   United of Omaha next contends Plaintiff's counsel filed a premature notice of appeal and that time should not be deemed reasonable under the circumstances. (Doc. 84 at 17). The Court agrees. The notice of appeal was filed after this Court issued its opinion on the summary judgment motions. The appeal was dismissed,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals approximately two months after it was filed for lack of jurisdiction. (Doc. 67). The Eleventh Circuit determined that the appeal was due to be dismissed because this Court's action was not a final order or immediately appealable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, the time expended in this endeavor is not compensable. The 5.2 hours spent from November 2015 to January 2016 on the appeal will be deducted from the final determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Lastly, United of Omaha challenges Plaintiff's submission to the extent it seeks to recover 2.8 hours spent on February 28, 2017, by Mr. Fernon to familiarize himself with the case. (Doc. 84 at 17). Considering Mr. Fernon's involvement in the case following his introduction to the same, the Court finds this time is reasonable and allowable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   United of Omaha does not opposed Plaintiff's petition to the extent it seeks\n   $4,286.26 in expenses.
