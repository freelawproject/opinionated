The Court has considered Defendant's motion, Plaintiff State of Washington's Response, Defendant's Reply, the Complaint, and the remainder of the file herein. Dkts. 1-1, 17, 18. The Court also considered oral argument held in open court on November 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case centers on the compensation of detainees at the Northwest Detention Center, a facility Defendant operates in Tacoma, Washington, under a contract with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a division of the Department of Homeland Security. Defendant uses detainees to assist in operating the facility under a Voluntary Work Program, and in exchange for their work, Defendant compensates detainees $1 per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed this\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   action \"to enforce Washington's minimum wage laws and to\n   remedy the unjust enrichment\" from Defendant's \"long standing failure to adequately pay immigration detainees[.]\" Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6 1.1. Defendant's Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion seeks dismissal on four primary grounds: (1) the State's claims are preempted by federal law, (2) the State lacks authority to bring this lawsuit, (3) the State fails to state a claim for unjust enrichment and violations of the Washington Minimum Wage Act, and (4) the State's unclean hands and laches bar relief.

The sole preemption provision under IRCA, \u00a7 1342a(h)(2), prevents state and local governments from \"imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ...unauthorized aliens.\" \u00a7 1324a(h)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At issue is how broadly to define the term \"sanction\" under \u00a7 1324a(h)(2). According to Defendant, the term should be broadly construed to include disgorgement, particularly because a finding that Defendant is an \"employer\" would expose Defendant to liability for double damages and attorneys fees.

Plaintiff argues that because employing unauthorized aliens is the act that IRCA sanctions, only state laws imposing sanctions for that conduct fall within IRCA's express preemption clause.

There are no other express preemption provisions under IRCA, so the key question is what Congress intended for \u00a7 1324a(h)(2) to preempt. Section 1324a(h)(2) prohibits states from imposing civil or criminal sanctions \"upon those who employ...unauthorized aliens[.]\" Put differently, states cannot penalize employers for employing unauthorized aliens.

Dkt. 10 at 20, 21. The most to be gleaned about congressional intent for a framework regulating detainee wages at the expense of State law can be found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201555\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Section 1555(d) authorizes congressional appropriations for \"payment of allowances [to detainees]...for work performed,\" but payment is limited to \"such rate\n   <em>\n    as may be specified\n   </em>\n   from time to time\n   <em>\n    in the appropriation Act\n   </em>\n   involved.\" \u00a7 1555(d) (emphasis added). Under this section, Congress arguably speaks to detainee wages when Congress appropriates payment of allowances to detainees for work performed, but although \u00a7 1555(d) is still in effect, Congress has not specified any rate for detainee work since fiscal year 1979. At that time, Congress appropriated funds for \"payment of allowances (at a rate\n   <em>\n    not in excess of\n   </em>\n   $1 per day)...for work performed.\" PL 95-431 (HR 12934), PL 95-431, Oct. 10, 1978, 92 Stat 1021 (emphasis added). At least since fiscal year 1979, Congress has abandoned direct appropriations for payment of allowances, despite its awareness of how to do so.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, PL 114-113, December 18, 2015, 129 Stat 2242, 2497. From the text of \u00a7 1555(d), Defendant has not shown that Congress intended to preempt state law regarding detainee wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant has offered no satisfactory explanation for the congressional silence since 1979 other than to make general representations about congressional delegation of authority to ICE to create a comprehensive regulatory scheme, e.g., through the Voluntary Work Program. Dkt. 18 at 15. The Voluntary Work Program is an ICE policy with no preemptive force at law. As argued in the companion case, if ICE intended the Voluntary Work Program to preempt state law on the issue of detainee wages, ICE would need to follow at least two sets of requirements. ICE, like all federal agencies, is subject to Executive Order 13132, which requires agencies to follow specific rules when intending to preempt state law through agency policy. Federalism, 64 FR 43255, E.O. 13132 (1999). For agency policy to have the force of law, agency rule-making processes must also approach at least the spirit of Administrative Procedure Act (APA) formalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There is no showing that Congress intended for its general appropriations after 1979 to delegate to ICE the authority to preempt state law as to detainee wages. ICE policy on detainee wages, specifically, the Voluntary Work Program, does not show a clear agency intent to preempt state law, where there is no showing that ICE attempted to observe formalities that underlie its authority to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant has not shown that the State minimum wage provision is field preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Conflict/obstacle preemption.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Conflict preemption exists \"where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,\" and obstacle preemption exists\n   \"where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    English v.

Defendant has challenged the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), which means that the Court must resolve the motion based on allegations in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Regarding obstacle preemption, Defendant points to the obstruction of several federal objectives and purposes: increased costs to ICE, and, ultimately taxpayers; a \"balkanized patchwork\" of state laws; and the undermining of ICE's authority to care for detainees and enforce the Contract. Dkt. 10 at 23, 24; Dkt. 18 at 16. Defendant's obstacle preemption argument is also premature, because addressing whether the federal objectives and purposes will be obstructed would require resolution of factual determinations far beyond the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In sum, the conflict/obstacle preemption issues may become ripe at summary judgment or at trial, but at present factual issues abound that preclude a decision based on the pleadings, and before discovery. Defendant has not shown that the State minimum wage provision is conflict or obstacle preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Admittedly, at first blush the issue of preemption would seem to favor Defendant, given the long history of federal legislation and agency action in the area of immigration detention generally. After peeling back the rhetoric and examining the actual statutes and regulations, on the issue of detainee wages, an area of traditional state prerogative, the Court cannot find evidence of congressional intent-either express or implied-sufficient to overcome the presumption against preemption.

It is alleged that since 2005 Defendant has simultaneously housed up to 1,575 individuals at the Northwest Detention Center and that compensating detainee-workers below the State minimum wage affects both detainee-workers and workers in the general population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 3.5, 3.9. A more exact, quantifiable number of adversely affected proportion of the population should not be required at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant argues that Washington's citizens have rejected the idea that federal detainees should be \"supported at taxpayer expense\" and points to a 2007 ballot initiative. Dkt. 10 at 5. The initiative, which Defendant represents received more than 60% approval from voters, apparently addressed the applicability of the State minimum wage to state inmates. Support for the initiative, Defendant argues, shows that the current vast majority of Washington residents reject the applicability of the State minimum wage to civil detainees at a federal facility. Defendant extends its argument beyond the pleadings, and the initiative\n   did not address federal detainees. This argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Parens patriae\n    </em>\n    challenge brought under Fed. R. Civ.

Dkt. 10 at 29. Defendant represents that the two elements for an unjust enrichment claim are that (1) the enrichment of the defendant is unjust, and (2) the plaintiff is not a mere volunteer, Dkt. 10 at 29, citing to\n   <em>\n    Lynch v. Deaconess Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1172082\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/113/162/#p165\">\n    113 Wn.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=776%20P.2d%20681\">\n    776 P.2d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). It is not clear that \"involuntariness\" is an element to an unjust enrichment claim.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , 113 Wn.2d at 165,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=776%20P.2d%20681\">\n    776 P.2d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Assuming that \"involuntary\" must be alleged in the pleadings, the Court can infer that detainees' participation was involuntary from the alleged circumstances, where detainees are housed at a private immigration detention center, Defendant has compensated detainees at $1 per day since 2005, regardless of hours worked, and Defendant has financially benefited from the work without the financial burden of paying the State minimum wage. Defendant argues that the Voluntary Work Program cannot be involuntary because it is voluntary by design, a conclusion that Defendant says is reinforced by a waiver signed by detainees affirming their voluntary participation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20P.3d%201258\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This reasoning relies upon factual findings beyond the scope of the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant's second argument avers that the Complaint fails to allege that detainees had a reasonable expectation of receiving compensation at the State minimum wage. Dkt. 10 at 29, 30. Defendant provides no authority for \"reasonable expectation\" to be an essential allegation to\n   the pleadings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20P.3d%201258\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , nor is the undersigned of aware of any.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , 164 Wn.2d at 484-85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20P.3d%201258\">\n    191 P.3d 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Absent this authority, the reasonableness of the parties' expectations is a fairness issue that cannot be decided on a Fed. R. Civ. 12(b)(6) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that the unjust enrichment claim fails to state a claim because it is not alleged that the State has conferred a benefit on Defendant. Dkt. 10 at 29, 30; Dkt. 18 at 17. Defendant cites to\n   <em>\n    State v. Am. Tobacco Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 96-2-15056-8-SEA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20931316\">\n    1996 WL 931316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (Wash. Super. Nov. 19, 1996), which is not analogous. In\n   <em>\n    Am. Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   , the State sought common law damages for itself for \"increased public health costs\" due to a tobacco company's alleged failure to assume duties owed to protect public health.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20931316\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, Plaintiff does not seek damages on behalf of itself, but rather brings this action\n   <em>\n    in parens patriae\n   </em>\n   for Washington residents and workers, including detainees, who conferred a benefit on Defendant by working at compensation below the State minimum wage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 3.5, 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss the cause of action for unjust enrichment for failure to state a claim should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Violations of the Washington Minimum Wage Act.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant contends that the Complaint fails to state a claim for violations of the Washington Minimum Wage Act because detainees are not \"employees\" under Washington law. Dkt. 10 at 24-28. The Washington Minimum Wage Act defines \"employee\" generally as \"any individual employed by an employer,\" subject to an enumerated list of exceptions. RCW 49.46.010(3). Defendant argues that detainees fall under an exception, subsection (3)(k), which excepts from the general definition, \"Any resident, inmate, or patient of a state, county, or municipal correctional, detention, treatment or rehabilitative institution[.]\" RCW 49.46.010(3)(k). Defendant also argues that, when interpreting the statute, the Court should look to Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Beginning with the statute itself, it is plain that the definition excepts residents of \"state ...detention\" facilities, not federal facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 49.46.010(3)(k). The Northwest Detention Center is a federal detention facility and thus does not fall under the exception. This conclusion is reinforced by Washington law narrowly construing exceptions in favor of the employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anfinson v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021791\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/851/#p870\">\n    174 Wn.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=281%20P.3d%20289\">\n    281 P.3d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Anticipating this result, Defendant urges an expansive interpretation of the exception to extend to federal detainees. (This is an ironic request, because elsewhere Defendant argues that the State deliberately omitted federal detainees from the statutory exception because it would be \"outlandish\" for the State to include them. Dkt. 10 at 28.) Defendant urges this Court to follow\n   <em>\n    Menocal v.

In the absence of binding authority, the undersigned should respectfully decline the invitation to add to the statute.

UNCLEAN HANDS AND LACHES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant summarily urges dismissal of the unjust enrichment cause of action on the equitable grounds of unclean hands and laches. Defendant makes two primary arguments: first, Plaintiff acts in bad faith to enforce the State minimum wage, because State law expressly excepts residents of state, county, or municipal detention facilities from the same protections, and the State operates and benefits from programs similar to the Voluntary Work Program; and second, the State's L &amp; I division, the government entity statutorily-authorized to enforce the State Minimum Wage Act, has never initiated any wage enforcement actions against Defendant, despite its knowledge of the Voluntary Work Program and no excuse for its delay. Dkt. 10 at 31, 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Both arguments reach far beyond the scope of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion. The pleadings on their own do not make a showing of unclean hands or laches sufficient for dismissal. Defendant's motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment cause of action based on unclean hands and laches should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendant has not overcome the presumption against preemption by showing congressional intent to displace state law as to detainee wages. Defendant has not shown that Plaintiff lacks authority to proceed as\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   on behalf of Washington residents. The Complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted for both causes of action. Dismissal under equitable doctrines of laches and unclean hands is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   THEREFORE, Defendant The GEO Group, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (Dkt. 10) is HEREBY DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Clerk is directed to send uncertified copies of this Order to all counsel of record and to any party appearing pro se at said party's last known address.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    companion case,\n    <em>\n     Chen v.
