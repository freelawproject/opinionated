As such, he is bound by the numerous requirements set forth in Kentucky's Sex Offender Registration Act, which seeks to govern where Doe lives, works, recreates, and more. Certain Kentucky restrictions particularly impact Doe's use of the internet. For example, the law prohibits Doe from using any social networking websites that may be accessed or used by minors. KRS \u00a7 17.546(2). Doe must provide his local probation office with all of his email and other internet name identities.

First, KRS \u00a7 17.546 governs registrants' use of social media as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   No registrant shall knowingly or intentionally use a social networking Web site or an instant messaging or chat room program if that Web site or program allows a person who is less than eighteen (18) years of age to access or use the Web site or program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS \u00a7 17.546(2). That statute also includes a set of definitions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (a) \"Instant messaging or chat room program\" means a software program that allows two (2) or more persons to communicate over the Internet in real time using typed text; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (b) \"Social networking Web site\" means an Internet Web site that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

KRS \u00a7 17.510(10)(c). The Justice and Public Safety Cabinet is permitted to intermittently verify these name identities, and if the Cabinet discovers that a sex offender registrant failed to provide a particular identity, the Cabinet may notify the relevant County or Commonwealth's Attorney Office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS \u00a7 17.510(13). A sex offender who violates KRS \u00a7 17.510(10)(c) is considered guilty of a Class D felony for his or her first violation, or guilty of a Class C felony for any subsequent violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS \u00a7\u00a7 17.510(11) - (12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   John Doe argues each of these statutes impermissibly abridges his right to free speech under the First Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doe initially challenged the statutes described above by way of a motion for preliminary injunction filed against the Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, the Fayette County Attorney, and the Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney, all sued in their official capacities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the parties later consolidated their briefing, and they now ask the Court to consider Doe's request as one for permanent injunctive relief.

Even applying this lower standard of review, the Supreme Court found the law to be unconstitutionally burdensome and overbroad.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n    at 1736-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant John Tilley, Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, concedes that Kentucky's restriction on sex offender registrants' use of social media websites is unconstitutional in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Packingham.\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 52 at 2.] Secretary Tilley explains that, while he considers Kentucky's sex offender restrictions to be important tools to protect the children of the Commonwealth from abuse, the North Carolina statute struck down by the Supreme Court was even more narrowly tailored than KRS \u00a7 17.546(2). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants Lou Anna Red Corn and Larry Roberts, Fayette County's Commonwealth and County Attorneys, do not share Secretary Tilley's view and attempt to distinguish KRS \u00a7 17.546(2) from the unconstitutional North Carolina law. The Defendants point out that the North Carolina statute penalized a sex offender registrant's mere \"access\" of a social media site, but the Kentucky law only penalizes \"use.\" [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 54 at 5.] Because the Kentucky statute includes both the words \"access\" and \"use\", the General Assembly must have intended the two terms to have a distinct meaning. And this is significant, they argue, because a Kentucky sex offender registrant can still \"obtain information freely on the internet,\" something a North Carolina sex offender could not do. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Despite these attempts to distinguish KRS \u00a7 17.546(2) from the law struck down in\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   , the Court agrees with the Plaintiff and Secretary Tilley that the Commonwealth's statute is unconstitutional. Ms. Red Corn and Mr. Roberts apparently find it sufficient that Mr. Doe could log onto a website such as Facebook or Twitter and read the speech of others, thereby obtaining political news, learning of community events, or viewing job postings. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 54 at 5] (emphasizing that the Kentucky law still \"permits sex offenders to obtain information freely on the internet\"). But this, under\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   , is not enough. \"A fundamental principle of the First Amendment is that all persons have access to places where they can\n   <em>\n    speak\n   </em>\n   and listen, and then, after reflection,\n   <em>\n    speak\n   </em>\n   and listen once more.\"\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). KRS \u00a7 17.546 as it currently stands may allow Mr. Doe to\n   \"listen\" to the speech of others on social media sites, but it surely does not allow him to \"speak.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Instead, as Secretary Tilley seems to recognize, KRS \u00a7 17.546(2) burdens substantially more speech than necessary to further the Commonwealth's legitimate interests in protecting children from sexual abuse solicited via the internet. Like\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   points out, \"it can be assumed that the First Amendment permits a State to enact specific, narrowly tailored laws that prohibit a sex offender from engaging in conduct that often presages a sexual crime, like contacting a minor or using a website to gather information about a minor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But KRS \u00a7 17.546(2) prohibits sex offender registrants from engaging in any speech whatsoever on a social media website, as innocent as that speech may be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Indeed, rather than prohibiting a certain type of conduct that is narrowly tailored to prevent child abuse, the statute prevents Mr. Doe and others similarly situated from \"access[ing] what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1732 ;\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , 491 U.S. at 791,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

This, as\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   made clear, is impermissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Further, despite the Commonwealth's repeated attempts through written and oral arguments to allege that KRS \u00a7 17.546 applies only to websites that minors are truly likely to frequent and use for communication [\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 31 at 8; R. 41 at 9-11], the statute as written fails to make that clear. Pre-\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   , the Defendants asked the Court to construe both KRS \u00a7 17.546(2) and KRS \u00a7 17.510 (discussed below) to include only \"gaming and social networking sites\" that \"involve considerable interaction with others, many of whom are minors,\" and to avoid reading the restrictions to include a ban against online banking or shopping websites. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 31 at 8.] And the Court previously expressed concerns that Kentucky's statutory scheme prohibits Mr. Doe from participating in basic online activities such as creating an account on Orvis.com to purchase equipment for fly-fishing. [R. 41 at 9-11.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   noted a similar vagueness problem with the North Carolina statute, explaining that the law \"might well bar access not only to commonplace social media websites but also to websites as varied as Amazon.com, Washingtonpost.com, and Webmd.com.\"\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1736 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1741-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alito, J., concurring).

The statute, accordingly, is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, while Plaintiff Doe's challenge to KRS \u00a7\u00a7 17.510(10) and 7.510(13) falls outside the direct scope of\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court's guidance in that case still guides the Court's analysis. KRS \u00a7 17.510(10)(c) requires a sex offender registrant to report all of his or her \"Internet communication name identities\" to the probation office, and to inform the probation office upon any change or creation of a new \"Internet communication name identit[y].\" This term is not defined, although the statutory provision on the whole reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   If the electronic mail address or any instant messaging, chat, or other Internet communication name identities of any registrant changes, or if the registrant creates or uses any new Internet communication name identities, the registrant shall register the change or new identity, on or before the date of the change or use or creation of the new identity, which the appropriate local probation and parole office in the county in which he or she resides.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   KRS \u00a7 17.510(10)(c). Presumably, these identities are collected by law enforcement to enable the public's use of the search function provided for in KRS \u00a7 17.580(3) and discussed in greater detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Doe argues that this reporting requirement is impermissibly vague, that it serves as an unconstitutional prior restraint on lawful speech, and that it impermissibly chills his and other sex offender registrants' lawful speech. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 27-1 at 15, 23-26.] At oral argument, the Defendants acknowledged that the trend of the case law is against them when it comes to Doe's latter two arguments, particularly in light of the fact that the Commonwealth's reporting requirement is an immediate one. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 41 at 33-34];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Thus, while the Defendants are quick to point out that the statute addressed in\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   did not involve a reporting requirement, the constitutional principles explained in\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   apply to KRS \u00a7 17.510(10)(c) just as they do KRS \u00a7 17.546.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   court could not determine whether the North Carolina statute in question truly applied to only \"commonly understood\" social media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, or whether it also extended to news and online shopping forums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, the Court cannot determine, and, therefore, Mr. Doe cannot be expected to know, what types of \"Internet communication name identities\" he must register with his probation office pursuant to KRS \u00a7 17.510(10)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To its detriment, KRS \u00a7 17.510(10) does not define the \"Internet communication name identities\" it requires sex offenders to register.

But just like in\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   , the statute is not susceptible to such a narrowing construction. It may be true that the General Assembly meant the law to apply only to a sex offender's new Facebook profile, but the law as written might as well apply to usernames created to engage in online dialogue over Amazon.com products of Washingtonpost.com news stories.\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Additionally, the statute fails to explain how, exactly, a sex offender must register a change in his or her identities. At oral argument, the Commonwealth conceded the reporting requirement was an immediate one but was otherwise unable to explain to the Court whether registration of a new identity must be accomplished online, through a phone call, via some sort of written communication, or in person. [R. 41 at 31.] This vagueness is troubling because \"the ambiguities in the statute may lead registered sex offenders either to overreport their activity or underuse the Internet to avoid the difficult questions in understanding what, precisely, they must report.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315216\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/563/#p581\">\n    772 F.3d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, just as KRS \u00a7 17.546(2) violates Doe's constitutional rights, KRS \u00a7\u00a7 17.510(10) and (13) do, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, the Court finds that the constitutional violations brought about by KRS \u00a7 17.546 and KRS \u00a7\u00a7 17.510(10)(c) and (13) are worthy of permanent injunctive relief.

As explained above, Plaintiff Doe has clearly suffered violations of his First Amendment rights as a result of the challenged laws. Further, the four factors for courts to consider before granting a request for a permanent injunction also weigh in Doe's favor. These factors require the Court to find (1) that the Plaintiff has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that an equitable remedy is warranted upon considering the balance of hardships between the parties; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    eBay Inc. v.

While the Commonwealth would presumably be harmed if the enforcement of a\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   law were enjoined, the statutes discussed in this case have already been deemed unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Connection Distrib.

According to the Sixth Circuit, \"a facial challenge to a law's constitutionality is an effort to invalidate the law in each of its applications, to take the law off the books completely.\"\n   <em>\n    Speet v.
