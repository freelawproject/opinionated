These reasons included that the plaintiff had: (1) terminated a subordinate's employment, without notifying superiors or following the requisite process set out in a collective bargaining agreement, Termination Letter at 1; (2) an overall performance in 2014 that \"has not been satisfactory,\" marked by the plaintiff's failure to meet time performance and absenteeism targets, ineffectively holding his division accountable \"for the timely completion of routine assignments to include absenteeism tracking, payroll recordkeeping, and discipline administration,\" as well as \"exhibit[ing] a pattern of inappropriate and unprofessional conduct in your interactions with direct and indirect staff, as well as other WMATA Department staff,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; and, finally, (3) admitted, in response to an inquiry about \"missing\" Montgomery Division petty cash, that he had \"the petty cash in [his] possession,\" which violated WMATA Comptroller Procedures by failing to maintain the petty cash \"in a secure manner during operating hours and locked in a safe during non-operating hours,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Regarding the last reason given for his termination, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit\n   as an attachment to his Amended Complaint, admitting that he did not store the petty cash in the Division's safe because \"no one had access to the combination by which it could be unlocked, as it had not been used in many years,\" leaving him \"to secure the monies in [his] WMATA company vehicle.\" Am. Compl., Attach. 1 (Plaintiff's Affidavit, dated Sept. 22, 2015) (\"Pl.'s Aff.\") \u00b6 1, ECF No. 24-1. He further states that his \"predecessor superintendent did not have a safe in which to secure petty cash,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2, and cites an incident in October 2013 when his predecessor, who was a woman, \"borrowed $200.00 from [ ], another superintendent, and handed it to me,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. The remaining claim at issue in this case, Count III, challenges only one of the three bases for termination-the plaintiff's failure to maintain securely the Montgomery Division's petty cash-alleging that his termination was due to gender discrimination, since his female predecessor also did not utilize a safe to secure the petty cash.

Specifically, he did not have a written statement already prepared when he visited the EEOC office, Pl.'s Depo. at 13:16-14:5; Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 5, and was merely \"interviewed by one of the I believe hearing officers there on site,\" Pl.'s Depo. at 12:11-14;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:16-20 (plaintiff testifying that hearing officer with whom he met was \"female\").
