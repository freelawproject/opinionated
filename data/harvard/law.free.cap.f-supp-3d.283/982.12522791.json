(Dkt. No. 18 at 1-2.) NWEA requests this Court order the agencies to do so.

CZARA provides a separate, but distinct Coastline Nonpoint Pollution Management Program (\"Coastal Nonpoint Program\") to CWA's Nonpoint Program. Its focus is on coastal areas. Any state with a Coastal Zone Management Program must include a Coastal Nonpoint Program. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455b(a)(1). A state's Coastal Nonpoint Program must be approved both by EPA and NOAA, the latter of which does so on behalf of the U.S. Department of Commerce. (Dkt. No. 18 at 6.) Like CWA Section 319's Nonpoint Program, once a state submits an approvable Coastal Nonpoint Program, the state is eligible to receive federal grants under CZMA (\"Coastal Assistance Grants\") to assist it in its implementation. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455b(h)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") allows persons to sue a government agency if harmed by the agency's failure to comply with its statutory mandate.\n   <em>\n    Sackett v.

First, the agencies failed to make a final CZARA approval decision on Washington's Coastal Nonpoint Program (Claim # 1). (Dkt. No. 18 at 27-28.) Next, the agencies failed to withhold required amounts from Washington's\n   CWA Assistance Grants and Coastal Assistance Grants (Claims # 2-3). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.) In addition, the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it approved Washington's 2015 CWA Nonpoint Program update despite clear evidence that the Program did not meet relevant CWA Section 319 requirements (Claim # 4). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.) EPA also acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it determined Washington made satisfactory progress towards its CWA Nonpoint Program implementation schedule and awarded resulting CWA Assistance Grants to Washington in 2015 and 2016 despite clear evidence that such progress had not been made (Claim # 5). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31.) Finally, the agencies failed to engage in required ESA consultation when taking such actions (Claim # 6).

Agencies clearly have a statutory mandate to\n   <em>\n    approve\n   </em>\n   submitted Coastal Nonpoint Programs meeting the applicable criteria. The statute reads as follows: \"Within 6 months after the date of submission by a State ... the [agencies] shall jointly review the program.

The agencies have not determined that \"the program ... meet[s] the requirements of the section.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455b(c)(1). Absent this determination, CZARA is clear. The agencies \"shall withhold\" the required amounts from Washington's CWA Assistance Grants and Coastal Assistance Grants. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455b(c)(3), (4). EPA and NOAA have failed to do so. They have not finally approved Washington's Coastal Nonpoint Program, while awarding upwards of $83 million in Program Assistance Grants to Washington through 2016. (Dkt. No. 18 at 26.) None of the grants were reduced by the required statutory amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On this basis, the agencies have failed to meet their statutory obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court DENIES Defendants' motion to dismiss Claims # 2-3 for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Claim # 4: Approval of Washington's 2015 Update to its CWA Nonpoint Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   EPA originally approved Washington's CWA Nonpoint Program in 1989. (Dkt. No. 18 at 18.) NWEA challenges Washington's 2015 update to its Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.) NWEA asserts that EPA approved the 2015 update even though the updated program did not satisfy program criteria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants counter that an update to a CWA Nonpoint Program is not subject to the program criteria articulated\n   by CWA Section 319. (Dkt.

NWEA challenges the grants made to Washington in 2015 and 2016 based on a lack of progress in implementing its Program. (Dkt. No. 18 at 31.) According to NWEA, Washington did not have sufficient nonpoint pollution control practices in place to protect water quality during those years, and EPA was aware of this deficiency. Therefore, EPA's satisfactory progress determinations were arbitrary and capricious and the grants were unlawful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19, 30-31.) Defendants' have no meaningful rebuttal, other than to rely on an extension of their argument for Claim # 4-that the 2015 update does not present a standard for which EPA can be held accountable for purposes of satisfactory progress determinations. (Dkt. No. 21 at 34.) The Court previously dismissed Defendants' argument for Claim # 4 and, by extension, similarly dismisses the argument for purposes of Claim # 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court DENIES Defendants motion to dismiss claim # 5 for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Claim # 6: Failure to Engage in ESA Section 7 Consultation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   NWEA's final claim is comprised of four subclaims. Each represents a distinct agency action for which NWEA asserts that ESA Section 7 consultation was required but did not occur: (1) EPA's approval of Washington's 2015 update to its CWA Nonpoint Program; (2) EPA's 2015 and 2016 satisfactory progress determinations for Washington's CWA Nonpoint Program; (3) EPA's approval of the full amount of 2015 and 2016 CWA Assistance Grants to Washington; and (4) NOAA's approval of the full amount of Coastal Assistance Grants, despite the lack of an approvable Coastal Nonpoint Program. Defendants' move to dismiss only the second and fourth subclaims. (Dkt. No. 21 at 35-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Regarding the second subclaim, Defendants argue that EPA's 2015 and 2016 satisfactory progress determinations were retrospective assessments of Washington's progress towards the goals articulated in its CWA Nonpoint Program. (Dkt. No. 21 at 38.) As such, Defendants assert that EPA had no discretion when making its satisfactory progress determinations to prospectively benefit listed species. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38.) On this basis, Defendants assert the progress determinations do not meet the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Karuk Tribe of Cal. v.

The second prong of\n   <em>\n    Karuk Tribe's\n   </em>\n   provides that ESA Section 7 consultation is only required when the agency \"had some discretion to influence or change the activity for the benefit of the protected species.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886234\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/1006/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886234\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/1006/\">\n    at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court disagrees with Defendants' position, as it relies upon a false premise that EPA has no discretion in the factors it considers in making its CWA Section 319 progress determinations. In fact, EPA has great discretion in determining how satisfactory progress is measured. It has exercised this discretion, for example, both in the promulgation of related regulations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035.260\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 35.260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - .268, and informal guidance (Dkt.

Furthermore, this discretion must be viewed in light of Washington's CWA Nonpoint Program objectives, which include \"initiatives to [s]upport Salmon Recovery in Washington\" and other measures directly aimed at improving the health of threatened and endangered species. (Dkt. No. 25 at 21.) On this basis, EPA's progress determinations could prospectively benefit listed species.
