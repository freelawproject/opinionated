JONES, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter appears before on the Motion of Western Washington Laborers-Employers Pension Trust for Appointment as Lead Plaintiff and Approval of Selection of Lead and Liaison Counsel (Doc. No. [13] ) and the Motion of Arkansas Teacher Retirement System for Appointment as Lead Plaintiff and Approval of Selection of Counsel (Doc. No. [14] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 establishes procedures governing the appointment of lead plaintiff and lead counsel \"in each private action arising under [the Securities Exchanges Chapter of Title 15] that is brought as a plaintiff class action pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(1). First, the plaintiff who files the initial complaint must publish a notice to the class informing class members of their right to file a motion for appointment as lead plaintiff. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(A). Within sixty days, any member of the purported class may then move the Court to be appointed lead plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After considering\n   the motions, the Court must appoint the plaintiff who is \"most capable of adequately representing the interests of the class members.\" \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The statute creates a presumption that the most adequate plaintiff, 1) \"has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a notice;\" 2) \"in the determination of the court, has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class;\" and 3) \"otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(aa)-(cc). The presumption may be rebutted \"only upon proof by a member of the purported plaintiff class that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff ... will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class[,]\" or \"is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.\" \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Case law also makes clear that \"[t]he PSLRA 'sets up a rebuttable presumption that the plaintiff with the largest stake in the controversy will be the lead plaintiff.' \"\n   <em>\n    Belmont Holdings Corp. v. Suntrust Banks, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 1:09-cv-1185-WSD, 1:09-cv-1310-WSD, 1:09-cv-1459-WSD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203188695\">\n    2009 WL 3188695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D.

The ATRS loss is four times larger than the loss of Western Washington Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because ATRS claims the largest financial stake in the controversy, it is presumed to be the most adequate plaintiff under the PSLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In opposition, Western Washington Trust argues that ATRS' motion should be rejected because appointing ATRS as lead plaintiff would violate the \"[r]estrictions on professional plaintiffs\" provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(vi) ( \"5 -in-3 Provision\").
