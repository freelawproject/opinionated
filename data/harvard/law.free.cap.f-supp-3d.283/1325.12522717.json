In ruling on the parties' competing motions, this Court considers the parties' pleadings and evidence in accordance with the foregoing standards. On the basis of the materials submitted by the parties in connection with Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Rahman's Motion to Dismiss, the Court makes the following findings for the limited purposes of deciding the foregoing motions.\n </attorneys>\n <attorneys id=\"p-13\">\n  This case relates to a former Church's Chicken franchised restaurant located at 7411 Interstate Highway 10 East, Orange, Texas (the \"Restaurant\" or \"Franchised Restaurant\"). In 2007, Plaintiff Global entered into a franchise agreement with Defendant Swati Enterprises, Inc. (\"SEI\") pursuant to which SEI was permitted to operate the Franchised Restaurant as a Church's Chicken for a limited period of time and pursuant to the terms set forth therein (the \"Franchise Agreement\"). Defendant SEI's obligations under the Franchise Agreement were personally guaranteed by Defendants Shujat Swati, Osman Swati and Tahira Swati.\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n  Pursuant to the terms of the Franchise Agreement, SEI is not permitted to sell or transfer the Franchise Agreement without Plaintiff Global's written knowledge and consent. Nevertheless, only two months after the Franchise Agreement was executed, Defendant Osman Swati purportedly sold the Franchised Restaurant to Defendant Rahman without Plaintiffs' knowledge or consent (the \"Sale\"). Rahman never signed the Franchise Agreement. Rahman claims that he never received a copy of the Franchise Agreement in connection with the Sale and that he was unaware of its existence until recently.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-14\">\n  While this Court has not made any findings as to the legitimacy or legal effectiveness of the Sale, Defendants acknowledge that they intended for the Sale to transfer the Franchised Restaurant to Rahman and that thereafter, Rahman performed under the Franchise Agreement as if he were the franchisee and accepted the benefits of the Franchise Agreement as if he were a franchisee. While Rahman never signed the Franchise Agreement or any other similar agreement with Plaintiffs, Rahman, acting in concert with the Swati Defendants, remitted royalties and marketing fees to Plaintiffs, used the Church's Chicken federally registered trademarks, received operational training and support from Plaintiff Global, allowed Plaintiff Global to periodically inspect the Franchised Restaurant, addressed operational deficiencies that were found during inspections, and obtained Plaintiffs' confidential operations manual. Plaintiffs allege that based on representations that had been made by all Defendants throughout the ten-year franchise term, Plaintiffs understood at all times that Rahman was the manager for the Swati Defendants and that SEI remained the franchisee and owner of the Franchised Restaurant.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This Order does not fully adjudicate Rahman's Motion to Dismiss. The Court reserves ruling on Rahman's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Plaintiff Global's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <footnote label=\"2\">\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants Swati Enterprises, Inc., Shujat Swati, Osman Swati and Tahira Swati shall be collectively referred to as the \"Swati Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon the expiration of the Franchise Agreement in May 2017, Defendant Rahman re-branded the Franchised Restaurant as \"Orange Fried Chicken,\" a similar quick-service restaurant specializing in the sale fried chicken. Orange Fried Chicken also uses a logo, marks and other d\u00e9cor that are confusingly similar to the Church's Chicken logo and Marks. Thereafter, Plaintiffs demanded that Defendants cease and desist the use of confusingly similar marks at the former Franchised Restaurant. Plaintiffs also demanded that Defendants cease and desist operating\n   Orange Fried Chicken, which Plaintiffs claim violates the post-expiration non-compete provision in the Franchise Agreement. Upon Defendants refusal to comply with Plaintiffs' demands, Plaintiffs filed this action seeking to enjoin all Defendants from, among other things, continuing to infringe on Plaintiffs' trademarks and continuing to violate the non-compete in the Franchise Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Specifically, the Franchise Agreement provides that upon expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement, the franchisee may not \"for a period of two years, own, maintain, engage in, or have any interest in any restaurant business that specializes in the sale of chicken or has a method of operation or trade dress similar to that employed in the System and that is located within a 25-mile radius of (i) any Franchised Location or (ii) the location of any other Church's Restaurant that is in existence as of the date of the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Swati Defendants do not oppose the injunctive relief that Plaintiffs seek. However, the Swati Defendants claim that they cannot bring the former Franchised Restaurant into compliance with Plaintiffs' demands because they no longer own or control the Restaurant. Rahman, who acknowledges he owns and controls the Restaurant, nevertheless claims that he is not bound by the non-compete and other post-expiration obligations in the Franchise Agreement because he did not sign the Franchise Agreement. Similarly, Rahman asserts in his Motion to Dismiss that as a non-signatory to the Franchise Agreement, the personal jurisdiction and venue selection provisions contained therein do not apply to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and have established (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; (3) that the threatened injury to the Plaintiffs outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the Defendants; and (4) the injunction is not adverse to the public interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonald's Corp. v. Robertson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358793\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/1301/#p1306\">\n    147 F.3d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1306 (11th Cir. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. PLAINTIFFS HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS OF THEIR CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Having determined that the Franchise Agreement's provisions are enforceable, the primary issue before the Court is whether non-signatory Rahman is bound by the obligations in the Franchise Agreement, namely, the non-compete, personal jurisdiction provision and forum selection provision. Based on these circumstances where Defendants failed to disclose the Sale to Plaintiffs or obtain Plaintiffs' approval of the same, and where Rahman, acting in concert with the Swati Defendants, performed under the Franchise Agreement for nearly the entire ten-year term of the Franchise Agreement, it is justified and warranted to extend all terms of the Franchise Agreement to non-signatory Rahman, including the personal jurisdiction provision, forum selection clause, non-compete and other post-expiration obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 65 extends to \"the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2)(C). Even under Rahman's theory that he knew nothing about the Franchise Agreement, Rahman falls within the ambit of Rule 65 as an owner, employee, and someone \"in active\n   concert and participation\" with the Swati Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, while it is true that non-signatories are generally not bound by contracts, \" 'traditional principles of state law' may allow 'a contract to be enforced by or against nonparties to the contract through assumption, piercing the corporate veil, alter ego, incorporation by reference, third party beneficiary theories, waiver and estoppel.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lawson v.

As such, the personal jurisdiction and forum selection clauses in the Franchise Agreement (which provide for both personal jurisdiction over the franchisee and venue in this Court) are likewise binding on Rahman. Notably, Rahman does challenge the enforceability of these provisions. Rather, he merely argues these provisions are not binding on him because he did not sign the Franchise Agreement. This Court disagrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lipcon v.

Here, the evidence shows that Rahman is so closely related to this dispute that it was foreseeable that he would be bound by the Franchise Agreement's personal jurisdiction and forum selection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In addition, because Rahman purposefully availed himself to the right to conduct business with Plaintiffs in Georgia under the Franchise Agreement, he transacted business in Georgia within the context of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-10-91(1). Rahman also had sufficient minimum contacts with Georgia,\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe Co. v.
