No. 14) (\"G4S's Motion\") and Defendants Chuck Brock, Donald S. Zeccardi, Malcolm Burchett, Jr., Tifani A. Grusky, and Michael A. Nail's (the \"Individual Defendants\") Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (Doc. No. 15) (G4S and Individual Defendants collectively \"Defendants\") (collectively the \"Motions\"). Having considered the Motions, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part G4S's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and GRANTS the Individual Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings for the reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Elmer Ray Raynor (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Raynor\") filed this action in Superior Court in Gaston County, North Carolina on February 21, 2017, and Defendants subsequently removed the action to this Court on March 24, 2017. (Doc. No. 1). Defendants answered Plaintiff's Complaint on March 31, 2017. (Doc. No. 7). On June 9, 2017, as required by Court order, Plaintiff filed the Charge of Discrimination (the \"Charge\") that he filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (Doc. Nos. 12, 13). Defendants filed their respective Motions on August 11, 2017. (Doc. Nos. 14, 15). Plaintiff filed his responses on September 4, 2017. (Doc. Nos. 20, 21). Defendants declined to file replies. Accordingly, the Motions are now ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   G4S employed Plaintiff, an African-American male, from on or about July 16, 2001 until G4S terminated Plaintiff on August 26, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 1-1 at 18, 20). Plaintiff received favorable evaluations for his work and had no write-ups of misconduct or infractions in his record. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 20). G4S also employed the Individual Defendants, who were officers, agents, and/or employees of G4S. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 19-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In February 2008, G4S promoted Plaintiff from Manager of Field Support to Regional Manager of Field Support. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 20). Plaintiff alleges that in his position as Regional Manager, he received a lower salary than his predecessor, a white employee with less experience, training, and education, and was required to travel to conduct floor surveys, when other\n   regional field managers were excused. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 21). Further, despite his superior performance, Plaintiff did not receive incentive pay throughout his employment when other white employees did. (Doc. No. 1 at 21-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2014, G4S's Mid-Atlantic Vice-President Malcom Burchett released Plaintiff from his position as Regional Manager on the pretext of a budget cut and demoted Plaintiff to Site Manager at Bank of America Corporate Center. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 22-23). Plaintiff alleges that a less experienced white employee filled his vacated position and assumed his duties but was given a different title, Director of Field Support. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Then, in July 2016, G4S's Director of Administration Tifani Grusky informed Plaintiff that he had no accrued vacation leave when he in fact had three days of unused vacation leave under G4S's policy, practice, and contract with Plaintiff. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 23-24). Soon thereafter, on July 20, 2016, G4S's Secure Solutions General Manager Mike Nail informed Plaintiff that they had no work for him and gave him a Severance Agreement and General Release package that stated his effective termination date as July 18, 2016. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 24). The Severance Agreement and General Release indicated that Plaintiff was terminated for cause. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 24). After several individuals refused to listen to his complaints, on July 21, 2016, Plaintiff sent a written memorandum to G4S's Chief Human Resources Officer and Burchett. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 25). The memorandum cited specific examples of G4S's disparate treatment of Plaintiff, asked questions about the Severance Agreement and General Release, and summarized his favorable work performance. (Doc. No. 1-1 at 25). In August 2016, Burchett informed Plaintiff that the Severance Agreement and General Release had been intended for another employee (Doc. No. 1-1 at 25) but maintained that G4S did not have a work assignment for Plaintiff (Doc. No. 1-1 at 26). Burchett, G4S's Mid-Atlantic Vice-President, however indicated that he would have Plaintiff paid for his vacation leave. (Doc. No. 1 at 25-26). Nevertheless, Plaintiff did not receive payment for his vacation leave and was not considered for a comparable position in the company despite Plaintiff's interest. (Doc. No. 1 at 26-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff reported these discriminatory practices to the Human Resources Department on September 17, 2015 (Doc. No. 1-1 at 27) and filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC on January 11, 2017 (Doc. No. 1-1 at 28; Doc. No. 13-1 at 1). On January 18, 2017, Plaintiff received notice from the EEOC that he could file suit (Doc. No. 1-1 at 28, 69) and initiated this action on February 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) provides that \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial-a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" Fed.

G4S moves to dismiss the complaint against it in its entirety (Doc. No. 14). The Individual Defendants also move to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, but they only brief the dismissal of Plaintiff's claims against them for wrongful discharge, breach of contract, Title VII discrimination claims, and violations of the North Carolina Constitution (Doc. No. 15). Accordingly, the Court only considers the adequacy of the pleadings for the claims against the Individual Defendants of wrongful discharge, breach of contract, Title VII discrimination claims, and violations of the North Carolina Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Charge reflects the filing date of his Charge, January 11, 2017, and the scope of his Charge-race, sex, and age discrimination and retaliation. (Doc. No. 13-1). Liberally construing the Charge, the Court concludes that the scope of the Charge sufficiently covers the claims asserted in this action of discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment. However, some of the allegations in the complaint arise before May 4, 2017, which is 180 days before the filing of the Charge. Plaintiff plead allegations concerning his salary from 2008 to 2014, his release and demotion in September 2014, non-receipt of incentive pay, denial of and non-payment of his vacation leave in July 2016, and his termination in August 2016. Plaintiff's release and demotion, his salary from 2008 to 2014, and at least some of Plaintiff's non-receipt of incentive pay are discrete acts completed by or occurring before May 4, 2016. As a result, discrimination or retaliation claims under Title VII based on these discrete acts are untimely and not actionable. The other alleged discrete discriminatory acts of termination and denial of vacation leave occurred after May 4, 2016 and are timely. Therefore, to the extent Plaintiff's Title VII claims are based on discrete discriminatory or retaliatory acts occurring before May 4, 2016, the Court dismisses them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   G4S also argues that Plaintiff has not demonstrated his qualifications and satisfactory performance, identified a specific similarly-situated comparator outside Plaintiff's protected class, evidenced engagement in a protected activity prior to the filing of his EEOC charge, or plead facts of severe or pervasive conduct. However, at this procedural stage, Plaintiff does not have the burden of production, and these factual issues are more appropriately resolved after discovery at summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swierkiewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108377\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/506/#p510\">\n    534 U.S. at 510-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108377\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/506/#p510\">\n    122 S.Ct. 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For plaintiff to be eligible for punitive damages, \"an employer must at least discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law to be liable in punitive damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Kolstad v.

G4S argues that Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages should be dismissed for not pleading that \"G4S knew it may be acting in violation of Title VII.\" (Doc. No. 14-1 at 18.)
