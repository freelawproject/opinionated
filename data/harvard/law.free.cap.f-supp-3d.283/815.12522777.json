Campbell, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs brought suit against Defendant City of Phoenix, challenging a City ordinance that prohibits pet stores from selling dogs and cats supplied by commercial breeders (\"the Ordinance\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Phoenix City Code \u00a7 8-3.06. Plaintiffs argued that the Ordinance violated the Dormant Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Constitution as well as the Arizona Constitution's prohibition on special laws, and was preempted by state law. Doc. 1. The Court permitted the Humane Society of the United States (\"HSUS\") to intervene. Doc. 37. The Court granted summary judgment to Defendant and HSUS, ruling that the Ordinance did not violate the U.S. or Arizona Constitutions and was not preempted because it did not conflict with state law. Doc. 177.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   While an appeal from this decision was pending before the Ninth Circuit, the Arizona Legislature enacted State Bill 1248. Contrary to the requirements of the Ordinance, the new law specifically allows pet stores to sell dogs and cats obtained from commercial breeders that meet certain requirements. A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1799.10. The law contains an express preemption provision, stating that any local ordinance that imposes stricter requirements on pet dealers \"is preempted.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1799.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In light of this new statute, Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss in the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the statute preempted the Ordinance and mooted this case, and that automatic vacatur of this Court's summary judgment was appropriate. Doc. 209-1 at 2-17. The City and HSUS opposed the motion, arguing the case was not moot because the statute did not preempt the Ordinance under the Arizona Constitution, and that automatic vacatur was not appropriate because Plaintiffs persuaded the Arizona Legislature and Governor to adopt the new statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-97. In response, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to this Court \"for consideration of the effect, if any,\" of the new legislation. Doc 207-1. Thus, the case has been fully remanded to this Court for consideration of the new statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court held a status conference on May 17, 2017. The parties and the Court agreed that the parties would file supplemental memoranda and stipulated facts on the preemption and vacatur issues. The parties have since made these filings. Docs. 216, 217, 218, 221. Plaintiffs' counsel stated at the status conference that they did not need further oral argument. Defense counsel reserved the right to request oral argument, but have not done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 218. After considering the briefs, stipulated facts, and relevant cases, the Court finds that the new statute preempts the Ordinance and that the summary judgment in favor of Defendant and HSUS should be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs, their counsel, and their lobbyists drafted proposed legislation, contacted and met with legislators, and testified before the Arizona Legislature. Doc. 216 \u00b6\u00b6 1-9. Defendant and HSUS countered with a lobbying effort of their own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-15. The Arizona Legislature ultimately enacted the proposed legislation and the Governor signed it into law. Doc. 216-1 at 30-31. The new law took effect on August 6, 2016, as A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 44-1799.10 and 44-1799.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The statute provides that a pet store or dealer \"may not obtain a dog or cat for resale or sell or offer for sale any dog or cat obtained from a person who is required to be licensed by the pet dealer regulations of the United States department of agriculture\" and who either is not currently licensed or has violated various regulations. A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1799.10(A). Thus, if breeders are currently licensed by the Department of Agriculture and have not violated the specified regulations, the statute permits pet stores or dealers to acquire dogs and cats from them. The statute expressly preempts any local law that imposes stricter regulations than the statute or prohibits the sale of a dog or cat \"based on the source from which the animal is obtained if obtained in compliance with \u00a7 44-1799.10.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1799.11. The Ordinance-which provides that pet stores and dealers can only sell animals obtained from shelters or nonprofit rescue organizations-imposes stricter regulations than the statute. Doc. 177 at 7. The parties agree that the statute is designed to preempt the Ordinance. Doc. 209 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This subject matter clearly implicates state interests. For years, Arizona has regulated the health of animals sold by pet stores and dealers ( A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1799.01 ); information such businesses must provide customers regarding the health of the dogs or cats they purchase (\u00a7 44-1799.02); notices that must be posted by pet stores and dealers (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); records such businesses must keep regarding the pets they sell (\u00a7 44-1799.03); conditions for housing animals (\u00a7 44-1799.04); detailed procedures and remedies for customers who purchase unhealthy animals (\u00a7 44-1799.05 to .07); and penalties that can be imposed on pet stores and dealers which violate state laws (\u00a7 44-1799.08). These statutes, which have been in place for 20 years, clearly demonstrate a state interest in regulating pet stores and dealers and the animals they sell. In addition, the new statute specifically states that \"[t]he regulation of pet dealers is a matter of statewide concern,\" A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1799.11, and the Governor's signing statement confirms this interest, Doc. 216-1 at 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Furthermore, the Arizona Supreme Court has held that \"[m]atters involving the police power generally are of statewide concern,\"\n   <em>\n    Brnovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310584\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/588/\">\n    399 P.3d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and courts have repeatedly found that the regulation of domestic animals is an exercise of police power.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Reid v.

In this case, the legislative act is considerably broader than animal homelessness in Phoenix. It concerns the sources of pets acquired by pet stores and dealers throughout the state.
