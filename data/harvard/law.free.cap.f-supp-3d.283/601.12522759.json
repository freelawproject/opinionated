Terry worked as an HSE supervisor for CB &amp; I from February 2016 to May 2016. (Instrument No. 28 at 6). On August 10, 2016, Terry filed an administrative wage claim with the Texas Workforce Commission (\"TWC\") to receive unpaid wages from CB &amp; I pursuant to Chapter 61 of the Texas Labor Code. (Instrument No. 23-1 at 7). On November 18, 2016, the TWC ordered CB &amp; I to pay Terry $6,990.10 in unpaid wages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 7, 2017, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, in which they assert that Terry's FLSA overtime claim is barred by collateral estoppel because he already secured relief before the TWC. (Instrument No. 23). On June 27, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint that added named Plaintiffs Tony Babb, Jason Fowlkes, Robert McDaniel, and Matthew Clippard. (Instrument No. 28). Plaintiff Tony Babb (\"Babb\") also brought an overtime claim under the Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act (\"PMWA\") on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated CB &amp; I employees in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 28, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a response in opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment, in which they claim that collateral estoppel does not apply because the TWC lacks jurisdiction to consider FLSA claims. (Instrument No. 29 at 5). On July 6, 2017, Defendants filed a motion to strike Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. (Instrument No. 31). That same day, Defendants submitted a reply in support of their motion for summary judgment. (Instrument No. 32). Plaintiffs filed a response in opposition to Defendants' motion to strike on July 27, 2017, (Instrument No. 38), and Defendants submitted a reply in support of their motion to strike on August 1, 2017. (Instrument No. 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 2, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion for conditional class certification of \"all field, non-manual exempt workers\" employed by Defendants during the last three years. (Instrument No. 52 at 5). Defendants then moved for a protective order to stay the response deadline until the Court rules on the motion for summary judgment and the motion to strike. (Instrument No. 58). On November 9, 2017, the Court granted Defendants' motion for a protective order and granted Defendants five days from the date of this Order to file a response to the motion for conditional class certification.

Aug. 15, 2017) (Rosenthal, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The present case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Thakkar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   because Plaintiff Terry prevailed before the TWC. In\n   <em>\n    Thakkar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs were estopped from proceeding in federal court because the TWC made a finding of fact that they were paid for all hours worked.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203492315\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202996727\">\n    2009 WL 2996727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Here, the TWC made a finding of fact that Plaintiff Terry was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   compensated for all hours worked without specifically addressing which wages were owed for overtime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Instrument No. 23-3 at 50). Moreover, the TWC did not address Plaintiff's FLSA claim for liquidated damages, which could not have been litigated before the TWC.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202996727\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to the FLSA, an employer who fails to pay overtime may be liable not only for unpaid wages but also for \"an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). A court may decline to award such damages if it concludes that the employer acted in \"good faith\" and had \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that its actions complied with the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    Singer v. City of Waco, Tex.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160858\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/813/#p822\">\n    324 F.3d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 822-23 (5th Cir. 2003). However, there is a \"substantial burden\" on the employer to demonstrate good faith and a reasonable belief that its actions were not in violation of the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160858\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/813/#p822\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff Terry should be estopped from seeking liquidated damages because the TWC did not assess a penalty against Defendant CBI Services, Inc. for acting in bad faith. (Instrument No. 23-1 at 13). However, the TPL imposes a different legal standard for the administrative penalty of \"bad faith\" than the liquidated damages provision of the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Lab. Code \u00a7 61.053. Thus, the fact that the TWC did not impose an administrative penalty on Defendant CBI Services, Inc. does not collaterally estop Plaintiff Terry from pursuing the FLSA remedy for liquidated damages in federal court. Although the wages that the TWC ordered Defendants to pay Plaintiff Terry may be factored into any future damages calculations for his FLSA claim, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar Plaintiff Terry from bringing this claim to secure all remedies to which he is entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   on Plaintiff Terry's claim for overtime wages under the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint is premised on the argument that \"a party may not amend its complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 to create jurisdiction where none previously existed, even by adding new causes of action or new parties.\" (Instrument No. 31 at 2) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Jamison v. McKesson Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715809\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/322/#p328\">\n    649 F.3d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328 (5th Cir. 2011) ). The Motion presupposes that Plaintiff Terry's overtime claims \"were barred by issue preclusion and were moot\" and that new claims and parties were added to the lawsuit only in \"an obvious attempt to avoid Defendant's argument ... that this Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this lawsuit.\" (Instrument No. 31 at 2-4). Besides claiming that Plaintiff Terry's overtime claim was barred by collateral estoppel, Defendants do not state any reason for why Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint should be stricken\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715809\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/322/#p328\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because this Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff Terry's claim and Defendants do not raise any additional arguments, Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the foregoing reasons,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED. (Instrument No. 23). IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.
