Both Parties moved for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 25, 46.) Allina also moved to exclude the testimony of Hustvet's expert witness. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 38.) For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Hustvet's motion and grants summary judgment in Allina's favor on all claims.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hustvet worked for Courage Center, out of its Golden Valley campus, as an Independent Living Specialist (\"ILS\") for several years. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 6, Dkt. No. 1.) In May 2013, Courage Center announced it would be merging with Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute, part of Allina, on June 1, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) As a condition of continued employment, Allina required all ILSs to complete a health screen, which, among other things, included\n   testing for immunity to certain communicable diseases and a \"Respirator Medical Evaluation\" (\"RME\"). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) The RME, which is based on OSHA standard forms, asked questions about potential health conditions directed at evaluating safe respirator fit and use. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Testing revealed that Hustvet had immunity to mumps, measles, and varicella (chickenpox ), but that she lacked immunity to rubella. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 29.) Hustvet did not complete the RME and instead wrote \"N.A.\" on the form because her supervisor told Hustvet that the form did not pertain to her position as an ILS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition of Janice Hustvet (\"Hustvet Dep.\") 185:17-23, Dkt. No. 66.) Allina informed Hustvet that she would need to submit a full RME and develop immunity to rubella by taking a Mumps, Measles, Rubella (\"MMR\") vaccine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-13 at 3-4.) Hustvet did not comply with either request, but later stated she was willing to complete the RME, despite her feeling that it was invasive and unnecessary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hustvet Dep. 66:10-16, 118:3-6, 140:2-5, 170:10-15, 186:15-25, 214:6-9 216:25-2; Deposition of Heather Lindblom (\"Lindblom Dep.\") 184:13-19, Dkt. No. 28-2; Dkt. No. 28-13 at 3.) However, Hustvet never completed the RME, nor did she develop immunity to rubella. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-13 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hustvet told Allina that she was concerned about taking the MMR vaccine because her \"health is of the utmost concern\" and because she \"had severe cases of mumps and measles-the MM part of the MMR.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) She also stated that she has \"many allergies and chemical sensitivities,\" such that she needed to limit her \"exposure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hustvet Dep. 76:7-77:5, 82:9-21.) Based on these factors, she concluded that \"[i]t would be unwise and unhealthy to expose [her]self to those unneeded parts of the vaccine.\" (Dkt. No. 28-13 at 3.) She offered to take a rubella-only vaccine instead of the MMR vaccine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) However, a rubella-only vaccine was not available in the U.S. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1; Dkt. No. 28-19 at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Allina's immunization policy applies to all employees who have patient or client contact, regardless of location or job title. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 28-9 at 1-2, 28-13 at 4.) The policy aligns with the CDC's recommendation that all healthcare professionals\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with direct patient contact have immunity to mumps, measles, and rubella. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-19 at 4, 20.) In her position as an ILS, Hustvet worked one-on-one with clients in their homes, helping them with everyday chores and skills learning. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hustvet Dep. 71:2-25.) Her clients were fragile and immuno-compromised, and they received regular assistance and medical care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:9-20; 74:8-11.) Hustvet accompanied clients to doctors' appointments. (Deposition of Cynthia Guddal (\"Guddal Dep.\") 13:17-24, Dkt. No. 28-3.) She also periodically visited the Courage Center's Golden Valley campus for meetings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hustvet Dep. 159:12-23.) That campus includes inpatient rehabilitation clinics and other fitness facilities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lindblom Dep. 15:16-24, 25:17-26:18.) When attending meetings in the building, Hustvet came into close proximity with rehabilitation clinics and their patients. (Guddal Dep. 21:20-22:24, 24:14-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 9, 2013, Allina terminated Hustvet's employment due to her failure to comply with immunity requirements and to complete the RME. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-13 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Disability Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hustvet brings disability discrimination claims under the ADA and MHRA against Allina for utilizing discriminatory qualification standards, not making reasonable accommodations, and denying employment on the basis of disability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 36-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Claims for disability discrimination in violation of the ADA or MHRA are analyzed under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dovenmuehler v.

Instead, Hustvet asserts that she is actually disabled, as shown by her impairments and/or her record of impairments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"D.S.J. Pl. Br.\") 10-11, 34-37, Dkt. No. 77; Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of Her Motion for Summary Judgment (\"P.S.J. Pl. Br.\") 8-9, Dkt. No. 61.) She argues that her conditions limited her performance of major life activities (such as breathing, eating, caring for oneself, cleaning, and socializing) and major bodily functions (including the functioning of her immune, digestive, neurological, respiratory, circulatory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.S.J. Pl. Br. 11, 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There is insufficient evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Hustvet's conditions substantially limit her ability to perform major life activities. For example, the record shows that Hustvet has garden-variety allergies to various foods, grass, pets, trees, etc. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hustvet Dep. 82:25-86:14.) She has \"typical\" allergic reactions, such as \"itchy runny eyes and nose.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:6-9.) She has never been prescribed an Epi-Pen. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:18-19.) She is generally able to breath, eat, care for herself, clean, and socialize, but sometimes she must avoid certain fragrances and chemicals by relocating herself farther away from the source of an offending emanation. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 165:12-167:11.) She has never been hospitalized due to any allergic or chemical reactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103:16-104:2, 176:10-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In her deposition, Hustvet claimed that her chemical sensitivities and allergies derive from an immune system disability. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 109:5-19.) However, the record does not show that any doctor has diagnosed Hustvet with an immune system disability. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 110:20-23; Deposition of Dr. Tammy Chiesa (\"Chiesa Dep.\") 17:14-16, 62:13-16, Dkt. No. 71; Dkt. No. 32.) Allergies and sensitivities may be indicative of an immune system disorder, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Chiesa Dep. 74:11-75:3), but Hustvet has not shown that these conditions substantially impaired the functioning of her immune system,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Land\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381319\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/423/#p425\">\n    164 F.3d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that a peanut allergy did not render the plaintiff disabled);\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

A reasonable jury could not find that Hustvet is disabled on the basis of her allergies and chemical sensitivities or because she has an immune system disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The closest Hustvet comes to demonstrating the existence of a disability is her assertion that she suffers from a seizure disorder. The record indicates that Hustvet has a remote history of seizures. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Chiesa Dep. 49:4-8; Dkt. Nos. 32 at 3, 30, 50 at 1, 51 at 1, 60 at 1.) This may constitute a substantial limitation on the functioning of the neurological system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(iii) (stating that epilepsy substantially limits neurological function). But the record does not sufficiently disclose how her seizures substantially limit\n   her ability to perform major life activities. Hustvet manages her seizures with a prescription medication,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but when the seizures occur, the record only shows that they cause Hustvet to feel disoriented and as if she is \"fading away\" for one to two minutes (Dkt. No. 28-23 at 2.) She does not lose consciousness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The record does not otherwise reveal the extent, frequency, or severity of her seizures. Given this lack of evidence, Hustvet fails to meet her burden of showing she is disabled due to conditions that substantially limit her performance of major life activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brunke v.

The only information Hustvet provided to Allina for why she did not want to develop immunity to rubella by taking the MMR vaccine was that she has allergies, chemical sensitivities, and a past history of severe cases of mumps and measles. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-13; Hustvet Dep. 76:3-77:5, 82:9-21.) None of these conditions is a contraindication or precaution\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the MMR vaccine, such that one condition would imply the presence of disability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 74-3 at 10-11, 74-7 at 1-2, 6.)

And the record shows that Allina representatives did not consider Hustvet to be seeking an accommodation for or suffering from a disability.

Severe allergies to components of the MMR vaccine, for example, are contraindications for the vaccine, but there is no evidence that Hustvet has severe allergies to any of the vaccine's components. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 74-3 at 10, 74-7 at 6.) Sensitivities to chemicals or a past history of severe cases of the underlying diseases included in the vaccine are not listed as contraindications or precautions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202080236\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Although Hustvet previously had negative reactions to certain vaccines, such as the flu vaccine (on one occasion) and the Tetanus, Diphteria, Pertussis (\"Tdap\") vaccine, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hustvet Dep. 151:23-152:8; Dkt. No. 32 at 1, 3, 10), no physician ever told Hustvet prior to her termination that she should not take the MMR vaccine, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hustvet Dep. 86:19-22, 88:4-7, 106:14-107:16, 171:11-17). Rather, Hustvet relied on her own uninformed intuitions and considered\n   it \"common knowledge\" that the injection of unnecessary chemicals and vaccines would compromise her health, especially because she was already \"chemically sensitive.\" (Dkt. No. 28-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Hustvet says she was also concerned that the MMR vaccine would threaten her health because it contained live (attenuated) viruses, but she does not know if she has ever had a negative reaction to a vaccine because it contained live viruses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hustvet Dep. 164:11-13, 170:20-171:10.) Hustvet received other live virus vaccinations (e.g., Zoster )\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   throughout her life and in the years leading up to her termination without incident. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. Nos. 32 at 1, 5, 34 at 1.) She was also willing to take a rubella-only vaccine, but such a vaccine, like the MMR vaccine, presumably contains a live virus. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 28-13 at 2, 28-19 at 41.) And although live virus vaccines, like the MMR vaccine, carry an elevated seizure risk, a history of seizures is not an absolute contraindication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Chiesa Dep. 54:10-55:13.) Personal or family history of seizures is a precaution for the MMR\n   <em>\n    V\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   vaccine, but not the MMR vaccine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 74-3 at 10, 74-7 at 2.) Though the live virus in the MMR vaccine presents a \"very small, but possible risk, of having a seizure,\" the CDC does not consider a past history of seizures to be a precaution or contraindication for the vaccine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chiesa Dep. 54:6-21; Dkt. Nos. 74-3 at 10-11, 74-7 at 1-2, 6.) Therefore, no reasonable jury could find a causal connection between Hustvet's claimed limitations and her concerns about taking the MMR vaccine as a safe avenue to develop immunity to rubella.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Lastly, Hustvet claims that Allina's policy requiring immunity to certain diseases is a per se violation of the ADA and MHRA because it is similar to \"100% healed\" policies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.S.J. Pl. Br. 32-33.) \"All courts that have examined the question ... agree that a 100% rule is impermissible as to a disabled person.\"\n   <em>\n    Henderson v.

However, per se violations in the form of 100% healed policies involve the context of workplace injury and subsequent return-to-work requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGregor v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585712\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/187/1113/#p1116\">\n    187 F.3d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1116 (9th Cir. 1999) (\"A '100% healed' or 'fully healed' policy discriminates against qualified individuals with disabilities because such a policy permits employers to substitute a determination of whether a qualified individual is '100% healed' from their injury for the required individual assessment whether the qualified individual is able to perform the essential functions of ... her job either with or without accommodation.\"). Hustvet's case does not concern workplace injury or reinstatement, but rather a policy that applied to all similarly situated employees. As such, the existence of the policy was not a per se violation of the ADA or MHRA akin to a 100% healed\n   policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

There is no genuine dispute of material fact, based on the record, that Hustvet is not disabled within the meaning of the ADA or MHRA. There is also no genuine dispute of material fact that there is no causal connection between Allina's knowledge of any of Hustvet's proffered limitations and its decision to terminate Hustvet for failure to develop immunity to rubella, nor a causal connection between Hustvet's claimed limitations and any failure to accommodate based on her concerns about taking the MMR vaccine. Because Hustvet fails to make out a prima facie case of discrimination, her discrimination claims fail as a matter of law, and Allina is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Unlawful Inquiries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The ADA and MHRA prohibit, in addition to discrimination, certain medical inquiries and examinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; Minn.

Although Allina cited the incomplete RME, in addition to Hustvet's failure to develop immunity to rubella by taking the MMR vaccine, as a reason for termination, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-13 at 1), the record clearly shows that Hustvet was willing to complete the RME and would have completed it had Allina not required her to develop immunity to rubella. Due to her willingness to complete the RME, her failure to complete it did not cause her termination. Because Hustvet did not suffer any tangible injury as a result of not completing the RME-but, rather, because she did not develop immunity to rubella-her unlawful inquiry claims fail, and Allina is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.S.J. Pl. Br. 30; P.S.J. Pl. Br. 35-36.) She claims that her protected conduct entails: refusal to complete the RME and refusal to take the MMR vaccine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.S.J. Pl. Br. 30; P.S.J. Pl. Br. 35-36.) Allina argues that there is no evidence demonstrating a link between statutorily protected conduct and termination; Allina only fired Hustvet for failure to meet job requirements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Reply Memorandum in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment (\"D.S.J. Def. Reply Br.\") 10, Dkt. No. 79; Defendant's Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"P.S.J. Def. Br.\") 41-42, Dkt. No. 72.) Allina also points out that Hustvet was willing to complete the RME and otherwise develop immunity to rubella. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.S.J. Def. Reply Br. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, as discussed above, Hustvet cannot claim that her failure to complete the RME is protected conduct because she was willing to complete the RME so long as she did not have to develop immunity to rubella by taking the MMR vaccine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.B. Even if it was protected conduct, the conduct did not cause her termination for the same reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, Hustvet cannot claim that refusal to take the MMR vaccine was protected conduct on the basis that the MMR vaccine was an impermissible job requirement because taking the MMR vaccine was not a job requirement. Even though Allina representatives may have spoken as if taking the MMR vaccine was a requirement, Allina only required Hustvet to have immunity to certain diseases, such as rubella. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-13.) Hustvet did not have immunity to rubella, so Allina requested that she take the MMR vaccine because the vaccine is a safe way to develop that immunity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 28-13, 29;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28-19 at 14, 17, 20 (noting that the MMR vaccine has an \"excellent safety profile\").) If Hustvet would have had immunity to rubella, Allina would not have asked her to take the MMR vaccine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lindblom Dep. 181:25-182:3; Dkt. No. 29.) Thus, taking the MMR vaccine was not a job requirement. The record does not show that Hustvet opposed the immunity-to-rubella requirement.
