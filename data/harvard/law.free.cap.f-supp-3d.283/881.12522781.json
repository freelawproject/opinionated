INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This wage-and-hour class action was filed by Plaintiff Bill Taylor against Defendants Cox Communications California, LLC and Cox Communications, Inc. (together, \"Defendants\") in Santa Barbara Superior Court in 2012. (Dkt. 1-3 [\"FAC\"].) Most of the litigation proceeded in state court and, on March 4, 2016, the state court granted Plaintiff's motion for class certification. (Dkt. 10-6.) Shortly after, on March 21, 2016, Defendants removed the case to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In his FAC, Plaintiff alleges causes of action for violations of a number of sections of the California Labor Code, as well as unfair business practices under California Unfair Competition Law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   FAC.) Essentially, Plaintiff argues that Cox systematically underpaid its field technicians-employees who travel to customers' residences to install and repair television and internet services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The certified class that Plaintiff represents is a class of Defendants' field technicians who participated in a program called \"Home Start.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Home Start program allows field technicians to keep their company vehicles at home-as opposed to the company's depot. At the beginning of each work day, a Home Start participant clocks in remotely from home and drives directly\n   to the location of the first work assignment, instead of checking in at a company facility. At the end of each work day, the Home Start participant commutes home from the last work assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The state court certified four class claims arising out of California state law. (Dkt. 10-6 Ex. 1 at 1.) The primary claim is that Defendants failed to compensate Home Start participants for time commuting home at the end of each work day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The remaining claims are derivative claims for wage statements, waiting time penalties, and unfair competition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the certified claims, (Dkt. 40), and Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment, (Dkt. 39). For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion is DENIED and Defendants' motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following facts are not in dispute. Defendants provide telephone, internet, and video services to consumers and businesses. (Dkt. 43 [Defs.' Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, hereinafter \"Defs.' SUF\"] 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 47-2 [Pl.'s Opp'n to Defs.' SUF].) The central duty of Defendants' field technicians, who are hourly employees, is to travel to people's homes, in company vehicles, and install or repair Defendants' products or services. (Defs.' SUF 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff was hired as a field technician in Defendants' Santa Barbara office in 2005. (Defs.' SUF 5.) At that time, field technicians were not permitted to take their company vehicles home. (Defs.' SUF 6.) Instead, Plaintiff would drive his personal vehicle to the company's depot each morning, clock in, and then begin using his assigned company vehicle, which had been parked overnight at the depot. (Defs.' SUF 7.) After completing his last assignment for the day, Plaintiff would drive the company vehicle to the depot, clock out, and then commute home in his personal vehicle. (Defs.' SUF 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At some point after Plaintiff was hired, Defendants initiated the Home Start program. (Defs.' SUF 10; Dkt. 47-2.) Home Start participants, as opposed to \"Office Start\" participants who keep their company vehicles at the company depot overnight, are permitted to take the company vehicle to and from their homes. (Dkt. 44 [Pl.'s Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, hereinafter \"Pl.'s SUF\"] 7.) Plaintiff signed a form electing to participate in the Home Start program on September 28, 2009. (Defs.' SUF 16; Dkt. 39-4 Ex. B-10.) Approximately 70 to 80% of Plaintiff's fellow field technicians in the Santa Barbara office also opted to participate in the Home Start program. (Defs.' SUF 13.) On June 23, 2010, Plaintiff signed a form titled the \"Home Start Selection Option Statement.\" (Defs.' SUF 19; Dkt. 39-4 Ex. B-11.) The form included the following statement: \"As Home Start is an optional program, any Technician who is part of the Home Start program may opt out of the program for any reason by simply notifying his/her supervisor.\" (Defs.' SUF 20; Dkt. 39-4 Ex. B-11.) Plaintiff testified at his deposition that he agreed with this statement when he signed the form. (Dkt. 39-4 Ex. B [Deposition of Bill Taylor] 89:4-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the Home Start program, a work shift begins for a field technician when he or she leaves home and starts commuting to the first work site. (Pl.'s SUF 11.) In other words, the field technician is paid for time traveling from home to the location of the first assignment. (Defs.' SUF 18.) But, the time spent commuting home from the last assignment of the day is treated as unpaid commuting time. (Defs.' SUF 12, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   There are a number of other policies imposed by the Home Start program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Field technicians are allowed to visit the company depot once a week to load their assigned company vehicles with all the equipment and tools necessary to perform that week's work. (Pl.'s SUF 9.) They must then travel with the tools and equipment, and are responsible for safeguarding both the vehicle and its contents. (Pl.'s SUF 13.) While in the company vehicles, field technicians may not engage in personal business, carry passengers, or use their cell phones. (Pl.'s SUF 18.) Further, field technicians may not make any stops on their commute home-even fuel stops are prohibited and must be made earlier in the day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These policies are applied to all field technicians working in California under the Home Start program. (Pl.'s SUF 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants argue in their motion that they are entitled to summary judgment on all of the certified claims because they are based on the false premise that the time field technicians spend commuting home in company vehicles is compensable work time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 39 [Defs.' Motion for Summary Judgment] at 2.) Defendants further argue that the claims for accurate wage statements, waiting time penalties, and unfair competition fail for the same reason because they are derivative of the claim for failure to pay wages for commute time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff argues in his motion that the commuting time should be considered compensable work time under California law and requests a ruling that Defendants must pay class members for this time. (Dkt. 40-1 [Pl.'s Opening Brief, hereinafter \"Pl.'s Br.\"] at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court may grant summary judgment on \"each claim or defense-or the part of each claim or defense-on which summary judgment is sought.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

In contrast, where the nonmovant will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the moving party may discharge its burden of production by either (1) negating an essential element of the opposing party's claim or defense,\n   <em>\n    Adickes v.

A party opposing summary judgment must support its assertion that a\n   material fact is genuinely disputed by (i) citing to materials in the record, (ii) showing the moving party's materials are inadequate to establish an absence of genuine dispute, or (iii) showing that the moving party lacks admissible evidence to support its factual position. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A)-(B). The opposing party may also object to the material cited by the movant on the basis that it \"cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).

Plaintiff cannot prevail on this prong because it is undisputed that Home\n   Start participants are not required to commute in Defendants' vehicles. As discussed above, Defendants have presented evidence showing that the Home Start program was an optional program for Defendants' field technicians. Not all field technicians participated in the program-only 70 to 80% of the technicians working in the Santa Barbara office with Plaintiff opted into the Home Start program. Further, Plaintiff himself admitted that he signed a form on June 23, 2010, titled the \"Home Start Selection Option Statement.\" The form included the following unambiguous statement: \"As Home Start is an optional program, any Technician who is part of the Home Start program may opt out of the program for any reason by simply notifying his/her supervisor.\" Plaintiff testified at his deposition that he agreed with the statement when he signed the form. Because Home Start is an optional program, field technicians could decide, even after starting the program, not to participate and instead commute in their personal vehicles to and from the company depot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute the facts showing that the Home Start program was optional. Yet, Plaintiff argues that there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether the Home Start program was optional. (Dkt. 47 [Pl.'s Opposition to Defs.' Motion, hereinafter \"Pl.'s Opp'n\"] at 9.) In support of this argument, Plaintiff takes issue with a number of declarations that Defendants have submitted from Defendants' field technicians. Defendants have submitted 48 declarations from field technicians, some who participate in the Home Start program and others who do not. (Dkt. 39-2 [Defs.' Compendium of Declarations].) Each declarant indicates that he or she understands the Home Start program to be voluntary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff attempts to dispute this evidence. Plaintiff argues that the manner in which a field technician elects to participate in the Home Start program is by checking a box on the \"Home Start Selection Option Statement\" form, yet 42 of the 48 declarations do not attach the form. (Dkt. 47-2 at 2-3.) Plaintiff also argues that in Plaintiff's own form and one of the declarant's forms, the correct box was not checked off. (Dkt. 47-2 at 3.) Finally, Plaintiff argues that a field technician supervisor testified in his deposition that he does not confirm if any field technician checked the correct box before that technician begins the Home Start program. (Dkt. 47-2 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments do not raise a genuine issue of material fact. The field technicians who have submitted declarations state that they understand the Home Start program is voluntary. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt 39-2 at Declaration of Jose Aceves \u00b6\u00b6 4-6 (\"Since June 2010 (when Home Start started), I have voluntarily chosen using the option of Cox's Home Start program... I have always understood that I can opt out of the Home Start program at any time simply by notifying my manager and then leaving the truck that night with Cox.\").) It is irrelevant that some declarants did not attach their \"Home Start Selection Option Statement\" form, that two field technicians did not check off the \"right\" box on the form, and that a supervisor does not check these forms. Such facts have no bearing on whether a field technician can decline to participate in the Home Start program and instead commute to and from work in a personal vehicle. Because there is no genuine dispute of material fact that the Home Start program is optional, no reasonable juror could find that class members were \"subject to the control\" of Defendants on their commutes home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"Suffered or Permitted to Work\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff argues that field technicians are also \"suffered or permitted to work\" on their commutes home such that the commutes constitute \"hours worked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Pl.'s Br. at 15-21.)

There is no dispute of fact that field technicians on the Home Start program visit the company's offices once per week to pick up the equipment and tools necessary to perform the week's work. They then transport the equipment and tools in the company vehicles throughout the entire week, including from the last assignment of each work day to the technician's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff's theory been rejected by many courts construing the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Portal-to-Portal Act.

The plaintiffs there were technicians employed by Charter, a cable company, who sought compensation under the FLSA and Portal-to-Portal Act for time they spent commuting in Charter-provided vehicles. The court noted that, absent a contract or custom of compensation, commuting is presumptively noncompensable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3926523\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/950/1038/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1049 (citing\n   <em>\n    Rutti v.
