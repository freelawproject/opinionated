Ms. Lomma committed suicide in May of 2009 and Defendants have denied\n   payment of full death benefits based on a suicide exclusion in the Replacement Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action on November 2, 2016, in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County. The complaint (\"Complaint\") asserts five causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) promissory estoppel; (4) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (5) statutory bad faith pursuant to 42 Pa. C. S. A. \u00a7 8371.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 1-4). Defendants removed the action to this Court on December 2, 2016, (Doc. 1), and promptly moved to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety on December 9, 2016. (Doc. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint and the exhibits attached thereto allege the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs, Nicholas Lomma and J. L., are or were minors residing in Scranton Pennsylvania and are the surviving children of Ms. Lomma. (Doc. 1-4, at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). Anthony Lomma (\"Mr. Lomma\") is the natural parent of Nicholas Lomma and J. L and is the surviving former husband of Ms. Lomma and is also J. L.'s guardian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Defendants are Ohio corporations with registered addresses in Cincinnati, Ohio and are licensed to sell insurance in Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In September 1986, Ms. Lomma applied for, and was issued, a life insurance policy (the \"Original Policy\") by Pennsylvania National Life Insurance Company with a coverage amount of $25, 000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). The Original Policy contained a suicide exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the facts surrounding Defendants' purchase of the Original Policy from Pennsylvania National Life Insurance Company are not entirely clear, Plaintiffs allege Defendants \"purchased or otherwise acquired the Original Policy from Pennsylvania National Life Insurance Company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 4, 1995, Ms. Lomma applied to increase the amount of coverage under the Original Policy from $25, 000 to $100, 000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8). In order to do so, she executed a \"Request For Universal Life Policy Change\" with Defendants. (Doc. 1-4 at 30-32). Ten days later Defendants informed Ms. Lomma that \"[u]pon written request ... the stated amount is hereby increased from $25, 000 to $100,000 effective December 4, 1995.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). The Original Policy was set to expire on September 4, 2028.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Lomma filed an application for a new life insurance policy with Defendants with a coverage amount of $100, 000 on\n   June 6, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 1-4 at 33-49). On the application, a box is checked indicating that the \"proposed policy\" would \"replace or cause change in any existing policy.\" (Doc. 1-4 at 35). It identified the \"existing policy\" that the \"proposed policy\" would replace as \"Ohio National,\" \"Universal,\" \"$100,000,\" and again a box is checked indicating that the existing policy will \"be replaced.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Written on the application was that the \"replacement date\" would be \"upon issue of this policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 15, 2007, Defendants issued the Replacement Policy to Ms. Lomma with a benefit value of $100,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Both the amount of insurance coverage and the beneficiaries are identical to those under the Original Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Replacement Policy identifies the \"Contract Date\" as August 10, 2007, and the \"Issue Date\" as August 15, 2007. (Doc. 1-4 at 51). It also contains a definition of \"Contract Months and Years,\" and states: \"[t]his contract takes effect on the contract date shown on page 3. Contract months and years are marked from the contract date. The first day of the contract year is the contract date and its anniversaries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Replacement Policy, like the Original Policy, contains a suicide exclusion. The two exclusions, however, do not contain the same language. The suicide exclusion in the Replacement Policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If the insured dies by suicide while sane or insane or by intentional self-destruction while insane, we will not pay any death proceed payable on amounts of insurance which have been in effect for less than 2 years. If the suicide or intentional self-destruction is within the first 2 contract years, we will pay as death proceeds the premiums you paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Doc. 1-4 at 62). Although the Replacement Policy defines the term \"contract years,\" it does not contain a definition for \"amounts or insurance\" and does not provide guidance for determinations of whether those \"amounts of insurance\" have or have not \"been in effect for less than 2 years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Lomma committed suicide on May 24, 2009. (Doc. 1-4 at \u00b6 15). At the time of her death she had timely paid all premiums due under both the Original Policy and the Replacement Policy and no premiums were due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). Shortly after her death, Mr. Lomma filed a claim for death benefits under the Replacement Policy on behalf of Nicholas Lomma and J.L., requesting the $100,000 full death benefit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). On August 31, 2009, Defendants' informed Mr. Lomma that they were denying the claim \"on the grounds that Ms. Lomma's suicide violated the provisions of the policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Specifically, Defendants wrote that \"[b]ased on the information we have received and in accordance with\" the suicide exclusion in the Replacement Policy, \"the death proceeds for death due to 'Suicide' within the first two contract years is a refund of\n   premiums paid.\" (Doc. 1-4 at 69). Enclosed with the letter were two checks each in the amount of $144. 27 (totaling $288. 54) representing the premiums Ms. Lomma paid on the Replacement Policy plus 4. 5% interest.

Second, Plaintiffs argue that the facts alleged in the Complaint and the totality of circumstances plausibly demonstrate that\n   Ms. Lomma had a reasonable expectation of coverage. In either case, because Defendants are relying on affirmative defenses to defeat Count I, it is Plaintiffs' position that Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion must be denied.

Defendants' Motion Must Be Denied Because The Suicide Exclusion Is Ambiguous And, Even If The Suicide Exclusion Was Unambiguous, Plaintiffs Have Alleged Sufficient Facts Demonstrating That Ms. Lomma Had A Reasonable Expectation Of Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The parties propose two different interpretations of the Replacement Policy's suicide exclusion. The suicide exclusion consists of two sentences. The first sentence provides: \"[i]f the insured dies by suicide while sane or insane or by intentional self-destruction while insane, we will not pay any death proceed payable on amounts of insurance which have been in effect for less than 2 years.\" (Doc. 1-4 at 62). The second sentence, in turn, states: \"[i]f the suicide or intentional self-destruction is within the first 2 contract years, we will pay as death proceeds the premiums you paid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants principally rely on the second sentence of the suicide exclusion in support of their motion. They claim the second sentence is clear and unambiguous and unequivocally requires dismissal of Count I. The second sentence of the suicide exclusion provides that in the event\n   the insured commits suicide within the first two contract years, as explicitly defined in the Replacement Policy, Defendants will not pay the full death benefits due under the Replacement Policy. Instead, Defendants will only pay death benefits representing the premiums paid by the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The first sentence of the suicide exclusion is less clear. Unlike the term \"contract years\" in the second sentence, which is explicitly defined in the Replacement Policy, key terms in the first sentence of the suicide exclusion are not defined. The Replacement Policy neither defines \"amounts of insurance\" nor does it use a defined term like \"contract years\" to indicate whether those \"amounts of insurance\", which Defendants will not pay in the event of suicide, have or have not \"been in effect for less than 2 years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs thus take the position that the first sentence renders the entire suicide exclusion ambiguous and, under Pennsylvania law, ambiguities in an instance policy must be interpreted against the insurer. They also claim that, because Ms. Lomma maintained $100,000 in life insurance coverage with Defendants since 1995, she had a reasonable expectation of coverage because the suicide exclusion would not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants, in contrast, interpret the first sentence as applying \"if a policyholder increased his or her death benefits from $100,000 to $500,000 during the 25th year of the policy and then committed suicide within the next two years.\" (Doc. 11, at 3). They also argue that Plaintiffs' interpretation of the suicide exclusion is untenable because it would effectively nullify the second sentence of the suicide exclusion. In support, Defendants direct the Court to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Capek v. Devito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276716,1276695\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/564/267/\">\n    564 Pa. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127172,1276695\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/767/1047/\">\n    767 A.2d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). With respect to Plaintiffs \"reasonable expectations\" argument, Defendants theorize that any expectation of coverage was unreasonable and that the Original Policy is entirely irrelevant to the issues in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court rejects Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Capek.\n   </em>\n   The argument that Plaintiffs' proposed interpretation would, in effect, render the second sentence of the suicide exclusion a nullity does not mean that Defendants' interpretation, therefore, must prevail. In\n   <em>\n    Capek\n   </em>\n   , an attorney brought suit against his former client seeking recovery of a contingency fee and the Court was called upon to interpret the parties' contract. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted that when construing a contract, courts \"must determine the intent of the parties and give effect to all the provisions therein.\"\n   <em>\n    Capek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276716,1276695\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/564/267/\">\n    564 Pa. at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127172,1276695\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/767/1047/\">\n    767 A.2d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the argument that Plaintiffs' proposed interpretation would in effect nullify the second sentence of the suicide exclusion does not in and of itself require dismissal of Count I at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court must next look to Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions interpreting suicide exclusions for guidance. When no case is directly on point, the court must predict how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would rule. The parties do not cite to any Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision interpreting a suicide exclusion in an\n   insurance policy. The Court, however, has located several cases where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered cases where, as here, an insurer relied on a suicide exclusion to deny payments to the beneficiaries under an insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Krebs v.

In reaching this conclusion the Court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   It would have been an easy matter for the insurer to insert a provision to the effect that the date of the original policy should apply so far as the suicide clause was concerned, or that there was no exemption from suicide in the term policy. That was not done, and neither is there anything to show that a term policy meant something different from the contract, which was set forth in the printed form. The burden of showing this was on defendant, under the well-settled rule that, where there is an ambiguity in the conditions of a policy of insurance, its provisions will be construed\n   <em>\n    most strongly\n   </em>\n   against the insurer and in favor of the insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 334-35,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20A.%2091\">\n    95 A. 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In 1935 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court again construed a suicide exclusion in a life insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    Ligouri v.

Defendants did not cite, and the Court was unable to locate, any decision applying Pennsylvania law that granted an insurer's motion to dismiss a breach of contract claim based on the application of a suicide exclusion. Although not in the context of suicide exclusions,\n   <em>\n    Bensalem Township v. International Surplus Lines Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852461\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1303/\">\n    38 F.3d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1994), helps put Defendants' motion into proper context. In\n   <em>\n    Bensalem\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff municipality contracted with the defendant insurer for professional liability insurance covering civil claims made against the municipality and its officials during the policy period. \"The agreement included a typical exclusion clause that barred coverage of any claims arising from pre-policy litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852461\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1304 ). After the plaintiff renewed its policy, the insurer added new language expanding the scope of the exclusion clause. \"The new exclusion limited coverage to claims completely unrelated to any prior matter, regardless of whether the matter involved litigation for money damages.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852461\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Township sought, and was denied, coverage. The defendants based its denial of coverage on the new exclusion clause. The Township brought suit against the insurer alleging breach of contract and the district court granted the insurer's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, holding that the litigation for which the Township sought coverage fell squarely within the express terms of the policy's exclusion clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In reversing and remanding, the Third Circuit concluded that \"the district court should not have dismissed the complaint without allowing discovery on the issue of whether the new language added to the insurance policy's prior litigation exclusion clause is inconsistent with Township's reasonable expectation of the type of coverage provided under the agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852461\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1308 ). Although the Township \"may have known of the change in the language of the exclusion clause when it renewed the policy, it should nevertheless have the opportunity to discover and submit evidence that Insurers had created in it a reasonable expectation that the policy would cover claims such as that presented by the ... litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852461\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1308-09 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court of Appeals thus rejected an argument by the insurer, which was identical to the argument advanced by Defendants in this case, that the plaintiffs breach of contract claim must be dismissed at the pleading stage because the language of the exclusion provision was clear and unambiguous and, as such, Pennsylvania does not permit the court to \"consider what the parties' reasonable expectations might have been.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852461\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1309 ). After reviewing Pennsylvania case law, the Court of Appeals noted \"we are confident that where the insurer or its agents creates in the insured a reasonable expectation of\n   coverage that is not supported by the terms of the policy that expectation will prevail over the language of the policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852461\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1311 ). In reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeals held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [W]e believe that Township could conceivably prove that it had a reasonable expectation of coverage despite policy language that appears to those not familiar with its relationship with Insurers unambiguously to preclude coverage, and that it therefore might be able to obtain coverage. We stress, however, that our holding must not be overstated. If Township was aware of the change in the exclusion provision before it elected to renew its policy with Insurers and Insurers made no representation that the scope of coverage would not be reduced, or if after Township agreed to renew Insurers informed Township of the change and its significance, then Insurers must prevail because, in our view, the policy unambiguously excludes coverage for claims such as the one at issue here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   We are thus persuaded by the Township's argument that dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) was inappropriate. Before the district court denied the motion to amend and dismissed Township's complaint for failure to state a claim, it should have allowed discovery to enable it to review the circumstances surrounding the insurance agreement in order to determine whether Township might have had a reasonable expectation of coverage in this situation despite the language in the policy. We will therefore reverse and remand so that the district court can take these additional steps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852461\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1312 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Turning to the Defendants' motion to dismiss Count I, a review of Pennsylvania case law on suicide exclusions and the decisions of courts in this Circuit applying Pennsylvania law, make it abundantly clear that the Court cannot resolve Defendants' affirmative defenses to Count I on a 12(b)(6) motion for at least two reasons. First, the suicide exclusion were ambiguous. Because the suicide exclusion is ambiguous, Pennsylvania law dictates that it must be interpreted against the Defendants. Second, even if the suicide exclusion is unambiguous, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that Ms. Lomma had a reasonable expectation of coverage based on the totality of the circumstances. In either case, Defendants' affirmative defenses based on the language of the suicide exclusion and course of dealing between the parties does not warrant dismissal of Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court's review of the suicide exclusion shows it is ambiguous, both facially, and as applied to Plaintiffs. The suicide exclusion provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   If the insured dies by suicide while sane or insane or by intentional self-destruction while insane, we will not pay any death proceed payable on amounts of insurance which have been in effect for less than 2 years. If the suicide or intentional self-destruction is within the first 2 contract years, we will pay as death proceeds the premiums you paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (Doc. 1-4 at 62). \"Contractual language is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of different constructions and capable of being understood in more than one sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Canal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936313\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/431/#p434\">\n    435 F.3d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

It is reasonable, according to Plaintiffs, \"to interpret the 2 year suicide exclusion as beginning when Ms. Lomma first obtained $100,000.00 in coverage from Ohio National.\" (Doc. 10, at 2-3). The Court agrees. The language of the suicide exclusion, both in isolation and when considering the Replacement Policy as a whole, is capable of being understood in more than one sense and it is plausible that Defendants intended to pay full death benefits to Plaintiffs regardless of whether Ms. Lomma committed suicide within two contract years of the of the Replacement Policy because she consistently held $100,000 in life insurance through Defendants from 1995 through 2009. The first sentence of the suicide exclusion, unlike the second sentence, fails to reference the \"contract year\" or \"effective date\" but simply states that in the event insured commits suicide, the Defendants would not pay \"amounts of insurance\" that had been \"in effect for less than 2 years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants do not appear to contest that Ms. Lomma was insured through them since 1995 in the amount of $100,000 and do not dispute she timely paid all premiums under the Original and Replacement Policies. Defendants, however, interpret the first sentence of the suicide exclusion as applying only to an existing policyholder who increases his or her amount of insurance and then commits suicide within two years of the contract date. While Defendants' interpretation presents another facially reasonable interpretation, even if the Defendants' interpretation may be the more reasonable one, this does not permit the Court to resolve this issue in Defendants' favor on their motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   That Defendants' interpretation cannot prevail over Plaintiffs' at this stage is highlighted by the Defendants' argument that the suicide exclusion in the Replacement Policy is a \"standard\" suicide exclusion used in the insurance industry. While suicide exclusions are no doubt \"standard\" in the insurance industry, a review of the case law shows that the language in the suicide exclusion, considered in the context of the Replacement Policy as a whole, is anything but a \"standard\" suicide exclusion. Many key dates necessary to both provide notice to Ms. Lomma and aid in the Court's interpretation are not referenced in the suicide exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer v. CUNA Mut. Ins. Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740176\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/154/#p164\">\n    648 F.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (3d Cir. 2011) (noting that a \"typical\" case of ambiguity in the contract is where \"a technical term appearing in the policy is undefined within the policy\"). The fact that the second sentence references the \"contract year,\" which, in turn is defined in the Replacement Policy does not require dismissal. The Court cannot interpret the suicide exclusion in an evidentiary vacuum, and certainly cannot do so at the pleading state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that the first sentence of the suicide exclusion, unlike the second sentence, provides no metric from which to determine whether an \"amount of insurance\" has or has not been \"in effect for two years.\" Instead, they claim the amount of insurance referenced in the first sentence applies only to amounts under the Replacement Policy and that Ms. Lomma could not reasonably believe otherwise. The Court thoroughly rejects this argument. Defendants' draftsmanship resulted in a suicide exclusion that is both facially ambiguous and ambiguous as applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   A clearly worded and\n   unambiguous suicide exclusion referencing specifically defined terms, like the suicide exclusion courts in Pennsylvania have been interpreting for over a hundred years and like the suicide exclusion in the Original Policy, could easily have been inserted into the Replacement Policy.

As Plaintiffs cogently argue, the suicide exclusion clause \"does not base the timing of the exclusion on the policy issue date, or the date of application, but on when the insured secured the amount of coverage. If Ohio National intended to use the policy\n   date to time the exclusion, it could easily have done so. Ohio National chose to use the date on which the insured obtained an amount of coverage; this was clearly its intention.\" (Doc. 10, at 6).

Instead, Defendants cite cases exclusion provision in a replacement life insurance policy precluded payment of full death benefits. And the Court can conceive of no circumstances where Rule 12(b)(6) permits dismissal of a breach of contract claim, where, as here, the beneficiaries plausibly allege that the insured and insurer had a pre-existing contractual relationship and the insurer is relying on an exclusion in a replacement life insurance policy to deny benefits that plaintiffs allege the insurer would be obligated to pay under the original policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In sum, Defendants have not satisfied their burden to show that on the face of the Complaint and the documents attached thereto that any of its affirmative defenses\n   will be obviously be successful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The language of the suicide exclusion in the Replacement Policy where courts granted Rule 12(b)(6) motions based on the statute of limitations or qualified immunity.

Rather, it is entirely consistent with the Court's review of case law interpreting suicide exclusions in insurance policies. The Court was unable to locate a single case where a federal court applying Pennsylvania law in a dispute over the applicability of a suicide exclusion in an insurance policy granted (or considered) an insurer's 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Defendants will bear the burden to prove that Ms. Lomma had no reasonable expectation of coverage. They may satisfy that burden only after consideration of the totality of circumstances. In most cases, this will be an issue to be resolved by the factfinder. Only in the rarest of circumstances, if at all, is it appropriate for a federal court applying Pennsylvania law to grant an insurer's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss an insured's breach of contract claim where the insurer's sole argument in support of dismissal is that a suicide is ambiguous and,\n   even if it could be considered unambiguous, Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts plausibly establishing a reasonable expectation of coverage.

Plaintiffs do not dispute that a first party cause of action in which the insured alleges breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing would be subsumed by the insured's breach of contract claim.

This amount of coverage had been in effect since December 4, 1995, over thirteen (13) years prior to her death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Each of these allegations were incorporated by reference in Count IV for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

From these spare, but pointed allegations, it cannot be said that the Plaintiffs' cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith in fair dealing is based on the same conduct which forms Plaintiffs' claim for breach of contract with respect to the express provisions of the policy itself. Therefore, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiffs' claim for breach of the covenant of fair dealing at the pleading stage in that the law stated above herein makes clear that a plaintiff is not barred from bringing a cause of action for breach of contract and a cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing when those two actions are based on separate conduct. Accordingly, the Defendants' motion to dismiss Count III will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Statutory Bad Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Finally, Defendants seek dismissal of Count V of the Complaint (which Plaintiffs incorrectly label as Count IV). In Count V, Plaintiffs allege Defendants violated Pennsylvania's bad faith statute, 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 8371, \"by denying payment of the benefit amount in clear violation of the plain language\" of the Replacement Policy. According to Plaintiffs, the \"clear violation\" is based on the first sentence of the suicide exclusion \"which states that, in the event of suicide,\" the Defendants \"would pay 'amounts of insurance' which had been in effect for two years or more. (Doc. 1-4, at \u00b6 48). Because Ms. Lomma maintained $100,000 in coverage with Defendants since 1995, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' \"stated reason for the denial is manifestly unreasonable, and constitutes a\n   frivolous and unfounded refusal to pay because it is directly contradicted by the language of the policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49). Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants knew, or should have known, that their \"refusal to pay was unreasonable, frivolous and unfounded.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendants seek dismissal of Count V on the theory that their \"determination that the beneficiaries of the policy at issue were only entitled to the premiums paid was based on the second sentence of the suicide exclusion.\" (Doc. 4, at \u00b6 29). They further note that \"[m]ore fundamentally, Plaintiffs' allegations that [Defendants] acted knowingly or with reckless disregard in evaluating and denying the claim is based solely on the Complaint's failure to completely state the relevant suicide provision in the Policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). Thus, because the plain language of the [Replacement] Policy provided Defendants \"a reasonable basis for its coverage determination,\" they claim Count V must be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Pennsylvania legislature has enacted a statute permitting a cause of action against an insurance company based on the insurer's bad faith.
