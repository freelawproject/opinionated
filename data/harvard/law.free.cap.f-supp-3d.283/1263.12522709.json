CONWAY, United States District Judge\n   This cause comes before the Court on Defendant's, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S., Inc. (\"Defendant\"), Motion for Summary Judgment filed on June 1, 2016. (Doc. No. 47). Plaintiff, C.J.J. by and through C.R.J. as Next Friend, Parent, and Natural Guardian (\"Plaintiff\"), filed a Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion on July 1, 2016. (Doc. No. 65). Defendant filed its Reply on July 18, 2016. (Doc. No. 72). For the following reasons, this Court will grant Defendant's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff is a resident of Pinellas County, Florida living with autism, hydrocephalus, and cranial cysts. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 70 and 74) (Complaint). He is generally in the care of his mother (\"C.R.J.\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73). She brought this action on his behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff is incapable of waiting idly for long periods of time. (Doc. No. 65 p. 7). As a result, Plaintiff's family avoids places such as movie theaters, restaurants, and grocery stores. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He also cannot understand the concept of visiting an attraction and receiving a return time to experience it at a future time. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 76). Additionally, Plaintiff has a propensity to experience attractions in a specific order and he must experience certain attractions repeatedly for hours at a time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79). Exposure to idle waits or not being able to follow his routine will cause Plaintiff to have a behavioral meltdown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71). His meltdowns are mild and nonphysical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant is one of the world's most popular amusement parks. (Doc. No. 47 p. 23). It is divided into four parks that are organized into six lands, comprising over one hundred rides and attractions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3 n.1). Until October 9, 2013, Defendant would issue a Guest Assistance Card (\"GAC\") to certain disabled guests at its parks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4). A GAC allowed these guests and their party nearly unlimited access to rides through alternative \"backdoor entrances\" or \"Fastpass\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   lines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant, however, abandoned the GAC system because of alleged abuse by both guests that needed GACs and those that did not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The most common way guests purportedly abused the former GAC system was by requesting the accommodation with no need for it altogether. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Individuals were also creating counterfeit GACs, posting Craigslist advertisements offering unauthorized tours guided by GAC holders, and selling unexpired GACs online. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Disney Disability Access Service (\"DAS\") was adopted to replace the GAC system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Starting October 9, 2013, guests needing accommodations for a cognitive disability at Defendant's parks had to obtain a DAS card from its Guest Relations personnel upon arrival. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). DAS affords guests with disabilities such as autism the ability to \"virtually wait\" for attractions without standing in lines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A guest using DAS arrives at an attraction, presents the card, and receives a return time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This can be done for the duration of their visit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The virtual wait using DAS is the posted time for the attraction minus ten minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). DAS cardholders thus have the opportunity to \"avail themselves of the many other attractions\n   throughout the park-other rides, shows, attractions, concerts, characters, restaurants, and stores\" until their return time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition to DAS, some guests receive a number of \"readmission passes\" permitting them to enter the Fastpass line for any attraction without having to stand in line or wait virtually. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff recounts two visits to Defendant's parks in March and May 2014. On the March visit, Plaintiff was told that he could not receive any accommodation other than DAS. (Doc. No. 1\u00b6 83). However, upon returning to their hotel, they were offered readmission passes. (Doc. No. 65 p. 8). On the May visit, Plaintiff had to wait idly for return times at various rides in which he wanted to ride repeatedly but was not allowed to do so. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 88 and 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Overall, Plaintiff and his family were disappointed with their experience and are discouraged and deterred from visiting Defendant's parks because of DAS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 91 and 96). As a result, Plaintiff requests injunctive relief requiring Defendant to modify DAS to provide further accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Granting a summary judgment motion is proper if the moving party \"shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.\" Fed.

Defendant, however, argues that it asserts only a failure to accommodate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties' discord on what the issues are stems from Count I in the Complaint, the only count pertaining to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\").

Count I provides facts describing Plaintiff's experience with Defendant's accommodations. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 69-99). Though the Complaint mentions the ADA's general prohibition against discrimination, it lacks discernible allegations regarding denial of participation, participation in an unequal benefit, or a separate benefit.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(l)(A)(i)-(iii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Count I makes no identifiable claims of disparate treatment or disparate impact.

To the extent it is viewed otherwise, Plaintiff acknowledges, as the Court elaborates\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , that the ADA is intended to ensure that disabled patrons of public accommodations are afforded a like experience of those that are not disabled to the extent feasible. (Doc. No. 65 p. 13). Disabled or not, virtually no one visits Defendant's parks and accesses its attractions without having to wait. Therefore, the real issue is DAS, which is not facially neutral. It applies specifically to those with disabilities, not all of Defendant's guests. This precludes Plaintiff from establishing a disparate impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    A.

In sum, a key inquiry in determining that a requested accommodation is necessary is whether a disabled individual requires it to receive a benefit like that of a nondisabled person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Parties' Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant primarily argues that Plaintiff has not met his burden because an accommodation beyond DAS is not necessary as DAS affords him access to the rides at its parks. (Doc. No. 47 p. 14). Defendant also contends that if the Court finds that reverting to the GAC system is reasonable and necessary, it would nonetheless fundamentally alter its operations based on the risk of abuse and an overall adverse impact on the wait times experienced by all other guests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 21). It also attacks Plaintiff's standing to sue, asserting that he did not suffer a cognizable injury because he was not denied access to its parks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff counters Defendant's Motion with five main arguments. First, Defendant's conduct amounts to disparate treatment or alternatively creates a disparate impact. (Doc. No. 65 p. 10). Second, the reasonableness inquiry is fact-intensive and not fit for resolution on summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 14). Third, Plaintiff's requested accommodation is necessary because it is not a preference-it is a biologically driven mechanism. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 15). Fourth, Defendant has not shown that the requested accommodation will fundamentally alter its operations because it has provided a similar accommodation for the last twenty years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Lastly, Plaintiff contends that he has standing because being deterred from visiting Defendant's parks is alone sufficient to sue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 20). Plaintiff's disparate treatment and disparate impact arguments have already been addressed and are impermissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Therefore, based on the remaining arguments identified by each party, there are four issues to be considered by this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1. Whether Plaintiff's requested modification is necessary to afford him access to Defendant's parks;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2. Whether Plaintiff's requested modification is reasonable;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   3. Whether Plaintiff's requested modification would fundamentally alter the services provided by Defendant; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   4. Whether Plaintiff has standing to pursue his claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The subsequent analysis covers issues one and four only. Even if Plaintiff has standing to sue, the Court determines that the requested accommodation is not necessary. Therefore, discussion on the reasonableness of Plaintiff's request and whether it is a fundamental alteration to Defendant's operations is not needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    C. Plaintiff's Requested Accommodation Is Not Necessary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Revising DAS is not necessary for Plaintiff to have equal access to Defendant's parks. This is because (1) Defendant provided Plaintiff an opportunity to gain a like benefit from its parks that is enjoyed by nondisabled individuals; (2) Plaintiff can wait long enough to access Defendant's attractions without following a routine; and (3) DAS is an existing means to equal access. The Court assesses the \"necessary\" inquiry first because a showing that Plaintiff did not need the accommodation obviates further discussion regardless if it is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301934\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/661/#p674\">\n    532 U.S. at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301934\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/661/#p674\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Defendant afforded Plaintiff an experience like that of nondisabled guests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff was given an opportunity to experience Defendant's attractions in a similar manner as guests that do not need accommodations. In\n   <em>\n    Baughman\n   </em>\n   , Defendant in this case was sued by a guest with limb girdle muscular dystrophy which made it difficult for her to walk or stand.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901728\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/1131/#p1135\">\n    685 F.3d at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As part of its \"necessary\" inquiry into the plaintiff's requested accommodation, the Ninth Circuit highlighted the importance of considering the way nondisabled persons experienced Defendant's park and then assessing if the public accommodation took reasonable steps to afford a similar experience.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901728\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/1131/#p1135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901728\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/1131/#p1135\">\n    at 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, nondisabled guests visit Defendant's parks for rides and attractions that most of them have to wait more than an hour to experience. (Doc. No. 47 p. 23). Comparing this to Plaintiff's experience, DAS and readmission passes allow Plaintiff to access those same rides in a fraction of the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 18). The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Baughman\n   </em>\n   had difficulty standing and walking; Plaintiff here alleges that he cannot wait in line to access attractions. Having trouble standing or walking could create a different experience from nondisabled guests when viewing certain attractions or transitioning on and off of rides. However, nondisabled guests will inevitably have to wait to experience the attractions at Defendant's parks regardless of the order they choose to visit them. Not only will nondisabled guests have to wait, most of them will have to stand in line. They also will not be able to exit an attraction and ride it again without having to wait. Plaintiff can wait for attractions from anywhere in Defendant's parks from the time he arrives until whenever he decides to leave. While doing so, Plaintiff can visit other attractions with shorter waits until his return times for attractions with longer waits. Thus, DAS and readmission passes afford Plaintiff a similar, or better, experience as those not needing accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff can wait long enough to access Defendant's attractions without following a routine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The crux of Plaintiff's action is that he cannot wait idly in lines and needs to experience certain attractions repeatedly in a specific order. However, DAS accommodates these needs to the extent for him to have equal access. Plaintiff does not have to stand in line while waiting to access an attraction. Instead, he can experience other attractions in the meantime. Plaintiff has also shown that he does not need to repeat rides for hours by not repeating any during his March 2014 trip. (Doc. No. 47 p. 11). Furthermore, Plaintiff visited Defendant's Magic Kingdom on two consecutive days but rode different rides on each visit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10). In any event, the ADA does not require Defendant to accommodate Plaintiff's routine because \"preference-standing alone-is not essential to accessing Disney's Park.\"\n   <em>\n    Ault v. Walt Disney World Co.\n   </em>\n   No. 6:07-cv-1785-Orl-31KRS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203242028\">\n    2009 WL 3242028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (M.D. Fla.

Plaintiff has also shown that he can wait in line for up to twenty minutes. (Doc. No. 47 p. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiff has demonstrated his ability to defer gratification for hours through traveling by car at least four times from Stone Mountain, Georgia to Orlando, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 11). The gratification in traveling is, for the most part, reaching the desired destination. These trips required multiple hours of travel time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This is much more than Plaintiff's demonstrated ability to wait for twenty minutes-gratification in those instances was anything but instant. Plaintiff argues that traveling by car is not comparable to visiting an amusement park because when in a car, Plaintiff is \"belted in\" and he has access to electronics and media. (Doc. No. 65 p. 8). Plaintiff also notes that he becomes anxious when the car stops moving. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, this argument only demonstrates that DAS accommodates him because it shows that Plaintiff can defer gratification as long as he has something to do in the interim. At Defendant's parks, Plaintiff can engage in other activities that he likes while waiting. Therefore, Plaintiff has access to the attractions because he can wait for the amount of time required to experience them and does not need to follow a routine. Accordingly, using DAS is not beyond Plaintiff's capacity.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301934\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/661/#p674\">\n    532 U.S. at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301934\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/661/#p674\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    3. DAS and readmission passes are existing means that afford equal access\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff's requested modification is not necessary because of the existing accommodations to access the attractions at the parks. Defendant cites a host of cases where federal courts have deemed an individual's request for accommodation unnecessary because accommodations were already in place that provided access.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's case is no different. As\n   noted, DAS and readmission passes afford Plaintiff access to the attractions at Defendant's parks. For example, on his May 2014 visit, he experienced ten attractions but rode them for a total of sixteen times by repeating some of them. (Doc. No. 47 p. 11). Based on these facts, a reasonable juror could not find that Plaintiff's requested accommodation is necessary. Consequently, even if Plaintiff had standing, which he does not as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   III. D., Plaintiff failed to satisfy an essential element of his case.\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322-23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Regarding the risk of future injury, Plaintiff is not being denied access to Defendant's parks.

Injunctive relief is not proper and further analysis of the risk of future injury is not needed based on this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff's previous visits must be assessed under the three, bedrock elements of standing.
