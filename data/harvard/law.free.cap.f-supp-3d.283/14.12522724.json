(\"Boro\") and Local 1181-1061, Amalgamated Transit Union, AFL-CIO\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"the Union,\" and together with Boro, \"Defendants\") alleging that Boro discriminated against him, retaliated against him when he complained of being subjected to discrimination, and created a hostile work environment under the New York State Executive Law (Human Rights Law \u00a7 296) (\"NYSHRL\") and the Administrative Code of the City of New York, \u00a7 8-107.1(a)\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"NYCHRL\"). Plaintiff also seeks counsel fees pursuant to section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and under the New York Labor Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\"), Dkt. Entry No. 20, at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Plaintiff further alleges that the Union breached the duty of fair representation that it owed\n   Plaintiff under the \"Federal statute\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the common law of the State of New York.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages from Boro and the Union.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Prayer for Relief. Plaintiff also seeks equitable relief in the form of reinstatement to his former position and an injunction prohibiting Boro and its employees from committing further discriminatory acts against Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants moved separately to dismiss the Amended Complaint. Boro argues that the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim for discrimination, retaliation, or hostile work environment, and that Plaintiff merely is trying to relitigate an adverse arbitration decision that determined Boro had fired Plaintiff for \"just cause.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Boro's Mem. of Law in Supp. of its Mot. to Dismiss Am. Compl. (\"Boro's Mem.\"), Dkt. Entry No. 22. The Union argues that: (1) Plaintiff's fair representation claim is time barred; (2) the Union did not breach its duty of fair representation; and (3) any fair representation claim under New York state law is preempted by applicable federal laws.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Union's Mem. of Law in Supp. of its Mot.

Am. Compl. at \u00b6 10. Prior to his employment with Boro, Plaintiff worked for twelve years as a bus driver for a different employer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During his twelve years as a bus driver prior to working for Boro, he had a clean driving record, had no criminal history for crimes involving anger, and never had been written up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. He further alleges that, during his employment with Boro, his work performance was \"above satisfactory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. Plaintiff, who is black and of Haitian descent,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5, alleges primarily four incidents that provide the basis for his claims:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, Plaintiff allegedly on January 7, 2014 was assigned to drive a bus \"in the middle of winter with a defective heating system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. While he complained that driving children in a bus without heat was \"against the rules,\" Plaintiff allegedly was assigned the same bus without repairs to the heating system again on January 8, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Plaintiff again complained of the assignment, he was suspended for one day without pay, and unbeknownst to him at the time, a disciplinary notice was placed in his file.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff claims that \"no other non black or non Haitian employees were assigned to drive a school bus under the same weather conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Although he does not allege that he notified the Union of the assignments to buses with deficient heating systems or of the discipline he subsequently received, Plaintiff claims that the Union failed to represent him fairly in his disciplinary action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, on March 6, 2014, Plaintiff complained to \"the manager\" that he was being treated differently than other non-white\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and non-Haitian drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Plaintiff also complained to Boro's payroll representative, Mario Belgrave, that his paychecks were \"short[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Belgrave allegedly became \"angry\" at Plaintiff's complaint, and \"failed to look into the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The same day, while operating his bus, Plaintiff received a phone call from Boro notifying him that he was suspended for the rest of the day without pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that no reason was given for the suspension, and that Plaintiff again was written up without his knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiff, \"no other non black or non Haitian employees that complain[ed] to management about [the] same or other terms [of] their employment w[as] treated like the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. While Plaintiff does not allege that he notified the Union of the discipline he received on March 6, 2014, he nonetheless claims that the Union failed to fairly represent him in connection with this suspension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Third, on October 17, 2014, Plaintiff allegedly sped through Boro's bus yard in his school bus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. The incident was observed by the \"Yard Man,\" a non-black employee who did not have a speed gauge with which to measure Plaintiff's speed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiff, he and \"other non black or non Haitian drivers[ ] drove in a convoy to exit or enter\" the bus yard at the same time and \"none of the other said drivers were accused of speeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Boro told Plaintiff that the Yard Man \"is a police [officer]\" and dismissed Plaintiff that same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Plaintiff reported this incident to the Union.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that he collected unemployment insurance benefits after his termination on October 17, 2014 because his termination was not for any misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the days following his October 17, 2014 termination, Boro issued employee disciplinary notices for three additional incidents involving Plaintiff: (1) on October 21, 2014, for driving his school bus without a safety bag and while in possession of a four-inch curved knife; (2) on October 22, 2014, for driving his school bus without a safety bag and \"with an extremely dirty interior of the bus\"; and (3) on October 24, 2014, for reckless driving in the company yard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. Plaintiff alleges that each of these disciplinary notices were pretextual, spurious, and discriminatory because \"no other non black or non Haitian driver was treated similarly by defendant Boro.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. Plaintiff claims he had no knowledge of these disciplinary notices until receiving the arbitration decision dated October 26, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 40. Plaintiff does not allege that he reported the disciplinary notices to the Union, but nonetheless claims that the Union failed to fairly represent him in connection with them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two months after the October 17, 2014 incident, Plaintiff was asked by Boro to take anger management classes and two six-hour defensive driving classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. He was offered a \"last chance agreement,\" which he allegedly signed, without representation, and was reinstated to his position as a bus driver.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff claims that the Union failed to fairly represent him in connection with his signing of the \"last chance agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Fourth, on March 11, 2015, Plaintiff transported a group of children to the College of Staten Island (\"CSI\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. A staff member told Plaintiff not to leave his bus unattended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The staff member believed Plaintiff to be uncooperative and pointed Plaintiff out to the director\n   of CSI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The director then instructed Plaintiff not to leave his bus unattended, and Plaintiff allegedly replied that he did not have to listen to her, and asked her, \"who the hell do you think you are[?]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When the director told Plaintiff she would call his employer, Plaintiff allegedly responded, \"I don't give a shit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The director reported this incident to Boro, but did not report it to campus police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Plaintiff alleges that he was terminated without an investigation and without any union representation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. He contends that no other non-black or non-Haitian bus driver was accused in a similar manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. Plaintiff also alleges that he collected unemployment insurance benefits after his termination on March 11, 2015 because he was not terminated for any misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   An arbitration was scheduled for July 14, 2015, but Plaintiff's union representative informed him that the director of CSI, who reported the March 11, 2015 incident to Boro, refused to appear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. The union representative further told Plaintiff that Boro had decided to reinstate him if he signed an agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Plaintiff told his union representative that he would like to review the agreement before signing it, the union representative allegedly became angry and told Plaintiff that \"he will re-schedule the [a]rbitration [h]earing and that [P]laintiff will not win.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. Plaintiff alleges that the Union failed to fairly represent him by rescheduling the arbitration \"with malice\" because he requested to read the agreement before signing it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The arbitration was held on October 15, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. The director of CSI, who Plaintiff alleges was coerced into testifying, testified that she could not identify Plaintiff as there were several bus drivers at the college that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Though he requested a Haitian-speaking interpreter, the Union did not provide one during the arbitration proceedings, which Plaintiff claims breached the Union's duty of fair representation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. On October 26, 2015, the arbitrator issued a decision finding that Plaintiff was dismissed for \"just cause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. B to Decl. of Richard A. Brook, Opinion &amp; Award of Arbitrator, Dkt. Entry No. 28-2, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that at unknown time(s) and date(s) during his employment at Boro, Boro instructed Plaintiff not to wear his cap to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. Boro also instructed Plaintiff not to wear his sunglasses to work \"so that [Boro] could see his eyes to determine if [P]laintiff [was] using drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. According to Plaintiff, non-black employees were not prohibited from wearing a cap or sunglasses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Boro's discipline of him and the prohibitions it imposed on him created a hostile work environment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 44. He claims he was \"treated unequal and unlike non black employees similarly situated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. He further claims that Boro retaliated against him for complaining of being treated in a discriminatory manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff initially filed this action in state court on April 29, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal (\"Notice\"), Dkt. Entry No. 1, at 8 (indicating filing in Supreme Court, Kings County on April 29, 2016). On June 14, 2016, the Union filed a notice of removal with this Court.\n   <em>\n    See generally Id.\n   </em>\n   On July 1, 2016, the Court issued an order to show cause why the case should not be remanded to state court since the notice of removal was deficient on its face. On July 11, 2016, at a hearing on the order to show cause, the Court concluded that, in essence, what Plaintiff seeks to do \"is to reverse or undermine the arbitration award that was granted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 11th\n   Hr'g Tr. at 4:22-24;\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:15-16 (\"And you've just conceded that, in fact, plaintiff is trying to undo the arbitration award.\").

Ordinarily, however, an employee is required to attempt to exhaust any grievance or arbitration remedies provided in the collective bargaining agreement. Subject to very limited judicial review, he will be bound by the result according to the finality provisions of the agreement .... [H]owever, we [have] recognized that this rule works an unacceptable injustice when the union representing the employee in the grievance/arbitration procedure acts in such a discriminatory, dishonest, arbitrary, or perfunctory fashion as to breach its duty of fair representation. In such an instance, an employee may bring suit against both the employer and the union, notwithstanding the outcome or finality of the grievance or arbitration proceeding. Such a suit, as a formal matter, comprises two causes of action. The suit against the employer rests on \u00a7 301 [of the Labor Management Relations Act], since the employee is alleging a breach of the collective bargaining agreement. The suit against the union is one for breach of the union's duty of fair representation, which is implied under the scheme of the National Labor Relations Act. Yet the two claims are inextricably interdependent. To prevail against either the company or the Union ... [employee-plaintiffs] must not only show that their discharge was contrary to the contract but must also carry the burden of demonstrating a breach of duty by the Union. The employee may, if he chooses, sue one defendant and not the other; but the case he must prove is the same whether he sues one, the other, or both. The suit is thus not a straightforward breach of contract suit under \u00a7 301 ... but a hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation claim, amounting to a direct challenge to the private settlement of disputes under [the collective-bargaining agreement] ....

Aug. 5, 2013) (\"These allegations are nowhere to be found in plaintiff's amended complaint. Plaintiff may not amend his complaint through motion papers ....\"). Accordingly, the Court disregards the new factual allegations contained in Plaintiff's motion papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court will assess the timeliness of each of Plaintiff's fair representation claims in turn, which generally fall into three categories: (1) the January 8, March 6, and October 21, 22, and 24, 2014 disciplinary actions taken where the Union allegedly \"failed to legally and fairly represent the [P]laintiff,\"; (2) the October 17, 2014 dismissal and attendant November 2014 \"last chance agreement,\" in which the Union \"failed to advise or represent the [P]laintiff before he signed the ... 'last chance agreement' \"; and (3) the March 11, 2015 termination, the subsequent rescheduling of the July 14, 2015 arbitration \"with malice,\" followed by the Union informing Plaintiff that he \"will not win\" the arbitration, and the Union's failure to provide a Haitian-speaking interpreter at the October 15, 2015 arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff makes conflicting claims about his awareness of the January 8 and March 6, 2014 written disciplinary notices. The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff was not aware of these disciplinary notices until he received the October 26, 2015 arbitration decision,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16, and Plaintiff's opposition brief states that Plaintiff saw these notices \"for the first time\" on or about September 29, 2016 during the parties' initial disclosures, Pl.'s Union Opp'n. at 5. However, the January 8, 2014 disciplinary notice, which is included with other disciplinary notices as an exhibit to Plaintiff's opposition to the Union's motion to dismiss, is signed by Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A, Dkt. Entry No. 31-1. And while the March 6, 2014 notice is not signed by Plaintiff, the narrative purports to include many statements from the Plaintiff, suggesting he was present for the disciplinary hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (for example, \"[t]his Driver states ...\"). Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff was aware of these written disciplinary notices and the underlying facts that led to them at or around the date of the notices. Since Plaintiff filed his state court complaint on April 29, 2016, any fair representation claim based on the January 8 and March 6, 2014 incidents, which occurred more than two years prior to the filing, is time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Similarly, the October 17, 21, 22, and 24, 2014 incidents resulted in a suspension,\n   followed by a reinstatement agreed to by the Union and Boro, and signed by Plaintiff on November 5, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff, therefore, was aware of any failure by the Union to fairly represent him in connection with his suspension following the October 2014 incidents, and any failure to advise him with respect to the \"last chance agreement,\" by November 5, 2014, the date he signed the agreement, at the latest. Since Plaintiff's complaint was filed more than six months after November 5, 2014, claims based on the October 2014 incidents and the November 2014 \"last chance agreement\" the followed are also time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Turning to the March 11, 2015 incident, Plaintiff alleges that the Union refused to let him review a proposed settlement agreement and rescheduled a July 14, 2015 arbitration \"with malice\" for October 15, 2015, telling Plaintiff that he \"will not win.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 29-31, 39. While Plaintiff does not specifically allege when the Union communicated the refusal and rescheduling to him, the very latest Plaintiff could have been aware of these facts, and that the Union had not fairly represented him in connection with the March 11, 2015 incident, would be October 15, 2015, the date of the rescheduled arbitration. Since Plaintiff did not file the Amended Complaint until April 29, 2016, any claims based on the March 11, 2015 incident and the rescheduling of the arbitration are also untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff's final claim is based on the Union's failure to fairly represent him at the October 15, 2015 arbitration hearing by not granting his request for a Haitian-speaking interpreter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. The Second Circuit has found that where the claim involves a union's conduct in arbitration proceedings, accrual does not ordinarily occur until a decision is rendered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ghartey v.

As\n   <em>\n    Ghartey\n   </em>\n   recognizes, however, it is not always necessary to await the results of the arbitration. \"Where a union refuses or neglects to assist a union member, ... decides to stop assisting a member, ... or acts against the interests of a member, ... a breach of duty by the union is apparent to the member at the time [ ]he learns of the union action or inaction about which [ ]he complains,\" and \"it would indeed to be nonsensical to say that the member ... only learns of the union's breach later, when [ ]he suffers an adverse result.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527171\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/869/160/#p164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527171\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/869/160/#p164\">\n    at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Here, Plaintiff does not contend that the representation and end result was unfair, but rather he specifically contends that the Union breached its duty of fair representation by failing to provide him with a Haitian-speaking interpreter. Am. Compl. at \u00b6 41. This failure would have been apparent to Plaintiff on the date of the hearing, October 15, 2015, when no interpreter was present, and under\n   <em>\n    Ghartey\n   </em>\n   , it would be \"nonsensical\" to hold that such a claim only arose after the arbitrator reached his decision.\n   <em>\n    Ghartey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527171\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/869/160/#p164\">\n    869 F.2d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Plaintiff had six months from October 15, 2015, or until April 15, 2016, to file his complaint.
