Compl. \u00b6 20. In an 82-page complaint, inclusive of exhibits, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants maliciously targeted him for years by filing several charges and misdemeanors against him related to properties he rented.

The only details regarding the charges are found in a Certificate of Disposition, which is attached as Exhibit 1 to the complaint.

After multiple appearances by Plaintiff, Justice Smith of the Riverhead Town Justice Court dismissed all 61 charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Fifty-nine charges were dismissed as a result of Plaintiff's motions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The remaining two charges were terminated after the Town was unable to proceed to trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.

The complaint was filed on August 12, 2016. In his opposition papers, Plaintiff asserts that \"Defendants lack proof that [Plaintiff] was arraigned before 2014; the federal false arrest claims [stemming from the 2012 charges] appear timely.\" Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n at 25, ECF No. 20. Plaintiff mistakes the pleading burden. It is not Defendants' burden to prove that Plaintiff was arraigned outside the limitations period. Rather, it is Plaintiff's burden to allege that Plaintiff was arraigned within that period. Here, Plaintiff has not alleged an arraignment much less any facts supporting the timeliness of these claims. Accordingly, the Court reports and recommends that Plaintiff's false arrest claims emanating out of the 2012 charges be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Exhibit 2 to the complaint indicates that these charges were brought under docket no. 13120473. The appearance ticket for this docket provides that \"upon your failure to appear as above directed, a criminal summons or a warrant for your arrest may be issued.\" ECF No. 18-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants argue that these claims should be dismissed because there is no allegation that Plaintiff was confined or arrested in relation to these charges. Plaintiff does not address this argument in any coherent manner. To the extent Plaintiff's false arrest claim is premised upon an arrest without probable cause, the claim fails as Plaintiff fails to allege that he was arrested in connection with the 2013 charges. While the appearance ticket threatens Plaintiff's arrest if he did not appear in court, there is no allegation that Plaintiff was actually arrested. Indeed, Plaintiff's opposition papers refer to an \"arrest\" in quotation marks. Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n at 4, ECF No. 20. Moreover, there are no allegations that Plaintiff was taken into physical custody or somehow unlawfully detained.

Defendants argue that this claim should be dismissed because there is no allegation of a seizure, including that Plaintiff was arrested in connection with the 2015 charges. Paragraph 129 of the complaint, however, alleges that Plaintiff was \"arrested in April 2015 for an additional 21 charges now pending against him for alleged violations of the local Rental Permit law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. Defendant's argument is therefore incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiff fails to state a valid false arrest claim because the complaint fails to allege that Defendants lacked probable cause to arrest Plaintiff, or at a minimum, lacked arguable probable which would defeat a claim of qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Mar. 28, 2017) (\"To receive qualified immunity on a claim for false arrest or malicious prosecution, an officer must show only 'arguable' probable cause.\"). The complaint alleges that the 2015 charges concern alleged violations of Section 270-3 of the Southampton Town Code, which provides that \"no owner shall cause, permit or allow the occupancy or use of a dwelling unit as a rental property without a valid rental permit.\" Compl. \u00b6 68 (citing the Southampton Town Code). The complaint further alleges that Defendants \"knew, or should have known ... that [Plaintiff] was neither the owner nor occupant of any of these 21 houses,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72, and therefore had no lawful basis to arrest Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants argue that because the complaint alleges that Plaintiff was \"the person who aided and encouraged [the tenants] in securing and continuing occupancy\" of the rental dwellings,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70, Defendants reasonably believed that Plaintiff was acting on behalf of the owner, and Defendants therefore had probable cause to arrest Plaintiff. In support of this assertion, Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

July 29, 2015) for the proposition that an agent of the owner can be criminally responsible for code violations.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , however, did not involve violations of the rental code provision at issue here, which on its face, seems to limit responsibility to an owner. Moreover, while the\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   court found that the defendants had probable cause to prosecute not only the corporate record owner of the property but also Rodriguez, the court's finding was based on the rationale that a corporation can only act through its officers, and Rodriguez was the president of the corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1, 7. Here, there are no similar allegations concerning Plaintiff's relationship with the owner of the subject premises. Thus, based on the information before the Court, the Court finds that Defendants' arguments do not warrant dismissal of Plaintiff's false arrest claims stemming out of the 2015 charges. Accordingly, the Court reports and recommends that Defendants' motion be denied with regard to these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Abuse of Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Count III also asserts a claim for federal malicious abuse of process under Section 1983. Preliminarily, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff's abuse of process claims with respect to the 2012 charges are time-barred. As with Plaintiff's false arrest claims, Plaintiff's abuse of process claims are governed by New York's three-year statute of limitations, but accrual of such claims is governed by federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hadid v.

Plaintiff's conclusory allegations of a \"media ride-along,\" without a single specific allegation to support this claim are insufficient to state a cause of action. The complaint contains no details regarding these alleged media ride-alongs, such as where they took place; who participated in them; why Glogg and Larios were at these homes-there is no indication they were executing a search warrant; whether the residents consented to the alleged press coverage; and the content of the coverage. Moreover, Plaintiff has not addressed Defendants' argument that Plaintiff-who is attempting to vicariously raise the rights of the residents of the premises where the media ride-alongs occurred-lacks standing to assert a Fourth Amendment claim. Accordingly, the Court reports and recommends that this claim be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In one sentence at the end of his brief, Plaintiff requests leave to amend should the Court identify pleading imperfections. Despite Plaintiff's failure to identify any additional facts that he would allege in support of his claims, \"it is the usual practice upon granting a motion to dismiss to allow leave to replead.\"\n   <em>\n    Cruz v.
