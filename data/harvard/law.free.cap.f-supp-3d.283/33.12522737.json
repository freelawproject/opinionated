(\"CVS\"), Rosanne \"Doe\", and Mike Clarke (together, \"defendants\") for violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\") and the New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\"). Presently before the Court is defendants' motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, to stay the action pending arbitration. (ECF No. 11.) For the reasons explained below, the Court grants defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stays this action pending arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court takes the following facts from the complaint (ECF No. 1), the Declaration of Robert Bailey filed in support of defendants' motion to compel arbitration (\"Bailey Decl.,\" ECF No. 13) and the exhibits attached thereto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff was employed as a cashier and stock person at CVS from sometime in 2008 until July 28, 2016. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 42.) During the week of October 5, 2014, CVS implemented an arbitration policy. (Bailey Decl. \u00b6 6.) The arbitration policy states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Mutual Obligation to Arbitrate.\n   </strong>\n   Under this Policy, CVS Health (including its subsidiaries) and its Employees agree that any dispute between an Employee and CVS Health that is covered by this Policy (\"Covered Claims\") will be decided by a single arbitrator through final and binding arbitration only and will not be decided by a court or jury or any other forum, except as otherwise provided in this Policy.... Employees accept this Policy by continuing their employment after becoming aware of the Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Claims Covered by This Policy.\n   </strong>\n   Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, Covered Claims are any and all legal claims, disputes or controversies that CVS Health may have, now or in the future, against an Employee or that an Employee may have, now or in the future, against CVS Health, its parents, subsidiaries, successors or affiliates, or one of its employees or agents, arising out of or related to the Employee's employment with CVS Health or the termination of the Employee's employment. Covered Claims include but are not limited to disputes ... arising under the ... Age Discrimination in Employment Act ... and other state and local statutes, regulations and other legal authorities relating to employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Waiver of Class, Collective and Representative Actions (\"Class Action Waiver\").\n   </strong>\n   Employee and CVS Health will bring any Covered Claims in arbitration\n   <em>\n    on an individual basis only\n   </em>\n   ; Employee and CVS Health waive any right or authority for any Covered Claims to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative or private attorney general action.... Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the validity, enforceability or breach of this Class Action Waiver will be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Severability.\n   </strong>\n   If any portion of this Policy is adjudged to be unenforceable, the remainder of this Policy will remain valid and enforceable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Bailey Decl. Ex. A at 1-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff completed an online training session about the arbitration policy on May 27, 2015. (Bailey Decl. \u00b6 16.) During the training, plaintiff agreed that the arbitration policy applied to him, and acknowledged that he understood he could opt out of the arbitration policy by sending a written letter to CVS within thirty days of completing the training. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-16.) Plaintiff does not dispute that he did not opt out of the arbitration policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 28, 2016, CVS terminated plaintiff's employment for personally accepting gift cards from customers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) In the instant action, plaintiff alleges that CVS's reason for terminating his employment was pretextual, and that he was actually terminated because of his age. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed the complaint on June 22, 2017. (ECF No. 1.) Defendants moved to compel arbitration and to dismiss or, in the alternative, to stay the action on October 25, 2017. (ECF No. 11.) Plaintiff opposed the motion on November 15, 2017. (ECF No. 14.) Defendants replied on December 1, 2017. (ECF No. 15.) The Court heard oral argument on December 20, 2017 and has fully considered the parties' submissions and arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.

In any event, defendants further contend that the class action waiver is irrelevant to the instant motion because plaintiff is not pursuing collective action here. Finally, defendants argue that, even if the Court reached the enforceability issue and determined that the class action waiver is unenforceable, the proper remedy would be to sever that provision, not to invalidate the entire agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As a threshold matter, in light of the arbitration agreement's expressed intent that the Court decide issues regarding the class action waiver's enforceability, the Court disagrees with defendants' contention that that issue would be for the arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kai Peng v.
