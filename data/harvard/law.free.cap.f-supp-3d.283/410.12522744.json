Plaintiffs, thirty-one North Carolina voters, lodged objections to 12 of the 116 proposed remedial districts, arguing that those districts failed to remedy the identified racial gerrymanders or were otherwise legally unacceptable. Finding 9 of Plaintiffs' 12 objections potentially had merit, this Court identified its concerns and appointed Dr. Nathaniel Persily of Stanford University as Special Master (the \"Special Master\") to assist the Court in evaluating and, if necessary, redrawing those 9 district configurations (the \"Subject Districts\") in light of the fast-approaching filing period for the 2018 elections. Thereafter, the Special Master filed draft reconfigurations of the 9 districts for the parties' consideration, invited and considered comments and objections from the parties, and revised his draft plan in light of those comments and objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 1, 2017, the Special Master submitted to the Court recommended remedial plans (the \"Recommended Plans\") for the Subject Districts, as well as a report explaining his process for drawing the Recommended Plans and why the Recommended Plans remedy the identified legal problems with the Subject Districts. As further explained below, after careful consideration of the 2017 Plans, the Special Master's report, and the parties' evidence, briefing, and oral arguments, we sustain Plaintiffs' objections to the Subject Districts, approve the Special Master's Recommended Plans for reconfiguring those districts, reject Plaintiffs' challenge to one Senate district, and decline to consider Plaintiffs' remaining objections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early 2011, the North Carolina General Assembly set out to redraw state Senate and House districts to account for changes in population and demographic data revealed in the most recent decennial census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.

House Select Comm. On Redistricting Meeting Tr. 62:4-6, Aug. 25, 2017, ECF No. 184-18. Legislative Defendants did not introduce any evidence regarding what additional instructions, if any, Representative Lewis or Senator Hise provided to Dr. Hofeller about the proper use and weighting of the various criteria. Nor did they offer any evidence as to how Dr. Hofeller weighted or ordered the criteria in drawing the proposed remedial maps, either in general or as to any particular district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The General Assembly released Dr. Hofeller's proposed Senate and House Plans on August 19 and 20, 2017, respectively. The General Assembly provided block assignment files and statistical information regarding the 2017 Plans on August 21, 2017. The 2017 Plans altered a total of 116 of the 170 state House and Senate districts. On August 22, 2017, the Joint Committee held a public hearing on the proposed plans in Raleigh, allowing attendees at six satellite locations to participate via teleconference.

Letter to Counsel, Sept. 15, 2017, ECF No. 187-1. Plaintiffs also provided the Committees with alternative maps that addressed Plaintiffs' objections, and Democratic representatives offered those maps as amendments during the legislative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Committees did not revise the proposed remedial plans to address Plaintiffs' objections and rejected Plaintiffs' alternative redistricting plans.

The House Redistricting Committee approved Dr. Hofeller's proposed House plan on August 25, 2017, also by a party-line vote.

Objs. (\"Pls.' Objs.\"), Sept. 15, 2017, ECF No. 187. Along with their objections, Plaintiffs filed several supporting records, affidavits, and expert analyses. One week later, Legislative Defendants responded to Plaintiffs' objections, asserting that this Court was without jurisdiction to consider the objections and that the objections otherwise were without merit.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Leg.

In particular,\n   Legislative Defendants argue that: (1) the enactment of the 2017 Plans rendered this action moot; (2) this Court's review of the 2017 Plans extends, at most, to determining whether the plans corrected the racial gerrymander; (3) this Court lacks jurisdiction under the three-judge panel statute to consider\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of Plaintiffs' objections other than the racial gerrymandering allegations that initially served as the basis of this panel's jurisdiction; and (4) this Court may not, as a matter of federalism, consider Plaintiffs' state law objections. We address each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Legislative Defendants first contend that the General Assembly's enactment of the new districting plans rendered this case moot.

In particular, Legislative Defendants argue that because the districting plans that served as the basis of Plaintiffs' challenge have been replaced, \"[P]laintiffs no longer have a concrete stake in the outcome of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.

And the Special Master's Recommended Senate District 28, which significantly improves on the district's compactness and more closely tracks Greensboro's municipal lines, indicates that the district's lines, and therefore its BVAP, were not, in fact, \"naturally occurring,\" but rather a consequence of the district's tracking of the core shape of Dr. Hofeller's VRA exemplar.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.B.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Legislative Defendants further argue that the district remedies the constitutional violation because a \"district anchored in eastern Greensboro that tracks the city boundaries\" could not be drawn with a lower BVAP without considering race.

But Legislative Defendants failed to introduce any evidence, much less race-neutral evidence, establishing that the General Assembly had to \"anchor[ ]\" the remedial district in eastern Greensboro-the predominantly black portion of the city that served as the \"anchor\" of the unconstitutional version of the district. Indeed, by deciding to \"anchor\" the district in the same predominantly black area as the unconstitutional version of the district and Dr. Hofeller's exemplar, Dr. Hofeller ensured that the district\n   would retain a high BVAP, thereby perpetuating the effects of the racial gerrymander.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   When viewed in totality, the district (1) preserves much of the core shape of the unconstitutional version of the district and Dr. Hofeller's VRA exemplar, (2) continues to have a BVAP that exceeds fifty percent, (3) divides Greensboro's VTDs and precincts along racial lines, and (4) has a low compactness score and is significantly less compact than the benchmark version in the plan in effect in 2010.

To be sure, the unusual borders in Sampson County are attributable in large part to the unusual borders of the selected precincts.

Defs.' Rec. Plan Resp. 4, 6. This argument wholly disregards the instructions this Court provided to the Special Master-and the Special Master's careful adherence to those instructions-and amounts to a baseless attack on the Special Master's integrity and credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   This Court's Appointment Order governing the drawing of the remedial districts did not direct the Special Master to pursue any BVAP target in drawing the remedial districts.

Likewise, the Special Master averred that in accordance with the Court's instructions, \"the remedial districts were drawn not with any racial target in mind, but in order to maximize compactness, preserve precinct boundaries, and respect political subdivision lines.\" Rec. Plan &amp; Rep. 21. To that end, the \"Special Master's Plan removes the racial predominance of the [racially gerrymandered districts in the 2017 Plan] by replacing the constitutionally tainted districts with others that adhere to explicitly race-neutral criteria.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. In particular, the Recommended Plans \"do[ ] not preserve the core shape of the unconstitutional version of the district[s], avoid[ ] dividing counties and municipalities, and attempt[ ] to enhance compactness,\" the Special Master explained.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. The Recommended Plans achieved those goals, more effectively respecting precinct and municipal lines than the 2017 Plan's versions and improving on the measures of compactness embraced by the General Assembly.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A;\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.B. Accordingly, Legislative Defendants' BVAP targeting argument amounts to a claim that the Special Master made false representations to the Court regarding the approach he followed in drawing the Recommended Plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In support of their attack on the Special Master's plans, Legislative Defendants rely on a report and opinion by their proffered expert in census data and geography in redistricting, Dr. Douglas Johnson, who Legislative Defendants retained\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they had already filed their Response asserting that the Special Master impermissibly pursued racial targets. Hr'g Tr. 78:19-21, 90:7-8, 104:19-22. Dr. Johnson opined as to the Special Master's \"[a]pparent [p]redominant [u]se of [r]ace [d]ata\" and that \"certain racial quotas were targeted by the Special Master when drawing the districts\" or \"dictated the configuration\" of the districts. Expert Rep. of Douglas Johnson, Ph.D. (\"Johnson Rep.\") 13, 15, 20, Dec. 27, 2017, ECF No. 234-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 78:17-19 (opining as to the Special Master's \"apparent quota of the African-American percentage of the voting-age population\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In support of his opinion, Dr. Johnson (a) points to \"the remarkable similarity in the African-American percentages of the Voting Age Population in the districts drawn by the Special Master\"; (b) highlights that the Recommended Plans reduce the BVAP in all of the racially gerrymandered districts in the 2017 Plan; and (c) notes that, for several of the racially gerrymandered districts, Dr. Johnson was able to draw a remedial configuration that, he maintained, more effectively advanced the General Assembly's objectives without bringing the district's BVAP \"into the Special Master's remarkably consistent [BVAP] range for his adjusted districts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-25. For several reasons, we find Dr. Johnson's analysis and opinion as to the alleged racial targeting in the Recommended Plans unreliable and not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   To begin, we fail to see how the alleged \"remarkable similar[ity]\" in the BVAP for districts redrawn in the Special Master's Recommended Plan proves that the Special Master drew his Recommended Plans to achieve a specific target BVAP. Dr. Johnson notes that Recommended Senate Districts 21 and 28 and House Districts 21 and 57 have BVAPs ranging from 38 percent to 44 percent, Johnson Rep. 14-a range Legislative Defendants characterize as \"narrow,\" Leg. Defs.' Rec. Plan Resp. 7. But Dr. Johnson conceded that the fact that several districts' BVAPs fall in a particular range does not prove that \"a racial quota was being employed.\" Hr'g Tr. 98:24-99:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Additionally, \"correlation [is] not evidence of causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

To the extent the BVAPs of those four districts are \"remarkabl[y] similar[ ]\"-and Dr. Johnson provides no basis for determining whether the BVAPs of the districts are \"similar\" from a statistical perspective-any such similarity may be attributable to the underlying demographic make-up of the geographic areas in which the districts are drawn or other non-discriminatory districting considerations, not racial targeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tagatz v.

And neither Legislative Defendants nor Dr. Johnson offer any controlled statistical analysis ruling out non-discriminatory explanations for the four districts' BVAPs. Absent such evidence, we find that the BVAPs themselves do not prove that the Special Master, contrary to his unambiguous statements to the Court, engaged in racial targeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The Special Master credibly explained why BVAPs decreased in Senate Districts 21 and 28 and House Districts 21 and 57. As he stated in his report, \"[t]he fact that the districts happen to reduce the [BVAP] in the redrawn districts, while increasing it in adjoining districts, is to be expected whenever a plan replaces racial predominance with other redistricting principles.\" Rec. Plan &amp; Rep. 19. Additionally, the Special Master noted that House District 33, which was a racial gerrymander in the 2011 Plan, had a slightly higher BVAP in the Recommended Plan, meaning that, contrary to Dr. Johnson's analysis, the Recommended Plan did not universally decrease the BVAP in redrawn districts that were previously racially gerrymandered. Accordingly, we find that the reduced BVAP in the four districts fails to demonstrate that the Special Master engaged in racial targeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Finally, Dr. Johnson provided one alternative configuration for several of the districts in the Recommended Plan, which, according Dr. Johnson, have lower BVAPs and somewhat more effectively adhere to several traditional redistricting criteria,\n   like compactness and population equality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even assuming Dr. Johnson is correct that his configurations more effectively advance these criteria-and reasonable minds could differ as to that conclusion\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   -Legislative Defendants cite no legal authority for the proposition that being able to produce a single alternative districting configuration that somewhat improves on certain districting considerations, while reducing a district's BVAP, establishes that a mapdrawer intentionally engaged in racial targeting. On the contrary, the Supreme Court has recognized that \"a State could construct a plethora of potential maps that look consistent with traditional, race-neutral principles,\" some of which may involve impermissible racial targeting, and others of which may not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bethune-Hill v.

Hr'g Tr. 92:23-93:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Beyond the alleged similarities in the districts' BVAPs and Dr. Johnson's alternative maps, Legislative Defendants offer no other direct or circumstantial evidence indicating that the Special Master used racial targets in drawing the districts' lines. Legislative Defendants' failure to put forward such evidence is particularly notable when compared with the extensive direct, circumstantial, and expert evidence that this Court relied upon both to find the that 2011 Plans relied unjustified race-based districting,\n   <em>\n    Covington I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352684\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/316/117/\">\n    316 F.R.D. at 130-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and to find that the 2017 Plans failed to remedy the identified racial gerrymanders in Senate Districts 21 and 28 and House Districts 21 and 57,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   In sum, Dr. Johnson's report and testimony do not in any way call into question the Special Master's repeated, credible, and unambiguous statements-made in his capacity as an officer of the Court-that he did not engage in racial targeting, and that any changes to the BVAP of districts in his Recommended Plan are attributable to his efforts to achieve the non-discriminatory redistricting objectives set forth in this Court's Appointment Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Legislative Defendants next contend that the Recommended Plans fail to achieve several of the General Assembly's statewide or district-specific political objectives.

Second, Legislative Defendants assert that the Recommended Plan violates the General Assembly's political decision to \"place the Fort Bragg precinct in [Senate District] 19 ... in order to provide the Republican incumbent ... with an opportunity to win that district.\" Leg.

However, as noted previously, a court-or a special master acting on a court's behalf-is barred from considering partisan or political objectives in drawing a remedial districting plan.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.2.

Plan &amp; Rep. 34-36;\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Recommended Senate District 28 abuts Senate Districts 24 and 27; however, the Special Master's Recommended Plan leaves the version of Senate District 24 in the 2017 Plan largely unchanged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rec. Plan &amp; Rep. 35. The recommended configuration decreases Senate Districts 27's population deviation by 2.0 percentage points, and increases Senate District 28's population deviation by 0.5 percent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. Both Recommended Senate District 27 and 28 improve on their counterparts in the 2017 Plan in terms of the compactness measures included in the Adopted Criteria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And in accordance with the Adopted Criteria, the recommended districts split fewer municipalities and precincts than their counterparts in the 2017 Plans-Senate District 27 would split one fewer precinct and Senate District 28 would split two fewer precincts and one fewer municipality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   In addition to reasserting their unsupported contention that Recommended Senate District 28 was the product of racial targeting, Legislative Defendants also object to the recommended configuration because two incumbents are paired in Recommended Senate District 27. Leg. Defs.' Rec. Plan Resp. 11-12. But neither Legislative Defendants nor Plaintiffs asked the Special Master to unpair the incumbents-one of whom is a Democrat and one of whom is a Republican-notwithstanding that the Special Master expressly provided them an opportunity to suggest approaches for unpairing the incumbents. Rec. Plan &amp; Rep. 37. And we find that the Special Master reasonably recommended against unpairing the incumbents because doing so \"would require significant restructuring of the district\" and that potential alternative plans for the districts would either take both incumbents \"out of\n   the territory that comprises most of their present districts\" or significantly reduce the district's compactness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38. Finding that the Recommended Senate District 28 cures the racial gerrymander and that Legislative Defendants' objections are without merit, we approve the Recommended Plan's reconfiguration of Senate District 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   3. House District 21\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Like its predecessor in the 2017 Plan, Recommended House District 21 spans a portion of Wayne County and the eastern edge of Sampson County. Rec. Plan &amp; Rep. 42. Unlike the unconstitutional version of the district and version of the district in the 2017 Plan, Recommended House District 21 no longer includes a protrusion into central Sampson County to take in the majority-black sections of the City of Clinton, while excluding the city's majority-white sections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The recommended configuration of House District 21 and its neighbor, House District 22, satisfies the one-person, one-vote requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. And the recommended configuration also, on average, improves on the two districts' compactness, as measured by the General Assembly's two preferred metrics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Recommended House District 21 has the same number of municipality or precinct splits as the version in the 2017 Plan, whereas Recommended House District 22 splits one fewer municipality than its counterpart in the 2017 Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Legislative Defendants again argue that Recommended House District 21's reduced BVAP relative to the version in the 2017 Plan is a product of BVAP targeting-a contention which finds no support in the record.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.1. Legislative Defendants further argue that Recommended House District 21 does not protect its incumbent as effectively as the version of the district in the 2017 Plan. But the Special Master was not authorized to draw a district to ensure an incumbent will prevail.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.B.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we reject Legislative Defendants objections and approve the Special Master's remedial configuration of House District 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   4. House District 57\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   As with the version in the 2017 Plan, Recommended House District 57 lies wholly within Guilford County. However, unlike the 2017 Plan version, the Special Master's recommended version of the district no longer includes virtually all of the heavily black precincts in eastern Greensboro, which were included in Dr. Hofeller's Guilford County VRA exemplar. Rec. Plan &amp; Rep. 45. And whereas the version of House District 57 in the 2017 Plan had a BVAP exceeding 60 percent-a substantially\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   BVAP than its unconstitutional version-by no longer dividing Greensboro's precincts along racial lines, Recommended House District 57 has a BVAP of 38.4 percent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   In order to reconfigure House District 57 to remedy the racial gerrymander, the Special Master had to reconfigure several other House districts in Guilford County (House Districts 59, 61, and 62). The Special Master's reconfiguration of those districts more effectively respects municipal boundaries than the 2017 Plan, containing three districts that lie almost entirely within Greensboro's city limits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-48. Additionally, pursuant to his obligation to respect the General Assembly's redistricting decisions to the extent possible, the Special Master maintained the shape of\n   House Districts 58 and 60, as they were drawn in the 2017 Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45 (\"The Special Master's Recommended Plan redraws House District 57, but keeps intact the other \"Subject Districts\" (House Districts 58 and 60) as redrawn in the 2017 Plan.\"). Each of the reconfigured districts satisfies the one-person, one-vote requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. The Recommended Plan's configuration is as compact as the 2017 Plan, and more compact than the 2011 Plan, in accordance with the Adopted Criteria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the recommended configuration does not pair any incumbents, and each incumbent retains a majority of his or her constituency from the 2017 Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Legislative Defendants again argue that \"the most significant difference in these two versions of [district] 57 is the BVAP,\" and that the \"shape difference\" between the two versions is \"explained by policy decisions which had nothing to do with race.\" Leg. Defs.' Rec. Plan Resp. 16-17. However, Legislative Defendants nowhere identify the nature of these alleged \"policy decisions\" (stating only, \"The 2017 district is based upon whole precincts located primarily in eastern Greensboro.\"),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , making it impossible for this Court to determine both whether the Special Master's recommended configuration in fact failed to advance those objectives and whether the Special Masters should have-or legally could have-advanced those objectives. Legislative Defendants also characterize Recommended District 61's increase in BVAP \"from 11.5% to ... 40.3%\" as \"astonishing,\" maintaining that the district \"would have been labeled a racial gerrymander\" if the General Assembly had recommended such a configuration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. But the Special Master did not target any BVAP percentage in drawing the Recommended Plans.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.1; Rec. Plan &amp; Rep. 53. The increase in Recommended District 61's BVAP is attributable to shift of voters from the General Assembly's proposed House District 57, which had a BVAP exceeding 60 percent, into Recommended House District 61, and was therefore a consequence of the Special Master's obligation to remedy the racial gerrymander.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50. Thus, we reject Legislative Defendants' objections and approve the Special Master reconfiguration of the Guilford County House districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   5. Wake County House Districts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   As the Special Master correctly recognized, the problem with the Wake County House district configuration in the 2017 Plan-that the General Assembly violated the North Carolina Constitution by redrawing districts untainted by the constitutional violation-is \"characteristically different\" than the four districts in the 2017 Plan that failed to remedy the racial gerrymander.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. The Special Master, therefore, took a different approach to reconfiguring the Wake County districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57. In particular, the Special Master first \"reinstate[d]\" the four untainted Wake County districts from the 2011 Plan that the General Assembly altered in the 2017 Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57. Then, he reconfigured some of the remaining Wake County districts so as to cure the racial gerrymander, satisfy the one-person, one-vote requirement, and improve on the districts' compactness and adherence to precinct and municipal lines, as required by the Adopted Criteria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-58. The Special Master left intact two 2017 Plan districts, which he did not need to change to remedy the violation and made only minor changes to a third.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Recommended Wake County House plan satisfies the one-person, one-vote requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60. The districts in the Special Master's recommended Wake County configuration are uniformly more compact and split fewer municipalities and precincts than those in the 2011 Plan configuration, in accordance with the Adopted Criteria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-61. The Special Master's\n   configuration is slightly less compact, on average, than the 2017 Plan, and splits more municipalities and precincts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These differences are attributable to the Special Master's obligation to reinstate the untainted districts in the 2011 Plan, which were less compact and split more municipalities and precincts than their counterparts in the 2017 Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Special Master's Recommended Plan does not pair any incumbents in Wake County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Legislative Defendants object to the Special Master's reconfiguration of the Wake County districts in his Recommended Plan on grounds that it unpaired two Democratic incumbents that were paired in his draft plan. Leg. Defs.' Rec. Plan Resp. 19-20. But the General Assembly's incumbency criterion expressed a preference for not pairing incumbents of \"either party\" in a district. Adopted Criteria for House and Senate Plans, Sept. 7, 2017, ECF No. 184-37. And in accordance with that legislative policy preference, this Court directed the Special Master to unpair incumbents if doing so would \"not interfere with remedying the constitutional violations and otherwise complying with federal and state law.\" Appointment Order 7. The Special Master reasonably concluded that unpairing the Democratic incumbents-which required moving six precincts between the two districts and did not materially impact the Recommended Plan's compactness or respect for municipal and precinct boundaries-did not undermine the integrity of his plan. Rec. Plan &amp; Rep. 62. Therefore, we again reject Legislative Defendants' objections and approve the Special Master's recommended reconfiguration of the Wake County House districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   6. Mecklenburg County House Districts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Like the Wake County House district configuration, the Mecklenburg County House district configuration in the 2017 Plan unnecessarily, and therefore unconstitutionally, altered the version of House District 105 in the 2011 Plan, which was not impacted by the identified constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64. In redrawing the Mecklenburg County configuration, the Special Master restored the lines of House District 105 to those in the 2011 Plan and, as a result, had to somewhat alter only three adjoining districts (House Districts 92, 103, and 104).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64. In doing so, the Special Master sought \"to keep precincts whole (outside of those already split by [the] 2011 [Plan's] District 105), to keep the districts in the area relatively compact and contiguous, and to make only the changes necessary to remedy the constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Special Master's configuration is slightly less compact, on average, than that of the 2017 Plan, and splits more precincts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These differences are attributable to the Special Master's obligation to reinstate the version of House District 105 in the 2011 Plan, which was noncompact and split a number of municipalities and precincts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-67. No party asserts any specific objection to the Special Master's reconfiguration. Therefore, we approve the Special Master's Recommended Plan for the Mecklenburg County House districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Finally, we consider the remaining districts of the 2017 Plans unaffected by our decision today. We earlier found the following additional districts unconstitutional gerrymanders: Senate Districts 4, 5, 14, 20, 32, 38, and 40; and House Districts 5, 7, 12, 24, 29, 31, 32, 38, 42, 43, 48, 58, 60, 99, 102, 107. The General Assembly enacted the 2017 Plans to remedy the constitutional violations related to each of these districts. The Supreme Court has provided that \"[t]he new legislative plan, if forthcoming, will then be the governing law unless it, too, is challenged and found to violate the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182252\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/535/#p541\">\n    437 U.S. at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182252\" index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/535/#p541\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   No party has raised a substantive challenge to any of these districts, and therefore no party has provided this Court with evidence that the 2017 Plans fail to remedy the constitutional violations we identified.

Under these circumstances, our district-by-district review cannot discern any apparent failure to adequately remedy the specific constitutional violation this Court identified. Therefore, the Court will approve and adopt the remaining remedial districts in the 2017 Plans for use in future elections in the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.
