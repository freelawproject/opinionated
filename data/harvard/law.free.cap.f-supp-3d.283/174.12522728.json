BRODERICK, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Parker Madison Partners brings this putative class action on behalf of itself and a class of licensed real estate brokers seeking injunctive and declaratory relief preventing Defendant Airbnb from engaging in alleged unfair competition and conduct violating section 349 of the New York General Business Law (\"GBL\") by virtue of providing real estate brokerage services in New York without the licenses mandated by the New York Real Property Law (\"RPL\"). (Doc. 18.) Before me is Defendant Airbnb's motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint. (Doc. 23.) Because I find that Plaintiff lacks Article III standing\n   to pursue its claims, Defendant's motion to dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Airbnb was founded in 2008 and is a \"marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world-online or from a mobile phone or tablet.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 32.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Airbnb facilitates approximately 25,000 rental transactions per day in New York City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Those who are members of Airbnb can either list and rent their properties (\"Hosts\") or find properties to rent (\"Guests\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 34.) Plaintiff and the purported class it seeks to represent are licensed real estate brokers and real estate brokerage companies in the State of New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8.) Airbnb is not a licensed real estate broker, but provides services such as listing and advertising rentals, and regulating and controlling an online forum through which its members must conduct their communications and negotiations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7, 39, 41.) Airbnb members have to agree to its term of service (\"TOS\"), and Airbnb (1) requires Guests to agree to permit Airbnb to handle the rental funds, (2) requires members to agree to give Airbnb absolute discretion to resolve disputes between its members, (3) offers Hosts the option of allowing Airbnb to set the prices of their rentals, (4) makes a free-of-charge photographer available to take pictures of Host properties, and (5) purchases outside advertising to promote its website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) Furthermore, Airbnb's TOS advises visitors to its website that Airbnb is not a \"real estate broker.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Airbnb also processes rental payments and takes a percentage of the payment as a fee and/or commission from the Hosts and Guests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Specifically, Airbnb charges Hosts three percent of the rental payments received, and processes that percentage prior to distributing the balance of the payments to the Hosts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) Airbnb also charges Guests a commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Airbnb does not disclose the precise percentage of those commissions, but rather states that they fall somewhere between six percent and twelve percent of the rental contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Airbnb does not avoid conflicts of interest and does not provide the standard disclosures and waivers provided by real estate brokers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 42, 46.) Plaintiff claims that as a result, \"licensed brokers ... are harmed by a massive-scale market competitor that performs real estate brokerage services without a license and without oversight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Plaintiff states that it and the putative class \"have an interest in not being subject to competition in a commercial arena reserved exclusively for licensed brokers, and in maintaining the integrity of the licensed real estate broker profession.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff further claims that by not following the RPL, \"Airbnb takes unfair advantage of the real estate rental market and the consumers who are entitled to the protections afforded by licensed and regulated real estate brokers,\" and that allowing Airbnb to continue operating in this way \"will have severe repercussions for the commercial space reserved for licensed real estate brokers\n   and render the protections of [the RPL] meaningless.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 17, 2016, Plaintiff filed this action, (Doc. 1), as well as a statement of relatedness, (Doc. 3), and on November 29, 2017, the case was accepted as related to a matter pending before me. (Dkt. Entry Nov. 29, 2017). Soon after the case was assigned to my docket, on December 7, 2016, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 4.) Defendant filed a letter addressing Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on December 8, 2016, (Doc. 10), and Plaintiff responded later that same day, (Doc. 11). I directed the parties to appear for a conference, (Doc. 12), which was held on December 20, 2016. During the conference, after Defendant expressed its desire to file a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on a lack of standing, I noted-and Plaintiff's counsel agreed-that if I do not have jurisdiction I would not \"reach the summary judgment issue.\" (Doc. 21 at 4:2-13). Based upon my discussion with counsel at the conference, I stayed briefing on the summary judgment motion, stayed discovery, and set a briefing schedule for Defendant's motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:8-12:18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff then filed an amended putative class action complaint on December 26, 2016. (Doc. 18.) Thereafter, in accordance with the briefing schedule set at the December 20 conference, Defendant submitted its motion to dismiss on January 31, 2017, (Doc. 23), along with accompanying papers, (Docs. 24-25), Plaintiff submitted its opposition on March 3, 2017, (Doc. 26), and Defendant submitted a reply on March 17, 2017, (Doc. 27). Plaintiff further filed a letter motion for leave to file a sur-reply, (Doc. 28), which I denied, (Doc. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Rule 12(b)(1)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A claim may be \"properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) when the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"\n   <em>\n    Makarova v.

Rather, Plaintiff's allegations consist of conclusory statements and untethered assertions culminating in the claim that Airbnb's continued operation would have \"severe repercussions to the commercial space reserved for licensed real estate brokers and render the protections of RPL \u00a7 440, et seq. meaningless.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that: (1) \"licensed brokers ... are harmed by a massive scale market competitor that performs real estate brokerage services without a license and without oversight,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9); (2) Plaintiff and the putative class \"will continue to suffer harm to their business interests and to the integrity of the licensed real estate broker industry,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55); and (3) Plaintiff and the putative class have an \"interest\" both in \"protecting their business interests and customer base,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54), and \"in not being subject to competition in a commercial arena reserved exclusively for licensed brokers and in maintaining the integrity of the licensed real estate broker profession,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). These conclusory statements are insufficient to establish injury-in-fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robainas v. Metro. Life Ins.

Compl. \u00b6 60.) Plaintiff's general allegations of \"damage to their business,\" \"threats to their industry and the professional standards\" of that industry, and \"substantial lost revenues\"-not directly tied to injury suffered by Plaintiff-do not establish any cognizable injury as they do \"not include a single example\" or give any details whatsoever as to any actual injury to Plaintiff connected to Airbnb's activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Treiber v.

In fact, as Defendant points out in its brief, there are no allegations in the Amended Complaint concerning any current or potential clients that have been lost to Airbnb, nor are there even claims stating that Plaintiff operates in the same market as Airbnb, let alone any allegations revealing how Plaintiff competes with Airbnb. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. 9 &amp; n.5.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robainas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205918200\">\n    2015 WL 5918200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (noting that \"[p]laintiffs do not allege that they would have purchased policies ... but for its nondisclosures\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In its opposition, Plaintiff does not respond or address these points, or in any way offer how it has been actually injured by Airbnb's actions. The fact that Plaintiff-despite having the opportunity to do so-fails to point to any specific fact supporting its injury or to connect that purported injury to the members of the putative class it seeks to represent is fatal to Plaintiff's claims. Indeed, Plaintiff's failure to point to any such facts is particularly telling given that Airbnb has been in business since 2008, and one would expect that if, in fact, Plaintiff suffered harm, it would be able to articulate that harm with a modicum of detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ultimately, any alleged \"injury\" derives solely from Airbnb's purported violation of the RPL by acting as a real estate broker without procuring the proper license. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 5-10.) In other words, Plaintiff does not point to specific improper acts of Defendant that have caused actual harm to it or its customers other than the alleged violation of the RPL. However, Plaintiff cannot establish a cognizable injury based solely on an alleged statutory violation, particularly a practice that \" 'is not inherently [problematic] but becomes problematic only' because it [allegedly] violates a 'provision of New York law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Treiber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=635%20Fed.%20Appx.%201\">\n    635 Fed.Appx. at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Schlessinger v.
