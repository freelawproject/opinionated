Plaintiff predicates his claims upon Defendant's efforts to collect a debt from him in March 2003. On May 12, 2003, Defendant and related companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On October 15, 2003, the bankruptcy court entered its Order Confirming Debtors' Amended and Restated Joint Plan of Reorganization, as Modified, and confirmed Debtor's Third Amended and Restated Joint Plan of Reorganization, as Modified. In its Notice of Confirmation of Debtors' Third Amended Plan of Reorganization Notice and Related Matters, the bankruptcy court specifically provided that the provisions of the Plan bound any holder of a claim and that debtors (which included the instant Defendant) were discharged by operation of Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code from any and all debts and claims that arose against them before the date of entry of the Confirmation Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 19, 2004, Defendant was served Plaintiff's complaint.

On March 24, 2004. Plaintiff acknowledged receipt of the letter and advised that he would not dismiss his complaint. After talking with Plaintiff, Defendant's counsel sent another letter setting forth Defendant's position that Plaintiff was in violation of the injunction of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and again requested that Plaintiff dismiss his complaint against the Defendant. On March 29, 2004, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint in which he expressly states that he waives any recovery of damages against the Defendant. However, in the second paragraph of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff expressly states that \"This Amended Complaint is not to be interpreted, construed, or accepted as any agreement or conclusion, by Plaintiff, to dismiss OSI from this action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

While such language would typically allow Plaintiff to proceed, he cannot reach Defendant's insurer. Under its policy of insurance, Defendant is responsible, under a retention provision, for the initial sum of $ 100,000 for each wrongful act resulting in a claim, other than a class action claim. Plaintiff brings his suit under the FDCPA and chapters 598 and 649 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Plaintiff seeks from Defendant statutory damages of $1,000 under the FDCPA and punitive damages of $25,000 under the Nevada Revised Statutes. The maximum recovery Plaintiff could recover from Defendant is $26,000 which would not allow him to recover from Defendant's insurer.

First, the Court finds undue delay in Plaintiff seeking to file a Second Amended Complaint. In requesting Rule 15 relief, Plaintiff attached the deposition of Mr. Shannon from one of Plaintiff's many lawsuits. This deposition occurred in April 2003. Thus, Plaintiff knew of Shannon's activities almost one year before he filed his original Compliant in early March 2004. Thus, there is no excuse for Plaintiff not naming Shannon in either his original or Amended Complaint, Second, the Court finds the Plaintiff's actions are based on bad faith. Realizing that his complaint will be dismissed due to the \u00a7 524(a) discharge and that he has failed to serve the other individual Defendants in the time frame set out in Rule 4(m) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has now sought to salvage his complaint by finding any employee of Defendant to name as a defendant. Coupled with the fact that Plaintiff knew of Shannon's activities well before he filed the instant action, these acts establish bad faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Attorneys' Fees.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its motion to dismiss, Defendant seeks attorneys' fees pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(3). This section provides, in part: \"On a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award to the defendant attorney's fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.\" The Court finds that Plaintiff's case was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment. After Plaintiff filed his complaint, Defendant's counsel advised him of Defendant's bankruptcy and requested voluntary dismissal. Plaintiff refused and insisted in advancing his claims notwithstanding the discharge. Most likely, Plaintiff brought this complaint in the hope of demanding a payment in exchange for the dismissal of this litigation. Plaintiff's past court experiences support this finding as Plaintiff is no stranger to litigation under the FDCPA. A review of the Court's records reveals that Plaintiff has instigated at least 45 actions in this Court alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In these cases, Plaintiff brought claims pursuant to the FDCPA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1681u, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\"ECOA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201691\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1691(f), among others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to these legal\n   actions, Plaintiff has also reached monetary settlement in more than 20 claims without needing to file suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a previous deposition, Plaintiff testified that he made a living by suing companies pursuant to the FDCPA, FCRA, and ECOA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff\n   also testified that his basic practice is to allege a violation of one or more of the federal acts and make an initial demand of $7,500.00 to settle the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff used this practice even when the debt was only a $32 bill from MCI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Plaintiff testified that in 2001 he received settlements of approximately $25,000 in five case by sending just his demand letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather than being the most harassed debtor in Clark County, Plaintiff's many lawsuits indicates his tactic of harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court will award Defendant reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.

The Court finds Plaintiff's allegation meritless. First, the insurance document Plaintiff attaches states that it applies to \"OSI Holding Corporation\" which is not the named Defendant. Second, the policy period for the $10,000 deductible was from the period December 31, 1999 through December 31, 2002. Because the events alleged in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint occurred in 2003, this insurance policy is irrelevant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Court will dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint as to the individually named Defendants for failure to serve them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Additionally, the Court finds that Plaintiff's amendment may well be futile.

The cases Plaintiff cites address personal liability under the FDCPA for presidents, directors, sole shareholders, general partners and owners of debt collection companies, and then, in some cases, only if the corporate veil has been pierced. Plaintiff states in his moving papers that Shannon is not a president, director, or officer of Defendant, thus undermining his argument based on these cited cases. Furthermore, the courts have not specifically addressed whether an employee who neither talked to the debtor nor sent a letter to the debtor is still liable under the FDCPA based solely on his employment. Based on Defendant's cited cases, the Court would not find such an employee liable under the FDCPA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Court arrived at this number by reviewing its electronic database and entering the Plaintiff's name as a search criterion.

Most likely the cost of litigation was more than Edward's demand. However, Edwards has sued parties who were willing and able to pursue the litigation process. While the Court is unable to evaluate the merits of Edward's claims in those lawsuits that were dismissed early in the progression of the case, a review of the lawsuits that did not settle or that settled after much litigation hints at the general frivolity of his claims. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Edwards v. Capital One\n    </em>\n    , No. CV-S-01-1170-LRH (PAL), Edwards sued Capital One regarding the rejection of his credit card application.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Complaint at 15-19,\n    <em>\n     Edwards v. Capital One\n    </em>\n    , No. CV-S-01-1170-LRH (PAL) (D. Nev. filed Oct. 10, 2001). Edwards sought compensatory as well as punitive damages in the amount of $420,000 because the required Regulation B disclosure language was on the third page of the rejection letter rather than the first page.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 16-19, 26.

Nev. filed Oct. 10, 2001) [hereinafter \"\n    <em>\n     Bill Heard Chevrolet\n    </em>\n    Complaint\"]. Despite having no lawful employment for the previous fifteen years, having recently experienced a bankruptcy and foreclosure action, and having previously worked in the automobile sales industry, see Edwards Dep. at 15, 41; Wall Dep. at 56, 59, 69, Edwards \"believed\" he would qualify for a lease of $500/month payment with $2,500 down,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bill Heard Chevrolet\n    </em>\n    Complaint at 13 n.7 (\"EDWARDS' initial offer was for financing with $2,000.00 down, and payments of $500.00 a month.\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Edwards Dep. at 45, 91 (\"A: She asked me how much I wanted to put down. I said I would like to keep it at $2,000. I believe I said I would probably go to 2500. I said I would like my payments to be somewhere around 500 a month for 36 or 48 months.\"). When such financing was not available, a representative of Bill Heard Chevrolet allegedly notified Edwards of alternative financing with a $10,000 down payment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Edwards Dep. at 54 (\"A: From what I remember, the next phone call was after the Jewish holidays, what they call Yom Kippur. Pam called me and said that, quote, We got you approved with $10,000 down, unquote.\");\n    <em>\n     but see\n    </em>\n    Wall Dep. at 76 (\"Q: Okay. When you were discussing the possibility of buying a car, did you say that with a 10,000 dollar down payment, he'd be approved? A: Absolutely not. I certainly did not have authority to tell him he would be approved for anything. And we never discussed an amount. The only figure that we ever discussed was that he didn't want his payments to be more than $500 a month. That is the only dollar figure we ever discussed. And then the price of the car was on the invoice. Money amounts, that's it.\"). Edwards rejected this alleged counteroffer.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Edwards Dep. at 54. A few days after this notification, Edwards filed his complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     but see Bill Heard Chevrolet\n    </em>\n    Complaint at 12-13 (\"That on or about August 31, 2001, EDWARDS was contacted by a salesperson from DEFENDANTS' location of 444 South Decatur Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada, who advised EDWARDS that he was approved for financing with a \"down payment\" of $10,000.00.\"). Not until the conclusion of discovery did Edwards state that he based his ECOA claim on the fact Bill Heard Chevrolet had failed to send him an adverse action letter after he had rejected the alleged counteroffer of a $10,000 down payment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Edwards Dep. at 89-92. Moreover, Edwards's actions since he approached the dealership were indicative that Edwards never desired to purchase a car. From the time he filed his complaint until his deposition in that case, Edwards did not purchase a Corvette nor did he seek to purchase such a car from any other Chevrolet dealer.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 67-77. It was also alleged that Edwards had on two occasions offered to settle his claims against Bill Heard Chevrolet in exchange for a brand new fully loaded, triple black Corvette.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Heard Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. Dismiss Defs.' Countercls. (# 40) at 4,\n    <em>\n     Edwards v. Bill Heard Chevrolet Corp.\n    </em>\n    , No. CV-S-01-1171-PMP (PAL) (D.

Nev. filed July 15, 2002).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Based on these three representative examples, Edwards' actions have an appearance of fraud. Collection companies do not randomly call individuals seeking payment of non-existent debts. While it may be understandable to have ten to fifteen debt collection cases since 1991, the fact that Edwards has conservatively had seventy such cases (50 lawsuits filed + 20 cases resolved without litigation) is suspect. Based on the number of cases filed, Edwards is one of the most litigious parties in Southern Nevada. If Edwards purposefully charges purchases knowing that he will not pay them back and then seeks to discharge them through threatened litigation, this may be evidence of criminal fraud that should be forwarded to the United States District Attorney's Office.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
