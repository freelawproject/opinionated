judicial process.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Peer v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678922\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/606/1306/#p1316\">\n    606 F.3d 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1316 (11th Cir. 2010). On the rare occasion when attorneys undermine that integrity and trust, there must be consequences. This is one of those rare occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Of the thousands of \"\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   product liability actions over which this Court has presided (\"\n   <strong>\n    Federal\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    Actions\n   </strong>\n   \"), the majority had to be resolved through a painstakingly piecemeal culling process. While the judicial books are closed for the litigants in the Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions, this matter cannot be concluded until The Wilner Firm, P.A. and Farah &amp; Farah, P.A. (collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Counsel\n   </strong>\n   \") and their principals, Norwood Wilner (\"\n   <strong>\n    Wilner\n   </strong>\n   \") and Charlie Farah (\"\n   <strong>\n    Farah\n   </strong>\n   \"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   are held to account for the immense waste of judicial resources and contempt shown for the judicial process occasioned by maintaining over a thousand non-viable claims. Counsel evinced a conscious disregard of their professional obligation to properly investigate such claims, obtain authorizations to file from clients, and-most importantly-communicate honestly with this Court. With the litany of litigation abuses recited here, the Court could never, in good conscience, sanction another lawyer in the future for failing to investigate a single claim if Counsel's failure here to investigate hundreds of actions were to be passed over, thereby implying that Counsel's indifference toward their professional obligations was acceptable because there were \"just too many\" potential claimants to do the job properly. The Court will not shrink from the formidable and unpleasant task of scrutinizing these filings individually and invoking the full authority of the judiciary, so as to renew the clarion call to the Bar that professionalism matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In January 2008, Wilner and Farah filed approximately 3,700\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny complaints in the Florida state and federal courts. The complaints alleged personal injury, wrongful death, and loss-of-consortium claims related to cigarette smoking. As it turns out, many of the plaintiffs never authorized Wilner and Farah to file a suit. Some had barely heard of them. Dozens did not meet the basic requirements for maintaining an\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny claim (some of the \"personal injury\" plaintiffs never even smoked, for example). Over 500 \"personal injury\" plaintiffs were\n   actually people who had died well before Counsel filed the complaints. Indeed, one of the \"personal injury plaintiffs\" had died 29 years earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court discovered these defects in 2012 only after it sent questionnaires directly to the named plaintiffs-over Counsel's objections. Before the questionnaire process, Wilner and Farah had insisted the Court need not inquire into the status of the plaintiffs; that a questionnaire process would not yield useful information; that there was no sizeable group of cases appropriate for dismissal; and that they could certify in accordance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that the complaints were viable. It was this obstructive, deceptive, and recalcitrant behavior that, in combination with the hundreds of frivolous complaints, compelled the Court to initiate sanctions proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As judges, we are properly cautioned against using 20/20 hindsight in evaluating the actions of lawyers in the context of unprofessional conduct. We are insulated from the hurly-burly of the practice of law, the press of client demands, the call of time sheets to log, and the occasional dictatorial demands of the Court. So it is, with that caution in mind, that a full explanation of the factors that motivate us to impose sanctions upon Wilner and Farah against the unique backdrop of these \"tobacco cases\" is warranted. The Court's findings here are drawn from a seven-month investigation by the Court's Special Master (the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida), careful consideration of the Special Master's Report and Recommendation (Doc. 2147 (\"\n   <strong>\n    2016 R &amp; R\n   </strong>\n   \")), Counsel's objections to the 2016 R &amp; R (Doc. 2165 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Objections\n   </strong>\n   \")), and the Special Master's Response to the Objections (Doc. 2170 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Response\n   </strong>\n   \")), comprising almost 600 pages of briefing and thousands of pages of exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court also has the benefit of a 2014 Eleventh Circuit opinion affirming the dismissal of over 500\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   personal injury actions that Wilner and Farah had filed on behalf of dead people, which noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [T]he root of the problem in all these [\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   ] cases is simple. Back in 2008, when these cases were originally filed, the law firm that brought them [Wilner and Farah] didn't have the time or resources required to fully investigate all the complaints (the firm in question filed claims on behalf of over 4,000 individuals). As a result, problem after problem cropped up once the District Court started going through the inventory of cases: there were personal injury claims filed on behalf of deceased smokers, wrongful death claims filed by \"survivors\" of smokers who were still living, cases filed as a result of \"clerical errors,\" multiple cases filed for the same person, cases filed for people the law firm had no contact with, claims that had already been adjudicated by another court, cases filed for people who didn't want to pursue a lawsuit, and claims filed long after the relevant limitations period had run. Over and over, plaintiffs' counsel explained that these problems were the result of the unique logistical difficulties involved in managing so many individual lawsuits. And over and over the District Court reminded counsel that a lawyer's responsibilities to the court are not diluted even by an ocean of claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1087 (11th Cir. 2014). The Eleventh Circuit also observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [T]he lawyers in these cases have established a pattern of acting on behalf of \"clients\" they have dubious authority to represent. As will become evident from the history of this mass action, plaintiffs' counsel have mostly managed their inventory of cases as they see fit, with scant contact with or input from the individuals they purport to represent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1088 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Given the importance of the matters at hand and the volume of pertinent materials, the Court has organized this unavoidably lengthy Order into six parts.

The Engle Class Action-1994 to 2006\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   From 1994 to 2006, a class action lawsuit between Florida cigarette smokers (or their survivors) and several major tobacco companies wound its way through the Florida state courts. The smokers alleged, among other things, that the tobacco companies negligently manufactured and marketed their cigarettes, that they had manufactured cigarettes that were defective and unreasonably dangerous, and that they had conspired to conceal the dangers of cigarettes. The \"\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class\" consisted of \"[a]ll Florida citizens and residents\" \"and their survivors, who have suffered, presently suffer or who have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Engle\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Engle I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7422977\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/672/39/#p40\">\n    672 So.2d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40, 42 (Fla. 3d DCA 1996) (alteration and quotation marks omitted). The class was estimated to number 700,000 people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In 1999, a jury in Dade County, Florida found generally that smoking causes certain diseases, such as lung cancer and coronary heart disease ; that cigarettes containing nicotine are addictive; that the defendant-tobacco companies negligently manufactured and marketed their cigarettes; and that the tobacco companies manufactured cigarettes that were defective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   , 945 So.2d at 1256-57 &amp; n.4. Years later, in December 2006, because \"individualized issues, such as legal causation, comparative fault, and damages predominate[d],\" the Florida Supreme Court decertified the class, and required class members to file individual lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1268. However, the Florida Supreme Court held that the original jury's findings should have preclusive effect in any action filed by an\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class member, meaning each plaintiff would not have to re-establish that the defendants were negligent, that their cigarettes were defective, or that cigarettes cause certain diseases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1269-70 ;\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris USA, Inc. v.

Instead, an individual plaintiff would have to prove only (1) that he is a member of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class, and if so, (2) that his addiction to cigarettes caused his particular injuries, and (3) the amount of his damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003106\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/110/419/#p424\">\n    110 So.3d at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Florida Supreme Court gave class members one year from the issuance of its mandate, or until January 11, 2008, to file individual complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   , 945 So.2d at 1277.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Potential Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class action wended its way through the state courts, Wilner says around 6,000 people contacted him about suing cigarette manufacturers (\"\n   <strong>\n    Potential Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R at 74-75). Assuming that the Potential Plaintiffs likely were members of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class, Wilner advised them that (1) Wilner could not represent them in individual actions given the time and expense required; and (2) the Potential Plaintiffs' best chance for recovery was through the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R, Ex. 10 at 2-3). Thus, between 1995 and 2008, Wilner collected names, but he did not \"make formal or special inquiry into the status\" of the Potential Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2016 R &amp; R at 75-76; Doc. 822 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   , Wilner scrambled to get in touch with the Potential Plaintiffs. Nonetheless, by the January 2008 deadline, Wilner had not been in contact with many of the Potential Plaintiffs in 10 to 14 years. (2016 R &amp; R at 76). According to Wilner, in the year between\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   and the January 2008 deadline:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   [W]e went manually through the 7,000 [contacts] as best we could.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:07-cv-760-J-25HTS, Doc. 35-2 at 1, 17). As it turned out, Counsel never should have filed many of the Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions-which alleged personal injury, wrongful death, and loss-of-consortium claims related to cigarette smoking-because: (a) many of the plaintiffs never authorized Counsel to file a lawsuit; (b) certain plaintiffs plainly did not meet the basic requirements for maintaining an\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny claim because they never even smoked or lived in Florida; and (c) over 500 \"personal injury\" plaintiffs were actually people who had died well before Counsel filed the complaints (\"\n   <strong>\n    Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n   \"). Indeed, when the Court pressed Wilner at the December 13, 2016 hearing about whether he had authorization to file the complaints, he repeatedly referred to agreements authorizing him to make a claim on the\n   <em>\n    Engle Trust Fund\n   </em>\n   , which is not an authorization to initiate litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 2174 at 126-35). Ultimately, when asked whether he had signed authorizations to initiate a lawsuit for each of the plaintiffs, Wilner admitted: \"Probably not.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

During that time, Counsel undertook a belated investigation into the status of the plaintiffs and their respective claims. Beginning in July 2009 and continuing through 2010, Wilner mailed so-called \"\n   <strong>\n    July 2009 Letters\n   </strong>\n   \" to 2,756 plaintiffs (\"\n   <strong>\n    Letter Recipients\n   </strong>\n   \"). (2016 R &amp; R at 179-80). The July 2009 Letters informed the Letter Recipients that, as a \"client\" of Counsel \"since the early 1990's tobacco litigation,\" Wilner had filed a lawsuit on their behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The July 2009 Letters also requested-a year and a half after Wilner filed the complaints-that the Letter Recipients return a questionnaire about the plaintiff's smoking history and medical diagnoses (\"\n   <strong>\n    Counsel Questionnaire\n   </strong>\n   \"), a \"Tobacco Litigation Authority to Represent,\" and an authorization for the release of medical records. Such requests suggest that Wilner did not obtain any of these things\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he filed the complaints. Even though Wilner had already filed suit on behalf of all 2,756 Letter Recipients, only 1,807 responded to Wilner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180). Whatever information Wilner learned from those 1,807 responses, however, it did not prompt him to correct any complaints or dismiss any actions for lack of viability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

On October 20, 2010, Counsel notified the Court that they were voluntarily dismissing 499 cases where a Duplicate State Action was pending. (Doc. 11). The Court asked Wilner why he was dismissing only 499 of the 660 cases that were filed in both courts, and Wilner replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Some of them are not-are not viable. And some of them are-were previously litigated. And we-if we were to dismiss them out of this [C]ourt, we'd be subject to the-to the two dismissal rules. So we had to be aware of that. So that's the only reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   But, yes, the-at the time we filed these in 2008, it was totally unclear. We knew that there was-this was a big block of litigation. And we're just trying to get a trial date. We're trying to move the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   (Doc. 31 at 74). As to the remaining cases, Wilner filed a case management brief \"on behalf of approximately 3800 claimants,\" in which he urged the Court to try groups of 100 to 500 cases at a time. (Doc. 25 at 1, 13).\n   <em>\n    Wilner ridiculed the Defendants' proposal to process cases individually, and in doing so-ironically-accused the Defendants of \"ignor[ing] the limited resources of the court system, and at worst consciously exploit[ing] them.\n   </em>\n   \" (Id. at 9) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In an Order dated December 22, 2010 (\"\n   <strong>\n    December 2010 Order\n   </strong>\n   \"), the Court dismissed the 499 cases and the number of Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions dropped to approximately 3,800. (Doc. 42 at 4). Concerned about case management issues created by\n   such a large number of actions, the Court ordered the parties to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   carefully and individually review each of the roughly 3800 remaining cases and to determine which of those cases is presently due to be dismissed (whether because a case has already been tried in state court, because a plaintiff has died leaving no heirs, or otherwise). No later than March 17, 2011, the parties shall each file a notice in the [M]aster [D]ocket which includes (1) a list of cases for which dismissal is sought, (2) a certification that the party has reviewed each individual case, and (3) a certification of compliance with Local Rule 3.01(g). By the same deadline, the parties shall file appropriate dismissal motions in the affected cases, specifically referencing whether the opposing side consents or objects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, \u00b6 8). Importantly, the Court reminded the parties \"of their continuing obligation throughout this litigation to inform each other and the Court when any of the remaining cases is due to be dismissed for any reason.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In January 2011, the Defendants recommended that Counsel gather basic information by interviewing each plaintiff. (Docs. 48, 48-1). Wilner responded that any information gleaned from individual interviews \"would not be worth much to anyone.\" (Doc. 61 at 3). Wilner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   balked at the suggestion that his law firm contact its clients to gather this information-citing the time and resources required and the likelihood that the information would quickly become outdated as more plaintiffs died over time. Thus, he stated the firm's intention to comply with the [C]ourt's [O]rder by just reviewing the information the firm already had in its files.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1092 (citing Doc. 61 at 3). Wilner also insisted that Counsel had:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   individual files for each plaintiff we represent, and we will make a good faith effort to screen each case for information contained within the file that suggests the case is not a viable one for reasons such as those described in the Court's order. We have already started this process and at this time expect, on the basis of some initial runs, to identify something like ten percent of the filed cases as appropriate for dismissal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   (Doc. 61 at 3). Given the dearth of information obtained before filing the Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 6), and the fact that more than 900 people failed or declined to reply to the July 2009 Letters, Wilner's claim that Counsel had \"individual files for each plaintiff\" was dubious. The Special Master's Report confirmed that Wilner's record-keeping was far less complete than he represented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Responses to the December 2010 Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In his March 17, 2011 response to the December 2010 Order (\"\n   <strong>\n    Counsel's 2011 Response\n   </strong>\n   \"), Wilner: (1) recommended dismissing another 136 Duplicate State Actions; (2) requested closure of 118 cases that resulted from a clerical error; (3) sought consolidation of 500 loss-of-consortium cases with their associated smokers' cases (\"\n   <strong>\n    Consolidation Request\n   </strong>\n   \"); and (4) moved for leave to withdraw from-but not to dismiss-332 cases (\"\n   <strong>\n    Withdrawal Request\n   </strong>\n   \") because \"these claims involve for the most part clients who have not been in contact with the undersigned or have claims that the undersigned cannot prosecute\" (\"\n   <strong>\n    Lost Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 114 at 2); (Docs. 114-1, 114-2, 114-3, 114-4). Wilner also certified by signature \"that counsel has reviewed each individual case in counsel's files for those that can be dismissed for the reasons listed above. Plaintiffs' counsel will continue to work with and review the cases within its files\n   and file additional notices of dismissal as appropriate.\" (Doc. 114 at 3). Counsel's 2011 Response inexplicably omitted mention of the myriad cases involving, for example, non-smoking plaintiffs, Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs asserting personal injury claims, and those whose claims were previously adjudicated (\"\n   <strong>\n    Previously Adjudicated Cases\n   </strong>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In their March 17, 2011 Response to the December 2010 Order (\"\n   <strong>\n    Defendants' 2011 Response\n   </strong>\n   \"), the Defendant tobacco companies provided a list of cases to dismiss, including: (a) 30 Previously Adjudicated Cases-including several cases Wilner himself had handled; (b) close to 250 cases that had Duplicate State Actions; (c) 125 actions that were duplicates of another federal court case; and (d) 25 actions where the plaintiff opted-out of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Class Action. (Docs. 113, 113-1, 113-2). Notably, the Defendants advised that Wilner did not represent the plaintiffs in several of the Duplicate State Actions-including two set for trial. (Doc. 113 at 2). This troubling information indicated that the plaintiffs who were represented in state court by\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    attorneys\n   </em>\n   likely did not authorize Wilner to represent them and were unaware that Wilner had filed Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions on their behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   On March 24, 2011, the Defendants filed a supplemental brief pointing out the differences between Defendants' 2011 Response and Counsel's 2011 Response (Doc. 128 at 11, 14), and noting that \"the lists developed by Defendants contain some plaintiffs with cases that the Wilner Firm should certainly have known had been previously adjudicated\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Ms. Joan Karbiwnyk, whose case has been filed in this Court under Docket No. 3:09-CV-13026-J-34HTS, is the same Joan Karbiwnyk whose claim was not only filed, but was in fact tried to a defense verdict-14 years ago\n   <em>\n    by Mr. Wilner himself\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). Another troubling example was Case No. 3:09-cv-10564, which Wilner brought in this Court on behalf of Diane Nelson. On February 16, 2011, the Defendants notified Wilner that Ms. Nelson's personal representative-Linda Patton-was deposed the year before in a different lawsuit. During the deposition, Ms. Patton testified that as the personal representative of Ms. Nelson she had long ago decided to drop the case, and in fact thought it had already been dismissed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Q.

After the April 2011\n   Order, roughly 2,900 Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions remained pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Having become concerned about Counsel's lack of case management, the Court appointed the late Michael J. Dewberry, Esq., as a Temporary Special Master to assist the Court in managing the cases. (Doc. 65). In a report dated April 22, 2011, the Temporary Special Master observed \"that neither side has any real grasp of the composition of the universe of cases, regardless of the actual number....Counsel know next to nothing about more than 90% of this action-the cases that remain stayed ....\" (Doc. 147 at 38). The Temporary Special Master wrote that \"[t]he absence of basic information\" created \"uncertainty as to the viability of the [stayed] cases,\" and that \"it is apparent that additional winnowing opportunities are both available and appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, the Temporary Special Master recommended sending questionnaires to each plaintiff to gather essential information. (Doc. 146 at 22-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Contending that they had been in contact with\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of their clients, Counsel objected to the questionnaire. (Doc. 158). Counsel asserted that their own \"data\" obviated the need to send questionnaires to the plaintiffs in the remaining 2,900 Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   This data is the product of ongoing and routine communications by telephone, mail, in person meetings, and electronic communications, between plaintiffs' counsel and the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    This data, however, will not result in \"a substantial reduction in the number of cases\" as the [Temporary Special Master] suggested might occur\n   </em>\n   ....Such winnowing has already occurred. On April 15, based upon the agreement of the parties, this Court dismissed 273\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   cases. In another 332 cases, [P]laintiffs' counsel has asked to withdraw due to lack of contact. Additional cases have been dismissed for other reasons including because the plaintiffs opted out of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   litigation. These efforts have resulted in the reduction of the federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   progeny cases from 4432 cases to a current total of roughly 2900 cases, a reduction of 35 percent. There may be additional cases that become untriable as this litigation proceeds because circumstances can always change, but\n   <em>\n    there is no longer any sizeable group of cases ripe for dismissal.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). Counsel assured the Court that \"[t]here is no need for the tremendous expense of energy and resources for a third party to poll the remaining plaintiffs because counsel already possess the vast majority of this data, and are working diligently to fill in all gaps.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15) (footnote omitted). Counsel reiterated that they \"are engaged in a constant and ongoing process of updating information and will continue to take appropriate steps if additional clients become unable or unwilling to pursue their claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). As the Court later learned, these assertions obscured the fact that hundreds of cases were fatally defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The June 2011 Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Court held a hearing on June 6, 2011 (\"\n   <strong>\n    June 2011 Hearing\n   </strong>\n   \") to address discrepancies between Counsel's 2011 Response and Defendant's 2011 Response, the 332 Lost Plaintiffs' actions, the Withdrawal Request, and other concerns. (Doc. 171). Judge Corrigan directly asked Wilner about the Lost Plaintiffs' cases-\"What was the basis upon which the claims were brought in the first place? Were you in contact with them at the time the suit\n   was filed on their behalf?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Wilner responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Many but not all. As we talked about earlier, we did have some claims that when the [\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   filing deadline] approached, we had them-we were historically in contact with them, and we had to file their claim because it must be preserved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   Most of them we were in contact shortly after, but we lose contact because people die, and so we don't always have contact at any given time. We have contact with the greater, by far, number, but there are always some that either die or go to a nursing home or something and we lose touch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Judge Corrigan then asked Wilner how the Lost Plaintiffs' cases were \"distinct\" from the cases that had been dismissed, and he asked whether Wilner was telling the Court that he was \"in direct contact with all of the remaining plaintiffs that [were] still pending in these cases?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Wilner responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Yes, your Honor, within the possibilities of being able to express that because you can't talk to everybody at once. So, yes, your Honor, as far as within statistical possibility, we are in\n   <em>\n    contact\n   </em>\n   with the remainder, but that changes every day.

Judge Howard then asked what Wilner meant by \"contact\"-\"When you say you're in contact with them, as of how recently have you actually had [contact?]...I'm saying, if you've heard from them three years ago, that doesn't really count to me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). Wilner agreed that three years would not count:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   No, that doesn't. It's not nothing, but that's not what I mean in contact. I mean within the past group of months, depending on how wide of a net we are talking about and how quickly we can go through it. We can't contact everybody at once; but we are in touch with them in recent history, meaning X number of months; and they indicated to us, through writings or personal interviews or telephone calls, they were\n   <em>\n    alive, present, willing, and all that.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). To clarify, Judge Howard asked whether \"within the last six months, all but the 332 [Lost Plaintiffs]...have expressed that they are willing and able to proceed with these claims? Is that your representation to the Court?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9). Wilner responded affirmatively-\"\n   <em>\n    Yes, absolutely\n   </em>\n   . The defense has gotten the idea that they are not. I don't know, but\n   <em>\n    we are in constant contact with them\n   </em>\n   ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9) (emphasis added).

WILNER: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).

How can we divide\n   them up in terms of do we have cases that have living people, we have death cases with survivors, we have death cases with no survivors? All of those, as you know, have-I mean, the elements of damage are going to be different with respect to each, and we are trying to figure out a way that we can triage these things and marshal them so that we can deal with them; and, frankly, we need some help, and we don't feel like we are getting it. That's the point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). Although Counsel told the Court that they were gathering information on their \"clients,\" the Court essentially told Wilner, \"though not in so many words, that it no longer trusted him.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court asked Counsel how long they would need to distribute and collect questionnaires. Counsel responded that three months would be enough time \"since they were in contact with all their clients and in the process of gathering the information sought by the [Temporary] Special Master.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court denied the Withdrawal Request and dismissed the 332 Lost Plaintiffs' actions. (Doc. 174). As such, approximately 2,600 Federal Engle Actions remained pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Court Questionnaires\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In August 2011, the Court ordered Wilner to send questionnaires to each of the remaining 2,600 plaintiffs (\"\n   <strong>\n    Court Questionnaires\n   </strong>\n   \"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   setting a November 2011 deadline for their return. Although Counsel mailed the Court Questionnaires \"to 2,661 unique addresses,\" Counsel returned only 1,724 completed questionnaires to the Temporary Special Master by the deadline.\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In moving for an extension to submit outstanding questionnaires, Counsel represented that they had not received questionnaires from 753 plaintiffs, but that they had been in contact with approximately 500 of those plaintiffs in the previous year. (Doc. 359 at 3-4). Counsel thus virtually admitted that they had not been in contact with another 200-or-so plaintiffs during the previous year. Such representations were at odds with Wilner's assertions at the June 2011 Hearing that he had been in contact with 2,600 of the remaining plaintiffs within the previous six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   In response to Counsel's motion for an extension, Defendants asserted that Wilner's filing of so many complaints in 2008 was problematic. As the result of \"discovery produced in one of the state cases in Duval County,\" Defendants learned that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   the Wilner Firm had, in fact, in many instances simply taken names from old files and listed them on those group complaints without determining whether the named individuals were legally authorized to pursue such a lawsuit or even wished to do so. As stated in the form letter to some of those people produced by the Wilner Firm, in 'the early 1990s'-15 or more years before the instant complaints were filed-the [Wilner] firm had collected the names of an unknown number of individuals apparently interested in the then-recently filed\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Class Action. But obviously, the fact that an individual might have been interested in participating as a passive class member in a case that might potentially be resolved on a classwide basis did not mean that he or she was legally authorized or willing to file an individual contested lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   (Doc. 360 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 465 at 3). The Court denied the motion for an extension, but it advised that-upon a showing of good cause-the Court might allow Counsel\n   to submit additional Court Questionnaires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 379).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Temporary Special Master detected problems almost as soon as he began analyzing the 1,724 Court Questionnaires. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 503). According to a report issued by the Temporary Special Master in January 2012 (\"\n   <strong>\n    2012 Temporary Special Master's Report\n   </strong>\n   \"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   (1) 521 plaintiffs were already deceased (some for more than 20 years) when Counsel filed personal injury actions on their behalf;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   (2) 66 plaintiffs were living when Counsel filed wrongful death actions on their behalf;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   (3) 64 deceased plaintiffs had no survivors when Counsel filed wrongful death cases on their behalf; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   (4) Counsel filed 39 wrongful death cases that were barred by the statute of limitations [ (\"\n   <strong>\n    SOL\n   </strong>\n   \") ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-14). All of these defects led the Temporary Special Master to conclude that \"the current universe of 1,700 cases [in which questionnaires were returned] is still inflated to an unknown extent\" by non-viable claims and by plaintiffs who were unwilling or unable to proceed with the claims Counsel brought on their behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Motions to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Without explanation, Counsel moved to voluntarily dismiss 189 cases in January 2012 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiffs' 2012 MVD\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 452). Two months later, Defendants moved to dismiss 39 time-barred wrongful death actions and 521 personal injury actions that Counsel had filed on behalf of Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs (\"\n   <strong>\n    Defendants' 2012 MTD\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Docs. 581, 582). The Defendants noted that about 30% of the cases where a Court Questionnaire\n   <em>\n    was returned\n   </em>\n   -to say nothing of the hundreds of cases where no questionnaire was returned-\"were filed as personal injury actions in the names of already deceased smokers.\" (Doc. 582 at 2). The Defendants emphasized that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   these defective complaints do not rest on some \"contingent\" or \"alternative\" pleading, as where a personal injury action is somehow pled along\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   a survival or wrongful death action. To the contrary, the complaints listing the 521 [Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs] assert\n   <em>\n    nothing\n   </em>\n   but a personal injury action-using the\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   tense in referring to the \"Smoking Plaintiffs\" and arguing that they \"have\n   <em>\n    and will suffer\n   </em>\n   \" as a result of their disease.... Nowhere do the complaints suggest that the smoker had died; and nowhere do they assert a wrongful death or survival action. To the contrary, the concluding allegation of each of the complaints states that each Smoking Plaintiff's injuries \"are permanent\n   <em>\n    and continuing and as such will be suffered into the future\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4) (emphases in original) (citations omitted). The Defendants further noted that \"since these cases were filed solely as personal injury actions, it is clear that in no case did anyone even purport to authorize their filing on behalf of the estate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The Defendants added that Counsel had known about these defective complaints for at least six months, when they received the Court Questionnaires from the deceased plaintiffs' families. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 n.4). Yet Counsel took no\n   action until after the Temporary Special Master reported the results of the Court Questionnaires and the Defendants moved to dismiss the cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Wilner Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   On April 6, 2012, Wilner filed a response to the Defendants' 2012 MTD (Doc. 589) along with the Declaration of Norwood Wilner (\n   <strong>\n    \"Wilner Declaration\"\n   </strong>\n   ) (Doc. 589-1). Attempting to explain why he filed over 500 personal injury cases on behalf of dead plaintiffs, Wilner advised that by 1998, he \"represented over 3,000 Florida smokers or their families. These clients\n   <em>\n    were signed into contractual agreements\n   </em>\n   giving the firm latitude as to the appropriate method to preserve and advance their claim against the cigarette companies.\" (Doc. 589-1, p.1 \u00b6 4) (emphasis added). He claimed that when\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   was decided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   <em>\n    my firm had successfully remained in contact with most but not all of these clients\n   </em>\n   during the decade long period between their initial contact with the firm and [\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   ]. Unfortunately, some had been lost to follow up, usually because they had died and their heirs or family were unaware of their having requested representation for cigarette-related injuries. However, after consulting with a legal ethicist who had been the Ethics Director of the Florida Bar from 1989-1997, I came to view it as my professional duty to make protective filings on behalf of these clients whom we could not locate prior to the time their claims had to be filed in order to be preserved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p.2 \u00b6 7) (emphasis added). Admitting that he filed suit on behalf of over 500 plaintiffs without knowing their status, Wilner asserted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   [b]ecause the status of the original claimant was unknown at the obligatory deadline for filing damage claims, and because the Florida Supreme Court did not elaborate on what format was required for a \"damage claim,\" I elected to list all claimants of unknown status under the name of the injured or deceased party, who had first contacted me or my firm. These claims were filed as a list in groups of 200, nominally under the name of the injured party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p.2 \u00b6 8). Finally, Wilner asserted that \"[i]n the time following the filing, efforts to locate survivors were successful in all but a few cases, and those\n   <em>\n    survivors ratified the filings nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p.2, \u00b6 9) (emphasis added). Despite these alleged \"nunc pro tunc\" ratifications, Wilner never moved to amend any of the complaints, and he never let the Court or anyone else know that more than 500 personal injury complaints named a dead plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Like this Court, the Eleventh Circuit was not satisfied by the Wilner Declaration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   That's it. We are not told what The Wilner Firm did to keep up with its clients during the decade or so that Engle was winding through state court, how many of those clients it lost touch with before\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   came down in December 2006, what efforts it took following\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   to reestablish contact, or how many of these missing clients it failed to contact before a lawsuit was filed on their behalf in January 2008. Nor are we told what information Mr. Wilner used to draft complaints for the missing clients, when those clients had last been in contact with the firm, or what efforts were taken to update client information and otherwise investigate the validity of their cases. And Mr. Wilner's declaration did not even mention, much less explain, how his firm came to file personal injury cases on behalf of smokers who died before the mid-'90s-who\n   obviously did not contact his firm to request representation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1110-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The June 2012 Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   To address the issues raised in the 2012 Temporary Special Master's Report and Defendants' 2012 motion to dismiss, the Court held another hearing on June 24, 2012 (\"\n   <strong>\n    June 2012 Hearing\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 677). Wilner did not attend the June 2012 Hearing, so the Court questioned Wilner's co-counsel-Elizabeth Cabraser of Lieff Cabraser-concerning the many suspect statements in the Wilner Declaration. As the Eleventh Circuit recounted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   In light of the fact that Mr. Wilner hadn't had any recent contact with these \"clients\" when he filed claims on their behalf in 2008, the court found it highly unlikely that he had any authorization to file suit or that he had investigated the validity of these claims. Moreover, the [C]ourt pointed out, a number of the [Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs] had died before Mr. Wilner even started collecting tobacco clients-a group that Mr. Wilner's declaration had not even mentioned. Ms. Cabraser didn't have any answers for the court; she explained that she hadn't been around back then and so she just stood on Mr. Wilner's (incomplete) declaration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   The [C]ourt also doubted that [Counsel] had really tracked down and received authorization \"\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   \" from these [Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs'] survivors. In fact, the court asked Ms. Cabraser if the attorneys had only learned of all these [Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs] once they received responses to the [Court Questionnaires]; her reply: \"I don't know.\" As for the suggestion that the [S]tay-which the [C]ourt left in place at the parties' request to help manage the mass of cases-absolved [C]ounsel of any obligation to fix their mistakes in a timely manner or otherwise inform the court that in 521 of the cases they had pled the wrong cause of action and named the wrong plaintiff, the court tersely responded, \"Really?\" And addressing [C]ounsel's request that they now be allowed to go back and fix all their mistakes, the [C]ourt had this to say:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   These cases were filed, clearly, with no authorization from the client, with no compliance with Rule 11, with no good faith inquiry into whether or not there was a viable basis for a claim, and now the Court is being asked under the purview of Rule 15 to somehow allow you to amend and relate back to a pleading that was filed on behalf of someone that was long dead and never authorized the institution of the action somehow under the rubric of doing justice and putting the Court in the position of [\"]how can you not allow these people to have a claim brought on their behalf[?\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   It's an untenable situation, [Ms. Cabraser], that you are asking the Court to occupy....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1101-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Doc. 677 at 59-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The Court explained to counsel that the volume of cases did not lessen their obligations reasonably to investigate the claims and remain up-to-date on the status of the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   JUDGE DALTON: [Ms.] Barnett, I don't mean for either you or [Ms. Cabraser] to be the whipping posts on this, but we have tried to make this point to Mr. Wilner and his firm from the outset that the volume of claims is a given. We understand that. We understand the practical difficulty of trying to manage that because we are experiencing it ourselves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   That said, as we have expressed to Mr. Wilner, the volume of claims does not render the fundamental precepts of lawyer-client\n   responsibilities, vis-\u00e0-vis the client and vis-\u00e0-vis the Court as procedural niceties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   The rules with respect to filing papers, prosecuting claims on behalf of people that you don't truly represent, that's not something that the Court is inclined to overlook. And we have tried to make that point. We have tried to do it in a way that is as accommodating as we can be to the difficulties that [C]ounsel is obviously having in trying to manage this large group of people; but there comes a day-and that day is here-where the Court really is left with no option other than to say, is this a viable claim, do you really represent this person, does this person wish to pursue this claim. And if you continue to tell us that the answer to those questions is in the affirmative and it turns out that it's not true, there are going to be consequences. And I don't say that in a way to try to hold a sledge hammer over the plaintiffs' heads.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   I'm simply trying to communicate to you all the fact that we have been struggling with this amongst ourselves trying to figure out how do we make sure that the people who have meritorious claims, that are not barred by operation of law, have full and open access to the judicial process to get those claims heard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   We have four federal judges sitting up here trying to work through some of this labyrinth of issues that are presented by these claims; but I need you all-and I think I speak on behalf of my colleagues-to hear this loud and clear. If there are filings from this point forward on behalf of people that you do not represent, who do not wish to have the claims brought, that there are going to be Rule 11 consequences for that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   (Doc. 677 at 40-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The Court questioned whether the 500-plus predeceased personal injury plaintiffs ever qualified as Wilner's \"clients\" to begin with:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   JUDGE DALTON: [Ms. Cabraser], that's the problem. It couldn't have been your client. And I say \"you\" collectively. It couldn't have been your client, because if it were your client, you would have had an authority to represent them. You would have had a conversation with your client. You would have had your client's authorization to proceed. Your client would have authorized you to avail him or herself of the court system and authorized you to file a complaint on his or her behalf seeking redress for injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   <em>\n    You couldn't possibly file on behalf of somebody who is dead.

During the trial in\n   <em>\n    Denton v. R.J.

(Case No. 3:09-cv-10036, Doc. 189 at 92-93;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Doc. 190 at 27-30;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Doc. 200 at 157-59). Although Ms. Larramore was the plaintiff named in Case No. 3:09-cv-13138, it was clear that she was unaware of the case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   THE COURT: Do you know, ma'am, whether you and [your husband] or either one of you were ever part of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   [C]lass or ever part of the lawsuit that was filed on behalf of tobacco smokers?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   JUROR LARRAMORE: No. Now, some people, some lawyer from-I can't remember if it was California or Washington, called me, and I denied the right to be in that lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.

Ms. Larramore was shocked to learn Wilner had filed a lawsuit on her behalf anyway, and was relieved to learn that it would be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Doc. 190 at 27-28). In the meantime, Wilner's actions disrupted the\n   <em>\n    Denton\n   </em>\n   trial, as the Court had to query Ms. Larramore before dismissing her from the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   The Larramore action was not the last case to be dismissed under circumstances indicating that sanctions against Counsel might be warranted. Accordingly, beginning on August 23, 2012 (Doc. 758), the Court began reserving Rule 11 jurisdiction each time it dismissed Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docs. 780, 835, 864, 909, 925, 929).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Case Dismissals in 2012 and 2013 and Appointment of Special Master\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   On July 31, 2012, Counsel finally explained the reasons why they had moved in January 2012 to dismiss 189 cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 452, 718). Specifically, Counsel moved for the voluntary\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   dismissals because: (a) two plaintiffs were involved in Duplicate State Actions; (b) five plaintiffs had no\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   disease; (c) 58 plaintiffs did\n   not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   's requirement of Florida residency; (d) 36 plaintiffs did not wish to pursue the litigation; (e) 53 actions were barred by the SOL; and (f) 35 actions were brought on behalf of Non-Smoker Plaintiffs. Alarmed by some of these reasons-particularly, the Non-Smoker Plaintiffs-the Court nonetheless: (a) granted the plaintiffs' motion to dismiss; (b) dismissed the cases; and (c) reserved jurisdiction over each of the 189 cases \"for the limited purpose of making further inquiry and addressing the circumstances surrounding the filing of each of these cases, as well as any Rule 11 implications.\" (Doc. 780 at 2, 3). In September 2012, the Court also dismissed 644 cases because no Court Questionnaire had ever been returned, likewise reserving jurisdiction to make a Rule 11 inquiry. (Doc. 787). Thus, by the end of September 2012, 1,800 Federal Engle Actions remained pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The Court continued to dismiss cases that did not belong on the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Docket. In November 2012, the Court dismissed 37 cases that were barred by the SOL. (Docs. 835, 835-1). In January 2013, the Court dismissed the 521 personal injury cases filed on behalf of dead plaintiffs (\"\n   <strong>\n    January 2013 Order\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 925). Recalling Wilner's contention that he received filing authorization from the Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs' survivors \"nunc pro tunc,\" the Court observed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   It is not clear at this point...when Plaintiffs' counsel located the survivors and whether they did so as a result of the Court-ordered questionnaire process, as a result of [Counsel's] independent efforts, or both. What is clear, however, is that Plaintiffs' counsel made no effort to bring to the Court's attention, until required to do so by the [Court Questionnaire] process, that they had filed suits in the name of over 500 dead people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, n.3). Further,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-242\">\n   Mr. Wilner acknowledges in his declaration that these cases were \"protective filings\" on behalf of clients who could not be located and whose status was unknown. (Doc. 589-1 at \u00b6 7). However, whether counsel undertook any significant effort during that year to confirm the status of their clients remains unestablished in the record. The filing of personal injury claims on behalf of these 521 individuals who were already dead (some had been dead for many years) suggests counsel may not have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Finally, the Court rejected Wilner's argument that he thought the Stay absolved him of his duty to correct hundreds of defective complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11). The Stay had not prevented counsel from filing protective motions to substitute personal representatives in other cases when a plaintiff died while the action was pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). The Court added that the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   circumstances of the filing of the 521 cases are now the subject of a Rule 11 motion filed by the Defendants (Doc. 813), which Plaintiffs oppose. (Doc. 822; Doc. 824). The Court declines to address this issue or the Rule 11 motion further in the context of this Order. However, the Court will reserve jurisdiction over these cases for the limited purpose of making further inquiry and addressing the circumstances of the filing of these cases, as well as any Rule 11 implications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, n.8). After the January 2013 Order, 1,200 Federal Engle Actions remained pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Between February 2013 and August 2013, the Court dismissed over 300 more cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 929, 951, 1101, 1102, 1130). Notable were the Court's Orders in\n   June 2013, in which it dismissed on the Defendants' motions another 67 cases that involved Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs' personal injury claims (Doc. 1101), as well as another 151 cases where the plaintiff failed to return a questionnaire (Doc. 1102). By the end of August 2013, only 1,000 Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions remained pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Pause to reflect how much things changed between mid-2011, when the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Docket stood at 2,900 cases, and August 2013, by which time only about a third of that number remained. In May 2011, Counsel insisted there was no need to send questionnaires to the plaintiffs; that counsel had \"ongoing and routine communications\" with nearly all the plaintiffs; that any data gathered by questionnaires would \"not result in a 'substantial reduction in the number of cases' \"; that significant \"winnowing ha[d] already occurred\"; and that \"there is no longer any sizeable group of cases ripe for dismissal.\" (Doc. 158 at 14-15). The next month, Wilner stood before the Court and represented that he was in contact with 2,600 plaintiffs, and that he could file Rule 11 certifications for each of the remaining 2,900 cases. But Counsel's representations could not have been more wrong. By August 2013, it had become clear that hundreds of cases were not viable, for \"[a]s any lawyer worth his salt knows, a dead person cannot maintain a personal injury claim.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1086-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Many more cases were not viable for various other reasons, including some where plaintiffs never smoked or never authorized a lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   The winnowed\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Docket progressively shrank, with the Court trying cases and others settling or being dismissed. In February 2015, the tobacco companies and the remaining plaintiffs announced that they had reached a tentative settlement valued at $100 million. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1919). Each of the last 415 plaintiffs eventually ratified the settlement (\"\n   <strong>\n    Settlement Agreement\n   </strong>\n   \") (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 2092), and the Court approved the creation of the Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Settlement Fund to disburse the settlement proceeds and attorneys' fees (Doc. 2090). The Court made clear, however, that the settlement of the remaining cases would not end the Court's inquiry into whether Counsel violated Rule 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or the Local Rules. (Doc. 2094 at 2-3). Thus, the Court required that the amounts set aside in the settlement fund to pay attorneys' fees and costs be frozen until it could adjudicate the sanctions issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Because \"the Court wishe[d] to maintain its role as [a] neutral adjudicator of these matters,\" it proposed \"appointing the United States Attorney to investigate the issues and recommend to the Court how it ought to proceed under Rule 11, \u00a7 1927, the Local Rules, the Court's inherent authority, and its obligation to ensure the appropriateness of attorney's fees and costs under the Settlement Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The Court solicited the parties' feedback. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The Defendants agreed to withdraw their Rule 11 motion as part of the Settlement Agreement; as such, they took no position on the sanctions issue. (Doc. 2098). Meanwhile, Counsel argued that such an investigation was unnecessary. (Docs. 2097, 2100, 2101, 2102). On December 22, 2015, the Court appointed the U.S. Attorney to serve as a Special Master (distinct from the Temporary Special Master) to investigate whether Counsel's conduct warranted sanctions under Rule 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or the Court's inherent authority (\"\n   <strong>\n    Referral Order\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 2108). The Referral Order delineated specific issues and incidents of concern (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-6), directed the Special Master to investigate, and set a schedule for the submission of a\n   Report and Recommendation, objections, and a response (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The 2016 Report and Recommendation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Seven months later, the Special Master submitted the comprehensive 298-page 2016 R &amp; R that is before the Court (Doc. 2147), along with several thousand pages of exhibits. While recommending no sanctions against the other firms representing plaintiffs, the Special Master found that Wilner and Farah had violated Rule 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court's Local Rules, and the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct. The Special Master recommended, among other things, that the Court order Counsel to disgorge all attorney's fees and costs recoverable in this\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel filed Objections totaling 242 pages (Doc. 2165), along with over 1,800 pages of exhibits. The Special Master filed a 48-page Response. (Doc. 2170).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <strong>\n    J. The December 2016 Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   The matter came before the Court for a day-long hearing on December 13, 2016, during which the Court heard argument from both sides, as well as extensive remarks from Wilner and a more limited statement from Farah. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 2174 at 90-143). The analysis and conclusions that follow are informed by the Court's familiarity with the record, the comprehensive briefs and exhibits submitted by both sides, and the December 13, 2016 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   <strong>\n    PART II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Before discussing whether Wilner's and Farah's conduct is sanctionable, the Court addresses an issue that they raised for the first time at the December 13, 2016 sanctions hearing. Although nowhere argued in their 242-page objections to the 2016 R &amp; R-or at any other time in the months after the hearing was scheduled-Counsel protested on the morning of the hearing that the hearing would not afford them adequate procedural due process. Counsel argued that the Court must give them the same procedural due process that attends a criminal trial: the right to present witness testimony; the right to discovery; the right to a trial by jury; and the right to require that the Special Master prove violations of Rule 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and any other ethical duties beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court disagrees. Below, the Court explains why the procedures accorded Wilner and Farah satisfy the requirements of procedural due process, as well as the particular procedural requirements of Rule 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

With respect to notice, Counsel received ample warning that sanctions may be imposed, the authorities under which sanctions might be imposed, and the reasons why. As early as the hearing on June 6, 2012, the Court warned Counsel that there may be \" Rule 11 consequences\" for the manner in which they conducted the federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   litigation. (Doc. 677 at 41). Beginning in August 2012, the Court began including a notation in each order dismissing cases that it was \"reserv[ing] jurisdiction to make further inquiry and address the circumstances surrounding the filing of this case, and any Rule 11 implications.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 758 at 2). On October 26, 2012, the defendants filed their own \"Motion for an Inquiry Under Rule 11 as to Cases Filed as Personal Injury Actions in the Names of Deceased 'Plaintiffs' \" (Doc. 813), giving Counsel further notice of the specter of sanctions. In November 2015, as the Court ordered the disbursement of proceeds from the global settlement, the Court advised Counsel that sanctions proceedings were forthcoming, and invited Counsel to \"make whatever arguments they wish or any suggestions as to how the Court ought to navigate this unusual situation.\" (Doc. 2094 at 2-4). Then on December 22, 2015, after hearing from the parties, the Court appointed the Special Master so that the Court could maintain its role as a neutral arbiter in the sanctions proceedings. (Doc. 2108). In so doing, the Court laid out the specific conduct that the Court thought warranted investigation, the authorities that might justify the imposition of sanctions (including Rule 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Court's inherent power), and the procedures that the Court intended to follow. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, the Special Master's comprehensive 2016 R &amp; R (Doc. 2147) laid out in painstaking detail the conduct that the Special Master believes warrants sanctions, the reasons why, and the applicable authorities. Thus, there can be no dispute that Counsel received ample notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Nor can there be any dispute that Counsel had an adequate opportunity to respond. At the Court's invitation, Counsel responded to the Court's proposal to appoint a Special Master. (Doc. 2102). This gave Counsel an initial opportunity to address the Court's concerns, as well as a chance to give input on the procedures for determining whether sanctionable conduct occurred. (Counsel did not at that time suggest that they were entitled to a criminal trial). During the Special Master's investigation itself, Counsel had several opportunities to justify their conduct to the Special Master, as reflected by several exchanges between the Special Master and the Wilner Firm. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1, 6, and 10 to 2016 R &amp; R). After the Special Master issued his 2016 R &amp; R, Counsel had the opportunity to respond to the Special Master's findings, and they did so, filing an extensive 242-page objection, along with over 1,800 pages of exhibits.

However, in view of the seriousness of the matter, the Court provided further procedural safeguards.

Issuing a further show cause order at this point, after having received hundreds of pages of briefing on the issue of sanctions, thousands of pages of exhibits, and having held an oral hearing, would be superfluous.

As discussed more fully in Part I and\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court learned in 2012 and 2013 that Counsel had filed personal injury complaints in the 588 Actions on\n   behalf of people who were already dead as of the filing date. In 554 of the 588 Actions, or about 95%, the plaintiff had been dead for a year or longer before Counsel filed the complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1096 n.16 ; (Docs. 933-1, 937-1). The Court did not discover this astonishing fact until the actions had been pending for four years, and the Court ordered Wilner to mail the Court Questionnaires to over 2,600 plaintiffs. Not once during those four years did Counsel do anything to advise the Court or opposing counsel about the fatally defective complaints. To the contrary, Counsel repeatedly resisted proposals that someone inquire into the status of the plaintiffs, and insisted that they were in contact with their clients and that they would be willing to certify that the complaints satisfied Rule 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The 588 Actions Were Objectively Frivolous\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   The complaints filed in the 588 Actions were objectively frivolous. As the Eleventh Circuit observed, \"any lawyer worth his salt knows [that] a dead person cannot maintain a personal injury claim.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1086-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The complaints listing the 588 Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs alleged only a personal injury action-using the present or future tense in referring to the \"Smoking Plaintiffs,\" and asserting that they \"have and will suffer\" as a result of their disease. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Edwin Moody et al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:08-cv-155-J-32HTS, Doc. 2, Complaint at \u00b6 1.10). Nowhere did the complaints suggest that the smoker had died, and nowhere did they assert an alternative wrongful death or survival action. To the contrary, the concluding allegation in each complaint stated that each plaintiff's injuries \"are permanent and continuing and as such will be suffered into the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.1). These allegations were demonstrably false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   The complaints in the 588 Actions were also frivolous because Counsel lacked authorization to file or maintain them. \"Perhaps the most basic factual contentions implicit in a complaint are that the plaintiff consents to the filing of suit and prays for the relief requested.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Deep Vein Thrombosis\n   </em>\n   , No. MDL-04-1606 VRW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202568269\">\n    2008 WL 2568269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 24, 2008). The dead plaintiffs obviously could not have authorized Counsel to bring lawsuits on their behalf. Nor did Counsel have authorization from the Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs' estates or their survivors because Counsel pled the complaints as personal injury actions on behalf of the Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs themselves. Therefore, \"the most basic factual contention implicit\" in the 588 personal injury complaints, i.e., that the plaintiff authorized and prayed for the relief requested, was untrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Counsel \"Later Advocated\" the 588 Complaints in this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   Counsel originally filed the 588 Actions in state court (where Rule 11 does not apply) in January 2008, and the Defendants removed the cases to this Court a month later. The question is therefore whether Counsel \"later advocated\" the frivolous complaints once they were pending here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   Recall that in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049349,9049294\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/91/1418/\">\n    91 F.3d at 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit equated filing a \"notice of appearance\" with \"later advocating\" a complaint. Here, Counsel's conduct in federal court easily amounted to \"later advocating\" the 588 personal injury complaints. On several occasions, Counsel reaffirmed to the Court, orally and in writing, implicitly and explicitly, that the pending complaints had factual merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   It began shortly after the cases were removed to this Court when, in March 2008, Counsel filed a case management report \"on behalf of approximately 4000\n   claimants,\" asserting that \"[a]ll plaintiffs come with[in] the Engle class definition specified by the Florida Supreme Court and thus share the Engle I verdict.\" (\n   <em>\n    Nestor Amoros, et al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:07-cv-760-J-25HTS, Doc. 35-2 at 1, 17). Counsel further represented that all of the cases were viable when he filed a case management brief \"on behalf of approximately 3800 claimants\" in November 2010, in which Wilner ridiculed the Defendants' proposal to process 3,800 cases individually as a \"millennium plan,\" and recommended trying the cases in groups of 100 to 500. (Doc. 25 at 1, 10-13). Counsel's advocacy of the frivolous complaints then continued after the December 2010 Order, in which the Court directed Counsel to \"carefully and individually review each of the roughly 3800 remaining cases and to determine which of those cases is presently due to be dismissed.\" (Doc. 42 at 7). The Court reminded Counsel that they had a \"continuing obligation throughout this litigation to inform [opposing counsel] and the Court when any of the remaining cases is due to be dismissed for any reason.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). The Defendants recommended that Counsel contact the plaintiffs to gather basic information about their status and their claims, with the goal of identifying meritless cases. (Doc. 48 at 1-4). Wilner balked at this suggestion,\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1092 (citing Doc. 61 at 3), and contended that any information obtained from individual interviews \"would not be worth much to anyone\" (Doc. 61 at 3). Counsel wrote that they had individual files for each Plaintiff, that they would \"make a good faith effort\" to screen out non-viable cases, and that they only expected \"to identify something like ten percent of the filed cases as appropriate for dismissal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). When time came to respond to the Court's December 2010 Order, Counsel failed to identify any of the 588 Actions, thereby implying that the actions were still viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   Counsel pushed back even more forcefully when the Temporary Special Master made his questionnaire recommendation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 158 at 14-15). Counsel asserted that contacting the plaintiffs was unnecessary because they had \"ongoing and routine communications\" with them. Counsel insisted that interviewing the plaintiffs would \"not result in 'a substantial reduction in the number of cases,' \" because significant \"winnowing ha[d] already occurred,\" and there was \"no longer any sizeable group of cases ripe for dismissal.\" Counsel assured the Court that \"[t]here is no need for the tremendous expense of energy and resources for a third party to poll the remaining plaintiffs because counsel already possess the vast majority of this data, and are working diligently to fill in all gaps.\" Further, Counsel represented that they were \"engaged in a constant and ongoing process of updating information and will continue to take appropriate steps if additional clients become unable or unwilling to pursue their claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The import of these assertions was that the remaining\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny cases-or at least the vast majority of them-had a living, willing plaintiff with a viable claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Wilner's advocacy for the 588 Actions did not end there. At the June 2011 Hearing, Wilner stood before the Court and represented that all the plaintiffs (less 332, whose cases were dismissed for different reasons) \"were alive, present, willing, and all that,\" that all the remaining cases were \"ready and able\" to proceed, and that he would be willing to certify that all of the 2,900 remaining complaints complied with\n   Rule 11. Under Rule 11, statements like these \"during a pretrial conference insist[ing] on a claim or defense should be viewed as 'presenting to the court' that contention and would be subject to the obligations of subdivision (b) measured as of that time.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, Adv. Cmt. Note, 1993 amend., subdivisions (b) and (c). Wilner's remarks were an affirmation that all of the remaining actions, including the 588 Actions, had legal and factual merit. As the Court found out following the mandatory Court Questionnaire process, Wilner's representations grossly overstated the number of viable complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Counsel Advocated Personal Injury Claims in Objective Bad Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Thus the issue comes down to whether Counsel advocated the 588 Actions in objective bad faith. At the very least, Counsel were reckless in filing personal injury complaints without any recent contact with the plaintiffs or any investigation into whether the plaintiffs were even alive, and then in urging the Court that these cases had merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   As noted in Part I, in the 1990's Wilner took down the names of numerous Potential Plaintiffs, but he lost contact with thousands of them in the decade that followed. After\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   , Wilner tried to get in touch with roughly 6,000 Potential Plaintiffs, but as the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   filing deadline approached, Wilner decided he would file complaints on behalf of those he could not reach. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 589-1 at 2). Never mind that Wilner's last contact with hundreds of the Potential Plaintiffs was a decade old. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 822-1 at 2-9). Never mind that the only thing some of these people did was contact Wilner's firm a decade earlier with a general interest in suing a tobacco company. And never mind that Wilner had no idea whether the Potential Plaintiffs were still interested in pursuing litigation or were even still alive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   In his \"\n   <strong>\n    Verified Response\n   </strong>\n   \" to the Defendants' now-withdrawn Rule 11 motion, Wilner wrote that he was \"duty bound to presume [he] represented each client who made contact\" with him many years earlier. (Doc. 822 at 18). This leads the Court to the same \"inevitable conclusion\" as the Eleventh Circuit: \"that [Wilner] filed lawsuits in 2008 for many individuals whose last, and perhaps only, contact with his firm was nearly a decade earlier, who never authorized him to file suit, and who, in all likelihood, had no earthly idea that Wilner considered himself to be their lawyer.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   The Special Master's investigation bears out the conclusion that Wilner filed the vast majority of the lawsuits without conducting any pre-suit investigation. Wilner's records from the 1995-2007 timeframe contain little indication that he communicated with his so-called \"clients,\" investigated their claims, or obtained authorization to file lawsuits on their behalf. To the extent Wilner attempted any investigation, he generally did so well\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he filed the complaints, as reflected by the July 2009 Letters he mailed to 2,756 Letter Recipients in 2009 and 2010. The July 2009 Letters announced that Wilner had filed a complaint in a plaintiff's name and asked the Letter Recipient to execute and return the Counsel Questionnaire, records release form, and authorization to represent-18 months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   filing the complaints. The July 2009 Letter shows that in over 2,700 cases, Wilner did not obtain such basic information\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   filing the lawsuits, and once he did obtain such information (or found he could not do so), Wilner did not amend or withdraw any of the Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   Wilner virtually admitted at the December 2016 Hearing that his approach to filing the complaints was to file-first-and-ask-questions-later by stating that his firm lacked \"the ability to contact 7,000 people in a year,\" so instead they opted to file the complaints and then determine whether the cases were viable. (See Doc. 2174 at 98-100). Even this they failed to do, seeing how many frivolous cases survived for over four years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   Wilner made a conscious decision to file hundreds of complaints without knowing the current status of the plaintiff, without knowing whether the plaintiff wanted to pursue an individual lawsuit, and without knowing whether the plaintiff was even alive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, despite\n   <em>\n    knowing\n   </em>\n   that the large volume of claims imposed significant strains on judicial resources, Wilner used the volume of claims (which he achieved through his own unethical behavior) as leverage to advocate his style of case management. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25 at 10-13). Although Wilner actually might not have known that 588 of the personal injury plaintiffs were dead, he must have known that, without having had contact with them in years, he had no basis to file claims on their behalf. Despite this, Wilner resisted suggestions that there be an inquiry into the status of the plaintiffs. Instead, he wrongly insisted that such inquiries would be a waste of time because all the non-viable cases had been eliminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   Wilner told the Court in June 2011 that the 588 Predeceased Plaintiffs were alive, willing, and able to proceed, even though he did not know whether that was true. And Wilner told the Court he would be willing to file Rule 11 certifications in all of the remaining 2,900 cases, despite knowing he had filed hundreds of personal injury actions without any idea whether the plaintiff was alive or dead, or even whether they wanted to pursue a claim. Such conduct is not merely negligent; it is an egregious display of deliberate indifference to the truth or falsity of his assertions: \"[i]f particularly egregious, the pursuit of a claim without reasonable inquiry into the underlying facts can be the basis for a finding of bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11669755\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/516/#p526\">\n    158 F.3d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is exactly what happened here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   Wilner has claimed that by June 2008, he had located survivors for nearly 400 of the 588 Actions, and that the survivors eventually ratified the complaints \"nunc pro tunc\" (though it is not clear whether\n   the survivors \"ratified\" the complaints immediately, or whether they did so at some later point). (Objections at 77; Doc. 589-1 at 2; Doc. 822 at 8). Even if true, such ratifications hardly help Wilner. If anything, it shows that Wilner\n   <em>\n    actually knew\n   </em>\n   in June 2008 that\n   <em>\n    hundreds\n   </em>\n   of personal injury complaints named a dead plaintiff. Yet he never told anyone. Instead-three years later-Wilner told the Court the opposite when he insisted that the plaintiffs were \"alive, willing, [and] present,\" and that the plaintiffs were \"ready and able\" to proceed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in so doing, he also made it impossible for survivors to pursue any wrongful death claims which may have been viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   In some cases Counsel must have known that the personal injury plaintiffs were deceased. Wilner's internal data showed that he had \"contact\" with more than 100 of the Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   their date of death. One can infer he spoke to a survivor and knew the smoker had died.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1112-13 ; (Doc. 822 at 14). Wilner has never been able to explain why he nevertheless filed and continued to advocate these personal injury actions.\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1112-13 ; (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Objections at 77-78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   As for Farah, the firm's own internal records also showed that some of the plaintiffs were deceased. For example, Farah knew in\n   <em>\n    November\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2006\n   </em>\n   that Alberta Aiken, Case No. 3:09-cv-14009, had died. (2016 R &amp; R at 64). Farah sent a letter terminating the representation in May 2007; he reopened the file in September 2007; he sent a second termination letter in November 2007; yet he filed a personal injury action on Ms. Aiken's behalf in January 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-65). Similarly, Farah filed a personal injury complaint on behalf of Rosalee Rogers, Case No. 3:09-cv-12287, even though his internal records noted that Ms. Rogers was \"deceased.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65). Thus, both Wilner and Farah must have known that some of the personal injury plaintiffs were dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   Making matters worse, Counsel's conduct during the litigation evinced an intent to obscure the fact that they had filed hundreds of complaints on behalf of people whose status they did not know, or worse, whom they knew were dead. Counsel vigorously opposed recommendations from the Temporary Special Master and Defendants that someone inquire into the status of the plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   Wilner also gave vague, incomplete, or shifting explanations about how and why\n   he maintained hundreds of lawsuits in the names of dead people. Compare, for example, the Wilner Declaration (Doc. 589-1) with the Verified Response (Doc. 822) to the Defendants' motion for a Rule 11 inquiry. As the Eleventh Circuit observed, much of the Verified Response \"was inconsistent with his earlier sworn declaration.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eleventh Circuit catalogued these discrepancies, including Wilner's changing stories about whether the plaintiffs had signed representation agreements with him (yes according to the Wilner Declaration, no according to the Verified Response), and whether he had remained in touch with the Potential Plaintiffs during the decade long period between initial contact and\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   (yes according to the Wilner Declaration, not necessarily according to the Verified Response).\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1111-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   The Court finds that Counsel acted in objective bad faith, \"akin to contempt,\" when they continued to advocate the 588 Actions. At the least, Counsel displayed reckless indifference to whether the assertions in the personal injury complaints were true or false. With respect to some cases, Counsel must have known that the personal injury plaintiff was dead. Nevertheless, they insisted that all the plaintiffs were \"alive, willing, present, and all that,\" and that they would be willing to certify that the complaints complied with Rule 11. In so doing, Counsel suppressed the fact that the 588 Actions were frivolous, thereby frustrating the Court's ability to shed meritless actions from the voluminous\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Docket, which in turn delayed the adjudication of viable actions. Accordingly, Counsel's advocacy of the 588 Actions warrants Rule 11 sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Counsel's Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   Counsel concede that there were \"critical flaws\" in their actions (Objections at 48), but they deny that their conduct warrants sanctions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel's overarching\n   objection is that, to the extent there were any frivolous or unauthorized filings, it was not their fault. Instead, it was the Florida Supreme Court's fault for giving thousands of tobacco plaintiffs only a year in which to file individual damage actions. Counsel claim that\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   , which required thousands to file individual lawsuits, was unforeseeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   Counsel further argue that errors were inevitable given the sheer volume of cases and\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   's filing deadline, and any errors resulted from an impossible dilemma, where they faced just two choices: (1) filing only \"perfectly-curated\" claims at the expense of forfeiting many potentially meritorious ones; or (2) filing on behalf of everyone to preserve all the meritorious claims, at the expense of including some frivolous ones. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 2, 167). As to why they didn't refer some cases to other lawyers to ease their burden, Counsel assert that they were the only lawyers within 150 miles of Jacksonville who were competent and willing to handle tobacco cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). Counsel further complain that it would be unfair to fault them for lacking the resources to file over 3,700 complaints. They contend \"this is not a case where a lawyer bit off more than he could chew. It is more akin to a case in which an initially small matter ballooned due to an unforeseen event.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   None of these explanations withstand scrutiny. This Court, as did the Eleventh Circuit, rejects the argument that the volume of cases or\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   's filing deadline can serve as an excuse.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-349\">\n   Even if\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   had created an unforeseen hardship, such exigencies did not excuse Mr. Wilner from his Rule 11 obligations at the time of filing....As the District Court put it during one of the many hearings required to sort through the problems with Mr. Wilner's bulk filing, \"the volume of claims does not render the fundamental precepts of lawyer-client responsibilities, vis-\u00e0-vis the client and vis-\u00e0-vis the Court as procedural niceties.\" Doc. 677, at 40.\n   <em>\n    The solution to managing these types of mass actions is surely not that the standard of care diminishes as the number of cases grows\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, this Court rejects the notion that the volume of claims somehow lessens an attorney's obligations under Rule 11. Accepting that proposition yields the perverse implication that a lawyer could overwhelm defendants and the court with a tidal wave of lawsuits, and at the same time bear diminished responsibility for filing claims that lack factual support. That simply cannot be. Rule 11 imposes the same obligations on a lawyer regardless of whether he files one complaint or 10,000 complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   This Court also rejects the false dilemma that Counsel try to portray-that of an unpalatable binary choice. There were other options:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-352\">\n   If Mr. Wilner lacked the resources required to fulfil his obligations to his clients\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   , he should have enlisted the services of another firm during the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   savings period (as he did in 2011) or he should have pared down the volume of claims to something that he could manage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1114-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Although Counsel suggest that they were the only lawyers within 150 miles of Jacksonville who were\n   willing and competent to handle tobacco cases, this naked, unsupported assertion unfairly denigrates the bar in northeast Florida. In any event, other law firms, such as Lieff Cabraser and Motley Rice,\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   available to assist Counsel, as demonstrated by their appearance in 2011-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   Nor was the fallout from\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   unforeseeable. Wilner knew in advance that thousands of plaintiffs would have to file individual damages actions. As, the Eleventh Circuit wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-355\">\n   [I]t was contemplated as far back as the Dade County Circuit Court's three-phase trial plan that certain elements of each class member's case would have to be tried separately. Presumably that's the whole reason Mr. Wilner signed up so many clients in the 1990s. Thus, we cannot blindly accept plaintiffs' counsel's suppositions that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   proceedings gave no hint, until the final decision by the Florida Supreme Court, that individual damage claims would be authorized,\" Doc. 589-1, at 2, or that there was \"no need to monitor individual class members\" until\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   came down, Doc. 822, at 4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Additionally, the notion that Wilner never saw\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   coming, and that he was unaware of the logistical challenges it would pose, is simply false. Wilner himself filed an amicus brief in 2003,\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   , urging the Florida Supreme Court not to decertify the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Class because of how impracticable trying thousands of individual damages actions would be.\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8448748\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/945/1246/\">\n    945 So.2d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Amicus Brief of Tobacco Trial Lawyers Association in Support of Petitioner,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2023718399\">\n    2003 WL 23718399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (2003). Wilner (the signatory on the brief) told the Florida Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-358\">\n   The undersigned's firm ... represents more than 1800 individuals who suffer from cigarette related injuries and who have retained his firm to represent their interests\n   <em>\n    only as class members\n   </em>\n   in the Engle class action-\n   <em>\n    they have specifically been advised and have agreed that our firm cannot represent them in pursuing individual suits against the tobacco industry due to the time, expense, and difficulty such representation would require\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2023718399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (first emphasis in original; second emphasis added). Wilner's amicus brief reveals two things. First, as early as 2003, he was aware that the Florida Supreme Court was considering decertifying the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class, which refutes his contention that\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   was \"unforeseeable.\" Second, he knew he lacked the resources to handle 1,800 cases, let alone 3,700 complaints. He said so himself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   Finally, Counsel argue that even if the Court finds that they violated Rule 11, the Court is confined by Rule 11(c)(5)(B) to imposing only non-monetary sanctions. (Objections at 113-15). Rule 11(c)(5)(B) provides that \"[t]he court must not impose a monetary sanction \u2026 (B) on its own, unless it issued the show-cause order under Rule 11(c)(3) before voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party that is, or whose attorneys\n   are, to be sanctioned.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(5)(B). Counsel contend that the rule prevents the Court from imposing monetary sanctions\n   <em>\n    sua\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    sponte\n   </em>\n   because the parties settled or dismissed the underlying cases before the Court issued a show cause order. (Objections at 113).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   The Court is not restricted by Rule 11(c)(5)(B) from imposing monetary sanctions as to the 588 Actions because the parties did not settle these actions. Rule 11(c)(5)(B)'s prohibition on monetary sanctions applies only to cases that the parties settle or voluntarily dismiss before a show cause order issues. It does not apply to cases, like these, that were resolved through a contested motion to dismiss. As such, Rule 11(c)(5)(B) offers Counsel no shelter from monetary sanctions as to the 588 Actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Rule 11's Application to Other Cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   As the Court explains in Parts IV and V\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the 588 Actions discussed above are not the only ones that the Court finds sanctionable. Sanctions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Court's inherent authority are warranted for Counsel's assertion of claims on behalf of Non-Smoker Plaintiffs, living plaintiffs who did not authorize a lawsuit, plaintiffs who never lived in Florida, and plaintiffs who did not respond to the Court Questionnaire (\"\n   <strong>\n    Frivolous Actions\n   </strong>\n   \"). Many of these Frivolous Actions also violated Rule 11 for the same reasons that the 588 Actions did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, because the parties voluntarily dismissed those actions involving Non-Smoker Plaintiffs, plaintiffs who never lived in Florida, and plaintiffs who did not want to pursue a lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    monetary\n   </em>\n   sanctions are inapplicable under Rule 11(c)(5)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   And while Counsel did not voluntarily dismiss the cases in which the plaintiff never responded to the Court Questionnaire, instead vigorously opposing their dismissal, the Court chooses to address these cases in Part IV (regarding sanctions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) and Part V (regarding sanctions under the Court's inherent authority). However, Counsel's pursuit of these cases on behalf of plaintiffs who never returned a questionnaire also constituted Rule 11 violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   \"But [ Rule 11(c)(5)(B)'s] restriction is explicitly limited to monetary sanctions.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   In the cases discussed below, the Court determines that Counsel multiplied the proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously by maintaining frivolous complaints in bad faith. Between 2011 and 2013, the Court learned that Counsel had filed dozens of Frivolous Actions (in addition to the 588 Actions). Counsel brought these Frivolous Actions without authorization or on behalf of non-smokers, people who never lived in Florida, and plaintiffs with previously adjudicated claims. The fatal defects in these actions surfaced not through voluntary\n   disclosures from Counsel, but through alerts from Defendants, the hard work of the Temporary Special Master, and from the returned Court Questionnaires. Before the Court Questionnaire process, Counsel vigorously opposed any suggestion that someone should interview or question the plaintiffs. Counsel's intransigence forced the Court to order Wilner to mail the Court Questionnaires to 2,661 plaintiffs and to have the Temporary Special Master review the results. The questionnaire process was time-consuming but necessary. It accomplished what Counsel would not: the identification of hundreds of frivolous cases, and the segregation of viable from non-viable claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   In some of these cases, Counsel knew or must have known that a fundamental defect existed. As to others, Counsel acted with reckless indifference. Counsel insisted on maintaining cases without having bothered to obtain the plaintiff's authorization, without having any basis for asserting that the plaintiff was even a smoker, and without knowing whether the alleged smoker ever lived in Florida (as required by\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, Counsel's resistance to the questionnaires and false assurances appeared calculated to prevent the discovery of such frivolous cases. At the very least, counsel's behavior \"grossly deviate[d] from reasonable conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Amlong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700083\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/1230/#p1242\">\n    500 F.3d at 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   Counsel's actions demonstrated a pattern of obfuscation and deception, which frustrated the Court's efforts to rid the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Docket of frivolous cases and to promptly and fairly resolve the cases that had merit. Counsel's maintenance of frivolous suits forced the Court to expend valuable resources-in terms of time, money, and manpower-to cope with the swollen\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Docket. It also delayed the resolution of meritorious claims. As a result, sanctions are appropriate for the \"excess costs\" and \"expenses...incurred because of [counsel's] conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Previously Adjudicated Cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   As discussed more fully in Part I, the Court discovered in March 2011-thanks only to the Defendants-that Counsel had filed 30 complaints that were previously adjudicated. Counsel never notified the Court or the Defendants of this fact, even though the Court ordered Counsel in December 2010 to identify cases that should be dismissed for any reason (particularly cases that had \"already been tried in state court.\"). (Doc. 42 at 7-8).\n   <em>\n    Wilner himself was the plaintiff's counsel in 11 of the 30 previously-adjudicated actions (having tried one of them to verdict)\n   </em>\n   , and the Defendants sent Wilner actual notice in February 2011 about the existence of the previously-adjudicated claims (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 128-4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, Counsel's 2011 Response\n   to the December 2010 Order omitted any mention of these cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 114).\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   The Special Master \"did not find any information for any of the 30 Plaintiffs indicating that Wilner inquired as to whether prior litigation existed that would bar a later action (nor any analysis of whether prior litigation in which Mr. Wilner represented a Plaintiff would bar a later action).\" (2016 R &amp; R at 171). If Wilner had only searched his own internal records, he would have had notice that 10 of these cases had been previously resolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   Although Counsel concede that their filing of frivolous cases was \"regrettable\" (Objections at 49), they contend that the Court should not sanction them under \u00a7 1927 because they did not oppose dismissal. (Objections at 49-50). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   As Wilner and Farah acknowledge, \u00a7 1927 can apply where a lawyer fails to take action in bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97) (citing\n   <em>\n    Gaiardo v. Ethyl Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546626\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/479/#p484\">\n    835 F.2d 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484 (3d Cir. 1987) ).

In that case, a plaintiff's lawyer received actual notice that his client's claim was part of a pre-existing class action in another district court. After the defendant notified the plaintiff's lawyer of this fact, the plaintiff's lawyer went several weeks without filing a stipulation of dismissal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212909\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/327/582/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212909\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/327/582/\">\n    at 583-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The lawyer's inaction forced the district court to grant the defendant's motion to dismiss (to which the plaintiff's lawyer never responded).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212909\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/327/582/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212909\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/327/582/\">\n    at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court held that the lawyer's \"failure to immediately file a stipulation of dismissal once given actual notice of his client's pre-existing civil action was unreasonable and vexatious.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212909\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/327/582/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212909\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/327/582/\">\n    at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   Likewise, Wilner had actual notice as of mid-February 2011 that 30 of his cases had been previously adjudicated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R at 169-70 &amp; n.54; Doc. 128-4). Nevertheless, Wilner did not agree at that time to dismiss 28 of those cases; instead, he omitted them from Counsel's 2011 Response. Although Wilner later did not oppose the Defendants' recommendation that the Court dismiss the previously-adjudicated cases, he forced the Court to sift through and reconcile his and the Defendants' inconsistent proposals about which cases to cull from the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Docket (\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 113-1\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Docs. 114-1, 114-2, 114-3, 114-4), something the Court likened to \"two ships passing in the night\" (Doc. 145 at 1 n.1). \"The Court's purpose in directing the parties to confer prior to filing their proposed dismissals was to avoid exactly such a disjointed result.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, Wilner is not relieved from \u00a7 1927 liability merely because he ultimately did not oppose the Defendants' recommendation to dismiss the other 28 previously adjudicated cases. Counsel's failure to dismiss 28 of the 30 previously adjudicated cases was egregious enough to amount to objective bad faith for purposes of \u00a7 1927.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After the Florida Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   in 2006, Wilner sent Ms. Larramore a letter asking if she wanted to pursue an individual damages action, but Wilner had no record of receiving a response.

His brother was the personal injury plaintiff in Case Number 3:09-cv-12059, Oscar Gregory Olds. (Objections at 55, 58-59). The Olds brothers also had a father named Oscar Douglas Olds, Sr., who died in 1995 and had a separate tobacco action pending in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Oscar Gregory Olds died in 1998 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59), which was a decade before Wilner filed the personal injury complaint in his name. Neither Wilner, Farah, nor any of the other plaintiffs' lawyers knew that Oscar Gregory Olds had died, possibly because Wilner's files only listed their client as \"Oscar Olds,\" without distinguishing between Oscar Gregory Olds, Oscar Douglas Olds, Jr., and Oscar Douglas Olds, Sr. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 55). Wilner admits he did not always capture middle names at intake, and over time, he lost track of which \"Oscar Olds\" was his client. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Wilner also admits that he chose to file a personal injury claim on behalf of Oscar Gregory Olds, as well as a loss-of-consortium claim on behalf of Oscar Douglas Olds, Jr., because he was unable to contact either one in the year leading up to the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   filing deadline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   According to the Special Master, Wilner claims he established an attorney-client relationship with a Mr. Olds-presumably referring to Oscar Gregory Olds-on August 26, 1997. (2016 R &amp; R at 159). However, Wilner could not produce a representation agreement or a statement of client's rights relating to Mr. Olds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160). Nor did Wilner have any copies of correspondence from Mr. Olds to the law firm, such as a completed questionnaire or a letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160-61).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-408\">\n   Wilner did not produce any documents evidencing communication with Mr. Olds or his representative between 1997, when Wilner claims the attorney-client relationship was formed, and November of 2011, which is the date of Lieff Cabraser's letter to Mr. Olds regarding the questionnaire and the first documented evidence of attempted communication with Mr. Olds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 163).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   The Special Master found that Wilner's own internal database concerning the Olds cases was inaccurate. Wilner's database indicated that Wilner had contact with a Mr. Olds between November 3, 2010 and June 29, 2011. But that could not have happened, regardless of which \"Oscar Olds\" Wilner thought he was referring to. Oscar Gregory Olds had been dead since 1998; Oscar Douglas Olds, Sr. had been dead since 1995; and Oscar Douglas Olds, Jr. wrote that he knew nothing about the case until the end of 2011. Between the presence of unreliable records (like Wilner's database) and the absence of other records (such as an attorney-client agreement), the Special Master wrote that the Olds cases \"call[ ] into question much of the data Wilner provided concerning his 'attorney-client relationships,' the authorization to file lawsuits on behalf of 'clients,' his communication with 'clients,' and his professional and ethical obligations to the Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162-63). The Special Master concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-411\">\n   The circumstances surrounding\n   <em>\n    Olds\n   </em>\n   -where the plaintiff was not a client of Wilner's, despite Wilner's representation stating otherwise; where the plaintiff was not informed of the filing of a complaint on his behalf, despite Wilner's representation stating otherwise; where the plaintiff was deceased, despite Wilner's representation in the personal injury complaint stating otherwise-lead the Special Master to believe that, as it relates to\n   <em>\n    Olds\n   </em>\n   , Wilner is in violation of his duty of candor to the Court and his ethical and professional responsibilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   Counsel insist that they\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   form an attorney-client relationship in 1997 with Oscar Gregory Olds, but over the next several years they simply lost \"awareness\" of who their client was. (Objections at 55). That supposedly explains why Oscar Douglas Olds, Jr. wrote the Court a letter stating that he never authorized a lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Counsel, \"Douglas Olds did not know of Wilner's representation, because Douglas Olds\n   <em>\n    was not the original client\n   </em>\n   . The original client was Douglas Olds's brother, Oscar Gregory Olds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   That does not explain the fact that Counsel\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   filed a loss-of-consortium claim on behalf of Oscar Douglas Olds, Jr. himself. Even if Oscar Gregory Olds ever qualified as Wilner's \"client\" (albeit before he died in 1998, which seems dubious), the same cannot be said for Oscar Douglas Olds, Jr. As his 2012 letter reveals, he did not authorize Counsel to file a complaint in his name. Despite the lack of authorization, Counsel insisted in 2011 that Oscar Douglas Olds, Jr.'s case, along with hundreds of other frivolous cases, was viable and involved a willing plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     Eugene Johnson\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 3:09-cv-12989\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   Although the Court's Order appointing the Special Master \"did not ask [him] to specifically address the filing and maintenance of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Special Master, through his investigation, found the circumstances surrounding the filing and maintenance of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to be as troubling as those that existed in\n   <em>\n    Olds\n   </em>\n   .\" (2016 R &amp; R at 167). In January 2008, Counsel filed a personal injury action on behalf of Eugene M. Johnson, Sr. On June 24, 2009, Wilner sent a letter advising Mr. Johnson that, as a client \"from the early 1990's tobacco litigation,\" he had filed a complaint on his behalf. On June 29, 2009, Eugene Johnson's personal representative, Katheryn F. Johnson, sent Wilner a letter stating she had never been a client of Wilner's, and she did not wish to be. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166). Unbeknownst to Wilner, Eugene M. Johnson died in 2003. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 63). The Special Master concludes, based on Katheryn Johnson's letter, that Counsel filed the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   without authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   Counsel respond that Katheryn Johnson was correct when she asserted that she was never a client; her husband, Eugene Johnson, was their client. Counsel contend that \"[b]ased on communications with Wilner in 1996, the named plaintiff-Mr. Johnson-was a client of Wilner's, and Wilner had a duty to protect his client's interests.\" (Objections at 63). However, Wilner could not produce a representation agreement or a statement of client's rights for Mr. Johnson. (2016 R &amp; R at 165-66). Nor did Wilner have any evidence of communications with Mr. Johnson between 1996 and 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168). Discrepancies in Wilner's own data also call his assertions into question. For one, Wilner's data shows that he notified Mr. Johnson or his personal representative in 2007 that he had filed a complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 167). But that cannot be true because Wilner did not file the complaint until January 2008. Second, Wilner's data says that he entered into a fee contract with Mr. Johnson on July 29, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168). That also cannot be true because: (1) Mr. Johnson was dead by then; and (2) only a month earlier, on June 29, 2009, Ms. Johnson had told Wilner that she had never been a client and did not want to be one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   Counsel suggest that Ms. Johnson changed her mind because in November 2011 she requested a federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   questionnaire. (Objections at 64-65). Counsel also assert that in 2012, one of Eugene Johnson's sons approved pursuing the lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65). Even if both of these assertions are true, however, it does not change the fact that Counsel initially filed this suit in 2008 without authorization. Wilner evidently had no contact with Mr. Johnson between 1996 and 2009. Had Wilner kept up any contact, or conducted any type of pre-suit investigation, he would have known that Mr. Johnson died in 2003. Nevertheless, Wilner insisted in May and June 2011 that Mr. Johnson's case, along with 587 others like it involving Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs, were viable and involved a living, willing plaintiff. At the least, Wilner filed\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and maintained the case for several years, with reckless disregard to whether the personal injury complaint involved a living plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Cases Where Plaintiffs Did Not Wish to Pursue a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   The Special Master investigated \"[t]he filing and maintenance of [other] Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   cases where the plaintiff...did not wish to pursue the case.\" (Doc. 2108 at 4; 2016 R &amp; R at 175-77, 214-21). The Special Master analyzed cases dismissed under various Orders in 2012 and 2013, following the results of the Court Questionnaire process. The Special Master\n   found over 50 cases that the Court dismissed because the plaintiff did not want to pursue the claim. (2016 R &amp; R at 175-77, 214-21, 242, 245-50, 252-68). In most of these cases, the plaintiff wanted to pursue a claim at some point, but simply changed his or her mind. The Special Master does not recommend sanctions as to those cases, and the Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   However, the Special Master identified over a dozen cases where the plaintiff never authorized Counsel to file a claim. The Special Master examined detailed logs developed by Lieff Cabraser in 2011 and 2012, when the firm conducted phone interviews with hundreds of\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs in connection with the Court Questionnaire process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R, Ex. 79, 82). The notes from the phone interviews reflect that some of the plaintiffs or their survivors told Lieff Cabraser that they never authorized a lawsuit. These include, but are not limited to, the cases of Charles Carew (Case No. 3:09-cv-10765), Clifford Clark (3:09-cv-10846), Willie Mae Copeland (3:09-cv-11356), Harriet Dauman (3:09-cv-11443), Wayne Evans (3:09-cv-13772), Joe Harris (3:09-cv-11200), Calvin Lewis (3:09-cv-13746), Louis Perez (3:09-cv-12136), Thomas Criswell (3:09-cv-11407), Carrie Griffin (3:09-cv-12660), and Sharon Swidler (spelled \"Swindler\" in the 2016 R &amp; R) (3:09-cv-13302). (2016 R &amp; R at 214-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   Wilner admits that there were two cases that he should not have filed because the plaintiff never authorized a lawsuit. Those were the cases of Shirley Larramore (3:09-cv-13138), which the Court discussed earlier, and Jean Evans (3:09-cv-13771). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 53, 209-10). Otherwise, Counsel object to the Special Master's findings that they maintained lawsuits that a plaintiff did not want to pursue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   Counsel explain that the reason why some people claimed they never authorized a lawsuit is that Lieff Cabraser simply contacted the wrong person-someone with a similar name to the plaintiff-which explains why the contacted person denied permitting a lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 53, App'x I at 206-11). For example, in the case of Willie Mae Copeland, Wilner's client was a \"W.M. Copeland age 65, Jacksonville, FL,\" but Lieff Cabraser contacted a \"WM Copeland, age 72, Columbus, Ohio.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 210). That, of course, would explain why WM Copeland of Columbus, Ohio told Lieff Cabraser that he never authorized a lawsuit. Likewise, Counsel assert that Lieff Cabraser contacted the wrong person in the cases of Clifford Clark, Harriet Dauman, and Louis Perez. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Wilner offers a similar explanation for the cases of Charles Carew and Joe Harris: Lieff Cabraser spoke to the plaintiff's relative, rather than the plaintiff himself, and the relative did not wish to pursue the claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 209). Thus, the actual plaintiffs did not necessarily deny having authorized a lawsuit. Therefore, while the Court is skeptical of Counsel's explanation, because the Court cannot find that Counsel violated \u00a7 1927 absent clear and convincing evidence, the Court does not impose sanctions for these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   Wilner's explanations for maintaining the cases of Carrie Griffin, Sharon Swidler, and Wayne Evans are problematic. Wilner says that in the case of Carrie Griffin (3:09-cv-12660), the client died and the survivors declined to pursue a case. (Objections at 209). Carrie Griffin died in 2006, and in 2008 Wilner contacted the survivors, who stated they did not want to proceed. (Objections at 209; Doc. 2165-14 at 64-65). By 2009, Wilner no longer had contact with the survivors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 209). As early as 2008, then, Counsel actually knew that the client was dead and the survivors did not want to pursue a claim. Nevertheless, four years dragged on without Wilner doing anything to withdraw the complaint, instead telling the Court in\n   2011 that all the plaintiffs were alive, willing, and present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   With respect to Sharon Swidler (3:09-cv-13302), Wilner claims that Lieff Cabraser spoke to the wrong person. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 210). However, Wilner's notes state: \"Client indicated in 2009 she did not want to pursue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Though Wilner claims that the firm passed the case off to Lieff Cabraser for withdrawal (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), that would not have happened until 2011 when Lieff Cabraser first appeared in these actions. Thus, Wilner's own notes show that his firm actually knew that Swidler did not want to pursue a claim, yet they failed to do anything about it for at least two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-426\">\n   Similarly, in the case of Wayne Evans (3:09-cv-13772), Wilner claims that Lieff Cabraser spoke to the wrong Wayne Evans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, Wilner's notes state that the client changed his mind in March 2010 and told the firm not to pursue the claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Wilner's notes do not suggest that Lieff Cabraser contacted the wrong person, but that Evans himself told the firm not to pursue an action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   Despite being flagged by the Special Master, Wilner's objections do not explain seven other cases where the plaintiff did not authorize a lawsuit. The Special Master reported that five plaintiffs-Donald Blajda (3:09-cv-14174), James Carter (3:09-cv-10787), Brent Collinson (3:09-cv-10888), Martin Coulton (3:09-cv-11046), and Beverly Siddens (3:09-cv-12408)-neither authorized a lawsuit nor had they ever lived in Florida. (2016 R &amp; R at 199-200;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R, Ex. 79 at 14, 56, 68-69, 104-05, 231). A Non-Smoker Plaintiff-Elaine Minnis (3:09-cv-11658)-also did not authorize a cause of action. Although she advised Wilner of this fact in 2010 (2016 R &amp; R at 228; 2016 R &amp; R, Ex. 79 at 190; Doc. 2165-14 at 30-31), Wilner did not dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   Additionally, Counsel's Objections do not address the case of Gerald Druley (3:09-cv-11607), who never wanted to pursue an individual damages action. (2016 R &amp; R at 249; 2016 R &amp; R, Ex. 82 at 85-86). Counsel's Objections, including Appendices I, J, and K (which purport to explain the circumstances of plaintiffs who did not wish to pursue a claim, who were not smokers, or who were not Florida residents, respectively), do not explain these defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   Counsel's explanations for three more unauthorized cases, even if assumed to be true, are unsatisfactory. Those are the cases of Calvin Lewis (3:09-cv-13746), Thomas Criswell (3:09-cv-11407), and Steven Cahen (3:09-cv-13017). Calvin Lewis's personal representative, Annette Hamilton, stated that she received paperwork from Farah, but that she never returned it and did not authorize them to file a lawsuit. (2016 R &amp; R at 215; 2016 R &amp; R, Ex. 79 at 121). Ms. Hamilton was angered to learn that Counsel had filed a lawsuit anyway. (2016 R &amp; R, Ex. 79 at 121). Wilner's only response is to say that Calvin Lewis \"hired another attorney\" (Objections at 211), which fails to explain why Counsel filed an unauthorized claim and maintained it for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   Another of Counsel's \"clients\"-Mr. Criswell was also upset to discover that Wilner and Farah had filed a lawsuit in his name. (2016 R &amp; R at 215). Again, Wilner's only response is to say that Mr. Criswell \"hired another attorney.\" (Objections at 211). Steven Cahen states that he did not authorize a lawsuit either. (2016 R &amp; R at 260; 2016 R &amp; R, Ex. 82 at 40-41). Counsel do not contend that Lieff Cabraser spoke to the wrong Steven Cahen; instead, they suggest that Cahen is mistaken, and that he did authorize a lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 210; Doc. 2165-14 at 78-79). As between Counsel and Mr. Cahen himself, Mr. Cahen is a more credible source of information about whether he authorized a lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   Accordingly, as to the following 15 individuals-Shirley Larramore (which the Court has already accounted for), Jean Evans, Carrie Griffin, Sharon Swidler, Wayne Evans, Donald Blajda, James Carter, Brent Collinson, Martin Coulton, Beverly Siddens, Elaine Minnis, Gerald Druley, Calvin Lewis, Thomas Criswell, and Steven Cahen-there is clear and convincing evidence that Counsel filed and maintained Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Actions that were unauthorized, or continued to maintain a suit after the plaintiff told Wilner that they no longer wanted to pursue it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Non-Smoker Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   In 2012, following the Court Questionnaire process and four years of litigation, the plaintiffs' lawyers admitted that some of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   personal injury plaintiffs or decedents were not smokers at all. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 718-1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   This admission was stunning. Florida's courts defined the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class as \"[a]ll Florida citizens and residents\" \"and their survivors, who have suffered, presently suffer or who have died from diseases and medical conditions\n   <em>\n    caused by their addiction to cigarettes\n   </em>\n   that contain nicotine.\"\n   <em>\n    Engle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7422977\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/672/39/#p40\">\n    672 So.2d at 40, 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, Florida's definition of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class required a personal injury plaintiff (or the decedent) to have been a smoker. A non-smoking plaintiff, or the survivors of a non-smoking decedent, therefore could not possibly have had a viable\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   claim. Moreover, each of the personal injury and wrongful death complaints alleged that the plaintiff or the decedent \"purchased, smoked, and [was] addicted to cigarette products manufactured and sold by Defendants which were the subject of\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:08-cv-158-J-32HTS, at Doc. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 1.6-1.10). Thus, the revelation that a plaintiff or a decedent was not a smoker meant that the allegations in the pertinent complaints were untrue. It also meant Wilner deceived the Court in his March 2008 case management proposal, which he \"[s]ubmitted on behalf of approximately 4000 claimaints,\" when he represented that \"[a]ll plaintiffs come with[in] the Engle class definition specified by the Florida Supreme Court and thus share the Engle I verdict.\" (Case No. 3:07-cv-760-J-25HTS, Doc. 35-2 at 1, 17). And it meant Wilner was still misleading the Court three years later, when he filed a case management proposal on the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   master docket stating that his position had not changed since March 2008 (Doc. 25 at 6), and maintaining that all of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   \"damage claims were vested with a liability verdict from [\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   ],\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Accordingly, the Court directed the Special Master to investigate \"[t]he filing and maintenance of Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   cases where the plaintiff was not a smoker.\" (Doc. 2108 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   The Special Master identified 43 individuals whose cases the Court dismissed because the plaintiff or the decedent was not a smoker. (2016 R &amp; R at 222-30, 246, 257-58, 274).\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   In identifying some of these\n   cases, the Special Master also relied on extensive logs assembled in 2011 and 2012 by Lieff Cabraser, when the firm telephonically interviewed hundreds of\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R, Exs. 79 &amp; 82). The Special Master considered the non-smoker cases to be among the \"most egregious of all.\" (2016 R &amp; R at 222).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   Wilner and Farah respond by providing details about the circumstances surrounding 42 of the \"non-smoker\" cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 211-15, App'x J;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 2165-14). After carefully considering each category of objections in Appendix J, the Court finds that Counsel have an explanation for maintaining 25 of the non-smoker's cases that makes sanctions inappropriate. These are the cases described in Categories A, B, C, and D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Counsel's explanations for the 17 Non-Smoker Plaintiffs' cases listed in Categories H, K, L, M, and N are more troubling. According to Counsel, five of the complaints were supposed to be filed in a different class action concerning flight attendants exposed only to second-hand smoke (\"Category H\"); two cases involved confirmed nonsmokers (\"Category K\"); six cases involved \"inconsistent, inconclusive, or missing smoking information\" (\"Category L\"); three cases involved plaintiffs whose smoking history was unknown to Counsel even as of 2011, and with whom Counsel had lost contact (\"Category M\"); and one case involved a known non-smoker whose case was somehow mismarked (\"Category N\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections, Appendix J at 211-15). At best, these explanations underscore how Counsel filed\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny complaints with reckless abandon, without knowing something as basic as whether the plaintiff even smoked. At worst, some of these explanations show that Wilner actually knew some of the plaintiffs were not smokers. For example, Eric Kusher, 3:09-cv-13107, stated that he has never smoked and never registered with the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Trust Fund, and that his wife was very upset that people kept calling his house about a lawsuit. (2016 R &amp; R, Ex. 79 at 161). Carl Bell, 3:09-cv-14234, whose wife, Lois Luke, died of second-hand smoke, had evidently told the plaintiffs' lawyers repeatedly that his wife never smoked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Mr. Bell complained that he did not \"understand why [Counsel] keep calling and why [they] can't get it that she never smoked.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   Additionally, there was one Non-Smoker Plaintiff's case that Counsel's objections did not address, although the Special Master flagged it in his Report. Marjorie Manushaw (3:09-cv-12760), told Lieff Cabraser in an interview on October 16, 2012 that she did not want to participate in mediation, that she did not smoke, and that she was only exposed to second-hand smoke. (2016 R &amp; R at 246;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7422977\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/672/39/#p40\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 82 at 234). Counsel filed a complaint anyway alleging that she \"purchased, smoked, and [was] addicted to cigarette products manufactured and sold by Defendants which were the subject of\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Lewis, et al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:08-cv-158-J-32HTS, Doc. 2 at \u00b6 1.6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   With respect to Marjorie Manushaw's case and the 17 cases contained in Categories\n   H, K, L, M, and N of Appendix J to Counsel's Objections (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Objections, App'x J at 211-15), the Court determines that Counsel maintained complaints involving Non-Smoking Plaintiffs or decedents that had no colorable basis. Counsel maintained these cases for over four years before they finally dismissed them in 2012 and 2013-albeit only after the Court Questionnaire process. Before the Court Questionnaire process, Wilner insisted that such an inquiry was unnecessary, that the Court could trust Counsel to identify any non-viable cases because they had complete files on every plaintiff, and that the remaining cases were viable. This simply was not true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   <strong>\n    9. Non-Florida Resident Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   At the same time the Court discovered the Non-Smoker Plaintiffs, it also began to learn that some of the plaintiffs did not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   's requirement of Florida residency (\"\n   <strong>\n    Non-Resident Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 718-1). Yet, Counsel alleged in each complaint that the plaintiffs or decedents \"were at times material residents of the State of Florida, suffering from a tobacco related illness within the time frames defined by\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jay Zeidel, et al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:08-cv-165-J-25HTS, Doc. 2 at \u00b6 1.3). Thus, cases with smokers who lacked Florida residency were necessarily unviable and involved factually untrue allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   The Court directed the Special Master to investigate \"[t]he filing and maintenance of Federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   cases where the plaintiff...did not meet the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   requirements,\" such as Florida residency. (Doc. 2108 at 4). The Special Master identified approximately 70 cases that the Court dismissed because of Non-Resident Plaintiffs or decedents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R at 196-208, 242, 245-50, 258-60). In some of these cases, the Special Master found that Counsel made an understandable mistake, such as where the smoker reportedly lived in Florida at some point but not during the relevant\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177-78). However, with the aid of Lieff Cabraser's interview logs (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R, Exs. 79 &amp; 82), the Special Master determined that 61 of these cases involved a smoker who\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   lived in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R at 199-208, 258-60). For these 61 \"never-resident\" cases, the Special Master found that Counsel's residency mistake was not understandable, and that \u00a7 1927 sanctions are warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   In Appendix K to their Objections, Counsel respond with details purporting to explain the circumstances of the Non-Resident Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections, App'x K at 215-20). Upon carefully considering the Objections, the Court determines that 22 cases with Non-Resident Plaintiffs do not evince clear and convincing evidence of bad faith or recklessness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   The evidence is stronger with respect to other Non-Resident Plaintiff cases. The case of Marcus Walker\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   , 3:09-cv-12486, stands out as one of the most egregious examples. Marcus Walker's daughter told Farah that her father, a smoker, never lived in Florida. (2016 R &amp; R at 200;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7422977\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/672/39/#p40\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 79 at 258). Nevertheless, someone\n   from \"Farah &amp; Farah told her to just list her county in [Florida] and still go ahead and fill out [the] paperwork.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 79 at 258). It therefore appears that someone from the Farah firm instructed Marcus Walker's daughter to falsely provide a Florida county of residence for her father. Such conduct reflects not reckless indifference, but intentional disregard for the candor owed to this Court concerning the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   residency requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   Remarkably, Counsel listed Walker, 3:09-cv-12486, under \"Category B\" of their Objections, meaning they claim to have had information, such as a questionnaire, indicating that the smoker was a Florida resident. Of course, Counsel have documentary evidence that Marcus Walker was a Florida resident only because the Farah firm told the smoker's daughter to falsely list a Florida county of residence in the questionnaire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   Similarly, Wilner has no excuse for filing and maintaining four of the five cases in \"Category D\"-the cases of Frank Tuohey (3:09-cv-13391), John Dubravetz (3:09-cv-11545), Kenneth Cortesi (3:09-cv-11369), and Beverly Siddens (3:09-cv-12408)-because none of them ever lived in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R at 202-03, 206-07; Objections at 218-19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wilner's excuse is that the lack of Florida residency was not fatal to their cases because they had valid \"non-\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   \" claims, and \"non-\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   \" claims do not require residency. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 216, 218-19). The glaring problem is that Wilner\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    assert\n   </em>\n   \"non-\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   \" claims on behalf of these plaintiffs. In these and every other\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Wilner\n   <em>\n    alleged only an\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   , trying to take advantage of the preclusive effect of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   findings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Clay Smith, et al., v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:08-cv-160-J-34HTS, Doc. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 1.1-1.2). Each complaint began by stating: \"This is a complaint seeking compensatory and punitive damages in accordance with the Florida Supreme Court's class\n   action decision and mandate in [\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ]\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.1). The very next paragraph of each complaint set forth the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   Findings, followed by the statement that the \"specified liability and general causation findings by the Engle jury [do] not need to be proved again as they shall be given res judicata effect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.2). Regardless of whether Tuohey, Dubravetz, Cortesi, and Siddens had valid \"non-\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   \" claims, Wilner did not allege such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   Additionally, Counsel's objections do not reasonably explain the filing and maintenance of the 31 Non-Resident Plaintiffs' cases listed in Categories F, G, H, and I of Appendix K. (Objections, App'x K at 216, 219-20). In fourteen Non-Resident Plaintiff cases, Wilner was unable to locate the plaintiff or obtain information about their residence until the Court Questionnaire process (\"\n   <strong>\n    Category F\n   </strong>\n   \"). In three cases Wilner knew of a residence defect and passed it off to Lieff Cabraser for dismissal (\"\n   <strong>\n    Category G\n   </strong>\n   \"). In seven cases there was some sort of \"error in intake\" (\"\n   <strong>\n    Category H\n   </strong>\n   \"). And in seven cases there was a known defect in residence, but the case was not dismissed due to \"clerical error\" (\"\n   <strong>\n    Category I\n   </strong>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   One of the most egregious examples of these cases was that of Thomas Sillers, 3:09-cv-12415. In\n   <em>\n    Sillers\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiff \"said every time they asked him when he lived in [Florida], he would tell them that he never lived in [Florida] so why do they keep asking him, and then one guy told him that it didn't matter that he never lived in [Florida].\" (2016 R &amp; R at 206;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7422977\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/672/39/#p40\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 79 at 233). Thus, someone from the Wilner or Farah firms apparently believed it wasn't important whether the smoker met\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   's residency requirement. Wilner admits that Counsel should have marked the case for withdrawal, noting that Thomas Sillers did not provide information indicating a Florida residence. (Doc. 2165-14 at 183). The filing and maintenance of this case reflects not just reckless indifference to whether the claim satisfied\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   's residency requirement, but intentional disregard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   Counsel are responsible, under \u00a7 1927, for filing and maintaining 36\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny complaints on behalf of Non-Resident Plaintiffs. These consist of the 31 cases described in Categories F, G, H, and I of Appendix K to the Objections; four of the five cases described in Category D; and the Marcus Walker case (3:09-cv-12486).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   <strong>\n    10. Cases Where the Plaintiff Did Not Suffer from an\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    Disease\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   The Special Master also investigated cases where the plaintiff or decedent did not suffer from an \"\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   disease.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Special Master identified approximately 35 such cases. (2016 R &amp; R at 230-32, 255-57, 272-73). The Special Master recommends sanctions for cases where the plaintiff never claimed to suffer from an\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   disease, but not for cases where the plaintiff initially claimed to suffer from such a disease and could not prove it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178). However, the Report did not specify which cases fell into which category. Thus, the Court does not have enough information to determine, by clear and convincing evidence, whether Counsel maintained any such cases in bad faith. Accordingly, the Court will not impose sanctions with respect to this category of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   <strong>\n    11. Cases Barred by the Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   The Special Master investigated cases that were barred by the statute of limitations. The Special Master identified at least 90 such cases. (2016 R &amp; R at 208-14, 238). The Special Master notes, however, that Wilner believed the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   findings tolled the statute of limitations. While the Eleventh Circuit ultimately rejected this contention, the Special Master finds that Wilner's argument was not frivolous; therefore the maintenance of these cases does not warrant sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 179) (citing\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20Fed.%20Appx.%20664\">\n    441 Fed.Appx. 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2011) ). The Court agrees with the Special Master's recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   <strong>\n    12. Cases Involuntarily Dismissed for Lack of a Federal\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    Questionnaire\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-453\">\n   Finally, the Court addresses the disturbing number of cases where, despite several months of intensive, Court-mandated efforts to make contact with the plaintiffs, the plaintiff never returned a Court-ordered\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   questionnaire. As recounted in Part I, the Court directed Counsel in August 2011-over their objections-to send questionnaires to all of the remaining plaintiffs because it had lost faith in Wilner's representations about his \"clients' \" willingness or ability to prosecute the lawsuits. These simple three-page, 14-question forms were designed to elicit basic information about these plaintiffs, including whether they wished to participate in the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 218-1). Wilner and Farah \"mailed questionnaires to 2,661 unique addresses, [but] by the November 2011 deadline, they had submitted only 1,724 to the [Temporary] Special Master.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   When all was said and done, nearly a third of the 2,661 plaintiffs never responded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Court dismissed hundreds of cases for failure to prosecute. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 787, Doc. 1102). Plaintiffs' counsel opposed the dismissals, insisting that the dismissals would come as a surprise to their so-called \"clients.\" But the Court was \"concerned that the real surprise for many of these plaintiffs was the fact that a lawsuit had been filed on their behalf in the first place.\" (Doc. 787 at 6 n.6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-454\">\n   Of the approximately 900 plaintiffs who did not respond to the Court Questionnaire, many are already accounted for elsewhere in this Order. Those not yet accounted for consist of 557 dismissed cases in which the plaintiff never returned a questionnaire for unknown reasons (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2016 R &amp; R at 232, 253-55), and 15 dismissed cases in which Wilner did not even send a questionnaire because he did not have the plaintiff's mailing address (indeed, Wilner did not even know the first names of two of those plaintiffs). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 232-34). Except for the 15 plaintiffs to whom Wilner did not even mail a questionnaire, these plaintiffs failed or refused to return the form despite extensive efforts to make contact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-455\">\n   According to Plaintiffs' counsel, these efforts consisted of the following: (1) sending questionnaires by first class mail to 2,661 addresses; (2) sending questionnaires to verified e-mail addresses; (3) posting a downloadable copy of the questionnaire on the website:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-456\">\n   www.floridatobaccocase.com; (4) employing nine full-time and three part-time paralegals to answer calls from plaintiffs, as well as place follow up calls to plaintiffs who did not submit a questionnaire in response to the mailing; (5) the creation of a separate e-mail address for communication between the paralegals and plaintiffs; (6) establishing precise protocols to be used by the legal team throughout the questionnaire process (Doc. 427, Ex. A); (7) investigation by the firm's Research Department to locate contact information for questionnaires returned by the U.S. Postal Service due to an incorrect address, including but not limited to database searches on ACCURINT and Lexis-Nexis; (8) utilization of a cell phone tracking service to obtain cell phone numbers; (9) attempts by Plaintiffs' counsel to contact plaintiff's next of kin and/or potential relatives at the numbers located; (10) sending a new questionnaire to new addresses or e-mail addresses obtained through follow up efforts; and ultimately (11) the initiation of an \"on the ground\" follow up to locate clients in Duval County, Florida.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-457\">\n   (Doc. 787 at 5). Thus, Counsel tried to contact the plaintiffs (whose contact information was known) no less than five ways: (1) by post mail, (2) by e-mail, (3) by phone, (4) by next-of-kin, and finally (5) in person. Nevertheless, these plaintiffs still did not return questionnaires-even after the issuance of a show cause order (Doc. 379) and the passage of a year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-458\">\n   The large number of individuals who never responded was concerning because Wilner assured the Court on June 6, 2011 that he had been in recent contact with all but 332 of the roughly 2,900 remaining plaintiffs. (Doc. 171 at 8-9). Indeed, it was the plaintiffs' counsel themselves who assured the Court that three months would be plenty of time to send and retrieve questionnaires from all of the plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27).\n   <em>\n    Yet, even as much as a year later, Counsel still were unable to obtain questionnaires from hundreds of plaintiffs on whose behalf they had filed an Engle lawsuit and with whom they claimed to have been in contact.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-459\">\n   The filing and maintenance of these 572 cases is emblematic of the larger problems in the federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   litigation. Wilner and Farah filed lawsuits on behalf of plaintiffs who did not authorize them, continued to maintain suits even after plaintiffs manifested their desire not to pursue a lawsuit, failed to keep in touch with their so-called \"clients\" or keep themselves apprised of their \"clients' \" status, and made misleading statements to the Court regarding the level of contact they had with their clients. Indeed, when the Court pressed Wilner at the December 13, 2016 hearing about whether he had signed authorizations to file the complaints, he ultimately admitted: \"Probably not.\" (Doc. 2174 at 135).\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-460\">\n   Between the 557 plaintiffs who did not return a questionnaire, the 15 plaintiffs for whom Wilner did not even have the basic contact information to mail a questionnaire, and Wilner's admission that he probably lacked signed authorizations to file complaints on behalf of the plaintiffs, the Court is left with the definite and firm conviction that these 572 plaintiffs did not authorize Wilner and Farah to file or\n   maintain lawsuits. The failure of the 557 to return the questionnaire-when considered in the context of everything the Court has discussed-is tantamount to these individuals denying that they had authorized a lawsuit in the first place. With respect to the 15 plaintiffs to whom Wilner did not even send a questionnaire (and especially the two plaintiffs whose first names Wilner did not even know), it is inconceivable that Wilner had any sort of attorney-client relationship if he did not possess such rudimentary contact information. With respect to all 572 of these cases, moreover, Wilner could not have been in recent contact with these plaintiffs nor could he have known that they wished to maintain these actions, as Wilner represented at the June 6, 2011 hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-461\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Wilner and Farah vexatiously and unreasonably multiplied the proceedings by filing and maintaining these 572 lawsuits for years before the Court finally dismissed them over Counsel's objections.

During the Special Master's investigation, Wilner himself \"indicated that he could not precisely answer the question of whether he was in contact with his 'clients' during the six-month period between December 6, 2010 and June 6, 2011 (the date of the hearing).\" (2016 R &amp; R at 190). That is because \"for most clients, [Wilner] did not record individual dates of contact.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 191). According to a review of his data, Wilner now claims to have been in contact with 2,231 clients during the six-month period preceding the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Special Master doubts that assertion, however, based on inaccuracies elsewhere in Wilner's data and his methodology for calculating that number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 191-93). The Special Master found correspondence that confirmed contact with only 1,320 individuals during the pertinent six-month time frame. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 193-94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-489\">\n   Wilner responds that when he stated he had been in contact with all of the remaining plaintiffs, he really meant during the preceding eight to nine months, not the preceding six months. (Objections at 108). That explanation is unpersuasive, because the question the Court asked Wilner was whether he was in contact with all of the plaintiffs in the preceding\n   <em>\n    six\n   </em>\n   months, and Wilner unequivocally answered \"yes.\" (Doc. 171 at 8-9). Besides, even if the Court accepted the premise that Wilner was referring to an eight-to-nine-month timeframe, it would not render his representation any more truthful. As the Court now knows, 588 of the personal injury plaintiffs had been dead since before 2008. Therefore, Wilner could not have been in contact with those plaintiffs even during the eight to nine months preceding the June 2011 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-490\">\n   Wilner's statement that he was in contact with all of the remaining plaintiffs was made with reckless disregard to its veracity, if it was not knowingly false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wilner now admits he could not precisely answer the Court's inquiry because he did not record dates of contact. Thus, when the Court asked Wilner whether he had been in contact with all of the remaining plaintiffs, Wilner should have responded \"No,\" or if he was unsure, then \"I don't know.\" Instead, Wilner answered \"[y]es, absolutely.\" The reason why: almost certainly because he did not want the Court to know that he was unaware of the current status of the plaintiffs and their claims. Wilner did not want to draw attention to the fact that he had filed hundreds of complaints on behalf of people with whom he had lost contact, and whose last contact with him might have been a decade or more old. Wilner gave the answer in bad faith-at least in the sense that he gave it with reckless indifference to its veracity. Wilner answered \"[y]es, absolutely\" to preserve the cases, not because he had a mistaken-but-earnest belief that he had been in recent contact with the remaining plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-491\">\n   The second misrepresentation the Special Master found was Wilner's statement that the remaining 2,900 plaintiffs were \"ready and able\" to proceed. Below are relevant excerpts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-492\">\n   MR. WILNER: Well, what we did after the [Temporary] Special Master's Report is went beyond that. In other words, we went and re-examined the entire mix of people and sent new questionnaires to everybody and compiled a new report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-493\">\n   So that is what we are just about to be able to present on behalf of everybody. So we took the [Temporary] Special Master's questions to heart, so to speak, but went beyond those questions, and we have data that extends to the entire group.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-494\">\n   The answer is, are all 2800 ready and able? Well, as far as we know today, they are. I hasten to say-\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-495\">\n   (Doc. 171 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-496\">\n   JUDGE CORRIGAN: Let me ask it this way, and I don't care if Mr. Wilner answers it or you answer it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-497\">\n   If you had to sign a Rule 11 complaint today, under Rule 11, because we know we haven't really talked about Rule 11, but if you had to sign a Rule 11 complaint today on behalf of each one of these smokers who has a case that you can certify under Rule 11, how many people would that be?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-498\">\n   MR. WILNER: Twenty-eight hundred and whatever the last two digits are. That's our data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-499\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-500\">\n   As the Court-ordered questionnaire process revealed later on, nearly a third of the plaintiffs were unresponsive, 588 personal injury cases involved predeceased plaintiffs, over a dozen involved plaintiffs who did not want to pursue a claim, and dozens more involved plaintiffs who did not meet basic\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   requirements, like Florida residency. Such cases obviously were not \"ready and able\" to proceed. As such, the Special Master concluded that this representation was false. (2016 R &amp; R at 194-95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-501\">\n   Wilner's assertion was also in bad faith. Wilner actually knew, or must have known, that representation was untrue. Nearly 600 of Wilner's personal injury \"clients\" were dead by then, and they had been dead for at least three and a half years. It is not plausible that Wilner merely overlooked that fact in good faith. In addition, a number of living plaintiffs or survivors had affirmatively told Wilner that they did not want to pursue a claim. For example, between 2008 and 2010, Sharon Swidler (3:09-cv-13302), Wayne Evans (3:09-cv-13772), the survivors of Carrie Griffin (3:09-cv-12660), and the personal representative of Eugene M. Johnson (3:09-cv-12989) all instructed Wilner not to pursue a cause of action. Thomas Sillers (3:09-cv-12415) told the lawyers over and over that he never resided in Florida, until eventually someone from Wilner or Farah told him \"that it didn't matter that he never lived in [Florida].\" (2016 R &amp; R at 206; Ex. 79 to 2016 R &amp; R at 233). In cases like these, Wilner had actual notice that the lawsuits were unauthorized or fundamentally defective. Wilner nevertheless told the Court that all of the remaining plaintiffs were \"ready and able\" to go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-502\">\n   Accordingly, there is clear and convincing evidence that Wilner recklessly or knowingly made misrepresentations at the June 6, 2011 hearing regarding his level of contact with the plaintiffs and the viability of the 2,900 remaining cases. Wilner's conduct obstructed the Court from eliminating hundreds of frivolous filings from the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   docket. Wilner forced the Court to order the dissemination of over 2,600 federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   questionnaires, and left it to the Temporary Special Master to unearth the frivolous cases. Wilner's obstruction delayed the adjudication of meritorious cases\n   as well. Accordingly, Wilner's misrepresentations at the June 6, 2011 hearing were in bad faith and are appropriate for sanctions under the Court's inherent authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   <strong>\n    2. April 6, 2012 Declaration (Doc. 589-1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-504\">\n   The Special Master also examined Wilner's April 6, 2012 Declaration (Doc. 589-1), which accompanied Wilner's response (Doc. 589) to the defendants' motion to dismiss personal injury complaints involving predeceased individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-505\">\n   First, the Special Master analyzed Wilner's contention that: \"[b]y 1998, I represented over 3,000 Florida smokers or their families. These clients were signed into contractual agreements giving the firm latitude as to the appropriate method to preserve and advance their claim against the cigarette companies.\" (Doc. 589-1 at \u00b6 4). The Special Master concludes that this statement misrepresented the number of smokers or their families who had signed contracts with Wilner by 1998. (2016 R &amp; R at 182-83). \"Based on Wilner's own data, there were only 45 clients who entered into contracts in the 1990's. The vast majority of the fee contracts weren't entered into until 2008, after the complaints had already been filed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-506\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit recognized the same discrepancy with Wilner's April 6, 2012 Declaration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-507\">\n   [T]he record remains incomplete or conflicting on nearly every relevant point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-508\">\n   First, Mr. Wilner's sworn declaration states, \"By 1998, I represented over 3,000 Florida smokers or their families.\n   <em>\n    These clients were signed into contractual agreements\n   </em>\n   giving the firm latitude as to the appropriate method to preserve and advance their claim[s] against the cigarette companies.\" Doc. 589-1, at 1 (emphasis added). His Verified Response states, though, that his representation began when his firm received \"information sufficient for us to believe that such client wanted us to act on their behalf should circumstances deem it advisable.\" Doc. 822, at 4. It explains further: \"requiring clients, who were at the time\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class members and formally represented by class counsel, to sign agreements in the mid 1990s was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   consistent with class action practices nor with our intent to monitor their potential claims and act only if necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. \"[R]egardless of the presence of a written agreement, our firm was duty bound to presume it represented each client who made contact seeking legal advice, and to act accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   So while Mr. Wilner originally told the court he had signed agreements from all 3,000-or-so of his \"clients,\" if the Verified Response is to be believed, it would seem that he considered anyone who contacted his firm to be a client and that none of them executed a written representation agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-509\">\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1111-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-510\">\n   Wilner now does not dispute that as of 1998, he had fee contracts with only a tiny percentage of his \"clients.\" (Objections at 111). Instead, Wilner argues that \"[t]o the extent one might\n   <em>\n    infer\n   </em>\n   that Wilner had 3,000 contractual agreements by 1998, that was not what he intended to communicate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To understand what he allegedly meant, Wilner insists that the Court must read the last two sentences of paragraph 4 of the Declaration granularly and discretely. What Wilner really meant to say was that: (1) by 1998, he represented over 3,000 smokers or their families, and (2) that each smoker was signed into a contractual agreement\n   <em>\n    as of the date of the Declaration\n   </em>\n   -April 6, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-511\">\n   Wilner's interpretation is frivolous. The plain and natural meaning of Wilner's Declaration is that he purportedly had 3,000 plaintiffs signed into contractual agreements\n   by 1998, not by the date of the Declaration. Nothing in paragraph 4 states that Wilner was referring to the state of affairs as of April 6, 2012. To the contrary, Wilner said that \"[b]y 1998, I represented over 3,000 Florida smokers or their families.\" (Doc. 589-1 at \u00b6 4). In the very next sentence, Wilner said, using the past tense, that the plaintiffs \"\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   signed into contractual agreements,\" obviously alluding to 1998. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). Wilner never said that the plaintiffs \"are signed into contractual agreements as of today.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, in the sentence after that, Wilner stated: \"As the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class action was\n   <em>\n    at that same time period\n   </em>\n   progressing through the courts, I elected, for the large majority of the claims, not to file individual claims at that time but to consider the claims as potential\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class members.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5) (emphasis added). Since the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class action was \"progressing through the courts\" from 1994 to 2006, Wilner could not have meant to say that 3,000 plaintiffs were signed into contractual agreements as of April 6, 2012. Accordingly, the Court rejects Wilner's revisionist interpretation of the Declaration. Wilner meant to say exactly what the Declaration says: that Wilner represented over 3,000 smokers or their families by 1998, and that by 1998 they had all signed contractual agreements. That representation was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-512\">\n   Wilner's misrepresentation could not have been an innocent mistake either. Only 45 plaintiffs signed contracts in the 1990's, and the vast majority of those who did sign contracts did not do so until after Wilner had already filed the complaints in 2008. (2016 R &amp; R at 183). It is not plausible that Wilner was earnestly mistaken about whether 3,000 people or 45 people had signed contracts by 1998. Wilner made the misrepresentation to overstate his authority to file the lawsuits at hand-particularly the 500+ personal injury cases with predeceased plaintiffs, whose dismissal Wilner was trying to prevent. As such, the Court finds that Wilner made this false representation in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   Next, the Special Master analyzed Wilner's representation that \"[his] firm had successfully remained in contact with most but not all of these clients during the decade long period between their initial contact with the firm and the [Florida] Supreme Court's decision.\" (Doc. 589-1 at \u00b6 7). The Special Master determined this statement to be a misrepresentation as well. (2016 R &amp; R at 183). The Special Master found that Wilner initially made contact with the plaintiffs between 1995 and 1997, that Wilner had little or no contact with those individuals over the next decade, and that Wilner only began re-contacting his \"clients\" beginning in late 2006, which is consistent with the lack of records of client communications from the 1995-2006 time frame. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183-84). The Special Master adds that paragraph 8 of the Declaration seems to contradict paragraph 7. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 589-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). In paragraph 8, Wilner stated that the status of the original claimants was unknown as of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   filing deadline. The Special Master advises that not knowing the status\n   of the original claimants is inconsistent with having maintained contact with the plaintiffs leading up to the January 2008 deadline. (2016 R &amp; R at 184).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit recognized similar contradictions in Wilner's statements about the level of contact he maintained with the plaintiffs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-515\">\n   Next, in his sworn declaration, Mr. Wilner stated, \"my firm had successfully remained in contact with most but not all of these clients during the decade long period between their initial contact with the firm and the Supreme Court's [\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   ] decision.\" Doc. 589-1, at 2. In his Verified Response, Mr. Wilner tells us the opposite: that \"[t]here is normally no need to monitor individual class members,\" and that the Florida Supreme Court's decertification of the class imposed \"a unique and exigent circumstance\" on his firm \"whose last contacts with these class members could well be decades old.\" Doc. 822, at 4-5. The summary data he attached to his Verified Response confirms that his last contact with most of the predeceased plaintiffs was in the mid- to late-'90s. We are not given data for the rest of Mr. Wilner's \"clients.\" In light of Mr. Wilner's confessed belief that he was \"duty bound to presume [he] represented each client who made contact,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18,\n   <em>\n    we are left with the inevitable conclusion that he filed lawsuits in 2008 for many individuals whose last, and perhaps only, contact with his firm was nearly a decade earlier, who never authorized him to file suit, and who, in all likelihood, had no earthly idea that Mr. Wilner considered himself to be their lawyer.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-516\">\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/#p1087\">\n    767 F.3d at 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-517\">\n   Given the inconsistencies with paragraph 7 of Wilner's April 6, 2012 Declaration, the Court agrees with the Special Master that Wilner once again misrepresented the level of contact he maintained with his \"clients.\" Wilner knew, or must have known, that he had lost contact with hundreds of plaintiffs a decade earlier (some of whom had been dead for that long). Wilner made the representation to obscure that he had lost contact with most-if not all-of the plaintiffs on whose behalf he filed complaints. The misrepresentation was made in bad faith. As such, sanctions are appropriate pursuant to the Court's inherent authority for Wilner's false assertions in the Declaration regarding the level of contact he maintained with the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-518\">\n   <strong>\n    PART VI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-519\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Monetary Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-520\">\n   The Court has determined that Wilner and Farah violated Rule 11 by advocating 588 personal injury complaints involving dead plaintiffs and 572 cases where the plaintiff never responded to the Court Questionnaire. The Court has also determined that Wilner and Farah violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by maintaining these cases, as well as 15 cases that were unauthorized; 18 cases where the plaintiff or decedent was not a smoker; 36 cases where the plaintiff or decedent never lived in Florida; and 28 cases that were previously adjudicated. Alternatively, the Court has the inherent authority to sanction Wilner and Farah for filing and maintaining these cases, as doing so violated the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct and their responsibilities as officers of this Court. Moreover, the Court has the inherent authority to sanction Wilner for misrepresentations made during the June 6, 2011 hearing (Doc. 171) and in his April 6, 2012 Declaration (Doc. 589-1). Due to some overlap between categories of frivolous cases, the total number of sanctionable cases is 1,250.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   This figure represents about a\n   third of the 3,765\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny complaints originally filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   The Court further determines that monetary sanctions are necessary to impress upon Wilner and Farah, and all others who litigate in this Court, that the Court cannot tolerate the type of conduct they have displayed in these cases. Non-monetary sanctions alone, such as a reprimand, will not suffice. Although the cold transcripts do not reflect it, Wilner's attitude throughout the proceedings has never reflected contrition. During the June 2011 status conference, for instance, Wilner's attitude was one of defiant indignation that the Court would suggest he was unaware of the status of the plaintiffs, as well as condescending assurance that the Court had no reason to worry about the viability of the remaining 2,900 cases. At the December 13, 2016 sanctions hearing, Wilner still did not seem to appreciate how seriously his conduct deviated from professional norms. Nor did Wilner seem to grasp the incredible strains his cavalier approach to filing\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   complaints imposed on the justice system-strains that were magnified by the fact that, at the time, the Middle District of Florida had the ninth heaviest weighted caseload in the country (out of 94 district courts).\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel's actions also delayed, perhaps by years, plaintiffs with meritorious cases from having their claims heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   Under Rule 11, a sanction \"must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(4). The sanction may include \"an order to pay a penalty into court\" if the Court is acting\n   <em>\n    sua\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    sponte\n   </em>\n   , as it is here. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(4). The Court must also consider the following factors in fashioning the appropriate sanction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-523\">\n   (1) \"[w]hether the improper conduct was willful, or negligent\"; (2) \"whether it was part of a pattern of activity, or an isolated event\"; (3) \"whether it infected the entire pleading, or only one particular count or defense\"; (4) \"whether the person has engaged in similar conduct in other litigation\"; (5) \"whether it was intended to injure\"; (6) \"what effect it had on the litigation process in time or expense\"; (7) \"whether the responsible person is trained in the law\"; (8) \"what amount, given the financial resources of the responsible person, is needed to deter that person from repetition in the same case\"; and (9) \"what amount is needed to deter similar activity by other litigants.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-524\">\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Early Cty., Ga.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=518%20Fed.%20Appx.%20645\">\n    518 Fed.Appx. 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b), Adv. Cmt. Notes to 1993 Amend.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-525\">\n   Applying these factors, the Special Master recommends that: (1) Wilner's and Farah's conduct was \"willful and reckless\"; (2) Counsel's conduct was part of a pattern that began with the filing of frivolous complaints and continued until the Court dismissed the last frivolous case; (3) Counsel's conduct infected the entire\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   litigation; (4) there is no evidence of similar previous misconduct by Wilner or Farah; (5) it is not clear that Wilner and Farah intended to injure, but they acted with conscious disregard to how their conduct would affect the Court, the\n   defendants, and other litigants who were waiting to have their cases adjudicated; (6) in terms of time and expense, Wilner's and Farah's conduct burdened the Court for years, and required both the Court and the defendants to expend significant additional resources; (7) Wilner and Farah were attorneys trained in the law; (8) deterring repetition in the same case is not a factor now that the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   litigation is over; and (9) total disgorgement of attorney's fees and costs is the only sanction sufficient to deter other lawyers from engaging in similar misconduct. (Doc. 2170, Response at 44-46). With respect to the ninth factor, the Special Master reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-526\">\n   By imposing a modest fine on a per cases basis, unscrupulous attorneys of like mind would not be deterred from engaging in such conduct. Rather, it would just require a calculus to determine whether the fees collected in the successful cases would be in excess of the sanctions imposed for the frivolous cases. Only by removing any possibility of profit can the Court be satisfied in the deterrent effect of the sanction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-527\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46). \"By preventing Farah and Wilner from profiting from their willful and reckless conduct, the Special Master believes [the sanction of complete disgorgement of fees] is the most appropriate means of deterring repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.\" (2016 R &amp; R at 285).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-528\">\n   The Court agrees with the Special Master's assessment of the first eight factors, but stops short of deciding that disgorgement of all attorneys' fees and costs is the proper sanction. To be sure, Wilner's and Farah's conduct was so egregious that disgorgement could be justified as necessary to deter similar abuses in future mass tort litigation. But the Court is mindful that the process employed is civil in nature and accordingly, the sanction must not be punitive. Moreover, a sanction of total disgorgement would deprive Wilner and Farah even of the fees they earned from prosecuting or settling legitimate causes of action, and would ignore the benefits attained for willing plaintiffs who had meritorious claims. The Court is unaware of any precedent where an attorney's sanction for litigating certain frivolous lawsuits consisted of losing the fees and costs earned from prosecuting other lawsuits with valid claims. As such, the Court declines the Special Master's recommendation to disgorge Wilner and Farah of all attorney's fees and costs.

The Court's efforts, mostly opposed by Wilner, included holding multi-judge panel hearings in June 2011 and June 2012 to address the bloated\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   docket, finding and appointing a Temporary Special Master to assist the Court in coping with case management, ordering Wilner to send questionnaires to the plaintiffs, reviewing\n   the Temporary Special Master's reports and analyses, disposing of the frivolous lawsuits (often over Counsel's opposition, as with the hundreds of cases involving Pre-Deceased Plaintiffs and those where the plaintiff never returned a questionnaire), and various other in-chambers tasks. Other litigants suffered as a result-both within and outside the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   litigation-because the time and resources the Court had to devote to these tasks could have been spent resolving other cases.\n   <em>\n    Ironically, even Wilner himself once acknowledged-albeit in the context of pushing for his own case management plan-that (1) the large volume of Engle claims imposed a significant burden on judicial resources, and (2) delay would harm plaintiffs and the public interest.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 25 at 8-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-537\">\n   The cost to the public of Wilner's and Farah's misbehavior does not end there, however. Because \"[t]he detection and punishment of a violation...is part of the court's responsibility for securing the system's effective operation,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, Adv. Cmt. Note, 1983 Amend., the Court had a duty to take action once it became apparent that Wilner and Farah had potentially violated their ethical duties and committed sanctionable conduct. To fulfill this duty while retaining the ability to act as a neutral arbiter, the Court appointed the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida to act as Special Master to investigate possible misconduct by the plaintiffs' counsel. (Doc. 2108).\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet such an investigation is not cost-free to the public. The United States Attorney is responsible for investigating and prosecuting a range of criminal and civil actions against those who violate federal law. The substantial time and resources that the United States Attorney spent investigating Wilner's and Farah's misconduct could have been used to prosecute other violations of the law. To compensate the public, the Court has determined that the sanction must encompass the cost of the Special Master's labor in carrying out this extensive investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Special Master, the value of its labor during the course of the sanctions investigation was $435,129.12 (Doc. 2180). Thus, this sum will be included in the sanction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-538\">\n   In total, therefore, Wilner's and Farah's conduct cost\n   <strong>\n    $9,164,404.12\n   </strong>\n   in judicial and other public resources during the course of the federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   litigation.

R. Civ. P. 11, Adv. Cmt. Notes, 1993 Amend. A sanction in this amount is also sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to deter\n   other lawyers from engaging in similarly egregious misconduct. The true cost of vexatious litigation is the diversion of judicial attention away from other cases and the loss of integrity that should underlie the system of civil justice-in addition to the incalculable cost of undermining public trust. This sanction teaches that frivolous litigation imposes real costs, which should be borne by the wrongdoers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-539\">\n   The Court must assure itself that the sanctioned party has the ability to pay.\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11669755\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/516/#p526\">\n    158 F.3d at 528-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court is so assured because it is holding in escrow approximately $45 million in attorneys' fees and costs from the global settlement of the remaining federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   cases. Although there is a pending state court dispute about the division of those fees among Lieff Cabraser Heimann &amp; Bernstein, Motley Rice, LLC, and the Wilner and Farah firms, it appears based upon the state court pleadings that the Wilner and Farah firms would likely be entitled to more than the amount of the sanction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, Wilner and Farah have the ability to pay the sanction from readily available funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-540\">\n   The Court recognizes that a strong case can be made that Wilner and Farah should be disgorged of all fees from the federal Engle litigation; the Court already has said why it is not ordering disgorgement. Nevertheless, the Court is also aware that the monetary sanction it imposes is significant, and perhaps unprecedented. But \"[a]s has been observed before, nearly everything about the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   progeny litigation is\n   <em>\n    sui\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generis\n   </em>\n   .\" (Doc. 925 at 12) (citing\n   <em>\n    Waggoner v.

Equally unprecedented is a lawyer filing 1,250 frivolous lawsuits, followed by years of maintaining those cases through obfuscation and recalcitrance. It must also be remembered that this sanction is not imposed for a single case. It is instead $6,983.42-a modest sum given the egregiousness of Counsel's conduct and its adverse consequences on the Court's docket-imposed for each of the 1,250 frivolous lawsuits that Counsel advanced in bad faith (plus the cost of the Special Master's labor).\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   While $9,164,404.12 is a large\n   number, it is that large only because of the breathtaking scale of Wilner's and Farah's wrongdoing. To impose a lesser sanction only because the end figure seems too high perversely would give Counsel a break precisely\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   they advocated such a vast number of frivolous lawsuits. That cannot be. Such a monetary sanction is necessary to compensate the public and to deter other lawyers from engaging in similarly outrageous conduct in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-541\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Apportionment of Fault\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-542\">\n   The Wilner and Farah law firms were responsible for investigating and filing each of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny lawsuits, and it was Wilner and Farah themselves who signed each of the complaints. It was Wilner who filed case management briefs representing that all of the roughly 4,000 plaintiffs were\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class members. (Doc. 25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nestor Amoros, et al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:07-cv-760-J-25HTS, Doc. 35-2). Wilner and Farah also signed court filings where they insisted that the remaining cases were viable, and that questioning or interviewing the plaintiffs was unnecessary because there was no significant number of cases ripe for dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61, Doc. 158). Wilner played the leading role in deciding to file, maintain, and advocate 1,250 lawsuits he knew or should have known were frivolous. Moreover, it was Wilner who stood before the Court in June 2011 and insisted that he had been in recent contact with all of the remaining plaintiffs, and that he could certify that all of the remaining complaints satisfied Rule 11. It was also Wilner who made the misleading representations about his authority to represent the plaintiffs in his April 2012 declaration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 589-1). Accordingly, the Court concludes that Wilner and Farah should be sanctioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-543\">\n   The Court agrees with the Special Master that the law firms of Lieff Cabraser and Motley Rice should not be sanctioned. Lieff Cabraser and Motley Rice joined the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   effort in 2011 and 2012, respectively, when Wilner, feeling the weight of the Court's inquiries, belatedly sought them out. Lieff Cabraser and Motley Rice were not responsible for creating the mess. Nor were those firms in the same position as Wilner and Farah to know how haphazardly the cases were investigated and filed-they just weren't around at the time. Overall, Lieff Cabraser and Motley Rice acted reasonably once they became involved in the litigation. Even if they made some mistakes, their conduct never rose to the level of bad faith or recklessness that is necessary for the imposition of sanctions. As such, the Court determines that neither Lieff Cabraser nor Motley Rice should be sanctioned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-544\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Non-Monetary Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-545\">\n   Finally, the Court has the discretion under Rule 11 and its inherent authority to impose a variety of non-monetary sanctions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(4) (\"The sanction may include nonmonetary directives....\");\n   <em>\n    In re Tutu Wells Contamination Litig.\n   </em>\n   , 120 F.3d at 383 (listing options for non-monetary sanctions) (citation omitted). Rule 11's commentary provides a number of examples of possible nonmonetary sanctions, including \"issuing an admonition, reprimand, or censure;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-546\">\n   requiring participation in seminars or other educational programs; [and] \u2026 referring the matter to disciplinary authorities.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, Adv. Cmt. Note, 1993 Amend., subdivisions (b) and (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-547\">\n   The Special Master recommends that the Court refer the matter to the Florida Bar for an investigation into whether Wilner and Farah violated the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct. (2016 R &amp; R at 288-89, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12). The Court agrees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Court's opinion, a Bar investigation is warranted with respect to (1) whether Wilner and Farah violated Florida Rule of Professional Conduct (\"FRPC\") 4-3.1 by pursuing lawsuits lacking any factual basis, and (2) whether Wilner and Farah violated FRPC 4-3.3(a)(1) by knowingly \"mak[ing] a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail[ing] to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer.\" (There may also be other ethical provisions implicated by Counsel's conduct). The Court is aware that the Florida Bar previously investigated Wilner and, on a limited record, found no probable cause to discipline him. However, in light of the complete record now compiled by the Special Master and the Court's findings in this Order, the Court recommends that a further investigation by the Florida Bar is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-548\">\n   Additionally, the Court determines that a public reprimand is appropriate. As this Order will be published, the Order itself accomplishes that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-549\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-550\">\n   Imposing sanctions on members of the Bar of this Court is an unpleasant task. Fatigued from managing the federal\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   docket since 2008, it would have been easier for the undersigned-once the global settlement was announced and the defendants' Rule 11 motion withdrawn-to let this matter go. However, we all agreed that would be inconsistent with our duty to ensure that lawyers who practice before the Court do so ethically and responsibly. If we did not cite Wilner and Farah for unprofessional conduct committed on such a grand scale, how could we continue to insist upon professionalism in our other cases? If this egregious conduct went unchecked, what deterrent would there be for other lawyers in future cases from taking the same approach? As the Honorable William W. Schwarzer of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California aptly stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-551\">\n   Of all the duties of a judge, imposing sanctions on lawyers is perhaps the most unpleasant. A desire to avoid doing so is understandable. But if judges turn from Rule 11 and let it fall into disuse, the message to those inclined to abuse or misuse the litigation process will be clear. Misconduct, once tolerated, will breed more misconduct and those who might seek relief against abuse will instead resort to it in self-defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-552\">\n   <em>\n    Sanctions Under the New Rule 11-A Closer Look\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20F.R.D.%20181\">\n    104 F.R.D. 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205 (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-553\">\n   Wilner's and Farah's maintenance of 1,250 frivolous complaints and their refusal to aid the Court in purging these cases from the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   docket substantially prolonged this litigation. Wilner and Farah forced the Court, over Wilner's objections, to expend significant time and resources merely identifying and eliminating baseless claims-something a court should not have to do. Wilner's and Farah's conduct evinced disdain for the Court, and reckless disregard for their profession's ethical duties to the Court and to other litigants. As a result of their actions, other litigants\n   faced increased delays as the Court had to divert its attention to cleaning up the mess that was the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   docket. It is hard to overstate the strains Wilner and Farah placed on the Court's already-stretched resources.

(Objections at 110). Wilner's argument is unavailing because the June 2011 Hearing was not the first time Counsel had asserted that they were in contact with the plaintiffs and that the remaining cases had merit.

Wilner's representations during the June 2011 Hearing were not of that character. Since December 2010, the Court had been seeking ways to sort out viable cases from non-viable cases. Thus, Wilner knew going into the June 2011 Hearing that the Court's goal was to get a handle on the number of viable cases and the number of plaintiffs willing and able to proceed. Wilner had ample opportunity before the June 2011 Hearing to study and reflect on how many of the 2,900 then-pending cases had a willing and able Plaintiff with a colorable claim.

Second, the Stay did not go into effect until October 2008, whereas Wilner claims he located around 400 survivors by June 2008.

(Doc. 2174 at 106-07). That was not at all among the reasons Counsel gave when they objected to proposals to inquire into the status of the plaintiffs. Rather, Counsel consistently asserted that the Court Questionnaires were an unnecessary exercise because: Counsel had complete files for all of the plaintiffs; any information gleaned from individual interviews \"would not be worth much to anyone\"; and the Court Questionnaires would \"not result in 'a substantial reduction in the number of cases.' \"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"39\">\n   <p id=\"p-607\">\n    One of Counsel's objections is that when they filed the complaints, they relied on Florida Ethics Opinion (\"\n    <strong>\n     FEO\n    </strong>\n    \") 72-36 (Revised) (1987). There, \"the Florida Bar Professional Ethics Committee addressed the issue of whether a lawyer retained for litigation by a client who has since disappeared is obligated to file suit in order to toll the applicable statute of limitations.\" (Doc. 2147 at 118). In the revised 1987 Opinion, the committee decided that an attorney\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    , but is not\n    <em>\n     required\n    </em>\n    to, file a complaint on behalf of a missing client if (1) the client's unavailability is not due to the attorney's neglect or inaction; and (2) either (a) the attorney believes there is no reasonable chance that the client will return or (b) the client has breached the attorney-client employment agreement by making himself unavailable.

Ethics Opinion 72-36 (Reconsideration) (1987).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-608\">\n    The Special Master recommends that Counsel's reliance on FEO 72-36 is misplaced (Doc. 2147 at 118-20), and the Court agrees. The circumstances of FEO 72-36 and this case are distinguishable. First, the attorney in FEO 72-36 (Revised) had a contingency fee contract to represent the missing client, whereas here Counsel did not have any representation agreements for the vast majority of the plaintiffs at the time they filed the complaints, nor was it clear they were ever \"clients.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 183).

First, it is contrary to the plain language of the\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    class definition, which defines the class as \"\n    <em>\n     [a]ll Florida citizens and residents\n    </em>\n    \" \"and\n    <em>\n     their\n    </em>\n    survivors, who have suffered, presently suffer or who have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine.\"\n    <em>\n     Engle I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7422977\" index=\"373\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/672/39/#p40\">\n     672 So.2d at 40, 42\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). Thus, it is the person who suffered from an addiction to cigarettes who must be a Florida citizen or resident,\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    the survivor. Under Wilner's nonsensical interpretation of the residency requirement, if a smoker and lifelong resident of San Francisco, California died, leaving behind a survivor who happened to live in Jacksonville, Florida, the survivor could join the\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    litigation and recover from the cigarette companies-in Florida court and under Florida tort law-for conduct that occurred entirely in California.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-626\">\n    The second problem with Wilner's interpretation of the residency requirement is that the very wrongful death complaints he filed in 2008 belie it. Wilner made a point of alleging in the wrongful death complaints that\n    <em>\n     the\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     decedents\n    </em>\n    were Florida residents, not the survivors.

Thus, Wilner's own complaints reflect that he understood the residency requirement as applying to the decedents, not their survivors.

Ironically, the sanction likely would have been greater had the Court acted immediately on the tobacco companies' motion for Rule 11 sanctions, which was later withdrawn pursuant to the settlement agreement. However, the Court did not act immediately on the Rule 11 motion because the Court did not want the issue of sanctions to sidetrack it from the primary goal of identifying and resolving viable pending\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    cases (many of which involved plaintiffs in declining health). Because the Court put the sanctions issue on the backburner so as not to cause further delays, the plaintiffs' lawyers had time to reach a global settlement, part of which entailed the withdrawal of the Rule 11 motion.

According to Wilner's and Farah's Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and Crossclaim, a fee-sharing agreement between Lieff Cabraser and the Wilner and Farah firms calls for Wilner and Farah to receive no less than 40% of any attorney's fees derived from a settlement, Lieff Cabraser to receive no less than 30% of attorney's fees derived from a settlement, and \"[t]he remaining 30% of such fees [to] be shared upon further mutual agreement, or, in the absence of such agreement, pursuant to mediation or binding arbitration.\" (Case No. 16-2015-CA-003930, Docket Entry No. 18 at 9, \u00b6 13).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-650\">\n    As the Court noted, it has approximately $45 million worth of attorney's fees and costs in the Federal\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    Settlement Fund, which was derived from the settlement of the remaining federal\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    cases.
