Presently pending are Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Third Amended Complaint in Part as to Millersville University, ECF No. 40, and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 41. For the reasons set forth herein, both motions are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Howell filed his Third Amended Compliant on August 22, 2017, alleging that he suffered age discrimination when the Music Department of Millersville denied him a promotion, demoted him from the position of Director of Choral Activities, and subjected him to two internal investigations, and that various members of the Department retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment rights. ECF No. 39. Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss the Third Amended Complaint in Part on September 1, 2017, arguing that although Howell included Millersville University of Pennsylvania as a defendant in the caption of his Third Amended Complaint, he brings no claims against the University in any of the five counts of his Third Amended Complaint. ECF No. 40. On the same day, Defendants filed their Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 41. Howell filed a Response to the Motion to Dismiss on September 15, 2017, ECF No. 54, and a Response to the Motion for Summary Judgment on September 22, 2017, ECF No. 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following facts are either undisputed or viewed in the light most favorable to Howell, the non-moving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   From 1996 through the spring of 2014, Dr. Allen Howell taught music education and conducted non-auditioned choirs in the music department of Edinboro University. Defs.' Stat. Facts \u00b6 1, ECF No. 41-1; Pl.'s Resp. to Stat. Facts \u00b6 1, ECF No. 57. When he learned in late 2013 that Edinboro was retrenching him, Howell applied for the Director of Choral Activities position at Millersville University, a tenure-track position with the rank of Associate Professor. At the time that this position was advertised, Dr. Jeffrey Gemmell, an adjunct professor with a doctoral degree in choral conducting who is the same age as Howell, conducted Millersville's choirs. Howell Dep. 213:6, Pl.'s Ex. B, ECF No. 57-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under the collective bargaining agreement with Howell's faculty union and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE), Howell's application was to be judged as to whether he was \"minimally qualified\" for the position, which was a very low standard. Defs.' Stat. Facts \u00b6 5; Pl.'s Resp. to Stat. Facts \u00b6 5; Houlahan Dep. 68:1-15, 95:18-98:21, Pl.'s Ex. H, ECF No. 57-12; Banks Dep. 40:1-12, Pl.'s Ex. D, ECF No. 57-8. The Music Department faculty assessed Howell's application first and the President of the University made the final decision. Defs.' Stat. Facts \u00b6 7; Pl.'s Resp. to Stat. Facts \u00b6 7; Houlahan Dep. 68:17-24. The Music Department concluded that Howell was not minimally qualified: faculty members expressed concerns about Howell's familiarity with the repertoire of choral music. Additionally, some faculty felt that Howell's degree did not qualify him for the position. The advertised position stated that a doctorate in choral conducting was \"preferred,\" but that an applicant, at minimum, should have completed all the requirements for a doctorate in Choral Conducting except the dissertation. Banks Decl. \u00b6 7; Banks Dep. 48-51; Defs.' Ex. D17, ECF No. 47-1. Howell has a Doctorate of Musical Arts with a primary concentration in Music Education and a secondary concentration in Choral Conducting. Howell Dep. at 20-21, 193; Pl.'s Ex. 98, p. 2, ECF No. 57-7. Regardless, the President of the University found Howell to be minimally qualified and, against the Department's recommendation, offered him a position as Director of Choral Activities at the rank of Associate Professor with tenure. Defs.' Ex. 83, ECF No. 45-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the fall of 2014, Howell began teaching the required credits per year, with extra pay for overloads. Houlahan Decl. \u00b6 16, ECF No. 43-7. Howell directs the non-auditioned Men's Glee Club, a standard activity for a choral director. Prabhu Dep. 87: 23-24, Pl.'s Ex. M, ECF No. 57-17; Howell Dep. 68:4-8, 69:6-9. However, he does not conduct the Department's two auditioned choirs or the Women's Choir, which Gemmell still conducts. Gemmel Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 43-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gemmell states that these three groups \"perform a more extensive, complex repertoire at a consistently higher level of musicality than the level of the Men's Glee Club,\" which aims at a \"fun-based experience more than curriculum-based learning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In November, Howell met with Defendant Dr. Miche\u00e1l Houlahan, Chair of the Music Department, concerning critical comments from students and faculty about Howell's performance. Defs.' Stat. Facts \u00b6 18; Pl.'s Resp. to Stat. Facts \u00b6 18. Howell reiterated his credentials to Chair Houlahan and asked to direct the more advanced choral ensembles in addition to the Men's Glee Club.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   December 2014, Howell and Dr. Toney, another retrenchee hired at the same time as Howell, met with Defendant Dean Diane Umble and complained about Chair Houlihan's micromanagement of the Department and course assignments. Defs.' Exs. 142, 142A, ECF Nos. 45-15, 45-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In June 2015, Howell sent an email to the entire Music Department and Dean Umble, stating that he refused to comply with the Department policy requiring students to buy specific lecture notes to defray the cost of live concerts and objected to the requirement that the students attend those concerts. Defs. Exs. 5, 8, ECF No. 44-1; Wiley Dep. 116-119, ECF No. 42-9; Umble Dep. 196-199, ECF No. 42-8. By November 2015, the Dean's office knew of three complaints about Howell's Popular Music Class: one concerning an explicit and violent music video he had shown in class, another complaining about his unstructured teaching style and open syllabus-and changing that style to \"appease\" Chair Houlahan on the day he observed class-and a third complaint alleging Howell's inappropriate behavior with his significant other while manning a recruitment table at a school event. Defs.' Ex. 94, ECF No. 45-9; Defs.' Exs. D7, D8, D9, ECF No. 46-1. Dean Umble and Howell met to discuss the complaints, and Dean Umble reported the results to Provost Prabhu, who considered Howell's teaching style unorthodox. Defs.' Exs. 94, D9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Fall 2015, Howell applied for promotion to full professor. Defs.' Ex. 144, ECF No. 45-17; Defs.' Ex. D13, ECF No. 47-1. Promotion criteria as listed in the Millersville University Promotion Statement include: (1) outstanding teaching, (2) service to the department and the University, and (3) evidence of scholarly program with sustained accomplishments in peer-reviewed scholarship. Prabhu Decl. \u00b6 10, ECF No. 43-9; Defs.' Ex. 65, ECF No. 44-8. The Department's professional development committee reviewed Howell's application; the committee included Defendant Dr. N. Keith Wiley and Defendant Dr. Phillip Tacka. Wiley Dep. 140-141, 160. Because Howell had only been at Millersville for two years, and the prerequisites for promotion ordinarily required five years as an associate professor, the committee considered his application under the \"Exceptional\" clause, which allowed unusually qualified candidates early promotion if they met the levels of expectation in all three of the promotion criteria and exceeded them in two out of the three. Defs.' Exs. 22, 23, ECF No. 44-2; Millersville University Promotion Statement p. 8, attached to Prabhu Decl. The committee unanimously recommended against promotion, concluding that Howell's documents included student evaluations from only four classes he taught as opposed to the required five, and that although Howell's CV listed various professional activities, only four of them occurred in the previous four years, and he presented no documentation to support them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Chair Houlahan and Dean Umble both agreed with the committee. Defs.' Exs. 23-24, ECF No. 44-2; Umble Dep. 219:10-14, 227:1-228:2. Lastly, the University-wide promotion and tenure committee considered Howell's application independently and unanimously determined not to recommend him for promotion. Defs.' Stat. Facts \u00b6 38; Pl.'s Resp. to Stat. Facts \u00b6 38; Defs.' Ex. 32, ECF No. 44-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2016, Howell was the subject of an \"Article 43\" investigation, carried out pursuant to Article 43 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement to resolve a complaint against Howell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   DeSantis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3,\n   ECF No. 43-3. The complaint alleged that Howell had provided insufficient supervision to two student teachers, one of whom complained that she did not receive any written feedback. DeSantis Dep. 119:9-120:1. The second incident of inadequate supervision resulted in a loss of student music teacher placement at the particular school involved. Defs.' Exs. 33, 35, ECF No. 44-3; DeSantis Decl. \u00b6 3; Umble Dep. 267:15-268:12. Howell explained that his practice, in keeping with his educational philosophy, involved group meetings where he gave verbal feedback to the student teachers he supervised. DeSantis Dep. 122-14. No discipline was imposed, and Howell agreed that he would provide proper feedback in the future as required. DeSantis Decl. \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In March 2016, several members of the Music Department faculty met with Human Resources Director DeSantis and Dean Umble to share their concerns about Howell, the circumstances of his hiring, his issues with student teaching, his interactions with other faculty members, and their concerns about his hostility. Pl.'s Ex. 66, ECF No. 57-6; Umble Dep. 248:17-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At a Department meeting in May 2016, Chair Houlihan made a statement to the effect that the Department had no Director of Choral Activities to assist with recruiting, but Howell responded that he was the Director of Choral Activities. Wiley Dep. 77:9-78:10. A subsequent grievance Howell filed under the Collective Bargaining Agreement lists the date of the meeting as the date he became aware of age discrimination, although no evidence in the record suggests that age was discussed at the meeting. Wiley Dep. 77:9-14, Defs.' Ex. D12, ECF No. 47-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Between spring 2014 and spring 2016, Tacka made several comments about wanting \"young and energetic\" or \"young and charismatic\" people in the positions of Director of Choral Activities and Director of Bands for student recruiting purposes. Howell Dep. 122:15-123:23, 124:3-14, 126:12-24, 127:3-7; Tacka Dep. 139:8-140:16, 267:21-268:6; Wiley Dep. 31:1-14. The first time, at a faculty meeting, Banks and Wiley corrected Tacka, stating that the Department should not focus on a candidate's age, but rather the person's qualifications, which could include charisma and energy. Houlahan Dep. 158:16-24, 160; Wiley Dep. 31:1-32:1; Banks Dep. 160:6-14. Chair Houlahan, Wiley, and Tacka testified that Tacka immediately accepted the correction and clarified that he meant to say charismatic, not young. Wiley Dep. 31:16-20; Houlahan Dep. 159:15-23; Tacka Dep. 139:12-140:16. Howell recalls that Tacka said \"young\" on two other occasions, but that Chair Houlahan corrected him both times. Howell Dep. 124:17-22. Chair Houlahan and Wiley claim they never heard a discussion about the age of candidates; Howell disputes this and states that they admitted to hearing Tacka's comments about the Department wanting a young person. Houlahan Dep. 71:24-72:1; Wiley Dep. 26, 91:23-92:3, 93:15-19; Pl.'s Stat. Facts \u00b6 48 (citing Houlahan Dep. 158:16-22; Wiley Dep. 31:1-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Music Department contends that they no longer use the title \"Director of Choral Activities\" to avoid confusion with the position of director of the University's honors college, and use the title \"coordinator\" instead. Defs.' Stat. Facts \u00b6 49 (citing Banks Dep. 164:12-165:21, 192:20-24). Howell disputes this and points to the Millersville website which, as of May 2017, listed Gemmel's position as \"Interim Director of Choral Activities.\" Pl.'s Ex. 40, ECF No. 57-5. Howell also points out that Banks did not recall the use of title \"coordinator\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   in the Department prior to Howell's arrival, and stated that she did not know any other PASSHE school that uses the title \"Coordinator of Choral Activities.\" Banks Dep. 165:12-14, 192:2-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Also in May 2016, Chair Houlahan wrote to Dean Umble to document Chair Houlahan's attempts to mentor Howell, observing that \"[i]t appears that Dr. Howell feels that the department has 'an ax to grind,' \" noting that Howell had not attended informational sessions about the University's expectations for faculty supervisors of student teachers, such that \"[i]t is unclear as to how Dr. Howell has the knowledge to supervise student teachers without attending these meetings.\" Defs.' Ex. 72, ECF No. 45-2. Chair Houlahan also stated that based upon past performances, the Department of Music did not believe Howell possessed the skills to be Director of Choral Activities, and documenting complaints from students about Howell's inadequate academic advising.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In February 2017, the University initiated another Article 42/43 investigation of unprofessional conduct by Howell. Pl.'s Ex. 57, ECF No. 57-6; DeSantis Dep. 180, ECF No. 42-2; Prabhu Dep. 103. The allegations against Howell included an unprofessional response to a student question, poor classroom management during a class discussion, unprofessional social media posting about a student, and communicating information with his Popular Music class that had no relation to the subject matter. The University provided Howell with evidence of the allegations in a letter dated April 5, 2017. Pl's. Ex. 57. The evidence included an email that a student in Howell's Popular Music class sent to Chair Houlahan on February 15, 2017, expressing a concern about how Howell had treated another student during the previous class session. The email stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   I'm currently taking Pop Music with Dr. Howell, and so far every class we have had he hasn't taught much, if anything about pop music...thus far he has taught everything, but pop music.

While I understand that these are all fascinating subjects to him, the fact is that he isn't teaching the designated subject.

It seems to me, when I hear students protest that their educational experiences are too broad (e.g., Why don't we just focus on pop music?

The rulers do not want citizens capable of critical thinking or citizens who understand\n   the larger issues behind the mundane affairs that we are \"supposed\" be [sic] thinking about. Musicians, however, consistently address larger issues. If we want to understand their music, we too must address the underlying issues.

Banks also noted that she was unaware of any criticism of Howell because of his social media postings. Banks Dep. 222:6-7.

The Department initially found Howell unqualified for the position of Director of Choral Activities because of concerns about his degree: Howell has a D.M.A. in music education with a secondary concentration in choral conducting, not a Ph.D. in choral conducting. The faculty found their concerns justified after receiving various complaints and observing Howell's Glee Club performances. In an email to Dean Umble and\n   DeSantis concerning the May 9, 2016 faculty meeting, during which Howell claims he became aware of his \"demotion,\" Chair Houlahan describes the faculty's low opinion of Howell's skills and Howell's unwillingness to accept advice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We have not addressed the question if Dr. Howell is the Director of Choral Activities? Faculty have recommended that he not be hired for this position. Conducting an ensemble as opposed to directing a choral program are two very responsibilities [sic]. It is the professional opinion of the department that he simply does not have the skills to direct the Choral program or the Glee Club ensemble. My advisement notes document that I have followed the Dean's instructions and have repeatedly tried to offer specific advice and professional assistance to Dr. Howell regarding his assignments within the department....All of my advice has been ignored.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defs.' Ex. 71, ECF No. 45-1.

Because the Department did not feel confident in Howell's ability to conduct high-level ensembles and teach upper-level classes, they assigned him large general-education classes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, the Department traditionally focuses on the Kod\u00e1ly method, a specific pedagogical method of music instruction, and provides its students the opportunity to obtain certification in the Kod\u00e1ly method. Howell, however, does not have his Kod\u00e1ly certification, which further limits his ability to teach upper-level classes.

The Department relieved Howell's responsibilities to supervise student music teachers because he refused to comply with the requirements to provide the students adequate feedback, which resulted in a host school ending its relationship with Millersville University's student teachers. In an email to Chair Houlahan, the teacher at the host school shared her frustration at Howell's refusal to share his written feedback for a student teacher so she could compare it with her own, and stated, \"[t]his is my third student teacher from Millersville and it will most likely be my last....I find the lack of communication and answers I did receive from Howell unprofessional and not what I would expect from Millersville.\" Defs.'

Howell falls far short of this standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Howell contends that he \"should have been promoted to full professor like he had been at Edinboro, even under the exceptional standard, based on his performance in teaching, scholarship, and service.\" Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. Summ. Judg. at 28. All Howell's evidence concerning the denial of his promotion application presents variations on the same theme: that Defendants and the University made the wrong decision. Even if he is correct, though, merely demonstrating that an employer made an incorrect or imprudent decision does not establish pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, he contends that \"[t]he University made it nearly impossible for [him] to be promoted\" by evaluating his application under the \"early promotion\" procedures that required him not just to meet but to exceed expectations in at least two of the three areas of evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Howell argues that the University should not have evaluated his application under the stricter early promotion standard because of his status as a retrenchee from another university.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But Howell offers no evidence other than his own opinion that his retrenchee status meant that the Department\n   committee, Chair Houlahan, the University-wide committee, and Provost Prabhu should not have applied the \"early promotion\" standard to his application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, Howell points to evidence of \"procedural irregularities\" in the review of his application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He points to \"tremendous confusion\" among the Department committee concerning what standard to use in reviewing his application and whether to consider his past work at Edinboro.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Howell cannot show pretext merely by showing that the Department applied the wrong standard out of confusion. Instead, he must prove that they deliberately applied the wrong standard because of his age. He has failed to do so. Howell complains that Tacka, whom Howell considers biased against him, served on the Department committee, but he presents no evidence that Tacka's alleged bias influenced the committee's decision, especially given that the committee voted unanimously. Howell also alleges that the committee \"pretextually discounted\" his positive performances because his application did not include programs or other evidence to substantiate his listed performances, did not contain hard copies of his published articles, and contained outside evaluations came from assistant professors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. However, he does not dispute that his application did in fact suffer from these defects, nor does he offer any evidence that the committee's denial of his application because of these defects violated any promotion procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Howell also complains that Chair Houlahan provided feedback on the Department committee's draft evaluation, and sent a draft of his own negative evaluation to a friend outside of the University, which Howell argues violated \"procedural norms\" and confidentiality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. But he offers no evidence that Chair Houlahan improperly influenced the Department committee's decision or that sending his evaluation to a friend violated any University procedure beyond a generalized \"confidentiality.\" He further argues that Dean Umble relied on \"pretextual\" reasons for denying his application when she cited the absence of certain materials from Howell's application, which Chair Houlahan's evaluation referenced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This argument misunderstands Dean Umble's evaluation. Under the University's Promotion Statement, the applicant submits ten copies of the bound application packet and one copy of supporting materials. Pl.'s Ex. 18, III.C, ECF No. 57-4. The Department chair keeps the supporting materials and distributes the applications to the Department committee and the Dean.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Umble Dep. 226-227. Dean Umble testified that when she evaluates a promotion candidate, she reviews the applications but does not seek out the supporting materials. Umble Decl. \u00b6 3. She stated that Howell's application referenced peer teaching observations and student evaluations in his supporting materials, but did not contain them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Howell does not dispute this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Howell traces his scholarly and service-oriented achievements and discusses his achievements at Edinboro University, which he believes the reviewers should have considered; however, he puts forward no evidence that the review procedures required them to do so. Howell also undermines his own argument that Defendants unfairly devalued his performance: he admits that Chair Houlahan found that \"Howell is to be commended for his teaching, scholarly growth, as well as his service to Millersville University,\" but argues that Chair Houlahan \"relied on the misplaced 'exceptional' standard to recommend against promotion.\" Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. Summ. Judg. at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To recapitulate, Howell can prove, at best, that Defendants applied the wrong\n   standard in evaluating his application for promotion. He cannot prove that they deliberately misapplied the standard because of his age. However much he may disagree with the decision and emphasize his own qualifications, he has not produced evidence of such \"weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions\" in Defendants' rationale for denying his promotion that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find it \"unworthy of credence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Howell also tries to demonstrate pretext with respect to the second adverse employment action, his \"demotion\" from the position of Director of Choral Activities. He argues that the decision was a pretext for age discrimination because Chair Houlahan's decision to strip the title and duties from Howell clearly conflicts with Howell's appointment letter and \"directly impact[s] the terms and conditions of Dr. Howell's employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30. Additionally, Howell points to Chair Houlahan's renaming the position \"Coordinator of Choral Activities\" as pretext, given that no other PASSHE university uses the title and the Coordinator position had the same duties as the Director, including conducting the top choirs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. Howell can quibble about the exact name of the position, but none of his arguments casts doubt upon the Department's conclusion that Howell does not possess the qualifications for Director of Choral Activities, much less makes it \"unworthy of credence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Howell contends that the Department's concern about his lack of a doctorate in Choral Conducting is pretextual, because the job description for Director of Choral Activities listed a doctorate in choral conducted as \"preferred,\" not \"required.\" Howell bases his argument on a misreading. The posting describes the \"Required\" qualification as \"ABD-Doctorate program leading to Doctorate in Choral Conducting,\" meaning that, at a minimum, an applicant for Director of Choral Activities must have completed all but the dissertation requirement (ABD) of a Doctorate in Choral Conducting program. Pl.'s Ex. 98, ECF No. 57-7; Defs.' Stat. Facts. \u00b6 2. The posting lists the \"Preferred\" qualification as \"Doctoral Degree in Choral Conducting.\" Pl.'s Ex. 98, ECF No. 57-7. Thus the distinction between required and preferred qualifications hinges, not on whether the applicant has a primary degree focus in choral conducting or in another subject, as Howell contends, but on whether the applicant has yet to finish the dissertation requirement of a Doctorate in Choral Conducting program or whether he has completed the degree. The Department therefore had adequate basis to conclude that Howell did not have the required qualifications to fulfill all the duties of Director of Choral Activities, given his lack of a Doctorate in Choral Conducting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Howell's evidence concerning the Coordinator of Choral Activities position underscores the Department's lack of confidence in his ability to conduct the top choirs: Howell references Tacka's statement that the Department hired Gemmell as a \"temporary solution...to cover the major responsibilities that would be covered by the coordinator of the choral activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, as stated earlier, Gemmell, the replacement adjunct who had many of the responsibilities of the Director of Choral Activities, is the same age as Howell, weakening any inference that age-related discrimination motivated Howell's \"demotion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Howell also attempts to put forward evidence for disbelieving Defendants' reasons for the first Article 42/43 investigation and the removal of his student teacher supervision duties. He states that when Chair Houlahan received the student complaint alleging a lack of feedback, he immediately\n   forwarded it to Dean Umble and Human Resources instead of trying to resolve the matter informally at the Department level as Department and University protocol required.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Howell points out that the Article 42 investigation did not find any wrongdoing, but that the University failed to disclose to Howell that he had been cleared.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Howell's argument overlooks the fact that his deficient supervision led to at least one student teacher complaint and the loss of a host school. The Department reasonably could decide to restrict his duties out of concern for future reputational damage and loss of much-needed host schools for student teachers. Given this fact, he cannot claim that the Department's concern about his ability to give proper supervision to student teachers was so implausible as to be pretextual for age discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Howell cannot point to any evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a jury could reasonably disbelieve Defendants' articulated legitimate reasons for their challenged actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Howell has offered no evidence from which a reasonable jury could believe that an invidious discriminatory motive was more likely than not a determinative cause of Defendants' actions.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A plaintiff seeking to establish pretext by producing evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a \"determinative cause of the employer's action\" must point to evidence demonstrating any of the following satisfies this second way to prove pretext: (1) the defendant previously discriminated against the plaintiff; (2) the defendant discriminated against others within the plaintiff's protected class; or (3) the defendant has treated similarly situated, substantially younger individuals more favorably.\n   <em>\n    Fuentes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844547\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/759/#p764\">\n    32 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   764 ;\n   <em>\n    Willis v.

First, he points to three statements by Tacka about the desirability of a \"young and energetic\" or \"young and charismatic\" Director of Choral Activities. However, courts give little weight to stray remarks by non-decisionmakers or by decisionmakers unrelated to the decision process, particularly when the remarks are temporally remote from the challenged decision.\n   <em>\n    Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp; Solis-Cohen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644784\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/509/#p545\">\n    983 F.2d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545 (3d Cir. 1992). Similarly, Tacka's remarks deserve little weight here. First, he is not a decisionmaker with respect to the challenged actions. Although he chaired the Department committee that reviewed Howell's promotion application, the committee included four other faculty members and voted unanimously. Additionally, independent review by Chair Houlahan and the University committee confirmed the Department committee's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Connolly v.

Most fatally to an inference of age discrimination, Tacka accepted correction by other Defendants. Banks and Wiley corrected Tacka at the faculty meeting, stating that it wasn't about the person being young, but rather the person's qualifications, which could include charisma and energy, and Tacka immediately accepted the correction and clarified that he meant to say charismatic. Howell admits that Chair Houlahan corrected Tacka the subsequent two times that he used the word \"young.\" These isolated-and subsequently clarified-comments cannot defeat summary judgment with respect to Tacka. Moreover, Banks's, Wiley's, and Chair Houlahan's refutations of Tacka's remarks weakens any inference that age discrimination motivated their actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Howell presents several other statements allegedly related to age: negative comments by Banks concerning Dr. Toney's age at the time the Department was considering him and her desire to avoid hiring another retrenchee after he left, and Chair Houlahan's remark about an older candidate that \"I am afraid that if we brought her on board, she would be walking around here with an oxygen tank.\" Pl.'s Opp. to Mot.

Howell points only to Dr. Darmiento's declaration to substantiate these statements and offers no explanation of their context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Howell suggests also that Chair Houlahan expressed a desire for an \"energetic\" candidate, and concludes that \"energetic\" \"is code for 'younger.' \" Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. Summ. Judg. at 22. However, he presents no support for this conclusion. Even taken together, and assuming that these comments support an inference of age-related bias on behalf of Defendants, they do not suggest that Defendants' stated reasons for the actions Howell complains about-his lack of qualifications and failure to perform his job duties properly-are pretexts for age discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cellucci v.

Toney's and Darmiento's declarations suggest a generally negative atmosphere in the Department, but do not necessarily link their poor treatment to their age. Howell seems to admit that the negative \"culture\" affects everyone, not just him or older faculty: \"I have also been noticing how the culture of this department affects people-current and former faculty members, current and former students, potential students, students who were formerly music majors, and so forth.\" Defs.' Ex. 62, ECF No. 44-7. Although, if true, Howell's observations reflect a sad state of discord in the Department, they undermine his claims that age discrimination motivated the negative treatment he suffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Neither Toney nor Darmiento was denied a promotion. The only adverse action they suffered in common with Howell was\n   removal from conductor positions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Toney asserts he was removed as the Wind Ensemble conductor, even though as Director of Bands he should have conducted the top wind ensemble.

Darmiento was removed as the director of the Millersville University Chamber Ensemble mid-year and replaced by a younger director. Darmiento Decl. \u00b6 6. Unlike Drs. Toney and Darmiento, Howell was not removed from conducting top ensembles mid-season; rather, he never conducted them at all because the Department found him unqualified. Howell has not refuted the Department's conclusion that he did not possess the qualifications necessary to conduct the top choirs. Although Darmiento was replaced by a younger director, Toney was not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   A single incident of alleged replacement of an older conductor by a younger one hardly establishes a pattern of discrimination by the Department sufficient to carry Howell's burden.

As discussed above, he has not produced evidence other than a handful of isolated statements by Defendants and the conjecture of Drs. Toney and Darmiento\n   that any adverse treatment they suffered was because of their age to support a reasonable inference that the alleged treatment he suffered resulted from age discrimination. As explained above, this evidence does not suffice to prove that age discrimination motivated Howell's promotion denial, demotion, and removal of student teaching supervision. Howell offers additional bases for his hostile work environment claim, such as Chair Houlahan and Tacka's solicitation of negative reviews of Howell, their opposition to Howell's new proposed course on love songs, and Chair Houlahan's disparagement of the Glee Club; however, every single one of these acts is neutral with respect to his age.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jaworski v.

As discussed below, Howell cannot establish that the First Amendment protects the first three categories of speech, and cannot establish a causal link between any of the four categories and the alleged retaliation.

However, the concept of academic freedom in the First Amendment context does not extend as far as he suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The First Amendment does not protect a teacher's in-class conduct because during class, the teacher acts as the educational institution's proxy, and the educational institution, not the individual teacher, has the final say in how to teach students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Additionally, the requirements for written feedback to student teachers reflect a decision as to how best to run a student teaching program, a pedagogical decision left to the educational institution. Although Howell may have other ideas about proper pedagogy, he must follow the policies his institution sets-the First Amendment does not protect his deviations from those policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Defs.' Ex. D12. As explained earlier, these allegations do not implicate a matter of public concern and therefore do not receive First Amendment protection. Therefore, Howell's grievance expressing these complaints does not receive protection either, and Howell's retaliation claim based on his grievance fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Howell cannot prove that his protected activity was a substantial factor in Defendants' alleged retaliatory action and, even if he could, Defendants can prove that they would have taken the same actions even if Howell's speech had not occurred.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Even if the First Amendment did apply to all the speech that Howell claims led to retaliation, his claims fail because he cannot establish that his speech was a substantial factor in the alleged retaliatory actions. And even if he could, Defendants can establish that the same alleged retaliatory actions would have occurred even if Howell's speech had not, which entitles them to summary judgment. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Howell, the record contains ample justification for all the alleged retaliatory actions Howell complains about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   First, Howell depicts his promotion denial as retaliation for his speech. Howell cannot show that his speech motivated Defendants' denial of his promotion application because Howell made most of the speech in question after the University had denied his application. The University-wide committee informed Howell of its decision to deny his application on April 11, 2016, after the Department committee and Chair Houlahan had already made their decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 32. Howell insisted he was the Director of Choral Activities at the Department meeting in May 2016, filed his union grievance in June 2016, and made his posts on social media in 2017. These subsequent acts of speech cannot have motivated the previous determination to deny his promotion application. Additionally, the committee denied Howell's promotion application because it determined that he did not qualify under the \"exceptional\" clause in the promotions guidelines. Howell may believe that the committee applied this standard erroneously, but he provides no evidence to suggest that his speech was a substantial factor in the committee's decision to apply the higher standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Furthermore, the undisputed evidence shows that Defendants would have denied Howell the promotion even if he had not made the speech at issue: Howell's\n   application lacked the required number of student evaluations and adequate documentation of his scholarly activity. The Department committee, Chair Houlahan, and an independent University committee all reached the same conclusion: that Howell did not merit a promotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Second, Howell cannot prove that his speech motivated Defendants' decision not to entrust him with the full duties of Director of Choral Activities. Howell claims he became aware of his \"demotion\" during the May 9, 2016 faculty meeting. This meeting predates his union grievance and his social media posts, so he cannot prove that those complaints motivated Defendants' decision. Additionally, Defendants have met their burden of proving that the Department did not consider Howell the Director of Choral Activities and did not give him all the performance opportunities he desired, not because of any protected speech he made, but because they considered him unqualified and had received complaints about the quality of his ensemble direction. Howell has provided no evidence that Defendants would have allowed him the full duties of Director of Choral Activities, such as directing the auditioned choirs, if he had not engaged in the allegedly protected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Third, Defendants provide undisputed evidence that the two Article 42/43 investigations of Howell have no relation to his speech. The University initiated the first because they received complaints that Howell was providing inadequate supervision to music student teachers, a serious liability to a successful music program. The second focuses, not solely on Howell's Facebook post as he describes it, but on complaints that he behaved unprofessionally and harassed a student in class. The record makes clear that even if Howell had made none of the alleged protected statements, the Article 42/43 investigations still would have occurred, because these reports of Howell's misconduct justified a University inquiry into his professionalism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Fourth, Howell does not dispute Dean Umble's reasons for the interim evaluation: his lack of recent scholarship and service. He contends only that the evaluation imposes a burden on him and allegedly often leads to dismissal, but he proves no link between the decision for the evaluation and his alleged protected conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Lastly, with respect to the \"punitive\" schedule involving large general education classes, Howell was assigned the schedule for the Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 semesters. Thus, his classes were already assigned when he wrote his social media posts in early 2017, and he cannot prove that those posts were a substantial factor in the Defendants' decision to assign him large general education classes. Howell contends that no other faculty member has to teach as many students as he does. Even assuming that this is true, the Defendants have produced evidence that Howell would be teaching these classes anyway: they are the only ones he is qualified for, and professors often have to teach large general education classes or classes with which they have no experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In sum, Howell therefore has failed to carry his burden on his First Amendment claim because he cannot prove that any of his speech was a substantial factor in a retaliatory action. Additionally, Defendants have produced adequate evidence that every one of the allegedly retaliatory actions would have occurred even if Howell had never voiced any criticisms of the Department. Therefore, the Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    E.
