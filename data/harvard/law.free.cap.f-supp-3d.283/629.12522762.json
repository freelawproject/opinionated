Hale, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In January 2017, the Kentucky General Assembly hastily passed the Ultrasound Informed Consent Act, referred to as House Bill 2 (H.B. 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 1-1) Although Kentucky already had a comprehensive informed-consent law pertaining to abortions, Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 311.725, H.B. 2 amended the existing law to require physicians to perform an ultrasound prior to an abortion procedure; display and describe the ultrasound images; and auscultate, or make audible, the fetal heartbeat. Physicians must comply with these requirements even if a woman does not want to receive the information and chooses to avert her eyes and cover her ears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs are the only licensed abortion clinic in Kentucky and its three doctors, who provide abortions and other health services. Defendants are various state government officials. Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of H.B. 2, primarily arguing that the law violates their rights under the First Amendment by compelling ideological speech. The Commonwealth argues that the law is within the Commonwealth's authority to regulate the practice of medicine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Three similar \"speech-and-display\" ultrasound laws have been challenged in states outside the Sixth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit upheld Texas's speech-and-display ultrasound law in\n   <em>\n    Texas Medical Providers Performing Abortion Services v. Lakey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715897\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/570/\">\n    667 F.3d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2012). Within a year of\n   <em>\n    Lakey\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Oklahoma concluded that Oklahoma's speech-and-display ultrasound law was facially unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nova Health Sys. v. Pruitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975933\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/292/28/\">\n    292 P.3d 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Okla. 2012) (per curiam). In\n   <em>\n    Stuart v. Camnitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341416\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/238/\">\n    774 F.3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2014), the Fourth Circuit explicitly disagreed with\n   <em>\n    Lakey\n   </em>\n   , holding that North Carolina's speech-and-display ultrasound law violated the First Amendment. The main reason for these differing outcomes rests on how the various courts interpreted a single paragraph in\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/\">\n    505 U.S. 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finding the Fourth Circuit's reasoning persuasive, the Court concludes that H.B. 2 violates the First Amendment. Like the Fourth Circuit, the Court recognizes that states have substantial interests in protecting fetal life and ensuring the psychological well-being and informed decision-making of pregnant women.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341416\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/238/\">\n    774 F.3d at 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, H.B. 2 does not advance those interests and impermissibly interferes with physicians' First Amendment rights. The Court will therefore enjoin enforcement of H.B. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to H.B. 2, the informed-consent process for abortion in Kentucky was governed by Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 311.725. This statute required that, at least twenty-four hours before an abortion was performed, a woman receiving an abortion must be informed of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 the nature and purpose of the abortion procedure to be performed as well as the medical risks and alternatives to the procedure that a reasonable patient would consider material to the decision of whether or not to undergo the abortion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 the probable gestational age of the fetus;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 the medical risks associated with carrying the pregnancy to term;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 the availability of printed materials published by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services that she has a right to view free of charge if she so chooses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 the potential availability of medical assistance benefits for prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 the liability of the father of the fetus to assist in the support of her child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 311.725(1)(a)-(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Cabinet materials referred to in \u00a7 311.725 contain two general types of information. The first concerns alternatives to abortion, such as adoption. Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 311.725(2)(a). A list of various agencies and the services those agencies offer is provided.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341416\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/238/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These materials also contain information on medical assistance benefits for prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care, as well as information on the father's child-support obligations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341416\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/238/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The second type of information is \"objective and nonjudgmental\" scientific and medical information about fetal development. \u00a7 311.725(2)(b).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 402) He explains that in his practice, he shows patients \"photographs, pamphlets and videos of the proposed gynecologic procedures and the organs that will be involved.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 401) For pregnancy, he states that \"an ultrasound is a necessary means of visualizing the infant in order to make an accurate diagnosis and to plan appropriate management in pregnancy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He describes these steps as the \"proper standard of care.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Notably, the requirements of H.B. 2-auscultating the fetal heartbeat and displaying and describing the ultrasound images against an abortion patient's wishes-are not included in his description of the \"proper standard of care.\" Nevertheless, Dr. Hager opines that the requirements of H.B. 2 are necessary to fully inform patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 405)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This opinion, however, appears to stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of Plaintiffs' practice. Dr. Hager states, \"I understand the Plaintiff physicians to say that, absent HB 2, they would not show an ultrasound to women patients, not tell them what is depicted on the ultrasound, and not make available the unborn child's heartbeat for the expectant mother to hear, should she desire to do so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 404-05) This is an inaccurate summary of Plaintiffs' practice. Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    offer\n   </em>\n   such information to a patient and will provide the information if the patient wants it. (D.N. 55, PageID # 694, 703-04) But absent H.B. 2, Plaintiffs would not force that information on a patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Similar to Dr. Hager, Dr. Seeds opines that H.B. 2 conforms to existing national standards of care. (D.N. 32-1, PageID # 366) But many of his assertions are undermined by the testimony given at the hearing. Critically, Dr. Seeds's opinion never addresses the standard of care for abortion set by the National Abortion Federation (NAF), which is the standard of care followed by the EMW clinic. (D.N. 55, PageID # 704-05, 813) Nor does Dr. Seeds clearly indicate whether he has ever performed elective abortions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 32-1, PageID\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   # 352) Further, his opinion is premised on the assumption that viewing the ultrasound image and listening to the ultrasound description and fetal heartbeat are voluntary for the patient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 349) Dr. Franklin's testimony revealed that it is impossible for a patient to entirely ignore the information being forced upon her. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 55, PageID # 699-700, 722) Additionally, Dr. Seeds states that the mandated disclosures strengthen, rather than impair, the physician-patient relationship. (D.N. 32-1, PageID # 363) However, as mentioned, Dr. Seeds does not perform elective abortions (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 352, 363), and Dr. Franklin's hearing testimony-which is based on firsthand observation of the effects of H.B. 2-directly refutes this assertion. (D.N. 55, PageID # 706-07)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Ultimately, any discrepancy between the hearing testimony and the doctors' declarations is immaterial. The following unrebutted facts were established at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Patient autonomy-the patient's ability to make informed decisions about her own medical care-is at the heart of the informed-consent process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 743-44, 808, 829) The informed-consent process consists of five core elements or types of information that the physician will disclose to the patient: the nature of the procedure, the purpose of the procedure, the potential risks of the procedure, the potential benefits of the procedure, and the major alternatives to the procedure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 688-89, 744-45, 807-09;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.N. 32-1, PageID # 344-46) The information mandated by H.B. 2 falls outside of these core elements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 55, PageID # 744-45) Offering the mandated information is acceptable and consistent with principles of patient autonomy, as it respects the patient's ability to decide whether or not she wants more information beyond the five core elements listed above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 744-45) The American Medical Association has stressed the importance of patient autonomy in the informed-consent process, stating that physicians must \"[p] resent relevant information accurately and sensitively, in keeping with the patient's preference for receiving medical information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 748)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   EMW clinic is accredited by NAF and follows its standard of care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 683) H.B. 2 is inconsistent with that standard. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/#p235\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 704-05, 813) Guidelines written by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also inform the practice of medicine in this field and the informed-consent process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/#p235\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 755-56, 758-59;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.N. 32-1, PageID # 352-53) But Dr. Franklin and Dr. Nichols were unaware of any ACOG guidance that recommends or requires a physician to simultaneously display and describe an ultrasound or auscultate the fetal heartbeat prior to performing an abortion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 55, PageID # 708, 813, 817, 819-20) The witnesses were similarly unaware of any medical procedure for which it is required that a patient view diagnostic images in order to give informed consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 707, 746, 810)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The NAF standard of care requires physicians to perform an ultrasound to date the pregnancy, look for any abnormalities, and determine if a fetal demise has occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 693-94, 705) ACOG guidelines also require that an obstetric ultrasound be performed, for the same reasons. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 32-1, PageID # 355) But it is not the standard of care to force the patient to view the ultrasound or listen to a detailed description of the internal and external organs of the fetus, as well as the fetal heartbeat. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 55, PageID # 705, 708, 813, 817, 819-20) Despite this, physicians at EMW clinic have been complying with H.B. 2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 726) Notably, the testimony at the hearing established that the requirements of H.B. 2 had not dissuaded any women from undergoing an abortion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/#p235\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 726-27, 728-29)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The testimony further revealed that H.B. 2 causes patients distress. Most patients choose to look away from the ultrasound image. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 699) But although they may attempt to avoid listening to the fetal heartbeat and ultrasound description, it is impossible for patients to entirely drown out the sounds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 699-700, 722) During the process mandated by H.B. 2, patients are \"very upset,\" \"crying,\" and even \"sobbing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 699) For victims of sexual assault, the requirements of H.B. 2 \"can be extremely upsetting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 698) Similarly, for patients diagnosed with a fetal anomaly, who have already had several ultrasounds performed and heard detailed descriptions of the fetus, the requirements of H.B. 2 \"can be extremely difficult\" and \"emotional.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 700-01; D.N. 41, PageID # 601-03)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Having established the relevant facts, the Court will now apply intermediate scrutiny.

The General Assembly has not expressly made it the duty of any other official to represent the Commonwealth in actions to enforce penalties under H.B. 2. Beshear cites no authority that expressly designates another official. Therefore, the Court can only infer that the official with the authority to enforce H.B. 2 is the attorney general. Beshear thus appears to be a proper party here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Defendant Rodman, the executive director of the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure, also argues that he is an improper party because he has no enforcement authority under H.B. 2 and no authority to take disciplinary action against a medical licensee. (D.N. 59-1, PageID # 884) Additionally, Rodman argues that Plaintiffs' injuries are purely hypothetical. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   H.B. 2 requires courts to report violations of the law to the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure for disciplinary action. Plaintiffs describe Rodman's position on the Board as a \"gatekeeper\" to the disciplinary process. (D.N. 66, PageID # 1890) When the Board receives a grievance, the executive director assigns that grievance to an inquiry panel composed of Board members. Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 311.591(2). If the panel determines that there has been a violation, the panel issues a complaint. \u00a7 311.591 (3)(d). The executive director then assigns the matter for a hearing. \u00a7 311.591(5). This role is sufficient to name the executive director as a defendant, as he may be enjoined from initiating any inquiries or disciplinary hearings related to violations of H.B. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Further, while it is true that Article III standing requires an injury, causation, and redressability, pre-enforcement review is permitted in some circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.
