(ECF No. 1.) Intervenor Colony Insurance Company (\"Colony\") then filed a complaint in intervention, also seeking a declaratory judgment that Ace has a duty to defend. (ECF No. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After Hallmark filed its first amended complaint, Ace filed a motion for summary judgment against Hallmark and Colony. (ECF No. 24.) Hallmark then filed a cross motion for summary judgment against Ace. (ECF No. 25.) For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that Ace's motion for summary judgment should be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN FULL\n   </strong>\n   and Hallmark's motion\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Underlying State Court Tort Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 19, 2012, Border Patrol Agent James Ray Dominguez was walking along the shoulder of Highway 90 when he was struck by a 1997 white Ford F-350 truck owned and driven by Jorge Luis Flores. Dominguez later died from his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, Dominguez's family (\"the Dominguez Family Plaintiffs\") filed suit in the 83rd District Court of Val Verde, Texas, under the Texas Wrongful Death Act and Texas Survival Statute. The ninth amended petition, the most current petition in the record, named Jorge Luis Flores as a defendant and alleged that he operated his vehicle in a negligent manner, resulting in the wrongful death of Dominguez. (Pl.'s Ninth Am. Original Pet., Cause No. 30315, ECF No. 24-1.) The petition also alleged that Flores was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14.) Thus,\n   the petition named as defendants various entities related to Flores's employment, including: (1) Precision Pipeline, LLC, (2) MasTec North America, Inc., (3) MasTec, Inc., (4) Tekrock Trenching, LLC, (5) Bar None Investments, LLC, and (6) Bar None Equipment (an assumed name of Bar None Investments, LLC) (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the petition, Precision Pipeline, LLC subcontracted with Tekrock Trenching, LLC to build and trench a pipeline called the \"Lone Star Project.\" (Id. at 7.) Precision Pipeline, LLC is a subsidiary of MasTec North America, Inc. and MasTec, Inc. (hereinafter jointly referred to as \"Precision\"). (Pl.'s Eighth Am. Pet., ECF No. 23-1 at 7.) Tekrock Trenching, LLC, in turn, is a subsidiary of Bar None Investments, LLC d/b/a Tekrock Trenching, LLC, which is also the parent company to Defendants Bar None Equipment (an assumed name of Bar None Investments, LLC) and Tekrock, LLC (hereinafter jointly referred to as \"Tekrock\"). (Pl.'s Ninth Am. Pet., ECF No. 24-1 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Essentially, the petition alleged that Precision and Tekrock formed a joint enterprise to build the pipeline, and both had shared control over Flores as an employee, who at the time of the accident was using his vehicle for work purposes pursuant to a lease agreement between Precision and Flores. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-15.) Accordingly, the Dominguez Family Plaintiffs allege that Precision and Tekrock are vicariously liable for the actions of Flores and are also jointly liable for negligently hiring Flores and for failing to properly train and supervise him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The question now is who has a duty to defend Tekrock and Flores in the state court suit. Throughout the state court proceeding, Hallmark has defended Tekrock pursuant to the terms of an insurance policy, Policy Number TXA502320 (the \"Hallmark Policy\"), issued by Hallmark to Tekrock for the period of March 30, 2012, to March 30, 2013. (Pl.'s First Am. Compl., ECF No. 23 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ace, however, insured Precision under Policy Number H08690509 (the \"Ace Policy\") for the policy period of September, 15, 2011, to September 15, 2012, which also covers the date of the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Under the Ace Policy, Ace agreed to \"pay all sums an 'Insured' legally must pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance applies, caused by an 'accident' and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered 'auto.' \" (Sec. II(A), ECF No. 19-3 at 26.) The policy also states that Ace has \"the right and duty to defend any 'Insured' against a 'suit' asking for\" damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under Section 11(A)(1) of the Ace Policy, \"Who Is An Insured,\" an \"insured,\" in pertinent part, is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (a) [The named insured] for any covered \"auto;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (b) Anyone else while using with your permission a covered \"auto\" you own, hire or borrow\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     except:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) The owner or anyone else from whom you hire or borrow a covered \"auto.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) Your \"employee\" if the covered \"auto\" is owned by that \"employee\" or a member of his or her household.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (c) Anyone liable for the conduct of an \"Insured\" described above but only to the extent of that liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (ECF No. 19-3 at 26-27 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At some point, Hallmark made a determination that Tekrock and Flores were \"insureds\" under the Ace Policy and demanded that Ace, rather than Hallmark, defend them in state court as the primary\n   insurer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) When Ace refused, Hallmark, under a reservation of rights, filed the present declaratory judgment action pursuant to \u00a7 2201, which allows a party to seek declaratory relief. In its first amended complaint for a declaratory judgment, Hallmark asks the Court to declare that Ace has a duty to defend Tekrock and Flores in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Hallmark also asks the Court to declare that the Ace Policy is primary to the Hallmark Policy, meaning the Hallmark Policy would only cover liability in excess of the coverage provided in the Ace Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In support of its argument that Ace has a duty to defend, Hallmark asserts that Flores's Ford F-350 is a covered auto under the Ace Policy, since the policy provides liability coverage under a \"Symbol 1\" designation, which renders any auto a covered auto. Although Hallmark does not contend that Flores or Tekrock qualifies as an insured under Section II(A)(1) of the main policy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hallmark argues that Flores qualifies as an insured under Endorsement 35 of the Ace Policy, or Form CA 99 18 03 10, because the state court petition alleges that Flores leased his Ford F-350 to Precision. Endorsement 35 states that for all autos \"hired\" for a period of 180 days or longer,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Any \"auto\" described in the Schedule will be considered a covered \"auto\" you own and not a covered \"auto\" you hire, borrow or lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   B. Changes in Liability Coverage\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   For an \"auto\" designated or described in the Schedule, Who Is An Insured is changed to include as an \"Insured\" the owner or lessor named in the Schedule. However, the owner or lessor is an \"insured\" only for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" resulting from the acts or omission by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1. You;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2. Any of your \"employees\" or agents; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   3. Any person, except the owner or lessor or any \"employee\" or agent of the owner or lessor, operating an \"auto\" with the permission of any of B.1. and/or B.2. above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (ECF No. 19-3 at 109.) Hallmark argues that the allegation of a lease agreement between Flores and Precision is sufficient to trigger insured status for Flores under Endorsement 35. Hallmark then argues that if Flores is an insured under Endorsement 35, Tekrock also is, since (1) the state court petition alleges that Precision and Tekrock are jointly and severally liable in the tort action; and (2) the Ace policy covers anyone liable for Flores's actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Alternatively, Hallmark argues that Endorsement 34, or Form CA 99 33 02 99, applies. Endorsement 34 adds an additional insured under the \"Who Is An Insured\" section of the main policy and states: \"Any 'employee' of yours is an 'insured' while using a covered 'auto' you don't own, hire or borrow in your business or your personal affairs.\" (ECF No. 19-3 at 108.) Hallmark argues that because Flores was an employee using the covered auto at the time of the accident, he qualifies as an insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 13, 2016, Colony filed a complaint in intervention, essentially seeking the same relief as Hallmark. (ECF No. 17.) Colony issued an umbrella policy to Tekrock that attaches after the exhaustion of any primary policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Like Hallmark, Colony now seeks a declaration that Ace has a duty to defend Tekrock and Flores, and that Colony's coverage only\n   applies after all other policies have been exhausted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On October 21, 2016, Ace filed the present motion for summary judgment, seeking judgment in its favor on all claims by Hallmark and Colony. (ECF No. 24.) Ace disputes that its policy requires it to defend Tekrock and/or Flores in the underlying state court suit. According to Ace, Tekrock and Flores are not named insured parties under Ace's insurance policy, neither qualifies as an additional insured under the policy, and neither qualifies as an additional insured under any of the Ace Policy endorsements. Because it owes no duty to defend, Ace argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on all of Hallmark's and Colony's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On November 4, 2016, Hallmark filed a response to the motion and a cross motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 25.) In the motion, Hallmark also contends that judgment in its favor is warranted. Essentially, Hallmark raises one ground for summary judgment-that Endorsement Number 35 makes Flores an insured under the Ace Policy, thus also making Tekrock an insured under the policy. Colony did not respond to Ace's motion for summary judgment or file its own motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Endorsement 34\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Endorsement 34 states, \"Any 'employee' of yours is an 'insured' while using a covered 'auto' you don't own, hire or borrow in your business or your personal affairs.\" (ECF No. 19-3 at 108.) Based on its arguments in its motion for summary judgment, Hallmark appears to have now abandoned the argument that Endorsement 34 applies. The Court also finds that it would not apply. It is undisputed that Flores was driving the Ford F-350 at the time of the accident and was acting in the course and scope of his employment. However, it is also undisputed that the Ford F-350 was a covered auto that Precision hired and did not own. Both the ninth amended petition and the rental agreement establish that Flores was driving a hired vehicle at the time of the accident, since it was rented/leased to Precision by Flores. Accordingly, Endorsement 34 does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Endorsement 35\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Endorsement 35 presents a more complicated case. Endorsement 35 essentially reclassifies a covered auto that is \"hired, borrowed, or leased\" for 180 days or more to one that is \"owned\" by Precision. It also expands the definition of an \"insured\" under the Ace Policy to include the owner or lessor of the covered auto, but only for bodily injury or property damages resulting from the acts or omission by (1) Precision, (2) Precision's employees or agents, or (3) any person operating the auto with the permission of Precision or its employees or agents, except the owner or lessor or any employee or agent of the owner or lessor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In support of coverage under Endorsement 35, Hallmark argues that the Court should look solely to the factual allegations of the ninth amended petition to determine Ace's duty to defend. The pertinent allegations state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant Precision maintained a formal, written lease compensation agreement with Defendant Flores for the use/rental of his vehicle on the date in question... Defendants Precision and Tekrock expressly leased and authorized Jorge Luis Flores to use his own vehicle in the performance of his work and the use of said vehicle is within the scope of Precision's and Tekrock's business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Pl.'s Ninth Am. Original Pet., ECF No. 24-1 at 8.) Although the petition does not indicate the duration of the lease, Hallmark argues that the petition should be construed in its favor since the wording of the petition indicates that the lease\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   could have been for 180 days or more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Ace, however, argues that the allegations in the petition are too vague to establish that the lease was for 180 days or longer. Ace also argues that it should be able to rely on the actual lease agreement, which is a day-by-day rental policy signed just 35 days before the date of the accident. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33-1 at 4.) In support, Ace argues that under Texas law, when the scope of coverage is determined \"from the language employed in the insurance policy, and if the policy directs us elsewhere, [a court] will refer to an incorporated document to the extent required by the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Deepwater Horizon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841869\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/470/452/#p460\">\n    470 S.W.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460 (Tex. 2015). Alternatively, Ace argues that the Court should apply the exception to the eight-corners rule and look at the actual lease agreement, since it\n   does not touch on the merits of the underlying third-party claims and can easily resolve a fundamental policy coverage question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Hallmark, in turn, objects to the admissibility of the rental agreement on grounds that it is not properly authenticated and contains inadmissible hearsay. Hallmark further argues that there is no recognized exception to the eight-corners rule, and thus the Court should not consider any extrinsic evidence. Finally, Hallmark argues that the lease agreement, even if considered, still fails to establish the length of the term of the agreement and should be construed in favor of coverage of the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court agrees with Ace that the allegations in the petition are too vague to support an inference that the lease was for 180 days or more. According to the Fifth Circuit, when allegations in the underlying petition \"lend themselves to multiple reasonable inferences, we cannot determine, based solely on the pleadings, whether there is a potentially covered claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Star-Tex Resources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=553%20Fed.%20Appx.%20366\">\n    553 Fed.Appx. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   370 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ooida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4053985\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/469/#p476\">\n    579 F.3d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the underlying complaint did not establish a person's role at the time of an accident, therefore requiring consideration of extrinsic evidence). Although an inference that the lease was for 180 days or more is reasonable, it is not the only reasonable inference, since it is just as likely that the lease was for a shorter term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Since the petition is ambiguous, the only way Hallmark can establish coverage under the Ace Policy would be to rely on extrinsic evidence. Although Hallmark argues that doing so is improper, the Court finds that extrinsic evidence should be considered, for two reasons. First,\n   <em>\n    Freeport Welding\n   </em>\n   instructs that\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   a court follows the eight-corners rule, it must determine whether the party alleging coverage qualifies as an additional insured under the policy.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632135\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/832/#p839\">\n    699 F.3d at 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Freeport Welding\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit looked to a purchase agreement in making the initial coverage determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, it is acceptable for the Court to first look at extrinsic evidence for purposes of determining Flores's and Tekrock's status as insureds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, extrinsic evidence is also permitted under the eight-corners rule. Although the Texas Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on the issue, this court is bound by Fifth Circuit case law-which now recognizes the exception-until the Texas Supreme Court declares otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Star-Tex Resources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=553%20Fed.%20Appx.%20366\">\n    553 Fed.Appx. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   370 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ooida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4053985\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/469/#p476\">\n    579 F.3d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, consideration of extrinsic evidence is proper only \"when relevant to an independent and discrete coverage issue, not touching on the merits of the underlying third-party claim.\"\n   <em>\n    GuideOne Elite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409136\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/305/#p308\">\n    197 S.W.3d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The lease rental agreement, which unquestionably meets this requirement, would thus be admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The rental agreement, signed and dated June 15, 2012, indicates that Precision will pay Flores a daily rate of $83 for the use of Flores's Ford F-350 when it is used while working on the pipeline project. (ECF No. 33-1 at 4.) It was executed just 35 days before the date of the accident involving Dominguez. The rental agreement was properly authenticated as a business record under Federal Rules of Evidence 803(6) and 902(11), and is therefore admissible summary judgment evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kirkman Decl., ECF No. 33-1 at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court finds that the rental agreement does not establish that the\n   Ford F-350 was \"hired for a period of 180 days or longer.\" (ECF No. 19-3 at 109.) In interpreting the rental agreement and the phrase \"hired for a period of 180 days or longer,\" the Court must apply basic contractual rules.\n   <em>\n    Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins.

First, it could mean that the lease must have lasted at least 180 days. Alternatively, it could mean that the lease/rental contract itself must be for 180 days or more. Either way though, neither Flores or Teckrock would qualify as an insured. First, the rental agreement was signed just 35 days before the accident. Thus, the actual lease term fell far short of 180 days. Second, based on the clear language of the rental agreement itself, the contractual lease period was not for 180 days or more. The contract period was for one work day and was renewable on a daily basis. Unquestionably the overall contract period feasibly could have lasted a\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   of more than 180 cumulative days, since there is no clear end date. But the Court, in applying contract rules, must \"ascertain the true intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013321\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/907/517/#p520\">\n    907 S.W.2d at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is simply no evidence of the intent of the parties to form a binding agreement lasting at least 180 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because there was no intent, the rental agreement fails to trigger insured status for Flores, and thus Tekrock, under Endorsement 35.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that Ace is entitled to summary judgment. Neither Flores nor Tekrock is a named insured under Ace's insurance policy, neither qualifies as an additional insured under the policy, and neither qualifies as an additional insured under any of the Ace Policy endorsements. Because Ace has no duty to defend Flores or Tekrock in the underlying state court action, Hallmark and Colony are not entitled to a declaratory judgment. It is therefore\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Ace's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN FULL,\n   </strong>\n   and Hallmark's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Judgment shall be entered in favor of Ace, and the claims against it by both Hallmark and Colony\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   . It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that a\n   clerk's judgment shall be entered immediately, terminating the present cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    It is alleged in the ninth amended petition and it is undisputed that Flores is the owner of the covered auto. Thus, Flores would be excluded under provision (b)(1), as would Tekrock under provision (c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Such is in line with\n    <em>\n     In Re Deepwater Horizon\n    </em>\n    , which also found that a court may look outside the eight corners of the policy and the petition, when a policy refers the court elsewhere to determine coverage.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841869\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/470/452/#p460\">\n     470 S.W.3d at 460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Even if the Court were to construe the contract to be one for an indefinite period of time, Texas courts have ruled that contracts of that type are unambiguous and terminable at will, meaning that either Flores or Precision could have terminated the contract at any time.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Providence Land Servs., LLC v.
