For the reasons set forth below, the Extradition Request is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Respondent is\n   <strong>\n    CERTIFIED\n   </strong>\n   as extraditable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABLE LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A request by Mexico to extradite an individual from the United States to that foreign country is governed by the provisions of the federal extradition statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203181\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 3196, and the Extradition Treaty Between the United States of America and the United Mexican States dated May 4, 1978, 31 U.S.T. 5059, TIAS 9656 (\"Extradition Treaty\"). The extradition process is initiated by Complaint for Arrest for the purposes of Extradition filed by the United States of America (\"United States\" or \"Government\"), and an arrest warrant.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203184\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pursuant to the Extradition Treaty, the diplomatic note and the other supporting documentation were bates labeled with pages 1-651 and timely produced to the Respondent on May 24, 2017. [Doc. No. 25 at 1.]\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Extradition of Figueroa\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 12-M-269,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203243096\">\n    2013 WL 3243096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Ill. June 26, 2013). Article 10 of the Extradition Treaty requires the formal extradition request to include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   a) A statement of the facts of the case;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   b) The text of the legal provisions describing the essential elements of the offense;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   c) The text of the legal provisions describing the punishment for the offense;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   d) The text of the legal provisions relating to the time limit on the prosecution or the execution of the punishment of the offense;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   e) The facts and personal information of the person sought which will permit his identification and, where possible, information concerning his location.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [Doc. No. 25-1, 26]. In addition, when the extradition request relates to an individual who has not yet been convicted of a crime, it must also include (1) a certified copy of the warrant of arrest issued by a judge or other judicial officer of the requesting Party; and (2) evidence which, in accordance with the laws of the requested Party, would justify the apprehension and commitment for trial of the person sought if the offense had been committed there. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3]. According to the Extradition Treaty, the documents from Mexico must be presented in English, the language of the United States. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The next phase of the extradition process is the extradition hearing, which is conducted by the federal court to consider the evidence presented by Mexico through the United States. The extradition hearing is not a criminal trial, and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not apply. Fed. R. Crim. P. 1. Rather, the purpose of such hearing is to determine whether there is competent evidence to justify holding the individual to await trial, and not to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to justify a conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peters v. Egnor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533491\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/888/713/#p717\">\n    888 F.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717 (10th Cir. 1989). Specifically, under the federal extradition statute, this court hears evidence and determines whether the evidence presented is sufficient to support a finding of probable cause that the person charged committed the extraditable offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203184\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Extradition of Vargas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174847\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/978/734/#p739\">\n    978 F.Supp.2d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (S.D. Tex. 2013). The court is not authorized under the Extradition Treaty to make a finding of guilt or innocence, and therefore, the Government is not required to present evidence sufficient to convict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Several principles guide this court's inquiry at the extradition hearing. First, extradition treaties, unlike criminal statutes, are generally construed liberally in favor of enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Factor v. Laubenheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3922840\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/290/276/#p293\">\n    290 U.S. 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293-94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3922840\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/290/276/#p293\">\n    54 S.Ct. 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3922840\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/290/276/#p293\">\n    78 L.Ed. 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1933) (\"In choosing between conflicting interpretations of a treaty obligation, a narrow and restricted construction is to be avoided as not consonant with the principles deemed controlling in the interpretation of international\n   agreements. Considerations which should govern the diplomatic relations between nations, and the good faith of treaties, as well, require that their obligations should be liberally construed so as to effect the apparent intention of the parties to secure equality and reciprocity between them.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Next, under the rule of non-inquiry, the court refrains from investigating the fairness of Mexico's justice system, and from inquiring into the procedures or treatment which await Respondent if he is returned to Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7645837\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/82/964/#p965\">\n    82 F.3d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 965 (10th Cir. 1996) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Extradition of Chan Seong-I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189912\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/346/1149/#p1157\">\n    346 F.Supp.2d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157 (D.N.M. 2004). Under the general rule of non-contradiction, Respondent has no right to pose questions of credibility regarding Mexico's witnesses, but only to explain away or completely rebut probable cause for the purpose of the extradition hearing.\n   <em>\n    In re Extradition Vargas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174847\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/978/734/#p739\">\n    978 F.Supp.2d at 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not control the admissibility of evidence in an extradition hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 1101(d). Instead, under federal extradition law, the admissibility of evidence is controlled by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203190\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Extradition Treaty.

Article 10(6)(b) of the Extradition Treaty provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In the case of a request emanating from the United Mexican States, they are certified by the principle [sic] diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in Mexico.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [Doc. No. 25-1, 27 at \u00b6 6(b) ]. Once the papers are certified by the diplomatic officer, they are considered properly authenticated and admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

Neither federal criminal law, nor state criminal law, has any import on the admissibility of documents for the purpose of proving probable cause in an extradition hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escobedo\n   </em>\n   , 623 F.2d at 1103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   If a court determines that there is probable cause to support the underlying charge, the decision to extradite is left to the discretion of the Secretary of State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203186\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, it is the Secretary of State, not this court, who considers whether an extradition request should be denied due to humanitarian concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Extradition Mathison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231667\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/974/1296/#p1315\">\n    974 F.Supp.2d 1296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1315 (D. Or. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Against this legal background, this court now turns to the request to extradite Gabriel Rodriguez Caro a/k/a \"El Guero\" to Mexico for the aggravated kidnapping of Marlene Paola Ramos Ortega on August 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to the warrant of arrest the following are the facts of the case:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 5, 2014, Patricia Ortega Amparan and Ramiro Ramos Peregrino initiated a complaint regarding their daughter, Ramos Ortega, with whom they had last been in contact on August 1, 2014. Ortega Amparan and Ramos Peregrino advised that at about 7:23 a.m. on August 2, 2014, they received a text message that read, \"we have kidnapped your daughter pay up or we will kill her do not talk to the police or we will kill her.\" At 12:09 p.m. the same day, they received a telephone call in which the kidnappers requested 350,000 Mexican pesos for the ransom of Ramos Ortega.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to Ortega Amparan and Ramos Peregrino, ransom negotiations continued until August 4, 2014, when the kidnappers agreed to accept 62,550 Mexican pesos for the ransom of Ramos Ortega. The kidnappers instructed Ortega Amparan and Ramos Peregrino to put the money, along with cell phones, jewels, and laptops, inside a bag, go to a specified location, and then call the kidnappers in order to agree on a subsequent location to deliver the ransom. At the same time, the kidnappers said they would hand over Ramos Ortega. Ramos Peregrino arrived at the location at approximately 11:00 p.m., dialed the kidnappers cell phone, and did as instructed. Approximately 25 minutes after hanging up with the kidnappers, Ramos Peregrino received a telephone call from the police telling him that they had apprehended Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes, who had picked up the bag containing the ransom money, and informed her parents that Ramos Ortega had been murdered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 9, 2014, after having been a fugitive for a period of time, Ivan Gonzalez Rodriguez (a/k/a el negro), a confessed member of the group who kidnapped and killed Ramos Ortega, provided a confession to the Public Prosecutor from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Chihuahua. In his confession, Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez stated that on August 1, 2014, he and Rodr\u00edguez Caro decided to kidnap Ramos Ortega. In accordance with the plan, Rodr\u00edguez Caro called Ramos Ortega and asked her to accompany him to collect money he was owed. Ramos Ortega agreed to meet Rodr\u00edguez Caro at an agreed location at 4:30 p.m. on that date. Rodr\u00edguez Caro and Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez went to the location, and ultimate victim Ramos Ortega picked them up in her car. The group then picked up Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes and went to a residence under the pretense that they were going to talk. Once at the residence, Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes struck Ramos Ortega in the head with a bottle, and Rodr\u00edguez Caro and Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez tied her feet, arms, and head with tape. Rodr\u00edguez Caro also took Ramos Ortega's wallet and cellular telephone. Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez further stated that on August 2, 2014, Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes called Ramos Ortega's parents to demand ransom for their daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes and Rodr\u00edguez Caro engaged in additional ransom negotiations with the victim's parents. On August 3, 2014, Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez, Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes, and Rodr\u00edguez Caro killed Ramos Ortega by placing plastic bags over her face and strangling her with cables. According to Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez, on August 4, 2014, Ramos Ortega's parents requested proof that Ramos Ortega was alive. Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez, Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes, and Rodr\u00edguez Caro took two photographs of Ramos Ortega and Rodr\u00edguez Caro sent them to Ramos Ortega's parents to convince them that their daughter was alive. Ramos Ortega's parents agreed to deliver the ransom money. Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes, accompanied by\n   his two sisters, Jennifer Reyes Reyes and Itzel Reyes Reyes, went to the agreed location to pick up the ransom. Rodr\u00edguez Caro and Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez remained hidden. Rodriguez Caro and Gonz\u00e1lez Rodriguez fled the scene when Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After his arrest at the scene of the ransom drop, on August 6, 2014, Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes provided a sworn statement to the Public Prosecutor. Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes advised that on August 1, 2014, Rodr\u00edguez Caro asked him for assistance in picking up a bag with money from a ransom for a girl (Ramos Ortega). According to Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes, Ramos Ortega was held captive at a residence with her hands, feet, eyes, and mouth bound by tape. Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes stated that Ramos Ortega was killed because she knew both Rodr\u00edguez Caro and Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez because they were her neighbors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   According to Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes, on August 4, 2014, Rodr\u00edguez Caro instructed Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes to pick up the bag with the ransom money. Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes asked his sisters, Jennifer Reyes Reyes and Itzel Arely Reyes Reyes, to accompany him. When they arrived at the location to pick up the ransom, Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes was arrested by Chihuahua State police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 3, 2015, Jennifer Reyes Reyes and Itzel Arely Reyes Reyes performed identification proceedings in which they identified a photograph of Gabriel Rodr\u00edguez Caro as the individual they knew as a friend of their brother, Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes, and who participated in the kidnapping of Ramos Ortega.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     EXTRADITION REQUEST\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Several motions were filed by Respondent, including a Motion to Vacate Warrant and Dismiss Complaint [Doc.

Specifically, the witness statements establish probable cause to believe Respondent, who is identified in multiple photo lineups [Doc. No. 25-4, 62 thru 69], on August 1, 2014, kidnapped Marlene Paola Ramos Ortega and thereafter demanded a 350,000 pesos ransom from Ramiro Ramos Peregrino and Marlene Paola Ramos Ortega, her parents. On August 4, 2014, after negotiations, the parents paid 62,550 pesos in ransom by placing the money in a suitcase and following the kidnapper's instructions. [Doc. No. 25-2, 46-47.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The suitcase containing the ransom money was picked up by Mr. Rodriguez Caro's conspirator, Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes (\"Marcos\"). Marcos was arrested after picking up the suitcase and he told the police that Gabriel Rodriguez Caro, who Reyes Reyes also identified by the moniker \"El Guero\", and Ivan Gonzalez Rodriguez, the third conspirator who was also known as \"El Negro,\" offered him 1,000 pesos to perform that act. [Doc. No. 25-4, 44-47.] Marcos also told the police that he had seen a girl who was blindfolded with her hands feet and mouth tied up in the house of \"el negro.\" He also heard\n   that they had killed the girl by suffocating her because she was their friend and neighbor and, if she had lived, she could have told the police who had kidnapped her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Ivan Gonzalez Rodriguez was also arrested after being a fugitive for several months and he provided a statement implicating Gabriel Rodriguez Caro and Marcos Humberto Reyes Reyes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-57.) The statement detailed that Gabriel Rodriguez Caro devised a plan to kidnap the victim. Rodriguez Caro first enticed the victim to go with them by asking her to drive and help him pick up some money. The victim said she would go and she picked up Rodriguez Caro and El Negro. They drove to El Negro's residence, where Rodriguez Caro left the victim's car. At some point while the three males were inside the house together Gabriel and Marcos confided that they wanted to kidnap the victim and get ransom for her return. They all agreed that Marcus would hit Marlene over the head with a bottle, which he did. After Marlene was hit, the three of them dragged her into the house and tied her down. Rodriguez Caro taped her face and took her wallet and phone. The three kept her tied up at El Negro's house while they all made multiple telephone calls with the victim's family members. During this time period, the three males, including Rodriguez Caro drank beer and drove around in a borrowed car and at one point Rodriguez Caro was reported to have actually left to go to a concert. At another point, El Negro stated that he left to go pick up his mother while Marcos stayed with the victim. After El Negro came back he and Marcos continued to monitor the victim and reported to Rodriguez Caro that the victim did not look good and complained of pain and of being cold. The two waited for Rodriguez Caro and when he did not show up after several hours, El Negro and Marcus killed the victim by strangling her with a set of stereo cables. According to El Negro, the victim fought with them until she died. Then, according to El Negro, the two left the victim dead in the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Once outside the house, Marcos told his sisters, Itzel and Jennifer, aged 16 and 11 years old, respectively, that he had killed a girl who was a friend of theirs. About an hour after the killing, El Negro reported that Rodriguez Caro returned to the scene. The three worked together to fake some pictures of the dead victim so her family would think she was still alive, then made more calls to the victim's family for money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   El Negro also admitted that when the victim's father showed up with the money for the ransom and left the suitcase and the police caught Marcos picking up the money, Rodriguez Caro and El Negro fled the scene.
