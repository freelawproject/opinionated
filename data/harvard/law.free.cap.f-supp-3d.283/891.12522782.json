The City, alleging hazardous material within the refuse contaminates underground water today, sues for costs related to this ongoing contamination. The United States now moves to dismiss the City's Federal Tort Claims Act claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which the City opposes. For the reasons discussed below, the court GRANTS the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although the court finds below the dispositive issue is not intertwined with the merits, the recitation of facts here implicates substantive issues for which the court need not resolve factual disputes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Autery v.

Defs.' Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"SUF\") 1-4, ECF No. 22-2. From in or about 1961 to 1966, the Dump operated five days per week and received mixed refuse from local businesses and approximately 1,200 residences. SUF 11, 16-18. The Dump reduced its operations starting in 1971, ceased operations in 1976 and was enclosed with a low permeability cover in 1993. SUF 22-23, 25, 32;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Disputed Facts (\"SDF\") 91, ECF No. 25-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Launch Facility's Pre-Operational Period\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 1960, the Army Corps of Engineers contracted with Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons Co. (\"Kiewit\") to construct three Titan I Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (\"ICBM\") launch facilities near Beale Air Force Base and in the cities of Lincoln, Sutter and Chico. SUF 38; Defs.' Ex. 12 (CEBMCO Historical Summary) at 13, 17, 19, ECF No. 22-15. Around this time, the United States acquired the property on which it would locate the Lincoln facility (hereinafter, \"the Facility\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF 3; Pl.'s Ex. 7, ECF No. 25-13 (finding Air Force acquired 274.99 acres for facility in 1958); Pl.'s Ex. 3, ECF No. 25-9 (final judgment awarding United States ownership of property in April 1960).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Kiewit subcontracted much of the construction to other companies, including Superior Electric Construction Co., Inc. (\"Superior\"), which installed electrical systems. SUF 41, 43. After completing construction in early 1962, Kiewit transferred possession and control of the facilities to Martin Company (\"Martin\"), which was then responsible for activating the launch facilities before delivering them to the Air Force. SUF 39, 45, 46; CEBMCO Historical Summary at 19, 34. On September 20, 1962, the Air Force accepted and took over the missile launch facilities from Martin. SUF 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties agree Superior disposed of refuse at the Lincoln City Dump, SUF 52, but dispute whether any other contractor also disposed of refuse at the Dump during this pre-operational period from January 1960 to September 1962.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The parties also dispute whether defendants' employees, including Army Corps of Engineer's Resident Office employees, Lincoln facility site inspectors and other Air Force personnel, disposed of refuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Launch Facility's Operational Period and Phase-Out\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Once the Air Force took over the Facility in September 1962, the Air Force issued a plan for the Facility's routine daily maintenance. SUF 59; Defs.' Ex. 23 (Maintenance Plan), ECF No. 22-26. The Maintenance Plan gave Base Deputy Commander for Civil Engineering (\"Base Deputy\") responsibility for collecting and disposing of refuse from the Facility. SUF 61; Maintenance Plan at 42 \u00b6 2(i). The Plan also established guidelines for collecting and disposing refuse. Maintenance Plan at 57 (Refuse Collection and Disposal Plan) \u00b6\u00b6 (a)-(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Starting in September 1962, the City began collecting thirty-three-gallon cans of refuse from the Facility three times per week. SUF 65-67. The parties dispute the contents of this refuse and whether the contents were hazardous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUF 70-71; SDF 105-07; Pl.'s Objs. 2-4; Pasilla Dep. at 150:21-23. The City continued to collect the facility's refuse until at least January 1965, when the Air Force began deactivating the missiles and shutting down the Facility. SUF 73-76. As part of that process, Beale Air Force Base took over the Facility in Spring 1965, the Department of Defense sold the Facility's equipment and materials to the Hudson Company (\"Hudson\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   in February 1966, and the United States transferred the property to Placer County in August 1968.

SUF 31; Defs.' Ex. 11 (RWQCB Order No. R5-2003-0142) at 1 \u00b6 4, ECF No. 22-14. The revised order required the City to maintain five feet of separation between groundwater and the bottom of the landfill, and to define how much of the groundwater contained total dissolved solids (\"TDS\") and volatile organic compounds (\"VOC\"). SUF 34. In 2013, the RWQCB found the City had violated the revised order, that release from the Dump affected nearby groundwater quality, and that the City Dump failed to ensure the required five foot separation. SUF 35; Defs.' Ex. 5 (RWQCB Order R5-2014-0703) at 2-4, ECF No. 22-8. The RWQCB required the City to develop a Corrective Action Plan (\"CAP\") to maintain the minimum five foot separation, remediate groundwater impacts and maintain the landfill cover. SUF 37; RWQCB Order R5-2014-0703 at 7 \u00b6\u00b6 31-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 26, 2016, the City sued the United States, the United States Air Force and the United States General Services Administration for (1) Continuing Nuisance; (2) Continuing Trespass; (3) Equitable Indemnity / Contribution; (4) Cost Recovery under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (5) Contribution under CERCLA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (6) Declaratory Relief.

In\n   <em>\n    Green v.

As these cases demonstrate, a court's inquiry does not focus on whether the United States has discretion to trespass, but instead on whether the United States has discretion to engage in behavior that may cause a trespass, such as the decision to apply DDT or the decision to select a location for a consulate's office.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214708\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/404/#p410\">\n    329 F.Supp.2d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting argument that United States Marshals Service, in providing protective services for a federal judge, never had discretion to trespass on plaintiffs' property).

Looking at specific sections of AFM 85-14, as well as Air Force Manual 88-11 (entitled \"Sewage, Refuse and Industrial Waste\") (1956), the court found both manuals similarly emphasized principles rather than practices, and did not prescribe specific and mandatory waste water disposal methods or treatment procedures.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11817893\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/819/\">\n    146 F.3d at 824-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   may be disregarded as unpersuasive in light of intervening Supreme Court precedent. In sum, the only two persuasive decisions to analyze applicable Air Force\n   manuals have found no mandatory duties with respect to the disposal of hazardous waste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With these cases in mind, the court turns to the two manuals on which the City relies: AFM 85-11 (hereinafter, \"the Refuse Manual\") and AFM 85-14 (\"the Industrial Waste Manual\"). As did the Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Aragon\n   </em>\n   , the court here doubts each manual's legal force.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11817893\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/819/\">\n    146 F.3d at 824-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, the Refuse Manual's opening section declares its purpose is to \"provide commanders of major and subordinate commands with information\" and \"is intended for the guidance\" of relevant personnel. AFM 85-11 at 3;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11817893\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/819/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 A1.01. Describing its content, this manual provides \"information on all practicable methods, procedures, and equipment applications to provide a basis for selecting a system of refuse collection and disposal to meet local Air Force requirements.\" AFM 85-11 at 3. In other words, the Refuse Manual guides and informs defendants on how best to do something, but does not necessarily require them to do something in a certain way. As the Tenth Circuit found in evaluating the Industrial Waste Manual, the language of the manual itself weighs heavily against finding it imposes any mandatory duty.\n   <em>\n    Aragon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11817893\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/819/\">\n    146 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   824-25 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AFM 85-14, \u00a7 E1.01 (\"Because of the varied nature of industrial problems, principles rather than practices are emphasized.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even if the manuals could be binding in a general sense, the City has not shown how they created a mandatory duty here. The City argues, citing the definitions of \"refuse\" in the Refuse Manual and \"liquid industrial waste\" in the Industrial Waste Manual, that defendants had a mandatory duty to segregate the two waste types. Opp'n at 21-22. But these provisions indicate only that different manuals govern different waste types, not that the Air Force was without discretion in deciding how to treat them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AFM 85-11 \u00a7 A1.03(a) (\"Refuse\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; AFM 85-14, \u00a7 E1.04 (\"Types of Industrial Waste\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   . That the Industrial Waste Manual lists several types of industrial waste as a \"primary concern\" does not dictate how they should be treated. AFM 85-14, \u00a7 E1.04(a)-(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The City also asks the court to draw a negative inference from omissions in the Base's Maintenance Plan. Because the Maintenance Plan references only a portion of AFM 85-11\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the City argues, any discretionary authority the Air Force manuals\n   otherwise confer must not be incorporated into the Facility's Maintenance Plan. The City's position is perplexing given its other arguments that the Air Force manuals generally apply. The manuals themselves defeat the City's argument, as the manuals apply \"to all Air Force activities\" over which the Air Force has real property maintenance responsibility, including the missile facilities here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AFM 85-11 at 3; AFM 85-14 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, the City argues for another negative inference, citing the Refuse Manual's definition of \"Salvage or Salable Materials,\" AFM 85-11, \u00a7 A1.03(b); because these items \"should be segregated from other refuse,\" the City says defendants lacked discretion to segregate any other type of waste not mentioned. Even if such a logical leap were warranted, and it is not, the City's argument is essentially that the Air Force was required to dispose of the hazardous waste it complains of, but the United States cannot be liable for complying with a regulatory mandate.\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The City asserts mandatory duties it says it has recently discovered. It acknowledges these duties fall outside of the complaint. Opp'n at 24:18-20 (explaining the City will seek leave to amend\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the complaint to allege the violations of these duties). The court is not restricted to the face of the pleadings,\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792557\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/558/#p560\">\n    850 F.2d at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but nonetheless finds the City's new allegations would not establish a mandatory duty. First, the City argues defendants were limited to using one of five types of approved disposal facilities, and the Lincoln Dump did not qualify. Opp'n at 25. In a sub-section entitled \"Classification of Refuse Disposal Methods,\" the Refuse Manual does list five types of approved refuse disposal facilities. AFM 85-11, \u00a7 D1.04(b)(1)-(5) (listing sanitary fill, incineration, pit burning, burn-and-cover and regulated dumping). But the Manual does not expressly limit defendants to these five types of disposal facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792557\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/558/#p560\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even if it did, the parties agree the Dump may fit at least one category, \"pit burning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792557\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/558/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 D1.04(b)(3);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SDF 115. The Refuse Manual in turn provides non-mandatory language regarding the design of burning pits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792557\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/558/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 C3.02(a) (\"Masonry burning pits should be designed to meet installation requirements by a responsible engineer.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792557\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/558/#p560\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 C3.02(b) (\"The design of earthen burning pits depends on the terrain and the quantity of refuse to be burned.\"). The Refuse Manual does not provide a specific, mandatory duty regarding the use of disposal facilities. Second, the City argues defendants were subject to a mandatory duty to protect groundwater. Opp'n at 25-26. To the extent the City alleges a mandatory duty to consider the possible effects the siting and operation of dumps and burn pits has on groundwater, this argument is untenable after\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Berkovitz\n   </em>\n   , as discussed above. To the extent the City's argument relies instead on state law, SDF 134, it has pointed to no specific state law limiting defendants' actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, the City has provided no basis to conclude the United States was subject to any applicable, specific and mandatory course of conduct regarding its disposal of hazardous waste, either during the facility's pre-operational or operational phases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Policy Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Having found no mandatory duty, the court next determines whether defendants' actions involving the disposal of hazardous\n   waste were of the type Congress meant to protect, \"i.e., whether the action involves a decision susceptible to social, economic, or political policy analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Whisnant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176331\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/400/1177/#p1180\">\n    400 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1180-81 (citing\n   <em>\n    O'Toole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7350168,9413795\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/1029/\">\n    295 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1033-34 ).
