(ECF 10 (Complaint)). As relevant to the pending Motion to Remand, Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges the following: The individual Plaintiffs are all extended members of the Boenker family, and are owners of the Boenker family farm, which lies directly adjacent to the Westlake Landfill and the Bridgton Landfill (jointly, the Landfills); Defendant Republic Systems, Inc., is and has been responsible for operating the Landfills; Defendant Bridgeton Landfill, LLC, owns the Landfills; in 1988, Defendant Westlake Landfill, Inc., changed its name to Laidlaw Waste Systems, Inc., and, in 1998, merged into Defendant Bridgeton Landfill, LLC; Defendant Allied Services,\n   LLC, is the sole member of Defendant Bridgeton Landfill, LLC, and oversees the operation and management of the Landfills; Defendant Rock Road Industries, Inc., owns and/or owned the West Lake Landfill; Defendants Jared Romaine and David Vasbinder worked at the Bridgeton Landfill; and Plaintiffs are all citizens of Missouri and at least one Defendant is a citizen of Missouri. (ECF 10, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 31-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that \"Defendants own[ed] and operat[ed] [the Landfills] which accepted radioactive waste without a license to do so\"; that the \"radioactive waste [ ] spread to the Boenker family farm causing personal injury, property damage, and the need for medical monitoring\"; and that \"Defendants have also so mismanaged the Landfills that an underground fire now burns out of control and threatens the nuclear waste.\" (ECF 10, \u00b6 1). Further, in their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that 40,000 tons of radioactive waste was accepted by the Landfills in 1973; that the radioactive waste came from Cotter Corporation's Latty Avenue site; that Cotter was a \"known possessor of radioactive material at the time\"; and that neither the Landfills' owner nor operator sought a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) prior to accepting and receiving the radioactive material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have previously declared to this court that the Price Anderson Act (PAA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , does not apply to them because the Landfills were not licensed to accept or receive radioactive materials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs contend that, because Defendants \"were not licensed to accept or receive radioactive materials and have not entered an indemnification agreement concerning their acceptance of radioactive materials,\" the PAA does not apply to Plaintiffs' claims, Plaintiffs' claims \"are not public liability actions\" under the PAA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202210\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Plaintiffs, therefore, may proceed in State court. (ECF 10, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 43-47). Plaintiffs seek a judgment against Defendants for compensatory and punitive damages caused by Defendants' alleged \"intentional, reckless, and/or negligent conduct in owning, operating, and/or managing the [L]andfills.\" They also seek \"Medical Monitoring.\" (ECF 10, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 111-113).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As further relevant to Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand, Defendants have submitted a copy of a Source Material License (the License or 1969 Source Material License) for uranium, issued to Cotter by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), on December 3, 1969. The License states that the \"[a]uthorized place of use\" was Cotter's facility located at 9200 Latty Avenue, Hazelwood, Missouri; that the \"[m]aximum quantity of source material which [Cotter] [could] possess at any one time under [the] license [was] unlimited\"; and that the License was to expire on December 31, 1974. (ECF 32.1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The License authorized Cotter\n   \"to receive, possess and import the [designated] source material [ ], to use such material for the purpose(s) and at the place(s) designated [ ], and to deliver or transfer such material to persons authorized to receive it in accordance with the regulations\" of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 40.

(ECF 21 at 1; ECF 22 at 5). Plaintiffs also argue that, were this Court to find the PAA applicable to their claims, their Constitutional right to Due Process would be violated. (ECF 22 at 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In their Response to the Motion to Remand, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims \"fall squarely in the purview of the PAA's federal jurisdiction provision,\" and that Plaintiffs cannot \"escape the PAA by suing only those entities connected to the nuclear weapons industry in St. Louis that did not have a license or direct indemnification agreement with the federal government.\" (ECF 32 at 6). Defendants further contend that \"regardless of whom, if anyone caused [the] nuclear incident, liability would be channeled to the licensee and payment would be obtained from the compensation pool\" established by the PAA.
