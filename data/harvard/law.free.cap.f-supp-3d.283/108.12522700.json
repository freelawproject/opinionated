Two months later, he was incarcerated at Riker's Island for five days. While at Riker's Island, Mr. Davis received emergency medical care from Defendant Joseph McCready, RPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the course of Mr. Davis's emergency visit, he informed Defendant that he suffered from excruciating pain throughout his body, had trouble sleeping and breathing, and had trouble walking due to his gunshot wounds, which were still raw. Mr. Davis requested a variety of treatments, but Defendant provided him with only a cane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Davis was later transferred to various other correctional centers. He developed increasingly severe injuries to his left foot, including ingrown toenails and a curling of his toes, both of which required surgical intervention. Mr. Davis filed this action\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , alleging that he received constitutionally inadequate medical treatment while at Riker's Island. Defendant has moved to dismiss Plaintiff's third amended complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Because Mr. Davis plausibly alleges that Defendant's treatment of his leg and foot injury was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs, Defendant's motion is DENIED to the extent that it is based on Mr. Davis's\n   leg and foot condition. Defendant's motion is GRANTED, however, as to all other aspects of Mr. Davis's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

ECF No. 144, Third Am. Compl. (\"TAC\"), \u00b6 7. Eighteen months later, on April 17, 2014, Mr. Davis was shot eight times, in both of his arms, his lower back, chest, and left leg. TAC \u00b6 8. As a result, Mr. Davis experienced \"extreme pain in the legs, chest area and lower back.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also suffered from \"foot drop,\" asthma, and heart problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nearly two months later, on June 14, 2014, Mr. Davis entered the Robert N. Davoren Complex (\"RNDC\"), a jail on Riker's Island. TAC \u00b6 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following day, Mr. Davis was taken to the RNDC's medical department for an emergency medical visit. TAC \u00b6 9. He was seen by Defendant Joseph McCready, RPA. TAC \u00b6 10. Mr. Davis explained to Defendant that he had extreme pain in his legs and back, foot drop, heart problems and associated chest pain, and breathing problems due to asthma and his gunshot wounds to the chest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At that time, Mr. Davis's gunshot wounds were \"still 'raw,' patched-up, and the 'stitches' clearly\" were showing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He had a surgical scar that extended from his chest to his lower abdomen, as well as scarring on his arms, lower back, and left leg. TAC \u00b6 14. Mr. Davis \"struggl[ed] to walk into\" Defendant's office because of his foot drop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After being examined by Defendant, Mr. Davis requested pain medication for \"excruciating pain\" in his legs and lower back, a special therapeutic mattress for his back pain and sleeping disorder, a foot brace to stabilize his left foot, and a cane to help him walk and \"take some of the weight off his left leg.\" TAC \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; ECF No. 152, Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss (\"Pl.'s Opp.\") at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant supplied Mr. Davis with a cane, but did not provide a brace to stabilize his foot drop, a therapeutic mattress, pain medication, or asthma medication.

TAC \u00b6 17. Approximately three months later, in November 2014, Mr. Davis was transferred to the George Motchan Detention Center (GMDC) in East Elmurst, New York. TAC \u00b6 19. While housed at the GMDC, Mr. Davis was not allowed the use of a cane.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One day, while being escorted to the medical department of the GMDC, Mr. Davis slipped on water that had leaked onto the floor, fell, and was taken away on a stretcher to the Elmhurst Hospital Prison Ward.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Davis alleges that it was Defendant's failure to prescribe a leg brace that partially contributed to his vulnerability to falling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Davis also alleges that prior to his transfer out of the RNDC, Defendant failed to properly record Defendant's \"findings and medical recommendations\" so that those findings would be available to medical staff who later treated Mr. Davis after he left the RNDC. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. This, as well as Defendant's failure to provide \"adequate medical treatment,\" Mr. Davis alleges, led to the \"degeneration\" of his other body parts as he attempted to compensate for his foot drop. TAC \u00b6 18, Pl.'s Opp. at 11. Specifically, his left toenails grew into the skin of his foot, \"causing infection, pain and bleeding,\" and his left toes became curled under his foot. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 12, 18, 21. While Mr. Davis was housed at the GMDC, his left toenails were \"finally\" cut by the center's medical staff. TAC \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Davis was later transferred back to the RNDC. TAC \u00b6 20. On September 20, 2015, while at the RNDC, Mr. Davis's stomach wound re-opened.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Davis informed the RNDC medical department, the \"Draft Room S[ergeant],\" and the \"Draft Room Officer\" of the reopened wound.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Davis was transferred by bus to the Ulster Correctional Facility, where photographs of his reopened wound were taken.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Davis underwent toenail surgery in January 2017, while housed at the Orleans Correctional Facility. TAC \u00b6 12; TAC Exhibit B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That month, a doctor at the Erie County Medical Center also prescribed an orthotic foot brace. TAC \u00b6 21, TAC Exhibit C. The brace stabilizes Mr. Davis's left ankle and foot while he performs daily activities. TAC \u00b6 21. Mr. Davis's toenails had to be cut again by medical staff in February 2017. TAC \u00b6 18. He is currently scheduled for surgery to straighten his left\n   toes. TAC \u00b6 21. Mr. Davis also receives treatment with an \"asthma pump.\" TAC \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Davis alleges that, as a result of Defendant's failure to properly treat and document his medical conditions, he continues to suffer from \"mental anguish,\" emotional and psychological distress, and \" 'unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain' throughout his body,\" specifically in his left leg and foot, lower back, and chest. TAC \u00b6 15. He also alleges that his daily activities have been \"significantly affected and filled with substantial pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Davis asserts that Defendant was fully apprised of his injuries, which were apparent with \"just a casual view of\" his body. Pl.'s Opp. at 12. Mr. Davis claims that Defendant \"ignored [his] obvious grave risks, extreme pain and debilitating conditions\" that \"would be obvious to any medical practitioner.\" TAC \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Davis filed his initial complaint on August 5, 2014, bringing claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the RNDC \"medical department\" and \"medical director.\" ECF No. 1. Following an order from the Court to identify the specific defendants in the proceeding, Mr. Davis filed a first amended complaint on March 6, 2015, alleging that a number of defendants, including Mr. McCready, had denied him adequate medical treatment. ECF No. 14. On February 22, 2016, the Court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs and granted Mr. Davis leave to replead. ECF No. 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Davis filed his second amended complaint on June 29, 2016. ECF No. 111. In his second amended complaint, Mr. Davis named only Mr. McCready as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On February 15, 2017, the Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim and granted Mr. Davis leave to replead by March 14, 2017.

After being granted an extension of time, Mr. Davis filed his third amended complaint on April 13, 2017, again alleging that Mr. McCready violated his constitutional rights by demonstrating deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. ECF No. 144. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on May 5, 2017. ECF No. 146.

The distinction between medical treatment that is merely negligent and treatment that supports a constitutional claim depends on the degree of risk associated with the practitioner's conduct. Presumably any negligent conduct by a medical practitioner yields some increased risk of harm to the patient. If a court finds allegations that a medical provider acted negligently, in order to determine whether a plaintiff has pleaded a\n   viable constitutional claim, the court is now required to evaluate whether the risk associated with the negligent conduct would reasonably be expected to be excessive. Determining whether a reasonable medical provider would expect the conduct to result in excessive risk, as opposed to some lower baseline level of risk associated with any negligent medical conduct, may be difficult in the context of a motion to dismiss-a stage at which the court does not have the benefit of expert opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Of course, some pleadings may present factual circumstances that do not require a court to engage in such an assessment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Villafane v.

In sum, in\n   <em>\n    Darnell\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit reaffirmed the vital distinction between mere negligence, and the something greater required to support a constitutional claim. But the distinction may be more difficult for a court to discern on the face of the pleadings in many cases involving medical treatment: evaluated objectively, the distinction between negligent medical treatment and treatment that gives rise to a constitutional claim comes down to the degree of risk associated with the negligent treatment-a question courts may be ill-equipped to answer on the basis of the pleadings alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In the present matter, the Court cannot, as a matter of law, conclude that Defendant's treatment of Mr. Davis's foot drop, or lack thereof, amounts to nothing more than simple negligence. Although Mr. Davis does not plead that Defendant\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that an excessive risk to his health would come from his sole prescription of a cane, the third amended complaint does suggest that Defendant may have been in a position to know of such a risk. Accepting Mr. Davis's allegations as true, Defendant was aware of the eight gunshot wounds Mr.\n   Davis had recently received, saw that Mr. Davis struggled to lift his left foot when he walked, and was asked for a foot brace to stabilize Mr. Davis's foot drop. Defendant was also informed by Mr. Davis of the excruciating pain that he experienced in his back and leg due, as Mr. Davis alleges, to the gunshot wounds and resulting nerve damage. Defendant also knew the extent of those gunshot wounds as they were still \"raw\" and Mr. Davis had scarring on his leg. Mr. Davis additionally pleads that, as a result of his ineffectively treated foot drop, he now suffers from severe conditions of his foot requiring surgery and has sustained additional \"degeneration\" of other body parts. On these allegations, the Court cannot conclude that no reasonable physician assistant in Defendant's position would have known, or had reason to know, that recommending nothing more than a cane posed an excessive risk to Mr. Davis's health and safety. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss Mr. Davis's deliberate indifference claim premised on Mr. Davis's left leg and foot condition is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With respect to Mr. Davis's claim related to Defendant's failure to prescribe pain and asthma medication and a therapeutic mattress, the Court is not faced with a similarly difficult assessment. Mr. Davis has pleaded nothing to suggest that he faced any risk, let alone an excessive risk, as a result of his lack of access to the requested treatments. He claims that he experienced ongoing pain, which reasonably may be attributed to Defendant's choice not to prescribe pain medication and a special mattress. Mr. Davis does not, however, allege how that pain posed an excessive risk to his health and safety. Mr. Davis similarly fails to plead that his asthma was such that leaving it untreated posed an excessive risk of harm. Therefore, Defendant's motion to dismiss Mr. Davis's deliberate indifference claim is GRANTED to the extent that claim relates to Defendant's failure to prescribe pain and asthma medication and a therapeutic mattress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. State Tort Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To the extent that Mr. Davis's third amended complaint can be read to suggest state tort claims against Defendant, those claims are precluded from being litigated in this court by New York Correction Law \u00a7 24 (\" Section 24\").
