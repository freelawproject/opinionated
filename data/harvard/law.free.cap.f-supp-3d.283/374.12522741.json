(ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 100.) Before the Court are three motions for summary judgment brought pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by (1) Defendants Josh Stein,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nancy Lorrin Freeman, and J. Douglas Henderson (collectively \"State Prosecutors\"), (ECF No. 100); (2) CAI, (ECF No. 103); and (3) Intervenor-Defendant, the North Carolina State Bar (the \"State Bar\"), (ECF No. 112). For the reasons stated below, the Court (1) denies State Prosecutors' motion, (2) denies CAI's motion, (3) and grants the State Bar's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its Complaint, CAI describes itself as a tax-exempt, \"non-profit employers' association\" comprised of approximately 1,080 employers throughout North Carolina that \"associate[ ] ... to promote industrial development and progress.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 17.) CAI members pay annual membership dues to CAI to receive \"efficient, low-cost human resources-related information, advice, data, education, legislative advocacy, and other benefits and services pertaining to each member's human resources, compliance, and day-to-day management needs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) In addition to its current offerings, CAI wishes to provide \"employment-related legal advice and services to its members through licensed North Carolina attorneys\" that it employs, as part of the dues its members currently pay. (ECF No. 105-1 \u00b6\u00b6 34, 44.) For a separate fee of $195 per hour, CAI also wishes to offer its members other legal services that would include drafting employment, separation, and non-compete agreements, reviewing employment policies and handbooks, and representation \"in charges before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) The legal services that CAI wishes to offer would not include providing legal assistance with matters related to litigation or \"extremely specialized areas of workplace law\" including, for example, \"[t]ax matters that relate to workplace and employee needs.\" (ECF No. 106-1 at 64-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April of 2013, CAI requested from the State Bar an opinion as to whether CAI's proposed plan to provide legal advice and services to its members would constitute the unauthorized practice of law. (ECF Nos. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 7-9; 42-1.) On May 28, 2013, the State Bar issued a proposed ethics decision, which notified CAI that its plan would amount to the unauthorized practice of law because of CAI's status as a corporation not authorized to practice law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 23, 2015, CAI filed this lawsuit, seeking declaratory relief and requesting that State Prosecutors be enjoined from enforcing the UPL Statutes against CAI. (ECF No. 1.) CAI alleged that the enforcement of the UPL Statutes, as applied to CAI, would violate (1) its right to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-53); (2) its right of association under the First Amendment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-63); (3) its right to free speech under the First Amendment on the grounds that the UPL Statutes operate as content-based restrictions and prevent CAI from speaking because it is a corporation, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-72); (4) its right to due process under\n   the Fourteenth Amendment on the ground that the UPL Statutes are vague, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-82); (5) its right to free speech on the ground that the UPL Statutes prohibit CAI from advertising its proposed legal services, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-91); and (6) the Monopoly Clause of the North Carolina Constitution, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-99). On February 16, 2015, CAI sought a preliminary injunction, requesting that the Court enjoin State Prosecutors from taking any action that would interfere with CAI offering or delivering legal advice and services to its members through CAI attorneys licensed to practice law. (ECF No. 19 at 1.) State Prosecutors moved to dismiss CAI's claims. (ECF No. 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court heard oral arguments on the motions on May 29, 2015. On September 4, 2015, this Court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order (\"Preliminary Injunction Order\"), denying CAI's motion for a preliminary injunction, and denying State Prosecutors' motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Capital Associated Indus., Inc. v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   State Prosecutors have moved for summary judgment on jurisdictional grounds and on CAI's right of association claim only. (ECF No. 100.) CAI and the State Bar have each moved for summary judgment on each of the six claims brought by CAI. (ECF Nos. 103, 112.) As State Prosecutors raise the threshold issue of whether the Court can consider CAI's claims, the Court will first consider their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. State Prosecutors' Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    1. Standing and Ripeness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   State Prosecutors argue that CAI cannot satisfy the requirements of standing doctrine or ripeness doctrine because CAI did not face a credible threat of prosecution before it brought suit. (ECF No. 101 at 6-20.) CAI contends that it does have standing to sue on the ground that such a threat exists. (ECF No. 117 at 4-11.) The Court observes that \"the Article\n   III standing and ripeness issues in this case 'boil down to the same question.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Susan B.

Further, when \"the State has not disclaimed any intention of enforcing\" the challenged statute, a plaintiff \"need not actually violate\" that statute, \"or be proactively threatened with prosecution prior to violation, in order to have standing to challenge its constitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    Does 1-5 v.

The Court's justification for this conclusion remains unchanged from the Court's earlier ruling on this issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   State Prosecutors have not stated that they would refrain from prosecuting CAI for violating the UPL Statutes. Nor have State Prosecutors stated that they disagree with the State Bar's proposed ethics opinion issued to CAI. To the contrary, State Prosecutors and the State Bar vigorously contend that CAI lacks the right to provide its members with legal advice and services. CAI need not subject itself to criminal prosecution to establish standing to challenge the UPL Statutes.... With the injury-in-fact requirement satisfied, CAI clears the other two hurdles for standing: causation and redressability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Capital Associated Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120627\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/129/281/#p308\">\n    129 F.Supp.3d at 301-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . State Prosecutors advance several related, yet equally unavailing,\n   arguments to counter the conclusion that CAI faces a credible threat of prosecution. (ECF No. 101 at 6-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   State Prosecutors contend that CAI lacks standing because (1) the record contains no evidence of a pending prosecution against CAI, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13); (2) CAI's plan is insufficiently specific, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8; 15-16); (3) the record contains no evidence of UPL prosecutions of \"licensed attorneys, business association or corporation attorneys by the Attorney General or these two District Attorneys,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11); (4) North Carolina law does not allow prosecutors to agree to refrain from enforcing the law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15; 17-20); and (5) CAI has provided no evidence to support its \"theory that the State Bar, or any other person, association or entity can make a referral to the Attorney General or a District Attorney, and have that referral automatically result in a prosecution for\" the unauthorized practice of law, (ECF No. 101 at 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court does not find State Prosecutors' arguments persuasive. First, CAI is not required to submit evidence that it faces a pending prosecution in order for the threat of prosecution to be credible. CAI could only satisfy such a requirement by engaging in the prohibited conduct, which the law does not require it to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MedImmune, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/\">\n    549 U.S. at 128-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, CAI's plan is sufficiently specific to allow the State Bar to conclude that the plan would constitute the unauthorized practice of law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42-2.) This conclusion by the State Bar is sufficient to subject CAI to criminal liability under North Carolina law and thus establish a threat of prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2084-7\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 84-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the fact that North Carolina has not prosecuted a business association for the unauthorized practice of law is immaterial to the standing inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fourth, the question of whether North Carolina law allows district attorneys to disavow their enforcement of state law is also irrelevant. Since State Prosecutors have not refused to enforce the UPL Statutes, CAI faces a credible threat of prosecution. Finally, contrary to State Prosecutors' contention, the Court concludes that North Carolina law requires the State's district attorneys to indict individuals or entities who allegedly violate the UPL Statutes once a district attorney receives notice of the alleged violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Disciplinary Hearing Comm'n v.

The Court concludes that CAI does have standing as a matter of law and thus State Prosecutors have failed to carry their burden. Accordingly, State Prosecutors are not entitled to summary judgment on jurisdictional grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    2. Right of Association\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court will next address State Prosecutors' right of association argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court will address this argument separately from its discussion of the cross-motions brought by CAI and the State Bar because State Prosecutors' argument rests on different grounds. State Prosecutors contend that they are entitled to summary judgment on CAI's right of association claim solely because, according to them, CAI has not produced any evidence \"to support CAI's efforts to categorize its members as 'marginalized individuals who were actually being denied channels to vindicate rights.' \" (ECF No. 101 at 15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Capital Associated Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120627\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/129/281/#p308\">\n    129 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   293 ).) CAI does not respond directly to this contention. CAI merely states that: \"Although the State raises several arguments, the theme of its challenges is the familiar refrain that CAI lacks standing in this case.\" (ECF No. 117 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It appears that State Prosecutors may have misconstrued the Court's Preliminary Injunction Order, in which the Court concluded that \"[p]aying more than desired for the assistance of outside counsel does not place CAI and its employer-members in the same category as union workers, minorities, or other marginalized individuals who were\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   being denied channels to vindicate rights protected by the United States Constitution or federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Capital Associated Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120627\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/129/281/#p308\">\n    129 F.Supp.3d at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In raising this argument, State Prosecutors appear to construe that conclusion as a rule that CAI must satisfy in order to prevail on its right of association claim.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 123 at 6-7.) The Court agrees with the State Bar's observation that CAI appears to prefer a limited record. Nonetheless, while this Court previously concluded that the record was too \"skeletal\" for CAI to meet its burden of demonstrating a clear likelihood of success on the merits, as was required to prevail on its motion for a preliminary injunction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capital Associated Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120627\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/129/281/#p308\">\n    129 F.Supp.3d at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court concludes that the record is adequate to consider CAI's as-applied challenge at this stage of the proceedings.

The State Bar responds that the UPL Statutes are rationally related to North Carolina's interest in avoiding potential \"conflicts of interest and loyalty,\" as well as its interest in avoiding the \"impairment of attorney independence.\" (ECF No. 113 at 7-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \"[n]o State shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend.

The Court concludes that the UPL Statutes are reasonably related to the promotion of these legitimate interests. North Carolina could rationally decide that non-lawyers would be more likely than lawyers to encourage the attorneys whom they supervise to violate the ethical canons that govern the legal profession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacoby &amp; Meyers, LLP v.

Accordingly, North Carolina's prohibition on the unauthorized practice of law, as applied to CAI, survives rational basis review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by CAI's four arguments that the UPL Statutes cannot survive rational basis review, based on its contention that \"[t]he facts underlying the general prohibition against trade associations offering legal services are not conceivably true.\" (ECF No. 104 at 21.) First, CAI argues that \"there is no harm to [its] members or the public if the trade association's attorneys comply with their ethical obligations; and North Carolina presumes that attorneys will comply with their ethical obligations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.) However, the State can reasonably conclude that an attorney who is supervised by a non-attorney would be more likely to violate those ethical obligations, irrespective of any presumption that the State might have about the conduct of supervised attorneys. Second, CAI contends that \"there is no evidence supporting the existence of the public-interest concerns [underlying the UPL Statutes] at trade associations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) However, the State is under no obligation to submit evidence supporting the reasonableness of its legislative choice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bostic v.

The Court will not consider evidence that compares CAI to other entities that are allowed to provide legal services under North Carolina's UPL Statutes.

Any \"[p]rofessional corporation\" that seeks to provide legal services in North Carolina can render those services \"subject to the applicable rules and regulations adopted by ... the licensing board,\" which in this case, is the North Carolina State Bar. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 55B-2(4) - (6), 55B-12(a). Therefore, the professional speech doctrine applies in this case. Accordingly, as applied to CAI, the UPL Statutes operate as professional regulation that is not subject to First Amendment scrutiny on freedom of speech grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   CAI argues that its proposed legal services are pure speech, as opposed to conduct (ECF No. 104 at 28-30), however this distinction is immaterial. CAI contends that its provision of legal services would constitute speech, and not conduct, because it will be required to communicate in order to provide its proposed services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There is no question that CAI's provision of legal services would require it to communicate with its member-clients. Rather, the question in this case is whether the type of communication that the UPL Statutes restrict is entitled to First Amendment protection. For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that CAI's proposed communicative acts fall under the professional speech doctrine and are therefore not entitled to First Amendment protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CAI also argues that the UPL Statutes violate freedom of speech because the statutes impermissibly prohibit CAI from speaking on the basis of its identity as a corporation. (ECF No. 104 at 30-31.) The Court rejects this assertion for two reasons. First, as stated above, the UPL Statutes operate as professional regulation that is not subject to First Amendment scrutiny under Fourth Circuit precedent. Therefore, no First Amendment bar to government regulation of speech on the basis of a speaker's corporate identity could apply in this case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p364\">\n    558 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p364\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p364\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Second, to the extent that any First Amendment bar to regulatory distinctions based on a speaker's corporate identity could apply to prohibit professional regulation as a general matter, that First Amendment bar would present no issue in this case. North Carolina does not bar CAI from providing legal services \"solely because CAI is a corporation,\" (ECF No. 104 at 30), as CAI contends. The UPL Statutes do \"not apply to corporations\n   <em>\n    authorized to practice law\n   </em>\n   under the provisions of Chapter 55B of the General Statutes of North Carolina.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2084-5\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 84-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). North Carolina permits corporations to provide legal services, subject to the state's ordinary regulation of the legal profession.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2084-5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 55B-2(4)-(6), 55B-12(a). Thus, CAI's corporate identity poses no bar to its ability to engage in professional speech, which nonetheless remains unprotected by the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   CAI has failed to carry its burden that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its freedom of speech claim. Conversely, the State Bar has met its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    3. Right of Association\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   CAI next argues that its members have a constitutionally protected right to associate to provide group legal services, relying on a line of Supreme Court cases that it characterizes as\n   <em>\n    NAACP v. Button\n   </em>\n   and its progeny,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support this argument. (ECF No. 104 at 22-23.) Further, CAI argues that North Carolina's infringement of that right cannot survive strict scrutiny. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.) The State Bar counters that\n   <em>\n    NAACP v. Button\n   </em>\n   and its progeny do not extend the right of association to protect CAI and its plan to provide legal services because CAI's goals are to increase revenue and reduce its members' expenses, which are not entitled to constitutional protection. (ECF No. 113 at 12-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Supreme Court has recognized the right to associate as a means of protecting the freedom to engage collectively in activities that are entitled to First Amendment protection.\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339552\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/609/#p622\">\n    468 U.S. at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339552\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/609/#p622\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e have long understood as implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.\").

CAI proposes to provide its members \"employment-related legal advice and services\" that could include drafting employment, separation, and non-compete agreements, reviewing employment policies and handbooks, and representation before the EEOC. (ECF No. 105-1 \u00b6 34, 44.) In addition, CAI alleges in its Complaint that it is being precluded from \"earning revenues by employing licensed attorneys to provide [this] legal advice and services to its members.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 98.) Unlike the clear constitutional objectives advanced by\n   <em>\n    Button\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, CAI has failed to provide evidence that any activity for which it claims a right to associate is deserving of First Amendment protection. The proposed legal services would not include assistance with litigation or the vindication of any statutory rights. (ECF No. 106-1 at 64-67.) They would not further the right to free speech pertaining to political expression as in\n   <em>\n    Button\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Primus\n   </em>\n   ; nor would they further the right to petition the government for redress before a court or an agency as in\n   <em>\n    United Transportation Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Trainmen\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Mine Workers\n   </em>\n   , by, for example, advising CAI members as to how they might vindicate their constitutional or statutory rights. CAI's characterization of\n   <em>\n    Button\n   </em>\n   and its progeny as establishing a First Amendment right to undertake \"a broad range of group legal services\" overstates the breadth of these holdings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 104 at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because CAI's proposed provision of legal services would not further the exercise of any protected First Amendment activity, CAI is not entitled to any corresponding First Amendment associational protection merely because the activities would be undertaken collectively.

CAI contends that the UPL Statutes fail to provide sufficient notice of the conduct prohibited by the term \"legal advice.\" (ECF 104 at 33.) Despite this contention, CAI appears to understand the term \"legal advice\" and has repeatedly used the term to describe its current and proposed activities. Bruce Clarke, CAI's President and CEO, demonstrated his understanding of that term in a 2013 communication with the State Bar when he noted that legal advice entails \"applying a legal solution to specific facts.\" (ECF No. 42-1 at 2.) Further, he confirmed in his deposition that he understands a \"reasonable definition\" of the term following his review of the General Statutes. (ECF No. 113-1 at 124-25.)

Defs. of Wildlife\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     504 U.S. 555\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 560,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     112 S.Ct. 2130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     119 L.Ed.2d 351\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1992). Similarly, ripeness doctrine requires courts to ask whether a plaintiff will suffer some hardship if the court declines to consider an issue at a certain time.\n    <em>\n     Doe v. Va. Dep't of State Police\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559947\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/745/#p758\">\n     713 F.3d 745\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 758 (4th Cir. 2013). Thus, when evaluating the cognizability of a future injury, both doctrines ask courts to determine whether that prospective harm will affect the plaintiff soon enough to justify the invocation of federal jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2084-7\">\n     N.C.
