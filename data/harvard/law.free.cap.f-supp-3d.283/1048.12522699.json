Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Defendants' Rule 50(b) Motion, and Memorandum in Support, Requesting for the Judgment on the Jury Verdict to Stand; to Find Defendants Have Qualified Immunity; and to Enter Judgment as a Matter of Law in Favor of Defendants, filed July 26, 2012 (Doc. 201)(\"Motion\"). The Court held a hearing on June 14, 2013. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Defendants' Motion was timely under rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ; (ii) whether the Court may overrule a prior judgment as a matter of law on a rule 50(b) motion; (iii) whether the Defendants properly preserved their qualified immunity argument in their rule 50(b) motion; and (iv) whether the Court may alter\n   the prior judgment in the Plaintiff's favor by construing the Defendants' rule 50(b) motion as a rule 59(e) motion. The Court concludes that: (i) the Defendants' Motion was timely; (ii) rule 50(b) is an improper vehicle for overturning a judgment as a matter of law; (iii) the Defendants' did not preserve their qualified immunity argument-regarding whether the law was clearly established-under rule 50(b) ; and (iv) the Court may construe the Defendants' rule 50(b) motion as a rule 59(e) motion. Because it can construe the Defendants' rule 50(b) motion as a rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend, it will alter the prior judgment rendered under rule 50(b) in the Plaintiff's favor. Although the facts of this case are disquieting, drawing all inferences in the Defendants' favor, a reasonable jury could have found for the Defendants. Furthermore, because there are no sufficiently analogous cases from the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit or the Supreme Court of the United States of America, the Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. The Court, accordingly, grants the Motion in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the morning of March 4, 2009, Tony Nelson, a sixty-two year old American Indian, drank some beers with his friend, Jeffery Patterson, in Patterson's home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Official Transcript of Trial Proceedings before the Court at 19:12-17 (dated October 24, 2011), filed June 29, 2012 (Doc. 189)(\"Trial Tr.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:18-29:2;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:17;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:21-22;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:9-11 (Hawk, Nelson). After running low on beer, the two argued over whether they should buy more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 32:14-19 (Nelson). The argument became heated and Patterson left his home to call the police.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 33:18-19 (Nelson). Patterson returned home, they argued some more, and Patterson left again.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 34:10-12 (Nelson). The last thing Nelson remembers from March 4, 2009, was being \"dead drunk\" and lying down to get some sleep. Trial Tr. at 34:16-35:8 (Hawk, Nelson).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:18-19;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:16-19 (Nelson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Patterson called the police again and this time reported that Nelson had \"threatened [him] with [a] rifle ... and a knife.\" Trial Tr. at 134:16-22 (Hawk, Johnston).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, forty-seven police personnel, which included seventeen SWAT police team members and eight K-9 officers, arrived at Patterson's home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 141:19-21;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 142:8;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 234:15-16 (taken October 25, 2012), filed June 29, 2012 (Doc. 190)(Hawk, Johnston). Someone-presumably Patterson-told the police that Nelson had been drinking, and that the rifle with which Nelson had threatened Patterson was either a pellet rifle\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or a \"308 bolt-action rifle.\" Trial Tr. at 131:15-17 (Johnston).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 298:9-10 (Hawk, Johnston). A 308 bolt-action rifle is a \"large caliber rifle\" that is \"devastating in close range and at distance.\" Trial Tr. at 77:11-12 (Brown);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 243:2 (Johnston). When the police officers arrived at the scene, they did not clarify whether Nelson had threatened Patterson with a pellet rifle or a 308 bolt-action rifle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 132:6-11 (Hawk, Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 243:14-20 (Griffin, Johnston).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The SWAT team arrived with a Bearcat-an armored police vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 84:16-19 (Brown);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 312:11-12 (Hawk, Hughes). At least two officers positioned\n   themselves on roofs nearby with sniper scopes and rifles, and other police personnel established a perimeter around the house with an officer stationed off each corner of it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 78:7-79:5 (Brown, Hawk);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 83:8-18 (Brown, Hawk);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 144:13-20 (Hawk, Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 455:15-17 (Limon)(taken October 26, 2011), filed June 29, 2012 (Doc. 191). The property was almost entirely enclosed by an eight-foot-tall fence with razor wire at the top.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 150:6-151:19 (Hawk, Johnston).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After setting up a perimeter, Defendant Officer Armando Limon called out to Nelson, who was still in the house, to exit the home and walk towards the police team near the driveway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 167:25-168:2 (Hawk, Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 169:4-10 (Hawk, Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 245:14-18 (Griffin, Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 456:11-16 (Hawk, Limon). The police team was positioned behind the Bearcat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 152:3-5 (Johnston). After some time, Nelson appeared in the doorway and motioned for the officers to come toward him; Nelson had a knife in his hand, but at the time, the officers could not tell what Nelson was holding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 172:3-9 (Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 350:3-10 (Hughes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 457:20-23 (Limon). Officer Limon again ordered Nelson to come out, and to turn around.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 500:1-4 (Limon). Nelson went back into the house, however, and dropped the knife. Trial Tr. at 171:7-9 (Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   172:17-18 (Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 350:12 (Hughes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 457:5-17 (Hawk, Limon). Nelson then exited the house, walking slowly south towards the officers with his \"[h]ands to his side.\" Trial Tr. at 98:16-17, 20 (Brown).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 170:19-24 (Hawk, Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 352:12-13 (Hughes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 460:14-15 (Limon). Nelson's hands were empty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 105:19-106:5 (Brown, Hawk);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 297:5-9 (Hawk, Johnston). The officer in charge, Defendant Sergeant Robert Johnston did not see Nelson holding a rifle and thought it would be \"hard to hide a rifle with the way [Nelson] was dressed.\" Trial Tr. at 171:10-14 (Hawk, Johnston). Although he had cleared Nelson's hands, the SWAT team sniper could not confirm whether Nelson had any weapon in his waistband and also observed that Nelson was \"looking around\" and \"appeared to be attempting to identify the position of other officers around the perimeter, or possibly avenues of escape.\" Trial Tr. at 99:19-100:2 (Brown, Griffin).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 99:12-14 (Brown, Griffin).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As Nelson walked down the driveway, the police ordered Nelson several times to raise his hands, but Nelson did not raise them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 258:11-19 (Griffin, Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 495:23-24 (Limon). Officers also heard Nelson speaking or yelling as he approached, but could not understand him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 291:15-18 (Hawk, Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 352:16-19 (Hughes). Officer Limon, however, heard Nelson say: \"Get the fuck out of here.\" Trial Tr. at 499:3 (Limon). After some time, Nelson stopped at the driveway's edge, about twenty feet from the officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 173:14-15 (Hawk, Johnston). He made a motion with his hands, which one officer interpreted as \"go-away\" and another interpreted as \"come to me, come to me.\" Trial Tr. at 353:22-354:1 (Hughes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 497:17-18 (Limon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nelson then made a motion to turn to his left, towards the north, away from the officers. Trial Tr. at 262:23-263:24 (Griffin, Johnston). Although Officer Limon had ordered Nelson to turn around when he made \"initial contact with\" Nelson,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 500:1-4 (Griffin, Limon), the officers interpreted Nelson's motion as an attempt to return to the house to retrieve weapons, and Johnston ordered his subordinate, Defendant Officer Daniel Hughes, to \"deploy his weapon and '[b]ag him,' \" Trial Tr. at 176:23-177:2 (Hawk, Johnston).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 177:5-6 (Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 268:1-5 (Johnston)(\"[W]e were not going to let him go back in the house ... [b]ecause there w[ere] deadly weapons in the house.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 321:19-22 (Hawk, Hughes). Officer Hughes \"immediately\" fired five \"bean bag\" rounds from a non-lethal, shotgun-style weapon. Trial Tr. at 354:19-23 (Hughes).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 182:14 (Johnston). Johnston also fired a wooden-baton round from a similar weapon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 185:21-22 (Johnston). Another officer launched a \"flash bang\" diversionary device to \"overwhelm\" and \"disorient\" Nelson. Trial Tr. at 182:15-24 (Hawk, Johnston).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers fired their weapons from a non-lethal range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 271:11-22 (Griffin, Johnston).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Afterwards-with Nelson's back toward the officers and without warning Nelson-Defendant Officer Scott Weimerskirch, a K-9 officer, released a police dog who bit Nelson on the left arm, drawing blood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 189:12-190:2 (Hawk, Johnston);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 393:12-16 (Hawk, Weimerskirch).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nelson staggered to a wrought-iron fence post, \"trying to shake the dog off,\" and several officers approached Nelson with the dog still clinging to his left arm. Trial Tr. at 274:9-15 (Griffin, Johnston).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 192:17-193:1 (Hawk, Johnston). Both of Nelson's hands were visible, and neither held a weapon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 362:8-11 (Hughes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 454:8-18 (Hawk, Limon). Officers ordered Nelson to let go of the fence, but he did not respond to that command.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 364:15-25 (Hughes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Limon fired his Taser at Nelson, but, after the Taser darts struck Nelson, Officers Hughes and Limon perceived \"no change to [his] behavior.... He didn't look like ... he was being tased.\" Trial Tr. at 364:5-9 (Hughes).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 451:1-11. Officer Limon heard his Taser make the sound it usually makes when operating effectively, however.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 452:17-20 (Hawk, Limon). Officer Hughes then fired his Taser at Nelson, and one of his Taser darts struck Nelson in the neck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 331:25-332:3;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 365:10-12 (Hawk, Hughes).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Hughes cycled\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   his Taser six times delivering six shocks over a thirty-seven second period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 336:11-13 (Hawk, Hughes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 368:19-23 (Griffin, Hughes); Plaintiff's Exhibit 47 at 2, filed November 23, 2011 (Doc. 158-4). Officer Hughes explained that he shocked Nelson six times, because he \"was still holding onto the fence and appeared to be fighting with the dog.\" Trial Tr. at 368:24-369:4 (Griffin, Hughes). After the sixth shock, Officer Hughes determined \"we were not going to get any compliance from him more than we had,\" stopped shocking him, and grabbed Nelson's left hand. Trial Tr. at 370:9-11 (Hughes). Nelson was subsequently arrested and hospitalized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 35:11-12 (Nelson);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:22-23 (Nelson);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 370:24 (Hughes). Nelson pled guilty to \"aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,\" but the judge dismissed the charge after Nelson served his probation. Trial Tr. at 37:23-38:6 (Hawk, Nelson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 10, 2010, Nelson filed suit in the Second Judicial District Court, County of Bernalillo, State of New Mexico, asserting tort and civil rights violations by Defendants Bernalillo County, the City of Albuquerque, and Albuquerque police officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint For Civil Rights Violations &amp; Violation of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act at 1, filed June 8, 2010 (dated May 10, 2010)(Doc. 1-1)(\"State Complaint\"). Nelson alleges, among other things, that: (i) police officers used \"excessive and unnecessary ... force in the course of arrest and custody\" violating his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America and Article II, Section 10 of the New Mexico Constitution ; (ii) the City of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County \"maintain[ ] official policies\" or a \"de facto\" policy permitting the excessive use of force; and (iii) the City of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County \"failed to train\" and supervise their police officers in the proper use of force and were, accordingly, deliberately indifferent to Nelson's rights. State Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 28, 34, 43, 48-50 at 5-6, 8-9 (emphasis omitted). The City of Albuquerque removed the case to federal court, and Nelson amended his Complaint, but continued to allege the same substantive violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal at 1, filed June 8, 2010 (Doc. 1); Amended Complaint for Civil Rights Violations &amp; Violation of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act \u00b6\u00b6 28-35, 44, 49-51 at 5-6, 8-9 filed July 15, 2010 (Doc. 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 6, 2011, the Defendants moved for summary judgment on the excessive use of force claim, arguing, generally, that the police officers' use of force was \" 'objectively reasonable' under the circumstances,\" and alternatively, that they were entitled to qualified immunity. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, and Memorandum in Support, Requesting Dismissal of Counts I and II of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint with Prejudice at 8-11, filed April 6, 2011 (Doc. 66)(\"1st SJ Motion\"). The City of Albuquerque subsequently filed a second Summary Judgment Motion, arguing that: (i) the City of Albuquerque could not be liable for excessive use of force, because Nelson could not identify any City of Albuquerque policies that were \"the 'moving force' behind [Nelson's] alleged injury\"; and (ii) the City of Albuquerque could also not be liable for failing to train and supervise its police officers, because their officers \"ha[d] undergone extensive law enforcement training\" and there were several policies in place \"ensur[ing] that subordinate officers [were] being supervise[d].\" Defendant City of Albuquerque's Motion, and Memorandum in Support, For Summary Judgment Requesting Dismissal of Counts III and IV of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint at 9-10, filed April 7, 2011 (Doc. 72)(\"2d SJ Motion\")(quoting\n   <em>\n    Board of Cty. Com'rs v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/#p404\">\n    520 U.S. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404-05,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/#p404\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/#p404\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) ). The Judge Black denied the City of Albuquerque's 1st SJ Motion, because there were disputes of material fact regarding whether Nelson \"posed a threat prior to the[ police's] use of force\" and whether Nelson was \"flee[ing] or resist[ing] arrest,\" which would allow the police officers to apply a higher level of force. Memorandum Opinion at 4-5, filed October 5, 2011 (Doc. 123)(\"SJ Opinion\"). Regarding qualified immunity, Judge Black determined that \"the Officers are not entitled to qualified immunity,\" because \"a reasonable factfinder could find that [Nelson]'s right to be free of excessive force was violated,\" and that the \"objectively reasonable standard under which that right is analyzed\" was \" 'clearly established' \" on March 4, 2009. SJ Opinion at 6-7. Judge Black, however, granted in part Albuquerque's 2d SJ Motion, because Nelson had evidence of only a \"single unconstitutional act of excessive\n   of force,\" which could not, by itself, demonstrate a citywide practice, policy, or custom that would give rise to municipal liability. SJ Opinion at 7-8. Nevertheless, Judge Black rejected the City of Albuquerque's argument that it adequately trained its officers, because the City of Albuquerque's police procedures \"require[ ] officers [when facing a mentally ill subject] to 'calm the situation,' 'assume a quiet, non-threatening manner when approaching the subject,' and 'not threaten the subject with arrest or physical harm,' \" but the record demonstrates that the \"[o]fficers instead relied on an imposing presence and swift physical force to arrest [Nelson].\" SJ opinion at 8-9. Judge Black noted that, \"[w]hile the record is rife with evidence of Officers' general training, it lacks evidence of training on this specific procedure, or the efficacy of such training,\" and concluded that \"[t]he failure to train claim, while thin, is not proper for summary judgment.\" SJ Opinion at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 24, 2011, Judge Black held a six-day jury trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clerk's Minutes, filed November 4, 2011 (Doc. 152). After Nelson rested, the Defendants renewed their qualified immunity summary judgment motion, arguing that\n   <em>\n    Quezada v. Bernalillo Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524205\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/710/\">\n    944 F.2d 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1991) affords defendants an opportunity to renew a qualified immunity argument \"at the Rule 50 stage.\" Trial Tr. at 720:3-8 (Griffin). Judge Black denied it concluding \"there's a factual dispute,\" because of Nelson's expert's testimony. Trial Tr. at 720:11-12 (Court).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524205\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/710/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524205\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/710/\">\n    at 720:22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Court).

Consequently, Nelson recovered nothing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form at 3. The Court entered judgment on November 8, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment, filed November 8, 2011 (Doc. 147).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Nelson's Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 23, 2011, Nelson renewed his motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule 50(b), and also moved for a new trial under rule 59(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJMOL at 1. In summary, he argues that, given the circumstances, the police used excessive force when they fired five beanbag shots, fired the wooden-baton rounds, sent the dog at him, and repeatedly Tased him such that no reasonable jury could have found for the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJMOL at 3-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Nelson argues that, under the excessive-force standard, a court must \"analyze the factual circumstances of every case\" and determine \"whether the subject poses an immediate threat to the safety of officers and others,\" and whether \"the subject is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\" RJMOL at 2. Nelson avers that, based on that standard, \"at the time Defendant Hughes deployed his beanbag shotgun, [Nelson] did not pose an immediate threat to officers or others.\" RJMOL at 3. According to Nelson, he posed no immediate threat, because the police had established a \"safe perimeter,\" Nelson could only exit through one door of the house, \"all sides of the house had lethal police coverage,\" \"any egress from the property was further hampered ... by two razor wired fences\" and that the SWAT team had high-ground snipers trained on the property. RJMOL at 3. Nelson argues, further, that \"there is no evidence that Plaintiff posed an immediate threat to [the police] once he exited the house,\" because Nelson \"followed commands to walk towards\" the police team, he \"slowly walked\" towards them \"empty handed,\" and Nelson \"stopped as ordered\" at least twenty feet away from the officers. RJMOL at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Regarding the inference that Nelson turned around to \"retreat to the house rather than turning around in compliance with [police] orders to turn around,\" Nelson argues that no \"reasonable officer, could infer that Plaintiff was turning around to retreat,\" because photographic evidence \"shows that Hughes was facing [Nelson] at the time of the shots.\" RJMOL at 4. Nelson also argues that photographic evidence demonstrates that the first two beanbag shots hit Nelson in his sternum and \"epigastrium\"-the center of his body-refuted the police officer's testimony that Nelson \"turned to his left in a quick manner.\" RJMOL at 4. According to Nelson, the remaining three shots hit his rib cage and back, because Nelson was \"obviously turn[ing] away from the shots.\" RJMOL at 4-5. Nelson also argues that Hughes' five consecutive beanbag shots were excessive, because Hughes failed to take \"appropriate tactical pauses between each shot.\" RJMOL at 5. Nelson avers that, under proper police protocols, a \"tactical pause is required ... to assess whether a subject is ... complying with orders,\" but the evidence \"clearly indicates there was no tactical pause\"-the first two shots hit Nelson near each other, \"in the midline.\" RJMOL at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, Nelson adds that the wooden-baton rounds were excessive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJMOL at 5-6. According to Nelson, Johnston \"launched his wooden rounds\" when Nelson's \"back was facing the [police] team.\" RJMOL at 5. Nelson further avers that, on top of having his back turned, Nelson \"posed no immediate threat,\" because, again, his \"hands were clear,\" he was \"disoriented\n   by the flash-bang diversionary device,\" already \"injured by beanbag rounds,\" and \"intoxicated.\" RJMOL at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Third, Nelson argues that releasing the dog after the beanbag shots, the wooden-baton rounds, and the flash-bang device established excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJMOL at 6-7. He also contends that the force was exacerbated, because Weimerskirch released the dog \"without warning\" when Nelson \"had his back towards\" the police team. RJMOL at 6. Finally, he asserts that Weimerskirch's command to the dog to \"retrieve ... in an effort to pull [Nelson] to Weimerskirch\" demonstrates excessive force. RJMOL at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Nelson contends that, after the dog, the shots, and the flash-bang device, the evidence establishes excessive force, because, while Nelson \"clutched onto the metal fence,\" two officers deployed their Tasers and one \"cycled it six times,\" at \"five seconds per cycle,\" delivering six shocks in thirty seconds. RJMOL at 7. He further contends that, like the required \"tactical pause\" for shooting the beanbag charges, police protocol requires a tactical pause before cycling the Taser, but Hughes did not observe that protocol. RJMOL at 7. Nelson argues that, instead, \"[Hughes] only waited 1 second between cycles one through four before cycling again.\" RJMOL at 7. \"Without a tactical pause,\" Nelson argues, \"Hughes could not have assessed [Nelson's] compliance [with orders], and therefore, clearly used excessive force.\" RJMOL at 8. Nelson also avers that the Taser strike was excessive because it occurred after two officers had determined \"that it was safe to approach [Nelson].\" RJMOL at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nelson states that under Tenth Circuit caselaw, it is \"excessive\" to use a Taser \"without having a reason to believe that a lesser amount of force or verbal command can exact compliance.\" RJMOL at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Casey v.

Here, according to Nelson, the officers violated\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   , because \"there was no reason to believe that [Nelson] could not be removed from the fence with less force\" than the Taser shots and six charges. RJMOL at 8.

The proper analysis, he contends, is to follow the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors. First, Nelson maintains that no reasonable officer would believe that Nelson posed an immediate threat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJMOL Reply at 2. Nelson argues that point by listing the following \"undisputed facts\": (i) \"47 officers [were] present\"; (ii) \"[e]ach officer ... had a lethal weapon\"; (iii) two officers were positioned on the roof with snipers; and (iv) and those snipers were prepared to \"sho[o]t Mr. Nelson if ... [they]needed to, if Mr. Nelson made any threats.\" RJMOL Reply at 2-3. Nelson argues that those facts undermined the officers \"subjective belief that [Nelson] nonetheless posed a possible risk to their safety.\" RJMOL Reply at 3. Finally, Nelson avers that, even subjectively, the officers did not believe Nelson posed an \"immediate threat,\" because \"after all the testimony surrounding subjective concerns that [Nelson] may have had a weapon in his waistband,\" both officers \"agree that they deployed the beanbags not in response to any threat by [Nelson], but rather in response to a subjective belief that\" Nelson was returning to the house for weapons. RJMOL Reply at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, invoking the third prong of the excessive force standard, the suspect's flight or resistance, Nelson contends that he did not attempt to flee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RJMOL Reply at 5. In support of that contention, Nelson lists the following \"undisputed facts\": \"[Nelson] came out of the house and dropped his knife after being commanded to do so,\" \"walked slowly towards [the driveway], and then stopped where he was told to stop\" twenty-to-thirty feet away from the officers, and the officer shot his \"beanbag shot gun\" when Nelson \"started\" to turn around. RJMOL Reply at 5-9. Nelson also argues that he did not attempt to flee, because he \"made no attempt to run even after being struck by five successive beanbag rounds and at least two wooden batons from behind.\" RJMOL Reply at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Regarding the dog's release, Nelson preserves his prior argument that the dog's use was excessive given that his back was turned, that he was disoriented by the flash-bang device, that he was intoxicated, that he had been shot seven times between the beanbag and wooden-baton rounds, and that \"he was confined in a small area\" enclosed by a razor wire fence on two sides, a chain-link fence on the third side, and a police team on the fourth. RJMOL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Reply at 10. Nelson also maintains that he posed no risk after the dog attacked him, because the dog handler \"testified that it was safe to approach.\" RJMOL Reply at 11.

Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment Entered in Docs. 168, 169, and 171, or in the Alternative, Motion for Relief From Judgment or Order Entered in Docs 168, 169, and 171 at 1, filed May 8, 2012 (Doc. 173)(\"Motion to Alter\"). Invoking a right to relief under rules 59(e) and 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Defendants argue that there were five reasons that Judge Black should alter Black's Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter at 2. First, according to the Defendants,\n   Judge Black committed clear error \"by utilizing the incorrect standard of review.\" Motion to Alter at 2. Second, they argue that Judge Black committed clear error, \"because it exceeded its jurisdictional authority under Rule 50(b)\" by \"resolv[ing] questions of fact, instead of questions of law.\" Motion to Alter at 2. Third, they contend that Judge Black misconstrued the facts with \"material omissions\" and \"inaccuracies.\" Motion to Alter at 2. Fourth, they say that Judge Black \"improperly weigh[ed] the evidence\" in granting Nelson's RJMOL. Fifth, they conclude that Judge Black committed clear error, because the Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter at 2. The Court details these five arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Turning first to the argument that Judge Black deployed the wrong standard of review, the Defendants argue that Judge Black disregarded rule 50(b)'s standard by failing to \"draw[ ] all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\" Motion to Alter 2-4. The Defendants further contend that Judge Black's factual background demonstrates clear error \"by weighing the evidence, judging witness credibility, challenging the factual conclusions of the jury, and ultimately substituting its judgment for that of the jury.\" Motion to Alter at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, the Defendants argue that Judge Black's close-of-evidence comment that, \"[o]bviously, there is a discrepancy as to what occurred at the scene\" demonstrates that Judge Black exceeded his jurisdictional authority by deciding \"factual questions.\" Motion to Alter at 5-7. The Defendants also aver that Black's Opinion's footnote two, explaining that the court had to \"conduct its own research,\" further demonstrates that Judge Black \"improperly weighed evidence, judged witness credibility, challenged the factual conclusions of the jury, and ultimately substituted its judgment for that of the jury.\" Motion to Alter at 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Third, the Defendants argue that Judge Black's material factual omissions from the opinion constituted clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter at 7. In support of that argument, the Defendants note that Judge Black omitted their expert's testimony from Black's Opinion's statement of facts, which is highly relevant, given Judge Black's close-of-evidence comment that \"I think both of these [ rule 50 motions] turn on the interpretation of the facts that the experts used.\" Motion to Alter at 7-9. The Defendants also contend the following omitted facts demonstrate clear error: (i) Nelson partially concealed himself at the door; (ii) Nelson dropped the knife at the door; (iii) Nelson failed to raise his hands when ordered to; (iv) officers did not know whether Nelson had a weapon in his waistband; (v) Nelson continued to disregard commands as he walked toward the officers; (vi) Nelson said \"[g]et the F[u]ck out of here\" to the officers; (vii) Nelson failed to stop right when he was commanded to do so and \"where the officers wanted to take him into custody\"; (vii) Nelson glanced around, looking as if he was looking for an escape route; (viii) Nelson turned from the southwest to the south when Johnston ordered Hughes to fire his beanbag shotgun; (ix) Nelson turned without being given a command to turn \"just before he actually did turn\"; (x) Nelson continued to turn towards the residence as he was shot; (xi) Nelson continued to turn around \"even\n   after Sergeant Johnston deployed the wood baton launcher\"; (xii) Nelson turned towards the residence as Weimerskirch released the dog; (xiii) Nelson resisted being pulled down by the dog; (xiv) officers cycled their Tasers so that Nelson would remove his arm from the fence; (xv) Nelson did not remove his arm from the fence in compliance with the officers' orders even though he was being Tased and attacked by a dog; (xvi) Nelson continued to move as he was Tased and in between each Taser cycle; and (xvii) officers removed Nelson's hand from the fence after the sixth Taser cycle. Motion to Alter at 9-14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants also argue that Judge Black committed clear error by omitting any mention that Nelson pled guilty to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   According to the Defendants, Judge Black's inclusion of the following inaccuracies amounts to clear error: (i) he noted that forty-seven officers were at Patterson's house \"to effect Nelson's arrest,\" but the Defendants argue that only seven or eight out of the forty-seven officers were charged with arresting Nelson; (ii) Judge Black wrote that the Bearcat armored van \"brought a battery of lethal and less-lethal weapons,\" but the Defendants contend that there is no testimony to that effect, that the Bearcat \"was used to rescue the victim,\" and that \"Officer Limon drove the Bearcat to the inner perimeter and organized SWAT officers in a position of cover\"; (iii) Judge Black determined that \"Patterson was sitting outside of his house\" where officers arrested him, but the Defendants aver that there is no such statement in the record; (iv) Judge Black wrote that Patterson was assaulted only with a knife and a pellet rifle, but the Defendants contend that Patterson advised officers that he was threatened with a knife, and a rifle described as an air rifle, a pellet rifle, or a 308 rifle; (v) Judge Black determined that Nelson was \"completely surrounded,\" but the Defendants note that Johnston did not make any of these statements in the five pages that Judge Black cited; (vi) Judge Black noted that \"Nelson appeared intoxicated, disoriented, slow to react, and unable to maintain a straight line,\" but the Defendants report that the testimony cited \"does not contain this statement\" or \"even a reasonable inference\" of the statement; (vii) Judge Black wrote, \"[a]fter some delay, Nelson stopped,\" but the Defendants rejoined that \"this statement is clearly misleading,\" because Nelson repeatedly failed to comply; (vii) Judge Black determined that \"[e]ach of the five shots hit Nelson before Nelson had turned enough to face the house,\" but the Defendants gainsay that this is \"opinion, not fact,\" because the testimony cited lacks that statement \"or even a reasonable inference that Officer Hughes made this statement\"; (viii) Judge Black wrote \"[t]he flash-bang device is a loud, bright explosive that disorients suspects and interferes with their ability to both see and hear clearly,\" but the Defendants argue that only when the flash-bang is detonated inside a dark room does it have this effect; in an open air environment, disorientation is less likely, its effect on vision or hearing is temporary, and \"there is no evidence in the record that [Nelson] was disoriented by the flash bang device\"; (ix) Judge Black recorded that the police service dog is trained to bite and hold suspects \"indefinitely,\" but the Defendants contend that \"indefinite\" is incorrect, because the dog is trained to stop biting when his handler calls him off; (x) Judge Black determined that the officers used the Tasers \"just\n   because [Nelson] was standing upright,\" but the Defendants argue that the Taser was \"used to gain compliance from [Nelson] so that he could be placed into custody\"; (xi) Judge Black wrote that after officers \"pried [Nelson's hand] from the fence, [Nelson] 'collapsed to the ground, and ceased to move,' \" but the Defendants rejoin there is no testimony that supports this \"opinion\" or a statement leading to \"a reasonable inference that Officer Limon made this statement\"; and (xii) Judge Black stated that \"the officers then carried Nelson's unconscious body to the Bearcat, leaving a trail of blood and urine,\" but the Defendants argue that \"[t]his statement is pure fiction,\" because \"there is no evidence that [Nelson] lost consciousness or that he was carried leaving a trail [of] blood and urine,\" and there was testimony that officers did not see him \"carried or taken back to\" the Bearcat. Motion to Alter 16-21 (quoting Black's Opinion at 2-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Fourth, the Defendants argue that Judge Black improperly weighed the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter at 21. The Defendants contend that, in addition to the inaccuracies and omissions as detailed above, Judge Black improperly weighed the evidence by conducting an \"imminent safety threat\" analysis, because that was an improper \"deadly force analysis.\" Motion to Alter at 22. Fifth, the Defendants argue that, even though rule 59(e) normally precludes reviving a previously-made-and-rejected argument, they were entitled to qualified immunity and the Court could have and should have considered it, because qualified immunity is an exception to rule 59(e).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter at 24 (citing\n   <em>\n    Quezada v. Cty. of Bernalillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524205\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/710/\">\n    944 F.2d 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1991) ). The Defendants contend that, because Judge Black noted in Black's Opinion that Nelson's expert had \"underwhelming credentials,\" Judge Black must have given \"no weight ... to his testimony.\" Motion to Alter at 25. From that premise, the Defendants argue that, because Judge Black precluded the Defendants' rule 50 qualified immunity motion on Nelson's expert's testimony, he committed clear error in Black's Opinion by not reversing himself on that finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter at 25. The Defendants further aver that, because Judge Black omitted and misrepresented material facts, he committed clear error by failing to evaluate whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, the \"Defendants committed a clearly established constitutional violation.\" Motion to Alter 25-26. The Defendants also argued that, even if the Defendants committed a constitutional violation, considering\n   <em>\n    Medina v. Cram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090884\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/1124/#p1132\">\n    252 F.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2001), a reasonable officer would have believed their conduct was lawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter at 26. Finally, turning to Nelson's state law claim, the Defendants argue that Nelson's claim failed, because \"the officers' actions were lawful and done in good faith.\" Motion to Alter at 26 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mead v. O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1959-NMSC-077\">\n    1959-NMSC-077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2847052\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/66/170/\">\n    66 N.M. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2847052\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/66/170/\">\n    344 P.2d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479-80 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     Nelson's Response to the Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend Judge Black's Judgment\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nelson responds to the Defendants' Motion to Alter Judgment, contending that rule 59(e) relief from Black's Opinion is inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Tony Nelson's Response to Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment Pursuant to Rule 59(e), or, Alternatively, Relief from Judgment Pursuant to Rule 60(b) [Doc. 173] at 1, filed May 25, 2012 (Doc. 178)(\"Motion to Alter Resp.\"). To summarize Nelson's position, he avers that Black's Opinion applied the appropriate standard, a district court is allowed to rule on a rule 50(b) motion even if it declined to grant a rule 50(a) (or a summary judgment motion), Judge Black did not mischaracterize or improperly weigh evidence, and the Defendants\n   do not have qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter Resp. at 4-20. First, Nelson argues that the Defendants' contention that, because Judge Black did not mention the standard of review in Black's opinion he must have applied the wrong standard of review, does not \"necessarily\" mean \"the Court in fact failed to [apply the correct standard].\" Motion to Alter Resp. at 5. Next, Nelson contests the Defendants' argument that, because Judge Black premised his Rule 50(a) denial on factual disputes, he must \"have exceeded [his] authority\" in ruling on the Rule 50(b) motion. Motion to Alter Resp. at 7. Nelson explains that, even if there are factual disputes, \"it does not follow that the Court must have therefore resolved questions of fact rather than legal questions\" as rule 50(b) allows Judge Black to decide legal questions. Motion to Alter Resp. at 7. Nelson further argues that the Defendants improperly attached \"additional supporting facts\" in their rule 59(e) motion, so Judge Black should, consequently, deny their motion. Motion to Alter Resp. at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Van Skiver v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867411\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/952/1241/#p1243\">\n    952 F.2d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1243 (10th Cir. 1991) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Nelson also contends that Judge Black considered only the appropriate facts and did not omit any material ones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter. Resp. 10-16. Regarding the Defendants' contention that Judge Black omitted facts about the \" 'potential' threat\" that Nelson posed, Nelson argues that there was no error, because the correct legal standard is immediate threat. Motion to Alter Resp. at 11. Nelson also notes the following facts that the Defendants failed to dispute: Nelson \"dropped his only weapon, the knife, after being commanded to do so\"; Nelson was \"clearly\" not holding the only other known weapon; Nelson did not hold any other weapons; Nelson was over twenty feet from officers; and the officers stood in tactically shielded positions. Motion to Alter Resp. at 12. Nelson further argues that Judge Black's statement that Nelson \"appeared intoxicated, disoriented, slow to react, and unable to maintain a straight line\" was \"accurate\" given certain testimony that Nelson spoke incoherently, he had been drinking, and had other observed intoxication behaviors. Motion to Alter Resp. at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nelson states that Judge Black also accurately determined that Nelson did not actively resist arrest or attempt to evade arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter Resp. at 14. Nelson argues that there was enough testimony for the Court to make a reasonable inference that officers shot at Nelson before he turned around to face the house.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter Resp. at 15. In support of that contention, Nelson cites Hughes' testimony that he \" 'immediately' deployed his weapon in response to Johnston's order,\" and that he did so when Nelson \" 'started' to turn around.\" Motion to Alter Resp. at 15. Nelson also argues that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that officers surrounded Nelson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter Resp. at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, Nelson argues that the Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter Resp. at 17-19. Nelson notes that the Tenth Circuit has determined that, under qualified immunity's clearly established prong, \"because excessive force jurisprudence requires an all-things-considered inquiry with careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case ... there will almost never be a previously published opinion involving exactly the same circumstances.\" Motion to Alter Resp. at 18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3327851\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1278/#p1286\">\n    509 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1284-85 ). Nelson concludes that, for all the reasons that Judge Black previously denied qualified immunity in Black's Opinion, qualified immunity is still inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Alter Resp. at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     Judge Black's Order Denying the Defendants' Motion to Alter\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On June 1, 2012, Judge Black denied the Defendants' Motion to Alter in a two-page order, before the Defendants could file a reply brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order at 1-2, filed June 1, 2012 (Doc. 179)(Black's First Order). After noting that the \"Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a specific 'motion to alter or amend judgment,' \" Judge Black determined that the relevant rule was rule 60(b)(1), because it provided relief for \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excludable neglect.\" Black's First Order at 1. Judge Black stated that rule 59 is inappropriate, because the Defendants filed their Motion to Alter at least ten days after judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's First Order at 1 n.1. He concluded that, notwithstanding the Defendants' contention that \"numerous facts ... were allegedly errant or overlooked,\" he considered those facts, he did not need to \"delve into irrelevant details,\" and rule 60 did not require him to use the Defendants' \"chosen rhetoric.\" Black's First Order at 2. Furthermore, Judge Black noted that he used the \"proper standard of review,\" granting all reasonable inferences in Defendants' favor based on the trial evidence. Black's First Order at 2. Accordingly, he denied the Defendants' Motion to Alter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's First Order at 2. In denying the Defendants' Motion to Alter, Judge Black did not specifically address qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's First Order at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    8.\n    <em>\n     The Defendants' Motion For Relief From Black's First Order\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On June 1, 2012, the Defendants filed a motion for relief, arguing that Judge Black erroneously determined that rule 60 was appropriate instead of rule 59.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Motion for Relief From Order Entered on 6/1/2012 [Doc. 179] Denying Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment Entered in Docs. 168, 169, and 171, or in the Alternative, Motion for Relief from Judgment or Order Entered in Docs 168, 169, and 171 at 1, filed June 1, 2012 (Doc. 180)(\"Mot. for Relief\"). The Defendants argue that Judge Black \"made a mistake\" when he determined that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides no rule that recognized a motion to alter or amend a judgment, citing rule 59(e). Mot. for Relief \u00b6 5, at 2. They also argue that, pursuant to a December 1, 2009 amendment, a party is entitled twenty-eight days to file a motion to alter or amend a judgment under rule 59(e), so Judge Black's determination that Rule 60 applied is inappropriate, because the Defendants had filed their motion within twenty-eight days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Relief \u00b6\u00b6 6-9, at 2.

They further argue that Nelson attempted to bait the officers to come to him while he was holding a knife, and this threat remained active after Nelson exited the house, because \"it was unknown if [Nelson] had any weapons on [ ]his person.\" Motion at 15.

Response at 11-13. Finally, Nelson argues that his delayed compliance could not be active resistance to arrest, Nelson's turn toward the house would not give rise to a reasonable belief that he was returning to the house, and, even if the turn indicates Nelson's intention to return to house, it did not justify a \"split-split second decision to deploy the beanbag shotguns,\" sending the dog, or firing the Tasers without first reassessing if such force was appropriate.

Turning to the case's facts, they emphasized that Nelson asserted during trial that \"he didn't remember the encounter,\" so the case turned on the officers' testimony. Tr. at 7:1-6 (Griffin). The Defendants further argued that Judge Black must have used the wrong \"deadly force\" standard in his opinion granting Nelson's rule 50(b) motion, because \"he said that there was no imminent threat that Mr. Nelson posed.\" Tr. 8:5-12 (Griffin). From that presumption, the Defendants contended that there is no evidence to conclude that the officers used deadly force, and, even if there were, the jury heard the deadly force instruction and still found for the Defendants, so the deadly force standard must be disregarded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:13-17 (Griffin).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Turning to qualified immunity, the Defendants maintained their position that there is no caselaw in the Tenth Circuit that would have put the Defendants on notice that they were using excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:18-23 (Griffin).

The Defendants argue that, \"given the circumstances,\" the Officers did not use deadly force and acted in good faith. Tr. at 9:17-21 (Griffin). The Defendants further argue that, even if the Court is inclined to believe the facts were not in Defendant's favor, it was a jury question, and the Court should defer to the jury's determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:12-18 (Griffin). Continuing in this vein, the Defendants argued that Judge Black stated that, regarding qualified immunity, there is a factual issue for the jury to decide, so that decision should not be taken out of the jury's hands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 11:8-9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:17-18 (Griffin).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court subsequently asked Nelson whether there is \"any procedural timeliness jurisdictional issues\" regarding the Defendants' rule 50(b) motion.

Nelson responded that, yes, there is a jurisdictional threshold issue,\n   because \"[o]n its face, Rule 50(b) is available basically to the party who loses at trial.\" Tr. at 12:24-25 (Hawk).

Tr. at 13:1-5 (Hawk). The Court responded by asking how that rule applied in this case and whether there was anything in the rules that prohibited it from hearing the qualified immunity argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:4-6 (Court). Nelson conceded that \"it is my understanding ... that qualified immunity can be raised at any time during the trial process even post trial.\" Tr. at 16:7-12 (Hawk). Nelson argued, however, that, nevertheless, the qualified immunity issue has already been litigated, and Judge Black has already denied it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:13-19 (Hawk). From that analysis, Nelson contended that the Defendants' Motion should be construed as nothing more than \"a motion to reconsider.\" Tr. at 16:21-22 (Hawk). Nelson then argued that, as a motion to reconsider, rule 59(e) governs, and Judge Black had already decided a 59(e) motion, so the Court should deny this Motion too.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:8-10 (Hawk). Nelson then concluded that the \"only issue before the Court today is the issue of qualified immunity.\" Tr. at 17:12-13 (Hawk).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court noted that \"normally what you would do with a motion to dismiss or summary judgment on qualified immunity is to ask the Court whether there is a triable issue on the constitutional [violation],\" but given the procedural posture that a jury trial had happened and Judge Black had ruled on Nelson's rule 50(b) motion, it asked if it \"den[ied] the motion and sa[id] there were triable issues, where does that leave [the parties].\" Tr. at 17:17-18:6 (Court). The Court expanded that it believed the Defendants' 50(b) motion was a request for the Court \"to go back to th[e] point [before it was submitted to the jury] and rule as to whether this was a triable issue or not.\" Tr. at 19:19-22 (Court). To that context and query, Nelson argued that the Defendants should have raised their motion \"within 28 days of the Court[ ] granting the Plaintiff's 50[ (b) ] motion,\" because the \"judgment on the merits in this case occurred on April 12th of 2012.\" Tr. at 19:12-20:3 (Hawk). He argued, accordingly, that the Motion is untimely. Tr. at 19:19-22 (Court). Nelson conceded, however, that the April 12, 2012, order \"was not a final judgment,\" but that the Motion was still \"untimely.\" Tr. at 20:6-10 (Hawk). Nelson averred his position again that the Defendants' Motion is \"really a motion to reconsider a previous decision,\" it should be viewed through the lens of rule 59(e), the issue has already been litigated, and Tenth Circuit courts prohibit using \"motions for reconsideration\" as vehicles for \"old issues already decided.\" Tr. at 20:23-21:14 (Hawk)(citing\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

A jury delivered a verdict for the Defendants. Nelson attacked that verdict via a rule 50(b) motion. Judge Black vacated the verdict and entered judgment as a matter of law, concluding that no reasonable juror could have found for the Defendants. The Defendants challenged Judge Black's determination under rule 59(e) and rule 60, but Judge Black did not alter or overrule his previous judgment. Now, the Court must rule on a second rule 50(b) motion-this one brought by the Defendants-which entails determining whether the Defendants' rule 50(b) motion may undo a judgment as a matter of law rendered by Judge Black. The Court determines that rule 50(b) is an improper vehicle for attacking Judge Black's previous ruling. However, the Court construes the Defendants' rule 50(b) motion as a second rule 59(e) motion, and grants the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In coming to this determination, the Court concludes that: (i) the Defendants' motion is timely, because they filed it within 28 days of final judgment; (ii) based on rule 50(b)'s text and purpose, a second rule 50(b) motion is not the correct vehicle to challenge prior rulings under rules 50(b), 59(e), and 60 on substantially the same issues; (iii) the Defendants did not adequately preserve their clearly established qualified immunity argument under rule 50(a) for the Court to consider it under rule 50(b) ; and (iv) construing the motion as a rule 59(e) motion, a reasonable juror could have found for the Defendants, and the Defendants are also entitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, the Court will alter the final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     THE DEFENDANTS' MOTION WAS TIMELY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Defendants' rule 50(b) motion was timely, because it occurred within twenty-eight days after entry of final judgment.

The Court concludes, accordingly, that \"judgment\" in rule 50(b) refers to \"final judgment,\" and the twenty-eight day time limit for the Defendants began on July 5, 2012, when Judge Black entered final judgment.

In their Motion, the Defendants advance many of the same arguments that they advanced previously before Judge Black, namely: (i) the trial evidence demonstrates that the officers\n   acted reasonably; (ii) clearly established law did not put the officers' on notice that their conduct would be unreasonable; and (iii) the officers are immune to state tort liability, because they acted lawfully and in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 14-20.

Although the procedural posture here is not always present-a second rule 50(b) motion by the party who lost the first rule 50(b) motion-the Court sees no reason why the normal rule 50(b) guideposts should vanish. Accordingly, the standard for ruling on a second rule 50(b) motion is similar to that for ruling on a rule 50(a) motion-whether there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could have found for the\n   <em>\n    non-moving\n   </em>\n   party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wagner v.

Drawing all inferences in Nelson's favor, the Court determines that a reasonable jury could have concluded that Nelson was unarmed, and that Nelson's turn back toward the house was not a motion to return to the home for more weapons, but was a motion to comply, belatedly, with the officers' command to turn around and get on the ground. Regarding whether Nelson was unarmed, it is undisputed that: (i) Nelson dropped the knife in the house;\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) the police sniper cleared Nelson's hands of weapons before Nelson stopped at the end of the driveway;\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iii) Johnston testified that \"it's kind of hard to hide a rifle\" in what Nelson was wearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although\n   the officers never cleared Nelson's waistband,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   drawing all inferences in his favor, the Court concludes a reasonable jury could determine that Nelson was unarmed, because the knife and the rifle were the only two weapons Patterson reported.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding Nelson's turn, Nelson complied, belatedly, with other commands,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   so, again, drawing all inferences in his favor, a reasonable jury could conclude that Nelson was complying, belatedly, to turn around and go to the ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   With these two inferences in mind, a reasonable jury could conclude that the officers used excessive force when they fired five beanbag shotgun shots and a wooden-baton round, released a police dog without warning, and cycled a Taser six times in thirty-seven seconds on an unarmed, drunken, sixty-two year old man, belatedly complying with officer's orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cavanaugh v.

For instance, they note that, although seventeen SWAT team members responded to the call, only \"four or five officers actually engaged [Nelson].\" Motion at 6. A reasonable jury, however, could still conclude that the officers used excessive force, because the \"four or five officers\" were armed, were protected by an armored vehicle, and outnumbered an unarmed sixty-two year old man. The Defendants also point to several instances where the officers subjectively perceived a threat from Nelson. For example, they note that \"Sergeant Johnston saw Plaintiff moving his hands around his waistband area which caused him concern,\" Motion at 7, and \"[Nelson] kept coming towards the officers instead of stopping where he was told; [Nelson] was closing the distance and thus compromising their safety,\" Motion to Alter at 11. Given the excessive force standard, a reasonable jury may discount these subjective concerns and subjective inferences\n   that the officers' safety was compromised, because the relevant inquiry is whether the officer's use of force was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , 490 U.S. at 398,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he subjective motivations of the individual officers ... has no bearing on whether a particular seizure is 'unreasonable' under the Fourth Amendment.\");\n   <em>\n    Cortez v.

For example, they characterize Nelson's struggle with the police dog as Nelson \"resist[ing]\" and acting \"non-compliant,\" Motion at 11, to officers' orders to \"let go of the fence,\" Motion to Alter at 13. Although undisputed that Nelson pulled up on the police dog and that Nelson did not let go of the fence immediately after commanded to do so, the Court does not need to infer under rule 50(b) that Nelson was \"resisting\" arrest or acting non-compliant, justifying the officers' Taser strike.

A reasonable jury, accordingly, deliberating over the facts that Nelson struggled with a police dog and did not let go of the fence as ordered, could conclude that a reasonable officer should perceive Nelson's actions as responding instinctively to fear and pain arising from a trained attack dog mauling his arm and not as actively resisting arrest. The Defendants also recount that \"Officer Hughes cycled his Taser in an attempt to gain compliance; however, [Nelson] continued to resist and move around,\" and that the \"Plaintiff was Tased six times in an effort to get him to let go of the fence and to stop fighting the dog.\" Motion at 11. For similar reasons, a reasonable jury could also disregard that characterization of \"resistance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   A reasonable jury could also determine that Tasing Nelson six times in an effort to make him let go of a fence constituted excessive force. \"[I]t is excessive to use a Taser to control a target without having any reason to believe that a lesser amount of force-or a verbal command-could not exact compliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3327851\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1278/#p1286\">\n    509 F.3d at 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

R. Civ. P. 50(b). The Court declines to direct judgment as a matter of law for the Defendants, because a reasonable jury could have found for Nelson. It also declines to order a new trial, because the Defendants have not asked for one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 31:19 (Griffin)(\"I'm not asking for a new trial.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Defendants urge the Court to order the final remedy-allow judgment on the jury verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 13-14; Tr. at 25:2-20 (Griffin). That remedy, however, in this circumstance, is inappropriate. The effect of \"allow[ing] judgment on the verdict\" would be to alter Judge Black's judgment as a matter of law for Nelson. Rule 50 affords the Court no appellate power to undo another District Judge's determination, or even the power to alter a previous determination made by that District Judge or the Court. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has explained, \"rule [50] serves two fundamental purposes: to enable the trial court to re-examine the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of law ... and to alert the opposing party to the insufficiency of his case before being submitted to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Delano-Pyle v.

To be sure, the Defendants' SJ Motion laid out the test for qualified immunity, specifically noting that \"in order for the law to be clearly established, there must be a Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit decision on point,\" Defendants' SJ Motion at 6-7, but their argument centers on whether there was a constitutional violation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defendants SJ Motion at 10-11, not the absence of Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court caselaw clearly establishing the right. Their conclusion in their qualified immunity analysis demonstrates that they failed to argue the clearly established element: \"[B]ased upon the totality of these circumstances, a reasonable amount of force was used by all of the defendant officers in this case and accordingly, they are each entitled to qualified immunity against Plaintiff's excessive force claim.\" Defendants SJ Motion at 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants' SJ Motion Reply similarly focuses on the officers' reasonableness, i.e., the underlying constitutional violation, not the clearly-established element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJ Motion Reply at 2-5. Although their summary judgment reply noted that \"there is no established legal precedent within the Tenth Circuit which holds that the use of a bean-bag shot-gun is deadly force,\" SJ Reply at 7, this sentence did not sufficiently preserve the argument, because it is specific to deadly force and it does not address the officers' conduct beyond the beanbag shotgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The Defendants' actions or lack thereof during their rule 50(a) motions at trial further supports the conclusion that the Defendants did not preserve or even argue the clearly established element. After the Defendants made their rule 50(a) motion at the close of Nelson's case-in-chief, Judge Black ruled from the bench: \"I find that there's a factual dispute as to that, so I will deny that at this time.\" Trial Tr. at 720:22-23 (Court). Instead of correcting Judge Black that they were also arguing a purely legal issue, the Defendants continued to argue about the evidence at trial until Judge Black cut them off, and they moved on to another motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 720:24-722:25 (Court, Griffin). Similarly, at the close of their case-in-chief, the Defendants again argued qualified immunity, and again Judge Black denied it based on \"the interpretation of the facts that the experts used.\" Rule 50 Tr. at 3:13-14 (Court). The Defendants still did not correct Judge Black that they were making a purely legal argument as well. Rule 50 Tr. at 3:13-20 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Accordingly, the Defendants' rule 50(a) motions incorporating their Summary Judgment Motion did not adequately preserve qualified immunity's clearly established element. The Court therefore denies their rule 50(b) motion concerning that purely legal issue.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blissett v.

Trial Tr. at 342:24-343:2 (Hughes). The facts further illustrate that a reasonable jury could have concluded that the force employed was reasonable. After the police dog latched onto Nelson's left arm and Nelson clutched the fence with his right, Limon and Hughes approached Nelson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 362:8-11 (Hughes). As they approached, one of the officers gave Nelson several commands to \"let go of the fence.\" Trial Tr. at 364:15-25 (Hughes). Officer Limon then fired his Taser at Nelson. 363:16-17 (Hughes). Limon's Taser, however, appeared ineffective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 364:8-9 (Hughes)(\"[Nelson] didn't look like-he looked like he was being Tased.\"). Hughes then fired his own Taser from ten feet away from Nelson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 365:11-12 (Hughes). He testified that Nelson was moving \"a great deal\" as he deployed his Taser, and that Nelson was not complying with an order to let go of the fence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 364:21-25 (Griffin, Hughes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 366:23-25 (Griffin, Hughes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 368:6-7 (Hughes). Hughes subsequently cycled the Taser six times over thirty-seven seconds, in part because Nelson \"was still holding onto the fence and appeared to be fighting with the dog\" and also in part to put Nelson in a position that would decrease the likelihood Nelson could \"stage an attack\" against officers \"or run away again.\" Trial Tr. 369:3-370:13 (Hughes). Hughes' Taser also appeared to have little effect on Nelson, because he continued to move and \"pull away from the dog\" even while Hughes cycled his Taser.

Although Nelson's arms were occupied, a reasonable jury could still conclude that Nelson posed an immediate threat if he had a weapon on him and there was reasonable possibility that one arm could break free. With Nelson struggling against the dog, it is reasonable to infer that, in the moment, he could have escaped from the dog or he could have gained enough leverage to liberate his right hand from the fence to reach for a weapon. There was also evidence that Nelson continued to resist the officers. For example, the officers gave Nelson verbal commands to let go of the fence so they could safely arrest him, but Nelson did not comply with those commands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 364:15-25 (Griffin, Hughes);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 368:6-7 (Hughes).

It seems ironic that the federal courts would restrict a congressionally mandated remedy for constitutional violations-presumably the rights of innocent people-and discourage case law development on the civil side-and restrict case law development to motions to suppress, which reward only the guilty and is a judicially created, rather than legislatively created, remedy. Commentators have noted that, \"[o]ver the past three decades, the Supreme Court has drastically limited the availability of remedies for constitutional violations in\" exclusionary rule litigation in a criminal case, habeas corpus challenges, and civil litigation under \u00a7 1983.

Rather than being a poor or discouraged means of developing constitutional law, \u00a7 1983 seems the better and preferable alternative to a motion to suppress. It is interesting that the current Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit appear more willing to suppress evidence and let criminal defendants go free, than have police pay damages for violations of innocent citizens' civil rights. It is odd that the Supreme Court has not adopted a clearly established prong for suppression claims; it seems strange to punish society for police violating unclear law in criminal cases, but protect municipalities from damages in \u00a7 1983 cases.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-260\">\n    <em>\n     Kerns v.

First, the Defendants have pointed toward no new controlling authority in their Motion concerning whether the officers' actions were reasonable. In the Defendants' Motion, they argue that the officers' actions were reasonable under\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    -the same binding precedent that Judge Black used to determine judgment as a matter of law in Nelson's favor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion at 17-18; Black's Opinion 5-12.

There is insufficient evidence for the Court to draw the inference that Nelson was returning to the house to re-arm himself. There is no evidence bearing on Nelson's state of mind, and the Court concludes that Nelson's act of dropping the knife before emerging from the house forecloses an inference that Nelson intended, at that time, to return home to arm himself with weapons he had voluntarily dropped earlier. Furthermore, given Nelson's otherwise erratic behavior, a step towards the house, without more, is not enough evidence to draw an inference that a reasonable officer would believe that Nelson was returning to the house for more weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-340\">\n    The Court concludes, however, a reasonable jury could infer that Nelson was continuing to disregard orders or could have been attempting to flee. There is testimony that Nelson was looking around in what officers perceived as \"target glances\" or glances where Nelson may have been looking an escape route.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. at 100:10-19 (Brown, Griffin);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 259:17 (Johnston). Although a razor wire fence surrounded the house and there was no ingress or egress except for the driveway, this fact is insufficient to preclude a reasonable inference that Nelson might have continued to disregard officers' orders or attempted to flee. Nelson might have known of another means of escape or simply may have fled to lock himself in the house. At that time, a reasonable officer might believe that Nelson intended armed himself with more weapons. One step, or even a couple of steps, in the direction of the house, alone, however, is insufficient for the Court to draw the inference.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"42\">\n   <p id=\"p-341\">\n    The Court notes that, in granting judgment as a matter of law, Judge Black determined \"[t]he jury may have been confused by the disorganized presentation of Plaintiff's case, and the underwhelming credentials of Plaintiff's expert.\" Black's Opinion at 2. Judge Black was present at the trial, and, unlike the Court, had the opportunity to hear the witnesses firsthand. The Court only alters Judge Black's judgment, because binding Tenth Circuit caselaw dictates a different outcome. Indeed, the Court notes that Judge Black, on highly similar facts, denied summary judgment in Nelson's favor, which used the same standard that he used later to grant judgment as a matter of law in Nelson's favor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SJ opinion at 1-6. Some of the facts of this case, however, trouble the Court. In concluding that a reasonable juror could have found for the Defendants, the Court is particularly sensitive to the fact that Nelson was Tased six times over thirty-seven seconds, while a trained dog mauled his left arm and his right arm clutched a fence. The appropriate standard requires the Court to judge the officers \"from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight,\"\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    , 490 U.S. at 396,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"485\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n     109 S.Ct. 1865\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , but even with that standard in mind, shocking a sixty-two year old man six independent times, while he clearly has no weapons in his hands, and after he has been hit by beanbag rounds, wooden-baton rounds, and a dog, supports a jury finding of excessive force. The Court concludes otherwise, however, because binding precedent dictates that a reasonable juror could come to a different outcome, and the Court is wary of appropriating the jury's power to deliver a verdict, unless precedent clearly indicates it must do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"43\">\n   <p id=\"p-342\">\n    In the following analysis, the Court considers only the clearly established prong.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"44\">\n   <p id=\"p-343\">\n    While the Court disagrees with Judge Black and concludes that a reasonable jury could have found for the Defendants, the Court shares Judge Black's conclusion that, absent controlling Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit, the law should be clearly established in this case. As former Tenth Circuit judge, and now Stanford law school professor, Michael McConnell, has pointed out, much of what lower courts do is read the implicit, unwritten signs that the superior courts send them through their opinions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Michael W. McConnell, Address at the Oliver Seth American Inn of Court: How Does the Supreme Court Communicate Its Intentions to the Lower Courts: Holdings, Hints and Missed Signals (Dec. 17, 2014). If a district court in New Mexico is trying-as it does diligently and faithfully-to receive and read the unwritten signs of its superior courts, it would appear that the Supreme Court has signaled through its per curiam qualified immunity reversals that a nigh identical case must exist for the law to be clearly established.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 1108. Although still stating that there might be an obvious case under\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    that would make the law clearly established without a Supreme Court or Circuit Court case on point,\n    <em>\n     White v.

Board of County Comm'rs for County of Dona Ana\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=707%20Fed.%20Appx.%20552\">\n     707 Fed.Appx. 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 555-56,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"488\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203951706\">\n     2017 WL 3951706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (10th Cir. Sept. 8, 2017) (unpublished).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-344\">\n    But factually identical or highly similar factual cases are not the way the real world works. Cases differ. Many cases, such as this one, have so many facts that are unlikely to ever occur again in a significantly similar way. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has crafted their recent qualified immunity jurisprudence to effectively eliminate \u00a7 1983 claims by requiring an indistinguishable case and by encouraging courts to go straight to the clearly established prong.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Saenz v. Lovington Mun. Sch. Dist.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360913\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/105/1271/\">\n     105 F.Supp.3d 1271\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1297 n.4 (D.N.M. 2015) (Browning, J.).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-345\">\n    The Court disagrees with that approach. The most conservative, principled decision is to minimize the expansion of the judicially created clearly established prong, so that it does not eclipse the congressionally enacted \u00a7 1983 remedy. The judiciary should be true to \u00a7 1983 as Congress wrote it. Moreover, in a day when police shootings and excessive force cases are in the news, there should be a remedy when there is a constitutional violation, and jury trials are the most democratic expression of what police action is reasonable and what action is excessive. If the citizens of New Mexico decided that the Defendants used excessive force, the verdict should stand, not set aside because the parties could not find an indistinguishable Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court decision. Finally, to always decide the clearly established prong first and then to always say that the law is not clearly established could be stunting the development of constitutional law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Aaron L.
