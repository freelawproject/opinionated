Plaintiffs Edgar Soto, Jr., Flora Soto, and Edgar Soto, Sr. asserted excessive force and due process claims against the City of New York and Police Officers Brian Santiago, Angel Torres, and Augustin Melendez pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as state law claims for assault, battery, and loss of consortium. After a two-week jury trial, Plaintiffs moved for partial judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, arguing that the shots fired by Officer Santiago during the incident in question constituted \"textbook excessive force.\" The Court denied the motion with leave to renew. The case was submitted to the jury, which found for Defendants on all claims. Plaintiffs now renew their motion for partial judgment as a matter of law. For the reasons that follow, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 7, 2012, Officers Santiago and Torres responded to a call from dispatch regarding a family dispute with a knife at 408 East 65th Street in Manhattan.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendants, the following narrative emerges. Officers Santiago and Torres arrive at an apartment building in response to a radio call regarding a family dispute with a knife. They encounter Officer Cocianga, whose service weapon is drawn. Officer Cocianga is shouting at Edgar Soto, Jr., commanding him to drop the steak knife that he is holding. Officers Santiago and Torres proceed to the sixth floor, where they are standing about thirteen feet from Edgar, who is pointing the knife in their direction, and Edgar's mother, Flora Soto. Edgar threatens to stab the officers if they get any closer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sergeant McLaughlin arrives and takes Officer Santiago's position on the sixth floor. Officer Santiago moves down to the stairway between the fifth and sixth floors, where he can see Edgar, but not Flora, Sergeant McLaughlin, or Officer Torres. Edgar is yelling and cursing at the officers. The officers continue to plead with him to drop the knife, but he refuses to do so. The mood is tense and the space is confined. Sergeant McLaughlin, in an attempt to subdue Edgar without using deadly force, discharges a taser. The taser is ineffective, and Edgar reacts angrily, suddenly charging in the direction of Flora, Sergeant McLaughlin, and Officer Torres. When Edgar charges, he momentarily leaves Officer Santiago's field of vision. Officer Torres fires, and Edgar immediately steps backwards, apparently uninjured and still holding the knife. Officer Santiago fires, and Edgar falls to the floor. All of the shooting takes place within a few seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This narrative is strikingly similar to the facts of\n   <em>\n    City and County of San Francisco v.

Pls.' Mem. at 13-14. However, the jury in this case could have reasonably concluded that the circumstances were not materially different, or at least that a reasonable officer would not have perceived them to be so. Even though Officer Santiago could not see Flora or Sergeant McLaughlin and Officer Torres from the stairway, he knew that Edgar was charging in their direction. He was thus able to appreciate that Edgar's charge posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to Flora and his fellow officers. As Plaintiffs' counsel emphasized on multiple occasions during summation, all of the shots were fired within a very short period of time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 1615:1-5, 1630:22-23. In light of this, and the fact that Officer Santiago testified that Edgar was still holding the knife and appeared to be uninjured when he came back into view, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the danger that justified Officer Torres's use of deadly force had not meaningfully abated by the time that Officer Santiago fired his weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The cases cited by Plaintiffs do not convince the Court otherwise.
