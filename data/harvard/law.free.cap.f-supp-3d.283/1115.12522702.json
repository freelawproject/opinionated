Ultimately, the court finds that where an officer must rely on subjective considerations to justify the search of a vehicle, the Fourth Amendment's protections are thwarted. On a number of grounds, the court concludes that the traffic stop and search in this case violated the Fourth Amendment and, therefore, the court suppresses the evidence resulting from the illegal investigatory detention and search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    A. Traffic Stop\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of October 15, 2016, Utah Highway Patrol (UHP) Trooper Jason Tripodi was on duty in Wasatch and Summit Counties in Utah. (Evidentiary Hr'g Tr. (\"Tr.\") 6:17-7:15, ECF No. 40.) As a member of UHP's criminal interdiction team, Trooper Tripodi was patrolling for traffic and safety violations and other criminal activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:1-3, 7:20-24, 38:20-39:7.) At some point, Trooper Tripodi parked in the median of I-80 around milepost 148 or 149 facing west and monitoring eastbound traffic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:2-20.) At approximately 8:44 a.m., Trooper Tripodi observed a silver Ford pickup truck traveling eastbound. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:25-8:3.) When the pickup passed, he noticed that the driver appeared \"hidden behind the door pillar, almost leaned back,\" so that he could only see the driver's arms \"locked in the ten and two position,\" as on a clock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:5-11.) This caught Trooper Tripodi's attention \"because the driver had no visibility out the side windows, and usually that's a safety issue,\" as well as \"a sign that you're trying to either hide from something or, you know just hide from someone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:19-24.) Trooper Tripodi acknowledged that the positioning was not illegal and that people of different sizes assume different positions in vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:24-41:25.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trooper Tripodi also noticed that the pickup had a California license plate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605100\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/1/#p7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605100\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/1/#p7\">\n    at 42:7-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605100\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/1/#p7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605100\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/1/#p7\">\n    at 15:20-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) He testified that officers target areas where drugs may be sourced and \"take more interest\" in \"high-probability areas\" like California, Nevada, and Arizona. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:4-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on these observations, Trooper Tripodi exited the median and began following the pickup. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:23-10:2, 42:1-10.) The dash camera video shows the silver pickup driving in the right lane on the two-lane divided highway, with Trooper Tripodi following farther behind in the passing lane. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dash Camera Video (\"Dash Cam.\") 8:44:17, Gov't Ex. 1; Tr. 12:15-25.) Trooper Tripodi did not observe any unsafe driving at this time. (Tr. 44:23-45:1, 51:12-20.) Farther ahead, an emergency police vehicle with flashing lights had pulled another vehicle to the side of the highway. (Dash Cam. 8:44:20-40; Tr. 13:9.) The pickup truck, still several car lengths ahead of Trooper Tripodi, signaled for at least two seconds and changed lanes into the left lane, providing more space to the emergency vehicle. (Dash Cam. 8:44:20-33; Tr. 10:12-16, 13:3-7.) Trooper Tripodi observed that this lane change complied with traffic law. (Tr. 46:25-47:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At this point, Trooper Tripodi accelerated from about 68 mph to 77 mph, closing the distance between his vehicle and the pickup, though he believed he maintained a safe following distance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dash Cam. 8:44:27-43; Tr. 50:11-16, 73:14-19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After passing the emergency vehicle on the side of the road, the pickup signaled again and moved back into the right lane. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dash Cam. 8:44:27-49.) This time, Trooper Tripodi thought the pickup did not signal for a full two seconds prior to moving lanes,\n   which is a traffic infraction under Utah law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:44:43-8:45:12; Tr. 11:1-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trooper Tripodi pulled behind the pickup, activated his lights, and initiated a traffic stop. (Dash Cam. 8:45:12-46; Tr. 14:4-24.) While the pickup yielded to the emergency lights, Trooper Tripodi radioed the stop and the license plate number to dispatch. (Dash Cam. 8:45:28-43; Tr. 15:1-5, 57:6-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the vehicles came to a stop on the side of the highway, Trooper Tripodi approached the pickup on the passenger side and observed that the truck bed was covered. (Dash Cam. 8:45:58-46:04; Tr. 15:9-12.) He saw the pickup had two male occupants, and the passenger appeared to be waking up. (Tr. 15:12-15.) He also noticed some dress shirts hanging in the back, along with luggage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:16-19.) He would later identify Jerry Siaki Esteban as the driver and Phillip Uigaese Taueetia as the passenger. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605100\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/1/#p7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605100\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/1/#p7\">\n    at 33:2-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Arriving at the passenger window, Trooper Tripodi introduced himself and apologized for waking the passenger. (Dash Cam. 8:46:04-09.) He told the occupants that the reason for the stop was the failure to signal for two seconds before changing lanes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:46:10-15.) Trooper Tripodi thanked Mr. Esteban for doing so during the first lane change, but advised that he needed to have signaled longer during the second lane change. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:46:16-24.) He requested Mr. Esteban's license, registration, and proof of insurance, and then said: \"I'm not going to cite you for [the violation], we just need to document all of our stops.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:46:25-234; Tr. 16:14-18, 17:4-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Trooper Tripodi continued to engage in conversation with the men while Mr. Esteban retrieved his documents. Trooper Tripodi asked if they were taking shifts driving and where they were headed, to which they responded St. Paul, Minnesota. (Dash Cam. 8:46:39-47:01; Tr. 17:12-14.) The passenger then asked whether or when would it start snowing, a question that Trooper Tripodi found odd because it was a \"shift in the topic of discussion\" and an \"odd first thought\" upon waking up. (Tr. 17:20-18:7.) Trooper Tripodi spent the next minute attempting to convince Mr. Esteban to return to his vehicle to speak with him while he filled out his paperwork. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:8-12; Dash Cam. 8:47:32-48:37.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Esteban ultimately declined. (Tr. 18:13-15, 19:10-25.) Trooper Tripodi admitted that asking a driver back to his\n   police car while a passenger remains in the stopped vehicle is not the safest way to conduct a stop, and is not related to the stop, but is \"the best way to get more information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:1-8, 77:17-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Trooper Tripodi returned to his vehicle and pulled up the \"Citation Report\" on his computer, which he uses to document every stop made, including those where only a warning is given. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:18-24.) He also immediately opened a chat system to ask UHP Trooper Kade Loveland to assist him on the scene while he filled out the citation report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:8-14, 21:7-9.) Trooper Tripodi testified that he had his \"initial suspicions\" of the men based on \"their behavior in the vehicle, the way that they were taking shifts and driving straight through, the hesitations to answer certain questions, like would you be okay returning to my vehicle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:10-23.) Trooper Tripodi also noted that the passenger was doing most of the talking, when usually he converses only with drivers during traffic stops, and that the passenger changed the topic of conversation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:24-21:4, 79:3-25, 85:24-86:13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trooper Tripodi and Trooper Loveland regularly work together, and Tripodi knew that Loveland was just a few miles down the road. (Tr. 22:7-14.) Trooper Loveland is a certified narcotics detection dog handler. (Tr. 88:4-10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 12.) Starting at 8:49 a.m., just after Trooper Tripodi had returned to his vehicle, the troopers had the following exchange on chat:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-20\">jtripodi yoo kloveland need 78<sup>6</sup> jtripodi si, if youre not on anything good kloveland cleared now jtripodi just from the window have some suspicions, doesnt want to come talk kloveland occupants in the car? jtripodi 2 kloveland copy</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the reference for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Gov't Ex. 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 22:2-23:21, 59:23-24.) The entire exchange lasted a little less than a minute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 2 (showing timestamps from 14:49:01-14:49:50 GMT).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Trooper Tripodi continued filling out the citation report while waiting for Trooper Loveland to arrive. (Tr. 23:25-24:1.) Regarding documentation, Trooper Tripodi testified that his unit supervisor trained them to document every stop, even when an officer does not intend to cite a person, so that there is \"a paper trail\" leading back to the stop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:5-15, 53:20-54:2, 55:10-14, 71:14-72:9.) He acknowledged that no written department policy required documentation of every stop, and that an officer is authorized to give a verbal warning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:3-57:5.) But he testified that he only gives verbal warnings in \"less than one percent\" of cases and usually when there is some other emergency\n   for which he is called away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:20-71:8, 72:10-15.) Trooper Tripodi estimated that it takes him an average of five to seven minutes to complete a citation report. (Tr. 27:5-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After Trooper Loveland appeared on the scene a few minutes later, and while still completing the citation report, Trooper Tripodi called dispatch for records checks on Mr. Esteban's license validity, wants and warrants, and a \"Triple I\" check for his criminal history. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:10-23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dash Cam. 8:52:32-48.) The Triple I check generally takes longer than the license and warrants checks, and Trooper Tripodi admitted that it was not related to documenting the stop, but that it was for \"officer safety issues and also for other means as well.\" (Tr. 58:11-59:18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When Trooper Loveland appeared, he immediately proceeded with the canine sniff without further communication with Trooper Tripodi. (Tr. 95:18-96:2, 107:1-5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dash Cam. 8:51:57-53:20.) Trooper Loveland and Drago, his certified narcotics detection dog, started at the tailgate. (Tr. 98:12-13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dash Cam. 8:53:20-22.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trooper Loveland and Drago do several laps around the pickup, for a total of about two minutes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dash Cam. 8:53:22-55:31.) On the first passes, Trooper Loveland testified that Drago moved quickly around the vehicle to the tailgate again, where he stopped and did a \"head check,\" i.e., changed directions and kept investigating, then continued to move around the vehicle and investigate the tailgate intensely, including almost squatting at the tailgate a few times. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 98:25-99:7, 109:20-111:4; Dash Cam. 8:53:22-54:01.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   During these passes, Trooper Loveland saw \"alerts,\" or the dog's natural change in behavior. (Tr. 100:4-11.) On the next passes, Trooper Loveland pointed to various places on the vehicle, focusing on the seams where odor could exit the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100:14-21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dash Cam 8:54:02-57.) After multiple passes around the pickup, Trooper Loveland then brought Drago back to the tailgate and detailed the high seam of the tailgate, which he hadn't previously, because Drago \"had alerted\" there before. (Tr. 100:25-101:4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dash Cam. 8:55:00-30.) Trooper Loveland testified that, at that point, Drago \"show[ed] a final indication by freezing and staring at the [passenger side] seam.\" (Tr. 101:6-9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trooper Loveland also conceded, however, that Drago did not give his \"final trained response,\" which is to freeze/stop, stare, and sit. (Tr. 101:9-13, 112:1-8, 113:3-23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On the way back to his vehicle, Trooper Loveland informed Trooper Tripodi that Drago was indicating on the pickup's tailgate. (Tr. 29:4-7; Dash Cam. 8:55:34-37.) Trooper Tripodi testified that he was finishing up the citation report at that time, though he did not believe it was complete because he had not yet printed it to give to Mr. Esteban. (Tr. 28:25-29:2, 38:10-14.) Based on Drago's indication, Trooper Tripodi decided to search the pickup. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:24-25, 30:21-23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to starting the search, Trooper Tripodi went to retrieve the passenger's identification in order to identify and run records checks on him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:14-30:23, 37:13-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Returning a couple minutes later without Drago, Trooper Loveland explained the dog's indication to Trooper Tripodi, stating that Drago \"alerted\" on the tailgate and \"squatted like he was gonna sit,\" but that \"it was weird because he wouldn't sit.\" (Dash Cam. 8:56:49-57; Tr. 113:8-23.) Trooper Tripodi did not know why Drago did not sit, but speculated that Drago was \"fringing the odor,\" meaning that he was on the edge of the scent, and that he could not leave it. (Dash Cam. 8:56:57-57:06; Tr. 116:2-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The officers removed Mr. Esteban and Mr. Tauteeia from the pickup, and started the search at the rear of the vehicle, where Drago had indicated. (Tr. 31:20-33:1.) They located approximately two pounds of methamphetamine in the tailgate and arrested both men. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:6-10, 37:4-6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 3-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In total, approximately ten minutes passed from the pickup's stop on the side of the road to when Trooper Loveland informed Trooper Tripodi of the canine indication and Tripodi determined to search the vehicle. (Dash Cam. 8:45:45-55:35.) Trooper Tripodi testified that his traffic stops generally last ten to fifteen minutes on average. (Tr. 27:1-3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    B. Canine Sniffs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1. Training and Certification\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants called Dr. Lawrence Myers to testify about the behavioral science on reliable canine training, both generally and as applied to this case. Dr. Myers is a veterinarian and has a M.S. in Zoology, specializing in animal behavior and sensory function, and a PhD in neurophysiology. (Tr. 145:21-25.) He studied canine behavior and training as a professor at Auburn University for 33 years and founded the Institute for Biological Detection Systems there in 1989. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146:1-25, 162:2-7.) Many law enforcement agencies have enlisted his assistance for their canine training programs, including the military police, FBI, Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs, and the FAA, as well as many state and local groups, including the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Connecticut State Police, and New York City Police Department Bomb Squad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   147:17-148:13.) Though he has consulted for these agencies, he has never implemented or been in charge of a dog training program himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 161:8-16.) He has testified in court about fifty times, once or twice for the prosecution and the remainder for the defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160:13-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dr. Myers affirmed that there is no universally accepted way to properly train a canine to accurately detect odors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148:17-149:2.) There are, however, three foundational principals that behavioral science would require be applied in any canine testing and certification to ensure its reliability: repeated, double-blind, and randomized testing. (Tr. 149:3-15, 165:18-166:7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this context, \"randomized\" means placement of a hide in a location selected by a random number generator rather than a human decisionmaker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 149:18-150:4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, Dr. Myers worked with an explosive-detecting canine program where the canines would reliably search the wheel wells of cars because that was an easy place for testers to hide the target, and so the training was not properly randomized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150:6-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to double-blind testing, Dr. Myers noted that single-blind (or blinded) testing-where the observer or evaluator is present in the training and knows where the hide is located-reduces confidence in the reliability of the search because the observer can give off subtle cues to both the canine and the handler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153:19-154:9, 156:24-157:1.) Dr. Myers discussed a 2011 study at U.C. Davis where certified narcotics and explosives-detecting canine-handler teams were brought to an area where no narcotics or explosives had ever been present (a brand new building). The researchers hinted to the handlers that narcotics and explosives were present, and found that about 85% of the canine runs produced one or more false alerts, where the canine showed a final trained response to its handler though no target odors were present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154:14-156:5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Myers noted that cuing by a handler or observer is not usually intentional or conscious, but that canines pay attention to their environments as well as their handler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154:5-7, 156:11-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In rebuttal, the government called Sargent Wendell Nope to testify about the Utah Department of Public Safety POST canine training program and his opinion on Drago's indication in this case. Sgt. Nope has been running POST's canine training and certification program in Utah for 27 years and has directly trained or supervised the training of nearly 4,000 police dogs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173:17-14:8, 180:7-10.) He started out as a canine handler and trainer, handling seven dogs personally, and qualifies as a police dog teaching judge, the highest level of certification in the police dog industry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180:2-7.) The POST program was initiated to establish reasonable, competent, and consistent canine training in various disciplines (narcotics, explosives, patrol, etc.) around the state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174:16-22.) The program uses reality-based training to imitate the circumstances canines face when deployed, and attempts to bring canines to a trained and certified reliable state in \"the most efficient manner possible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175:7-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The POST training program has been used by some of the states surrounding Utah as well as the U.S. Secret Service and Navy, the Iraqi police, and the South Korean government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178:7-179:7.) Sgt. Nope believes that about one-fourth of the police dogs in the United States are trained either identically or similarly to Utah's POST program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 186:15-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Sgt. Nope testified that POST uses single-blind testing for all detector dogs because it \"works best\" to achieve POST's \"goal and objectives.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175:23-24.) He acknowledged that double-blind testing \"is a wonderful way of determining credibility and reliability of a dog, but it does not offer the trainer or the administrator the ability to evaluate in a graded fashion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176:5-9.) Sgt. Nope stated that the evaluator must know where the hide is located to assess the skills of a dog on a graded scale, particularly during the initial training period, and that POST goes to \"great lengths\" to train evaluators not to present \"even subtle ideas or clues or cues to the dog or the handler.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177:2-25.) But when asked why the evaluator could not simply view a test by video, so that the evaluator was not physically present during the test, Sgt. Nope replied that they had tried such a process and found that it was \"tedious\" and \"would not allow us to accomplish what we are required to within a given time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 188:25-189:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   2. Final Trained Response\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Regarding the final trained response, Dr. Myers testified that a properly trained canine communicates the detection of a specific odor to the handler only through the final trained response. (Tr. 150:20-8.) The final trained response is necessary to take the subjectivity of the handler out of the equation, Dr. Myers opined, because a canine can be interested in any number of odors and display essentially the same behaviors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 151:14-23.) The final trained response can be changed intentionally or can fade if not continuously reinforced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168:23-169:4.) A properly trained canine who demonstrates a final trained response will be reliable to about the percentage shown by repeated testing, i.e., a canine that is 90% accurate in detecting narcotics would support a 90% probability that narcotics are or were present where the canine demonstrated the final trained response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152:22-153:12.) But if the canine shows no final trained response, \"you can't tell anything. You may suspect, but you can't tell anything. The dog has not communicated to you that in fact the odor it is trained to find is present.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 157:2-7.) Dr. Myers puts no confidence in a canine's behavior if it does not show a final trained response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 157:8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based solely on his review of the video of the canine sniff in this case, Dr. Myers found \"no value ... whatsoever\" in the indications Drago displayed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 157:21-158:3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Myers explained that Trooper Loveland may have suspected, but, from a training and scientific perspective, Drago's behavior was not reliable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158:4-11.) Dr. Myers agreed that, depending on how a dog is trained, the dog may have a tendency to \"linger\" with the odor, but contended that a properly trained dog smelling the target odor will exhibit the final trained response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 171:13-172:9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In contrast, Sgt. Nope believes, based on his experience, that the final trained response is just one way a canine may indicate to a handler that he has \"truly found\" the target odor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180:21-181:12.) Viewing the sniff in this case, Sgt. Nope described Drago's performance as \"a\n   reasonably skillful initial sniffing of the vehicle itself\" and confirmed that Drago exhibited \"two of the three elements associated with the trained final response.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180:17-20, 183:9-15.) Sgt. Nope did not believe that Trooper Loveland exhibited any subtle cuing behavior, but acknowledged that he did not have sufficient prior experience with Loveland to know of his typical behavior with Drago. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 203:6-204:11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Sgt. Nope discussed how Malinois, Drago's breed, are \"highly driven\" to not only detect a target odor, but to locate its source. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182:17-183:5.) In fact, a dog may be \"attempting to get to the source of the odor,\" or strongest part of the odor, when they fail to show the final trained response, but Sgt. Nope opined that such behavior still reliable because the dog has become more targeted and \"because the dog is doing its job. It's trying to find the odor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 181:13-182:9, 183:16-184:17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Sgt. Nope has developed an \"alert matrix\" with nine behaviors that may indicate the canine has detected the target odor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184:18-25.) These behaviors include \"a physical transition from general sweeping behavior to a targeted, more focused area\"; increased intensity of search; changed breathing from general sniffing to deep inhalation; hesitation to leave a spot; changes in physical characteristics, like the ears going forward, the tail coming up and wagging, and increased physical energy generally; and the disregard of distractions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 193:1-194:12.) He explained that if a canine exhibits \"several\" of these behaviors in a \"profound manner,\" they can indicate to the handler that the dog has detected a target odor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 195:9-12.) When asked how many behaviors must be present and at what intensity, Sgt. Nope acknowledged that even the presence of one behavior could be sufficient, so long as it was \"so profound as to be without reasonable question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 201:9-202:8.) When asked why, then, train canines to exhibit a \"final trained response,\" Sgt. Nope explained that the final trained response is like a \"home run where there is no question that the dog has performed appropriately\" and is the \"optimal display of success.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 195:17-20, 196:7-10.) In fact, Sgt. Nope conceded that POST would not certify a canine that could not consistently show a final trained response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192:15-17.) But Sgt. Nope believes that he has personally observed when a canine is sensing narcotics, as opposed to something else, through the canine behaviors he has identified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 197:16-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For his part, Trooper Loveland believes he can tell when Drago is sensing the odor of narcotics rather than, for example, food or dead animals, by observing the \"intensity\" of his behaviors as well, even if Drago does not give his final trained response. (Tr. 116:16-118:23.) Trooper Loveland noted that Drago is \"trained to sit, but he can't always sit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112:14.) Defense counsel submitted video of three other traffic stops where Drago was deployed to conduct a sniff of the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 3.) The video shows Drago executing his final trained response during one stop and then \"indicating\" during another stop. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605100\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/1/#p7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Tr. 120:6-121:13.) In the final stop, Drago again \"indicates\" and Trooper Loveland immediately throws him a tug toy as a reward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122:24-124:23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel also presented five training\n   or deployment logs in the days before and after this stop showing that Drago indicated to the presence of drugs when none were found, often with no explanation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605100\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/1/#p7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605100\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/1/#p7\">\n    at 125:5-135:7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) An additional training log from May 2017, about seven months after the stop, showed Trooper Loveland continuing to work on building Drago's \"final indication\" in the presence of a narcotics hide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125:11-127:8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trooper Loveland testified that he believes Drago is reliable because \"he's right more often than not,\" and that Drago does not indicate on the majority of roadside sniffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138:16-139:14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Throughout the hearing, the terms \"alert,\" \"indication,\" \"final indication\" and \"final trained response\" were often used interchangeably and without distinguishing between them. Trooper Loveland confirmed that \"indication\" and \"final trained response\" are equivalent in his mind. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121:14-20, 122:17-21.) When pressed on how an indication can substitute for a final trained response, Trooper Loveland explained that it may be \"the best indication he can give me at the time,\" based on the circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121:24-125:3.) An exchange between Trooper Loveland and the court is revealing on this issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: Tell me how many different ways that you believe [Drago] displays to you that drugs may have been present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   THE WITNESS: So, like I said, the stop and stare is always there. And then the three that he would usually do would either be standing if it's a high odor, the sit, which is obviously the preferred method, or sometimes if it's really low, like I've seen him go under cars, he's actually laid down on his stomach and stayed there on his stomach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: And how do you know that these various displays are in fact indications of drugs as opposed to some other indication of what the dog is perceiving?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE WITNESS: Through training.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT: And have you kept track of the different ways that he displays and indicated that in your training manuals?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: Your training logs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: Why is it then that you are trying to train him to give the final trained response?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE WITNESS: Honestly, because people like to see it on camera.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: Now, is it possible for anyone other than you to observe the behavior that you believe indicates drugs that's not the trained-final trained response? In other words, are you the only one that can tell when Drago's indicating on drugs when he doesn't give a formal trained response?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   THE WITNESS: I would say to an extent, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. So largely we're dependent purely on your subjective determination of what Drago's behavior is to determine whether or not you have reasonable cause to conduct a search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (Tr. 142:3-143:14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On November 16, 2016, Mr. Esteban and Mr. Tauteeia were indicted on one count of\n   possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) &amp;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But police discretion is not constrained when an officer's conduct provokes or substantially contributes to a violation, even unintentionally. Though Trooper Tripodi may not have been \"tailgating,\" he significantly increased his speed, exceeding the acknowledged speed limit while also passing the emergency vehicles on the side of the road, and came up behind Mr. Esteban's vehicle very quickly. Trooper Tripodi recognized that Mr. Esteban could reasonably have thought that a police officer, approaching quickly from behind, wanted his vehicle to move out of the way as soon as practicable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 83:12-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In addition, Mr. Esteban's conduct generally conformed to the safe-driving advice given by the Utah Driver Handbook, which notes that highway driving is \"faster and conditions are not the same as in normal driving\" and that a driver can be cited for \"impeding traffic if a vehicle is following behind you in the left lane of travel on a multi-lane highway and you do not change lanes and allow for the other vehicle to pass.\" Utah Dep't of Public Safety,\n   <em>\n    Utah Driver Handbook\n   </em>\n   8-8 (Aug. 2016).

Though Trooper Tripodi did not have his emergency lights on while coming up quickly behind Mr. Esteban, the cars were simultaneously passing an emergency vehicle on the side. In these circumstances, the court finds a reasonable person would have noticed the police car's quick approach and reasonably assumed that they should change lanes as quickly as possible. Mr. Esteban clearly understood the two-second rule because he implemented it just seconds before while properly passing the earlier emergency vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because the traffic violation that provided the basis for the stop was provoked by the officer's own driving conduct, the \"minimal level of objective justification\" for the stop falls away and the stop becomes unreasonable\n   under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Sgt. Nope's testimony repeatedly suggested the POST training regime was aimed more towards expeditious training and certification of canines than to applying the most reliable, if tedious, scientific standards to training and testing.

No explanation was provided in several of the false alerts/inconclusive incidents highlighted.

Nope's personal interest in upholding the training program's validity, which has been applied to train a substantial number of canines in this country and abroad. Tellingly, Sgt. Nope has never testified that a canine sniff he reviewed was unreliable. Moreover, Sgt. Nope's testimony that officers and observers can be taught to avoid cuing, when considered against Dr. Myers' testimony that cuing is primarily unintentional, appears both overly optimistic and largely flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In stark contrast, Dr. Myers testified that Drago's \"indication\" here was of \"no value ... whatsoever.\" Dr. Myers asserted that the only way a properly-trained canine communicates the presence of narcotics is through the final trained response. The officer may suspect, but without the trained response, the canine has not communicated that it has, in fact, identified the odor attached to that training. Despite this compelling testimony, and despite the Tenth Circuit's desire to provide \"bright-line\" rules for when officers may rely on canine alerts,\n   <em>\n    Ludwig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206791\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/1243/#p1250\">\n    641 F.3d at 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Circuit has not required the presence of a final trained response and cautioned against a judge's second-guessing a dog's alert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Yet what happens when the canine alert or indication is not based on objectively observable facts, but solely on the officer's subjective interpretation of the dog's behavior?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In this case, the officers have conceded that, at least to some extent and in some instances, the officer's subjective determination of a number of canine behaviors can be determinative of the decision to conduct a search. Indeed, without Trooper Loveland's testimony, the dash camera video does not reveal any objective basis with which to view many of the behaviors Loveland identified. Even Trooper Loveland was confused as to why Drago did not sit into his final trained response. Implicit in Trooper Loveland's training logs is the recognition that the trained final response is a necessary component of Drago's training and, consequently, his reliability. But Trooper Loveland asserted that the final trained response is simply for show, \"because people like to see it.\" Sgt. Nope agreed-the final trained response may be the best evidence, but not the only evidence, because POST's \"alert matrix\" details a wide variety of canine behaviors, any one of which, if sufficiently profound, can alone provide probable cause for a search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Supreme Court has \" 'repeatedly rejected' a subjective approach\" in its Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, \"asking only whether 'the circumstances, viewed\n   <em>\n    objectively,\n   </em>\n   justify the action.' \"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911971,12458997\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/452/\">\n    563 U.S. at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911971,12458997\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/452/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brigham City v.

But, in light of the challenges to this training program and the questions about Drago's performance, as well as the courts' adherence to objectively identified grounds supporting an officer's inferences, the court does not find that probable cause can rest on the officer's own subjective assessment of a canine's behavior that could indicate any number of circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \"Each case must rise or fall on the particular facts of that case.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But generalized \"safety concerns\" were not implicated in any way by the circumstances of this stop, so the Triple I check cannot be said to be a part of the stop's \"mission\" to complete \"documentation\" of a minor traffic violation. Trooper Tripodi admitted that asking Mr. Esteban back to his vehicle was not particularly safe, and no factors reasonably support suspicion of criminal activity or any unsafe conduct during the traffic stop, as further discussed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    . In these specific circumstances, the court finds that a reasonable officer would not be concerned for his safety such that the \"ordinary incidents\" of a traffic stop (license validity, wants and warrants, inspection of vehicle registration and insurance) were not adequate to accomplish the purposes of this stop.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n     135 S.Ct. at 1615\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
