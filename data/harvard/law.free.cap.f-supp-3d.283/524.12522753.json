FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are the parents of decedent Erik Emmanuel Salas-Sanchez. Pl.'s Am. Compl., June 15, 2017, ECF No. 17 [hereinafter \"Amended Complaint\"]. Co-defendant Officers Smith, Rivera, and Gomez [hereinafter collectively referred to as \"co-defendant officers\"] were employed as police officers by the City of El Paso Police Department [hereinafter \"EPPD\"]. Am. Compl. 2. On April 29, 2015, Erik Salas-Sanchez [hereinafter \"Salas-Sanchez\"] was twenty-two years old and living with his family in El Paso, Texas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On that same day, co-defendant officers arrived at Salas-Sanchez's family home and questioned Mrs. Sanchez, Salas-Sanchez's mother, about an alleged incident involving her son.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The incident involved Salas-Sanchez's uninvited presence in a neighbor's home, which prompted the neighbor to call 911.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the co-defendant officers' conversation with Mrs. Sanchez, Mrs. Sanchez informed them that her son had been acting strange and exhibiting signs of mental illness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Salas-Sanchez was inside the house during the conversation and intermittently\n   interrupted to speak with his mother or the co-defendant officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs claim that Mrs. Sanchez calmly talked to the officers at her door while simultaneously speaking with her son and telling him \"the police are here to talk with her, not him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Despite this, Salas-Sanchez began telling the co-defendant officers \"to leave as he believed they had no right to be at his home.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs then claim that \"[a]fter an extended period of time speaking with Mrs. Sanchez, and frustrated by [Salas-Sanchez]'s insistence that they leave the home, [co-d]efendant [o]fficers pushed Mrs. Sanchez out of the way and entered the home without consent and without a warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Once inside the house, Plaintiffs claim that Officer Rivera used his taser in an attempt to subdue Salas-Sanchez, while Officer Gomez had his weapon drawn and pointed at Salas-Sanchez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Then, Plaintiffs allege that despite the fact that Salas-Sanchez \"moved away\" from all of the officers and \"did not make any aggressive movements towards them,\" Officer Gomez fired five rounds at him, striking him twice in the back and once in the buttocks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The shots proved fatal, and Salas-Sanchez was pronounced deceased upon arriving at the hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No firearm, knife, or any other weapon was ever found at the scene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that various failures of the EPPD and its Chief, Gregory Allen [hereinafter \"Chief Allen\"], were a \"moving force and/or a proximate cause of the deprivations of\" Salas-Sanchez's constitutional rights. Plaintiffs make eight distinct allegations in that regard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (A) [EPPD maintains] a policy or custom of excessive force by officers so common and widespread as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (B) [EPPD maintains] a policy or custom of officers' failure to avoid the use of deadly force against individuals when the officer is not at risk of imminent serious bodily injury or death;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (C) [EPPD maintains] a policy or custom of the use of excessive force by officers when the officer is on notice of a victim's mental health problems that is so common and widespread as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (D) [EPPD failed to] properly train or supervise members of the El Paso Police Department, including [co-d]efendants Gomez, Rivera, and Smith, not to use intermediate or deadly force against an individual who does not place the officer or another at risk of imminent serious bodily injury or death;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (E) [EPPD failed to] properly train or supervise members of the El Paso Police Department, including [co-d]efendants Gomez, Rivera, and Smith, on mental health issues and how [to] implement de-escalation and communication tactics during incidents where their officers have notice and knowledge that the person for whom they are called has a mental health issues [sic];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (F) [EPPD failed to] institute proper procedures to ensure that EPPD officers use appropriate de-escalation and communication tactics in situations in which it is known that an unarmed resident has a mental illness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (G) [EPPD failed to] classify\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   officer-involved shootings as unjustified-particularly those involving unarmed victims; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (H) [EPPD failed to] pursue criminal or disciplinary charges or support criminal or disciplinary action against officers, including Gomez, Rivera, and Smith, who have deprived citizens and\n   residents of El Paso of their constitutional rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Am.

The Court's answer was yes, though a qualified one.

They further allege that Chief Allen has been on notice of this practice and has failed to take any steps to remedy it. Am. Compl. 15. Finally, they allege that this policy was a \"moving force in the constitutional violations against\" Salas-Sanchez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While Plaintiffs state that this is the first of five separate theories of municipal liability, Response 3, this theory appears to combine two independent claims into one. The first claim is that the City should be held liable here for its alleged custom or practice of excessive force more generally against all citizens. The second claim is that it should be held liable for its alleged custom or practice of excessive force specifically against mentally ill individuals. Because Plaintiffs explicitly state in their Response that their Amended Complaint is limited to five separate theories of municipal liability, the Court interprets their allegation as referring only to a policy of excessive force relating to individuals displaying signs of mental illness, and not to all individuals more generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    a. Policy or Custom\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A \"persistent, widespread practice\" is sufficient to constitute an official policy or custom.\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162285\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/567/#p578\">\n    237 F.3d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs support their allegations of a widespread practice with facts and statistics about EPPD's use of excessive force in instances where the EPPD officers were on notice of the victim's mental health issues. Plaintiffs cite the following statistics: from 2012-16, almost 57% of persons who died in EPPD custody exhibited signs of mental illness of which the police were on notice; and from 2015-16, 66-100% of residents shot and killed by EPPD officers exhibited signs of mental illness visible to officers prior to their killing (the national average proportions for those years was never higher than 26%). Am. Compl. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs then describe nine specific instances of EPPD officers using excessive force against mentally ill victims, which Plaintiffs claim support the existence of a pattern and practice of excessive force within EPPD against those exhibiting signs of mental illness.

First, Defendant argues that since none of the Plaintiffs or the decedent in this case was \"in custody,\" none of the cited cases or statistics about deaths in police custody is apposite. Mot. 15. This argument is not convincing. First, Salas-Sanchez was likely in handcuffs when he died,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   so according to the facts as provided by Plaintiffs he was indeed in EPPD custody at the moment of his death. Am. Compl. 6. However, even if he were not in custody, the Court finds this distinction irrelevant at the present time. The reasonable implication from the Amended Complaint is that the deaths in custody were caused by police misconduct, not simply deaths that happened to occur in police custody. Thus, the statistics are illustrative of the use of excessive force by EPPD officers against the mentally ill. If it is true, as Defendant claims, that these statistics do not accurately indicate deaths caused by police, that issue may be considered at a later stage in the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Next, Defendant claims Plaintiffs' statistics regarding the rate of people who were shot and killed in El Paso who were exhibiting signs of mental illness are \"meaningless.\" Mot. 15. This is because, among other reasons, \"the source [ ] and the underlying standards reflected in the statistics\n   are not apparent from the pleading.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162285\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/567/#p578\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is also because the statistics do not \"demonstrate/explain how an official policy, practice, or custom has caused those statistical differences, rather than the myriad other explanations that could be behind those numbers and the data quoted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21. These arguments also miss the mark. While the probity of a given statistic can be debated ad nauseam, it is not the Court's responsibility to settle such a debate at this time. The Court must accept Plaintiffs' allegations as true and draw reasonable inferences in their favor when deciding a motion to dismiss. It is reasonable to infer from these statistics that shootings by EPPD officers involve a much higher proportion of individuals displaying mental health issues than the national average. It is also reasonable to combine this and other statistics with Plaintiffs' other factual allegations to infer that a widespread practice of excessive force exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, Defendant discusses the nine alleged cases of excessive force against individuals displaying signs of mental illness. The thrust of its argument is that these cases are distinguishable and that it is impossible to determine from the pleadings that these cases represent examples of excessive force because Plaintiffs do not provide sufficient detail. Mot. 16-19. The Court disagrees with this argument. Plaintiffs provide concise paragraphs for each case of allegedly excessive force. Am. Compl. 17-20. In each, they allege that officers should have been on notice that an individual was suffering from some mental condition, that the individual never substantially threatened or attacked any officer, but was nonetheless killed, tased, or beaten by the officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While Plaintiffs may not allege sufficient facts to state a separate and independent claim for each of the individual cases, in the aggregate they support the reasonable inference that a pattern of excessive force exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    b. Final Policymaker Aware\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs must allege that an official to whom the governing body of the municipality \"has delegated policy-making authority\" had \"[a]ctual or constructive knowledge of\" the alleged custom or practice.\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162285\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/567/#p578\">\n    237 F.3d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Plaintiffs allege that Chief Allen is such an official. Am Compl. 8. Plaintiffs allege that the \"pattern of constitutional violations puts EPPD on notice ... of excessive force and excessive intermediate and deadly force when officers are dealing with persons with mental health issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. They further allege that \"Chief Allen acts with deliberate indifference to these consequences[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs specifically allege that Chief Allen makes all final decisions regarding officer discipline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. He makes all decisions regarding whether to classify the use of force as \"[j]ustified\" or \"[u]njustified.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. He makes all decisions regarding the scope and content of EPPD officer training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Finally, he has the ability to implement initiatives and programs to help EPPD officers handle situations involving the mentally ill.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. These allegations are sufficient to state a claim that Chief Allen is a final policymaker and that he had actual or constructive knowledge of the rate and past instances of excessive force towards individuals displaying signs of mental illness. Further, Defendant does not appear to contest that Police Chief Allen qualifies as an official with final policymaking authority. Thus, the Court concludes that the second element for municipal liability is satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    c. Moving Force Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs must allege that the municipal policy was the \"moving force\" behind the underlying constitutional deprivation. To do this, they must allege that \"the municipal action was taken with the requisite degree of culpability and must ... [allege] a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Valle v.

This can be accomplished by alleging that \"a municipal decision reflects deliberate indifference to the risk that a violation of a particular constitutional or statutory right will follow from the decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/\">\n    520 U.S. at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded such causation. The facts described above support a plausible inference that the City's policy of excessive force against the mentally ill was the moving force behind the co-defendant officers' decision to use excessive force. Defendant claims that Plaintiffs have failed \"to show that any of the alleged prior instances were factually similar, and therefore, fail[ed] to establish the essential causal nexus to the death of the Plaintiffs' Son.\" Mot. 20. Defendant further criticizes Plaintiffs' description of the prior instances of allegedly excessive force because Plaintiffs do not base their allegations on \"any investigative outcomes or findings,\" omit any \"officer statements or admissions,\" and fail to \"relate any information about decisions by fact-finders\" regarding the use of force.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant's criticisms do not defeat Plaintiffs' claims. The omission of investigative outcomes, admissions, or decisions by fact finders is not sufficient to overcome a plausible inference of causation. Based on the Amended Complaint, the Court has already determined that Plaintiffs plausibly claim that EPPD has a widespread practice of excessive force against individuals who are exhibiting signs of mental illness. In this case, EPPD officers used excessive force against an individual who they knew was exhibiting signs of mental illness in conformity with this practice. While causation is usually difficult to prove, Plaintiffs need only provide enough facts to allow the Court to make a plausible inference that the policy was a moving force behind the harm in this case. It does not strike the Court as implausible that the widespread practice of excessive force against those exhibiting signs of mental illness directly caused this particular case of excessive force against a man exhibiting signs of mental illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to allege moving force causation. Because Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim with respect to the policy of excessive force applied to mentally ill individuals, the court will deny Defendant's motion to dismiss this particular claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Institute Proper Procedures to Ensure Officers Employ Appropriate Tactics When Confronted with Mental Health Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Chief Allen \"made a deliberate choice not to adopt procedures to implement communication and de-escalation tactics in situations involving persons suffering from mental health issues.\" Resp. 16. In support of this allegation, Plaintiffs allege that EPPD has failed to take measures that many other cities have taken to prevent the aforementioned pattern of escalation upon encountering a mental health crisis. Am. Compl. 13. Plaintiffs highlight the fact that \"Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio have all implemented\n   crisis intervention teams\" that \"ensure that mental health professionals or officers trained in mental health issues and appropriate de-escalation techniques and communication tactics make the first contact with persons in mental health crises.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs point to the effectiveness of these reforms in other cities and allege that Chief Allen's refusal to implement such reforms \"ensures that responding officers respond to mental health crises without the ability to de-escalate the crisis non-violently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Further, they claim that the \"failure to implement these procedures has caused the disproportionately high incidents of excessive force ... when officers are on notice of a mental health crisis[.]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, they allege that the failure to implement these procedures was an \"actual cause in the constitutional violations that resulted in\" Salas-Sanchez's death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    a. Policy or Custom\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Rather than a \"widespread practice\" or pattern, this claim directly alleges a specific policy, or lack thereof, that caused the constitutional injury at issue. Plaintiffs describe policies such as the creation of Crisis Intervention Teams (\"CIT\") that other similar cities have implemented to address the need for appropriate responses to mental health crises. Resp. 17. Plaintiffs claim that Chief Allen is \"aware of these initiatives[ ] as EPPD's policy maker\" but has \"refused to implement any comparable policy to de-escalate calls where police have clear notice that a person is having a mental health crisis[.]\" Mot. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendant argues that while \"some larger departments may have the resources and personnel to adopt such practices, their adoption does not set the standard for all police departments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Defendant is correct that some cities' adoption of these policies does not make mandatory every other city's adoption of similar policies. However, if a city consciously chooses not to adopt such policies, an aggrieved plaintiff may certainly attempt to hold it accountable if that decision directly causes constitutional injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Second, Defendant cites a Louisiana district court case for the proposition that \"the lack of specific mental health training for officers d[oes] not establish a constitutional claim.\" Mot. 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Casto v.

This is far too broad a rule to draw from\n   <em>\n    Casto.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Casto\n   </em>\n   argued that a lone United States Justice Department report regarding a prison in his municipality-which had failed to provide adequate mental health care and suicide prevention programs-was sufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment on a municipal liability claim.\n   <em>\n    Casto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202855468\">\n    2016 WL 2855468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *10. However, because the plaintiff's claim stemmed from an incident involving an officer on patrol, rather than in a prison, the court held that the report about prison conditions was insufficient evidence to show the policymaker's indifference to the needs of non-prisoners like the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202855468\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The case does not, as Defendant suggests, hold that a municipality's failure to provide mental health training can never serve as the basis for a claim of municipal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Compl. 15. This is sufficient to state a plausible claim. After numerous incidents\n   involving individuals exhibiting signs of mental illness that have led to death or serious injury, Chief Allen's refusal to establish a protocol to reduce the frequency of these violent encounters is a plausible cause for the constitutional violations at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim because it is \"rank speculation\" to allege that the existence of a CIT would have reduced the likelihood that officers would have resorted to force in the present case.

Plaintiffs allege that this supports a plausible inference that EPPD has an unwritten policy to always classify police shootings as justified.

Further, they argue\n   <em>\n    Releford\n   </em>\n   deemed a similar causal connection between a municipality's unwritten policy and the injury alleged sufficient under the Fifth Circuit's standard despite the plaintiff's much higher burden of proof at summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20Fed.%20Appx.%20267\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Releford\n   </em>\n   , the court allowed the plaintiffs analogous \"failure to classify\" allegations to survive summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20Fed.%20Appx.%20267\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To support those allegations, the plaintiff provided the following evidence: that officer-involved shootings from 2009-2012 were classified as either justified or, in only three cases, accidental; detailed descriptions of previous incidents that were not classified as unjustified that arguably should have been; casual text messages between police officers regarding police shootings indicating the \"culture of indifference\" to such shootings; and expert testimony claiming it was \"shocking\" that the City classified almost all shootings as justified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court agrees that\n   <em>\n    Releford\n   </em>\n   provides an analogous example indicating that a plaintiff can produce sufficient evidence of causation for a failure to classify claim. As for whether such a claim satisfies the high causation standard in the Fifth Circuit, this is a closer call. Defendant does not mention\n   <em>\n    Releford\n   </em>\n   in any of its briefing or contest that the\n   <em>\n    Releford\n   </em>\n   court allowed substantially similar allegations to reach a finder of fact. Defendant does not contest that\n   <em>\n    Releford\n   </em>\n   implicitly permits such a claim even where the plaintiff has a much higher burden of proof. Based on the\n   <em>\n    Releford\n   </em>\n   court's determination that similar claims do indeed meet the Fifth Circuit's stringent causation standard, and Defendant's failure to address this case or cite competing cases, the Court concludes that such a policy could plausibly be the moving force behind the death in this case. Thus, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim for\n   municipal liability based on EPPD's policy of refusing to classify police shootings as unjustified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Pursue Disciplinary Action Against Officers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that EPPD has a policy of \"failing to investigate and discipline EPPD officers for engaging in excessive force [.]\" Resp. 23. Specifically, Plaintiffs provide a summary of how the Disciplinary Review Board (\"DRB\")-which makes disciplinary recommendations for police officer misconduct and is comprised mostly of police officers-routinely fails to mete out discipline for officers accused of misconduct. Am. Compl. 9. Plaintiffs state that only ten percent of cases brought before the DRB result in any disciplinary action-and, when discipline is deemed necessary, officers normally just receive \"counseling\" as a punishment, even for excessive force.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"[b]y maintaining a DRB that lacks independence, EPPD's disciplinary policy allows officers to use excessive force and to specifically use excessive intermediate and deadly force where officers are on notice of a victim's mental illness without suffering any disciplinary action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. This, in turn, causes \"disproportionately high incidents of excessive use of force\" in El Paso.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Plaintiffs highlight that in this case and each of the nine prior instances of alleged excessive force, the officer or officers responsible were \"kept on payroll\" and were, in almost every instance, not disciplined or sanctioned in any way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    a. Policy or Custom\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Again, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged the existence of an unwritten policy of leniency towards EPPD officers who have used excessive force against the mentally ill. While a municipality is free to tailor its disciplinary policies to address its own unique needs, municipalities may not habitually fail to discipline employees when they violate individuals' constitutional rights. Doing so sends a signal to the employees that there are only limited consequences, if any, for misconduct, and thus, according to Plaintiffs, implicitly encourages the misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Construing the facts most favorably to Plaintiffs, it is indeed surprising that the officers involved in the various incidents Plaintiffs describe were not subject to any notable discipline. This is especially true with respect to the officers involved in the present case-where one officer has been criminally indicted for manslaughter-and the case of Daniel Saenz-where an officer allegedly shot a handcuffed man in the back while he lay face down on the ground-received no formal admonishment. Am. Compl. 10, 17-18. This alleged lack of disciplinary measures plausibly suggests to the Court that EPPD had a blanket policy of not disciplining officers who were responsible for using excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   To contest this claim, Defendant argues that \"[t]here is no legal basis for a claim that a DRB is required, or that a particular format or makeup is required, or that independent review by non-police officers is mandated by the [C]onstitution or laws of the United States.\" Mot. 8. Defendant misconstrues Plaintiffs' argument. Plaintiffs did not bring this cause of action to force Defendant to conform to any specific set of disciplinary procedures or change the constitution of the DRB necessarily. Rather, they are attempting to hold the City liable for an alleged unwritten municipal policy that caused Salas-Sanchez's death. To do this, they have highlighted numerous deficiencies and disciplinary results that lead to the plausible inference that such an unwritten policy exists. It is of no consequence that the City is not constitutionally required to have any specific disciplinary procedures. What matters,\n   and what Plaintiffs ultimately need to prove, is that Chief Allen either explicitly promoted or was deliberately indifferent to a policy of refusing to discipline officers guilty of excessive force. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs allege enough facts to support such a claim at this stage in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    b. Moving Force Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Without appropriate consequences for excessive force, as Plaintiffs claim, it is plausible that EPPD officers felt emboldened and unafraid of the consequences for using unconstitutional tactics. It is also plausible that this confidence inspired and possibly motivated the co-defendants' unconstitutional action in the present case. Thus, Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to support an allegation of moving force causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendant argues that since there is no allegation that the DRB ever failed to discipline the co-defendants in this case, then the failure to discipline them previously could not have caused the injury that the Defendant is allegedly responsible for. Mot. 8. However, Plaintiffs are not alleging that a failure to discipline the specific officers in this case caused the injury. Rather, they seek to raise a plausible inference that the failure to discipline other officers created a culture that emboldened the officers in this case to engage in the conduct that resulted in Salas-Sanchez's death. Thus, it does not matter that the co-defendants were never the subject of disciplinary review, and Defendant's argument is accordingly unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Further, Defendant argues that the DRB's failure to discipline the co-defendants in this case cannot be used as evidence of causation because the decision not to discipline occurred \"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the incident in question.\" Mot. 8. However, Plaintiffs are not arguing that the lack of discipline in this case caused the misconduct to arise. Rather, they argue that the lack of discipline evinces an unwritten policy of leniency. Whether the DRB determination occurred after the alleged wrongdoing is irrelevant to showing the existence of an established policy. Thus, Defendant's argument that the lack of discipline in this case does not show causation fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim for municipal liability based on EPPD's policy of refusing to discipline EPPD officers involved in instances of excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    EPPD's Failure to Train Officers on Responding to Mental Health Crises\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that EPPD failed to train its officers in numerous respects on how to communicate with, respond to, and protect those individuals involved in mental health crises. Am. Compl. 11. According to Plaintiffs, necessary training would include training on skills \"completely different than standard patrol officer training,\" including patience and de-escalation tactics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Plaintiffs claim Chief Allen is aware of this lack of training and has been \"deliberately indifferent to its consequences,\" causing officers to respond to mental health crises by escalating the situations and using intermediate and deadly force that could have been avoided had they been trained properly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Plaintiffs allege that this failure to train is the direct cause of the co-defendant officers' unlawful entry and use of force against Salas-Sanchez in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The standard for establishing liability for failure to train is the same standard for establishing municipal liability in general.\n   <em>\n    Valle v.

Tex. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Again, Plaintiffs plead sufficient facts to support the reasonable inference that Chief Allen was deliberately indifferent to the obvious consequences of failing to train EPPD officers in specific methods for interacting with mentally ill individuals. Police are often asked to serve many roles in our community and involve themselves in various undesirable situations for which they may not have sufficient training. However, one of those situations involves interacting regularly with mentally ill individuals who may be disturbed, confused, aggressive, depressed, or delusional. If officers are given the authority to use deadly force when they fear for their safety, they must be given the tools to adequately discern when they are in danger and how to minimize and reduce that danger when interacting with an individual suffering from mental health issues. One of these tools is adequate training in the multiple areas Plaintiffs describe. It is the City's responsibility that those armed with lethal force know how to use it appropriately, and it is the City's fault if their employees consistently misuse that force. The frequent and substantially similar uses of excessive force by EPPD against the mentally ill should have alerted Chief Allen to the need for improved training in this regard. While this failure may have been excusable while the need for such training was gradually becoming apparent, Plaintiffs have pleaded facts suggesting the need was apparent long ago. Plaintiffs highlighted nine different occasions over the last four years where EPPD officers appear to be utterly unprepared for various encounters with individuals suffering from mental health crises. If Plaintiffs' allegations are true, a reasonable policymaker would have implemented enhanced training techniques to reduce the frequency of these outcomes, yet Chief Allen failed to do so here. Thus, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to support an inference of deliberate indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Remaining Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Defendant claims that because Plaintiffs allege that co-defendant Officer Rivera \"acted contrary to official city policy\" when he used his taser against Salas-Sanchez, he could not have been acting consistent with a citywide custom or practice. Mot. 5. Further, Defendant argues that because Plaintiffs claim that \"no reasonable officer would believe that shooting [or tasing] the Deceased was right,\" co-defendant Officers Gomez and Rivera could not have been following EPPD policy. Mot. 6. These arguments are unpersuasive. First, the existence of a certain official, written policy does not automatically preclude a finding that the City encouraged or condoned behavior that was contrary to that policy. There could plausibly be an official policy condemning the use of excessive force, and an unofficial policy condoning or encouraging it. Thus, this argument fails. Second, just because an officer was acting unreasonably, it does not follow that he or she failed to adhere to City policies. Such logic begs the question of whether City policies were reasonable in the first place, one of the very facts in dispute in this case. Thus, Defendant's argument that the officers were acting unreasonably-and thus that they could not have possibly been acting pursuant to City policy-fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Further, Defendant mentions repeatedly in its Reply that Salas-Sanchez was \"unarmed, presenting no threat, and running away\" when he was shot. Reply 7-8. Defendant argues that this indicates that none of the City's policies caused the excessive force; it was instead the co-defendant officers' own independent decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4020768\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/121/701/#p719\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the co-defendant officers' decision was undoubtedly a link in the causal chain that led to the injury, this does not preclude the City's various policies and practices from potentially being independent\n   moving forces that caused the injury. Thus, this argument fails as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds Defendant's additional arguments unpersuasive and will deny its Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

When deciding a motion to dismiss, the Court is required to view all the facts in a light most favorable to plaintiffs and decide whether these facts are sufficient to state a claim. It is entirely possible that EPPD and Chief Allen's decision not to deem the death of Salas-Sanchez \"unjustified\" in this particular case was correct. It is further possible that the charges against Officer Gomez will be dismissed or that a jury may acquit him. Nonetheless, taking Plaintiffs' allegations as true, the Court accepts as plausible the allegation that Chief Allen categorically denies wrongdoing in cases of excessive force regardless of the circumstances. Whether or not that allegation is true, of course, remains to be seen.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
