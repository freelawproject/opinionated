Mr. Greenberger is an Atlanta-area accountant and the subject of an IRS examination into his preparation of conservation easement partnership returns for some of his clients in 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A conservation easement is a permanent agreement between a property owner and a land trust, non-profit, or government entity through which the owner gives up some of her rights of ownership in order to advance conservation purposes. The easement allows the property owner to claim a federal tax deduction for up to 50 percent of the owner's adjusted gross income (and 100 percent if she is a rancher or farmer). However, according to the IRS, this deduction is sometimes susceptible to abuse, such as when taxpayers \"armed with questionable appraisals[ ] take inappropriately large deductions for easements,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or when promoters \"syndicate ownership interests in [a partnership] that owns the real property\" to assist investors in \"claim[ing] charitable contribution deductions in amounts that significantly exceed the amount invested.\" Internal Revenue Service, Notice 2017-10 : Listing Notice-Syndicated Conservation\n   Easement Transactions (noting that certain syndicated conversation easement transactions may be \"tax avoidance transaction[s]\")\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.irs.gov/irb/2017-04_IRB#NOT-2017-10 (last accessed September 26, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This alleged potential for abuse is what apparently made Greenberger a person of interest to the IRS. Greenberger's records were subpoenaed by the IRS, and the agency's examination remains ongoing, years after it started. In response to the examination, Mr. Greenberger submitted two FOIA requests. In a nutshell, he seeks the IRS's investigation file concerning him. When the IRS failed to respond to Mr. Greenberger's second FOIA request to his satisfaction, he filed this suit to enforce it. During the course of responding to Mr. Greenberger's request and this litigation, the IRS searched for and disclosed the existence of some 27,000 pages of responsive records. It has withheld virtually all of those records by asserting a number of exemptions under FOIA. For example, the IRS claims that almost every document is protected under Exemption 7A, which allows an agency to withhold information connected to an ongoing law enforcement investigation if release would be reasonably likely to interfere with that investigation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(A). The IRS similarly claims it cannot disclose large chunks of documents to Greenberger because they include the tax return information of third parties, and a federal statute-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -precludes the disclosure of those records. For the reasons stated herein, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the IRS's Motion and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Greenberger's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Internal Revenue Service's Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"IRS's Resp. SMF\") \u00b6 1.) On or about October 23, 2013, the IRS sent Greenberger a Notice of Examination seeking to determine if Greenberger should be held liable for promoter or preparer penalties in connection with conservation easement partnership returns he prepared for clients in 2010, 2011, and 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 7; Declaration of William E. Buchanan \u00b6 6.) Specifically, the IRS \"is examining [Greenberger's] conduct to determine whether he may have violated certain provisions of the [Tax] Code in connection with his involvement with conservation easement partnerships or arrangements or while preparing federal tax returns for conservation easement partnerships or ... on which a charitable donation deduction was claimed arising from a conservation easement.\" (Declaration of Deborah Fitzpatrick (\"Fitzpatrick Decl.\") \u00b6 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IRS then \"audited conservation partnership returns that [Greenberger] prepared for 2010, 2011, and 2012.\" (IRS Resp. SMF \u00b6 8.) As the examination proceeded, Greenberger claims that his relationship with his clients deteriorated. (Robert Greenberger's January 6, 2016 Declaration \u00b6\u00b6 44-49.) On January 27, 2014, Greenberger sent his first FOIA request to the IRS concerning its examination. (IRS's Resp. SMF \u00b6 15.) That request is not the subject of this suit. On or before August 4, 2015, the IRS referred the investigation to the Department of Justice's Tax Division. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Greenberger sent a second FOIA request on August 25, 2015 to the IRS, seeking access to records regarding the IRS's investigation of him.

(Pl. Resp. SMF \u00b6 7.) She began her search through the IRS's Integrated Data Retrieval System (\"IDRS\"), a central database that the IRS uses to maintain taxpayer accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Washington searched the IDRS database and identified open examinations of Mr. Greenberger for the 2009-11 tax years and open audits of Mr. Greenberger's personal income taxes for the 2009-11 tax years. (Declaration of Shira Washington (\"Washington Decl.\") \u00b6 7, 10-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, after Ms. Washington chased these records down, she discovered they related only \"to exams of Plaintiff's personal returns, [ ] not ... a promoter examination or promoter investigation, which was a topic of the FOIA request.\" (Washington Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13.) Ms. Washington\n   then contacted IRS counsel Chris Pavilonis, who was \"the IRS Counsel attorney working on\" the promoter investigation of Greenberger. (Declaration of Chris Pavilonis (\"Pavilonis Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Pl.'s Resp. SMF \u00b6 11-12.) Pavilonis searched his own files (both paper and electronic) and his e-mails for responsive records, and obtained \"all of the files of IRS Associate Area Counsel Attorney John Arthur, who had previously been assigned to the investigation,\" including Arthur's paper file, e-mails, and written notes. (Pavilonis Decl. \u00b6 7.) Pavilonis also provided to Washington an IRS Revenue Agent's Injunction Referral Report (and its exhibits and addendums). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pavilonis and Washington also obtained responsive files from the files of Revenue Agents Ellie Pennington and Mary Carter, (Pl.'s Resp. SMF \u00b6 15; Pavilonis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11), and Pavilonis collected responsive files from Jeanette Czachur, a Senior Program Analyst in the IRS's Small Business/Self-Employed department who \"helped coordinate the investigation on the IRS side (as opposed to [the] IRS Counsel side).\" (Pavilonis Decl. \u00b6 11.) Finally, the IRS gathered the \"return information of the partnerships and other business entities that had records responsive to the FOIA request,\" but did \"not gather the exam files and return information of the individual members of every partnership who received the flow-through tax benefits of deductions taken by the partnership.\" (Pavilonis Decl. \u00b6 13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Pavilonis transferred the collected files to Washington on or around December 2, 2015. (Pavilonis Decl. \u00b6 16.) Washington received them on December 9, 2015, and sent them to IRS Chief Counsel Elizabeth Rawlins. (Washington Decl. \u00b6 23.) The case was reassigned to Julie Schwartz, Senior Counsel in Branch 6 of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel-Procedure and Administration, located within IRS's Office of Chief Counsel. (Declaration of Julie C. Schwartz (\"Schwartz Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7.) Branch 6 of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel provides subject matter experts \"for disclosure and privilege matters ... arising in the context of tax litigation, the Freedom of Information Act ... or summons enforcement.\" (Schwartz Decl. \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Schwartz avers that the IRS received 26,910 responsive pages from the sources described above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Greenberger disputes this number, and claims that the IRS identified at least 27,167 pages. (Pl.'s Resp. SMF \u00b6 22.) The IRS claims it provided 1,042 pages in full and 57 pages in part to Greenberger. (Schwartz Decl. \u00b6 8.) Greenberger claim that 1,094 pages were provided to him in full, and 57 in part. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. SMF \u00b6 22.) The IRS also determined that there are \"no other records responsive to [Greenberger's] request that could be located that would not be categorically exempt from disclosure as third party return information protected under FOIA exemption (b)(3) in conjunction with IRC \u00a7 6103(a).\" (Schwartz Decl. \u00b6 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Schwartz reviewed the documents in conjunction with two other IRS attorneys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 9.) On March 17, 2016, the Court directed the IRS to produce a list of general categories of documents and a list of tax returns prepared by Greenberger that were in the IRS's possession. (IRS's Resp. SMF \u00b6 31.) The IRS created a list that was\n   not terribly helpful, because it withheld the names of the third-party taxpayers.

(Greenberger's Cross-Motion, Doc. 42-1 at 32.) First, he argues that the IRS's acknowledgement that it did not gather returns related to individual members of the partnerships whose returns were under scrutiny is enough to undercut the adequacy of the search. Second, Greenberger claims the search is suspect because \"substantial pages remain missing,\" as the IRS \"previously identified 30,000 pages, but now says it only produced 26,910 pages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Third, he argues that the \"sliver of documents the IRS did produce list[ed] roughly 40 involved people whose files were not searched.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fourth, Greenberger argues that the IRS's count of the reviewed pages was inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Greenberger's first contention is without merit because he plainly seeks \"returns related to individual partners.\" (Doc. 42-1 at 32.) But FOIA \"only imposes a duty to search for records in response to a request ... that complies with an agency's published rules and procedures\" for filing a FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    Hull v.

Greenberger argues that Kieran Carter stated that the IRS possessed 30,000 responsive pages in a conference with the Court. But Carter has since affirmed in an affidavit that this was just an \"estimate by IRS Counsel Elizabeth Rawlins\" before a \"formal count of the responsive documents\" had been completed. (Declaration of Kieran Carter (\"Carter Decl.\") \u00b6 2.) And a discrepancy between an agency's estimate of how many documents it expects to uncover and the number it actually does uncover is not enough to render the search \"inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    DiBacco v. U.S. Army\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786744,4288809\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/178/\">\n    795 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195 (D.C.

But the mere fact that these individuals were mentioned does not suggest that the IRS's search wasn't reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents. FOIA demands a reasonable search, not a perfect one.\n   <em>\n    Francis v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263632\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/267/9/#p11\">\n    267 F.Supp.3d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11-12 (D.D.C. 2017) (\"Agencies need not scour every database, but rather should conduct a \"good faith, reasonable\n   search of those systems of records likely to possess requested records.\") (citation omitted). Importantly, Plaintiff's FOIA request was exclusively directed at obtaining information related to the IRS's investigation of him. But Plaintiff failed to identify why a search of those 40 individuals was necessary to render the search adequate, when the IRS's affidavits establish that it searched the records of every individual who has had a significant role in the investigation that prompted the FOIA request\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that those individuals provided to IRS counsel their entire case files. IRS counsel then conducted a manual search and reviewed \"all records at issue in this litigation.\" (Schwartz Decl. \u00b6 9.) The IRS then determined that the only remaining material was exempt third-party return information which, as discussed below, the IRS is not required to produce. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Greenberger provides no explanation as to why he believes these individuals would possess responsive documents not already identified by the IRS-he simply assumes it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   And importantly, it appears that many of these individuals (a list of which neither party actually bothers to compile) engaged in e-mail correspondence about the investigation with individuals who\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   turn over responsive files-meaning the e-mails have been obtained and disclosed on the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Fourth, the discrepancies in the parties' page counts does not render the search inadequate. The IRS cites to two cases,\n   <em>\n    Budik v. Dep't of the Army\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160364\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/742/20/#p33\">\n    742 F.Supp.2d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33 (D.D.C. 2010) and\n   <em>\n    Fischer v.

In\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the FBI's inconsistent reports as to the number of responsive files might have been a mistake, but it was not \"bad faith\" sufficient to show that the search was inadequate. In\n   <em>\n    Budik\n   </em>\n   , the court held that a discrepancy in page counts prevented, under the circumstances of that case, the court from determining if exemptions were properly asserted. But it did not indicate that the search was in bad faith.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160364\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/742/20/#p33\">\n    742 F.Supp.2d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The IRS has met its burden in demonstrating it conducted a reasonable search.\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541448\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/908/1549/#p1554\">\n    908 F.2d at 1558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Greenberger has failed to present evidence that creates a material dispute of fact about the search's adequacy. The Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment in favor of the IRS and against Greenberger as to whether the IRS's search was adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The IRS's Asserted Exemptions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The IRS asserted several exemptions for all but roughly 1,000 pages it identified during its search. Greenberger challenges them all. For the reasons discussed below, the Court focuses only on the third party return information exemption and the law enforcement exemption. The Court finds that these exemptions have been properly asserted and justify withholding the documents from Greenberger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Third Party Return Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Greenberger seeks federal returns that he prepared for clients for filing with the IRS, along with materials that he or his firm gave to the IRS as part of the IRS's conservation easement partnership returns investigation. (Plaintiff's Motion, Doc. 42-1 at 10.) He claims (1) no privacy concerns can arise from giving him information he provided to the IRS; (2) that he\n   has a right under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) to material the IRS has gathered on him, including third-party return information; and (3) that he is entitled under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(4)(C) to \"transactionally related\" partner returns that were included in his file. For these reasons, he argues that the documents identified in\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index lines 6 through 43, 97, 153-155, and 159 through 187 should be disclosed. (Doc. 42-1 at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The IRS argues that it is precluded from disclosing this information because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) prevents the government from disclosing \"any return\" or \"return information\" of a third-party taxpayer to Greenberger.

Greenberger concedes some of this material is return information. He asks for \"[c]onservation related returns Bob prepared.\" (Doc. 45 at 8.) He notes he sought for the IRS to \"simply provide a list of the requested returns which Bob prepared.\" (Doc. 45 at 7.) And he claims he is entitled to \"the (summonsed) federal returns which he prepared for filing with the IRS.\" (Doc. 45 at 15.)

Section 6103(c) allows for the IRS to \"disclose the return of any taxpayer, or return information with respect to such taxpayer, to such person or persons as the taxpayer may designate in a request for or consent to such disclosure.\" However, this exception is \"subject to such conditions as [the Secretary of the Treasury] may prescribe by regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203041079\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Greenberger argues that the third-party return information in the possession of the IRS has been assembled as part of an IRS investigation into\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   activities as a tax promoter and is in \"\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   examination file,\" and so is\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   return information. (Doc. 45 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   First, Greenberger's reading of \u00a7 6103(c) is not reconcilable with the rest of the statute and must be rejected. The mere fact that other taxpayers' information is in Greenberger's file does not convert that information into \"his\" return information so that he can request it under \u00a7 6103. To allow otherwise would mean that any taxpayer under investigation-even one who was not an accountant, preparer, or the like-could access the third-party taxpayer information in his file if that information was compiled as part of the IRS's investigation of the alleged wrongdoer. That can't be right. Instead, Congress elected via \u00a7 6103 to presume that a taxpayer's return information was confidential, and to permit the disclosure\n   of such information to third parties-even accountants-only if they have been \"designate[d] in a request for or consent to such disclosure.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Greenberger cites no cases applying \u00a7 6103 that hold otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Second, Greenberger did not comply with the provisions of \u00a7 6103(c) that might have allowed him to obtain third-party return information. (Schwarz Decl. \u00b6 12 (averring that Greenberger has not \"secured consent to disclosure from the third party taxpayers\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, \"IRS regulations, and thus FOIA, require requesters seeking a third party's return information to file that third party's authorization with their initial FOIA request.\"\n   <em>\n    Hull\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830988\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/1174/#p1193\">\n    656 F.3d at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2011).

The Court assumes he means to challenge the remainder of the IRS's decisions to withhold documents. His reasons for doing so have already been rejected: he claims the search was inadequate, that there has been no active investigation since late 2015, that he poses no threat of obstruction and that the IRS imposed \"blanket exemptions on a categorical basis.\" (Motion, Doc. 42-1 at 36-38.) As discussed in this Order, the search was adequate, the IRS was only required to produce documents up until late 2015 because that is when the FOIA request was sent, the fact that Greenberger claims he poses no threat of obstruction is immaterial when granting him early access to the investigation defeats the purpose of Exemption 7A, and the IRS was entitled to impose two categorical exemptions as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Finally, the Court declines to order release of the Field Guidance Memorandums identified by Greenberger. These memorandums are documents compiled by the IRS for the purposes of investigations into taxpayers.
