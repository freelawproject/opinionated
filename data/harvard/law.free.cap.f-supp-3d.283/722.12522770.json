Defendants' Arguments Regarding Their Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   HSBC-North America insists that the claims against it should be stricken because it \"does not even offer correspondent banking services to non-U.S. clients like Al Rajhi Bank,\" and its \"primary business\" is to \"act as a holding company.\" [68] at 13. Defendants also note that the only allegation in the Amended Complaint specific to HSBC-North America states that its \"officials, committee members, compliance officers, and Anti-Money Laundering ('AML') directors are involved with, and oversee, the compliance and AML operations at [HSBC-US],\" which is an inadequate basis for liability. [68] at 7-8. In short, HSBC-North America argues that the claims against it should be stricken because it \"has nothing to do with the allegations in the Amended Complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants also suggest that all claims brought by Susan Gitelson, as the \"Special Administrator\" of the estate of Rima Akkad\n   Monla, should be dismissed for want of statutory standing. Gitelson was appointed as a \"Special Administrator\" pursuant to the Illinois Wrongful Death Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 180/0.01, and \"the powers and duties of a special administrator are strictly limited to those prescribed by the wrongful death statute,\" such that a Special Administrator's \"authority to prosecute a cause of action is limited to the wrongful death claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

[32] at 1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This portion of Defendants' motion is accordingly denied without prejudice. At this point, the Court is expressing no opinion regarding the ultimate viability of either the claims brought against HSBC-North America or the claims brought by Susan Gitelson.

Factors To Consider\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Several factors must be met for an action to be transferred to another venue: (1) venue must be proper in this district; (2) venue and jurisdiction must be proper in the transferee district; (3) the transferee district must be more convenient for both the parties and witnesses; and (4) transfer must serve the interest of justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Perfekt Mktg., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994134\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/861/919/#p920\">\n    861 F.Supp.2d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 920 (N.D.

Convenience of the Parties Favors Transfer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The relative convenience of the venues, however, is hotly contested. To resolve this dispute, the Court must consider four factors: (1) Plaintiffs' choice of forum; (2) the situs of the material events; (3) the relative ease of access to sources of proof; and (4) the convenience of the parties and witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Big Dog Sols. LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-6607,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205391391\">\n    2016 WL 5391391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 27, 2016). On balance, these factors weigh in favor of transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While Plaintiffs obviously chose this forum, their selection is given less deference \"where, as here, the chosen forum lacks any significant connection to the cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanders v. Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11811429\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/25/855/#p858\">\n    25 F.Supp.2d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 858 (N.D. Ill. 1998). The only Defendant with connections to this judicial district does not offer the type of international correspondent banking services at issue here. The only Plaintiff from Illinois is Susan Gitelson, who seemingly does not reside in this district and may not even be a party to this action after briefing pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). The Court accordingly gives Plaintiffs' selection less deference than it would normally carry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The situs of material events is in the Southern District of New York, where HSBC-U.S.'s correspondent banking business is centered. Unsurprisingly, sources of proof can also be found more easily in the Southern District of New York, since \"New York is the headquarters of defendant's [relevant] U.S. operations, [and] those employees of defendant most familiar with the company's U.S. operations work in New York.\"\n   <em>\n    Virgin Air, Inc. v. Virgin Atl. Airways, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 91-cv-8118,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%2073522\">\n    1992 WL 73522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 30, 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, the convenience of the parties and witnesses is well-served by a transfer. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the vast majority of\n   the Plaintiffs are residents of either California or Massachusetts, while the HSBC entity that provides the correspondent banking services at issue here is located in the Southern District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   While Plaintiffs initially attempted to establish that this judicial district is more convenient than the Southern District of New York (because Chicago represents a \"convenient geographic midpoint\" for parties dispersed on the East and West coasts), they later conceded in court that commercial airlines regularly fly convenient routes into both Chicago and New York City. [70] at 18. Clearly, the dispositive factor here is the location of HSBC-U.S.'s correspondent banking services, which renders the Southern District of New York more convenient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Interests of Justice Favor Transfer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, the Court must consider whether the interests of justice favor a transfer, in an effort to: (1) ensure the efficient administration of justice; (2) have the trial before a judge who is familiar with the applicable law; and (3) honor the relative desire of communities to adjudicate matters that affect them directly.\n   <em>\n    Big Dog Sols. LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205391391\">\n    2016 WL 5391391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As a preliminary matter, common sense \"suggests that the litigation will move more quickly in a venue close to key witnesses and evidence, and where such witnesses are within the court's subpoena power.\"\n   <em>\n    Andrade v. Chase Home Fin., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-cv-8229,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203436400\">\n    2005 WL 3436400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 12, 2005). Similarly, the Southern District of New York has a stronger interest in adjudicating the present dispute, which turns on correspondent banking services offered in New York City. Transfer is also consistent with the efficient administration of justice, as Al Rajhi Bank is currently embroiled in multi-district litigation in the Southern District of New York, involving allegations similar to those presented here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 1:03-md-1570 (S.D.N.Y.). Indeed, Plaintiffs might be able to re-plead their claims against Al Rajhi Bank in this lawsuit with the requisite jurisdictional grounding, and if they do, it makes good sense for this case to be litigated in the Southern District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Seventh Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Leibovitch v. Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277520\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/687/\">\n    852 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2017), is illustrative here. In that case, the court denied a motion to compel where personal jurisdiction was lacking over the target foreign banks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 681. Judge Posner concluded his opinion with the following observation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   We're puzzled that none of the plaintiffs who brought the suit against Iran that resulted in the default judgment are residents of Illinois. Why they are suing here rather than in the districts in which they live or work is unexplained. What is worse than merely unexplained is that they've presented no evidence to suggest that the two Chicago branch banks are either holding Iranian government assets or have any knowledge of where those assets might be held. In short, what are they doing here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 690.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This Court is similarly puzzled as to why Plaintiffs initiated this case in this district. The banking services at issue were provided in New York, and the Plaintiffs largely hail from Massachusetts or California. Clearly, this case does not belong here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As noted above, Al Rajhi Bank's Motion to Dismiss or To Transfer [64] is granted without prejudice. The Motion to Strike, Dismiss and Transfer filed by the HSBC entities [67] is denied in part and granted in part. Plaintiffs' claims against HSBC Holdings, plc and HSBC Bank Middle\n   East Limited are dismissed without prejudice for want of personal jurisdiction.
