Nine months later, the parties reached an agreement and sought to settle the case on a classwide basis. The agreement includes electronically distributing a $10 \"voucher\" to class members who have not opted out and injunctive relief consisting of a promise to abide by the law and implement a compliance program for at least four years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Of the nearly 2 million member class, 452 opted out of the settlement. Fourteen filed objections with the court, one of whom appeared through counsel at the final fairness hearing. Having considered the objections and the arguments of counsel, and although I find that the \"vouchers\" are coupons under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), for the reasons set forth below I also find that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and therefore GRANT final approval. I also GRANT in part the motion for attorney's fees and costs with respect to plaintiff's request for costs and class representative's service award. However, I will defer awarding attorneys' fees because I cannot determine the actual value of the coupon-relief provided by the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Art.com owns and operates several e-commerce websites that sell fine art, posters and other home d\u00e9cor products. Settlement Agreement \u00b6 4.3 (Kim Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 1, Dkt. No. 53-1). Plaintiff James Knapp alleges that he bought a framed poster from Art.com, and that he was induced to do so because Art.com advertised a \"40% off\" sale that expired that day. The next day, it held a new sale at \"45% off.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62 (\"FAC\") (Dkt. No. 6).

But I would like to more fully address the objectors' concerns. Some objected to the \"minimal\" amount offered to class members, especially in comparison to the attorneys' fee award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 62, 63, 73, 74, 75, 76. I discuss the fee award below, and I briefly addressed the \"amount offered\" above. In addition, some objectors stood on the side of Art.com and argued that it is the consumer's responsibility to compare prices, note sales, and try to get the best deal possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 64, 66, 70. In some ways, these concerns reflect the strengths and risks in plaintiff's case. As discussed above, they tend to balance each other out and support approval of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In addition, many objectors noted that the $10 amount will require them to spend more money with Art.com, thereby rewarding it rather than punishing it. Dkt. Nos. 65, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76. But class members are not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to spend more money because they are able to choose from many products that are $10 or less. Takemoto Decl. \u00b6 5. As noted above, I do question whether class members will choose to purchase these particular products, and the slim possibility that class members will spend precisely $10. But this uncertainty mostly relates to the overall value of the settlement, which I discuss below in the context of the attorney's fee request. Class members are faced with a choice, whether to use the voucher, and if so, whether to use it without remitting additional money to Art.com. The vouchers create the possibility that Art.com could ultimately benefit financially from this settlement, but it could also lose approximately $16 million in merchandise, if all class members were to use their vouchers without spending additional money. Given the apparent issues with plaintiff's restitutionary model, I find the risk insufficient to render the settlement unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Two objectors also raised concerns with the adequacy of the notice, specifically because it failed to notify class members of the possibility of\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   and the recipient, did not include instructions to serve objections on settlement administrator and failed to accurately convey the scope of the release. Dkt.

The Notice included appropriate instructions regarding objections and notified class members of the scope of the\n   release. It did, however, fail to notify class members about the possibility of\n   <em>\n    cy pres.\n   </em>\n   Because this possibility only exists with respect to attorney's fees and does not impact the class member's recovery, it did not have to be included in the Notice.

While the National Consumer Law Center would normally be an acceptable\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   beneficiary, class counsel's firm is co-counsel with NCLC in another matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kim Decl. \u00b6 13. Accordingly, NCLC is not an appropriate designee. The parties shall amend the settlement agreement to nominate a different\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   beneficiary in the event that the full amount of attorney's fees are not awarded, and notify the court accordingly when they file their motion for attorney's fees after the redemption period has expired, as discussed below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The remaining arguments of the objectors relate to the attorney's fees and whether this is a coupon settlement under CAFA, both of which I discuss in part II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Absence of Collusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because this settlement was reached prior to certification of the class, I must examine the settlement for evidence of collusion with a higher level of scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Bluetooth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825147\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/935/#p946\">\n    654 F.3d at 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In conducting such an examination, courts must be \"particularly vigilant not only for explicit collusion, but also for more subtle signs that class counsel have allowed pursuit of their own self-interests and that of certain class members to infect the negotiations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825147\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/935/#p946\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Signs of collusion include, but are not limited to: (1) a disproportionate distribution of the settlement fund to counsel; (2) negotiation of a \"clear sailing provision\" according to which defendants agree not to oppose an attorney's fee award up to a certain amount; and (3) an arrangement for funds not awarded to revert to defendants rather than to be added to the settlement fund.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825147\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/935/#p946\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825147\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/935/#p946\">\n    at 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The potential for two of the three signs of collusion exists here. First, the parties do not dispute the presence of a clear sailing provision. Second, I cannot determine whether the attorney's fee award represents a disproportionate amount of the settlement until I know the true value of the settlement. This factor is part of the reason I am deferring ruling on the motion for attorneys' fees. While any funds not awarded to class counsel will not revert to the defendant, they will go to a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   beneficiary rather than the class. On the other hand, the settlement was the result of arm's length negotiations during a full-day mediation with an experienced mediator. My decision to label this a coupon settlement under CAFA and determine attorney's fees accordingly, discussed below, resolves potential issues here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In sum, the\n   <em>\n    Churchill\n   </em>\n   factors support final approval, and the\n   <em>\n    Bluetooth\n   </em>\n   factors do not indicate collusion.

Unlike a Walmart gift card where recipients could purchase necessities such as toilet paper or toothpaste, class members here will be forced to purchase a product that they otherwise may not have purchased.
