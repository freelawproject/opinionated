The Motion to Dismiss presents the question of whether a tribal court dismissal based on tribal statute of limitation grounds should serve as a res judicata bar to the same suit brought under New Mexico law in U.S. Federal District Court. After reviewing the motions, briefs, and applicable law, the Court concludes that the Navajo Nation District Court's dismissal on statute of limitations grounds does not have preclusive effect on the current proceedings, and, therefore, the motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of an automobile collision that occurred on December 30, 2011, in which Decedent, Marcellino Morris, was killed.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 1-1]\n   </strong>\n   The Plaintiff, Decedent's estate, contends that Defendant\n   Giant Four Corners is liable for Decedent's death under two theories of negligence-negligent entrustment based on Defendant's sale of gasoline to Andy Ray Denny, the driver of the other vehicle, who was visibly intoxicated, and negligent hiring, training, and supervision of the employees who sold the gasoline to Denny.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 1-1, p. 1-2]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Franklin Morris, the representative of the estate Plaintiff, and Denny are both members of the Navajo Nation, as was Decedent. Defendant is not a member but is registered to conduct business on the reservation, and the events giving rise to Plaintiff's claims all occurred on the reservation.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 38-1]\n   </strong>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff originally filed suit in the District Court of the Navajo Nation in Crownpoint.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 38-1]\n   </strong>\n   Defendant moved for summary judgment, contending that Plaintiff's suit was filed after the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims under the Navajo Nation Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 N.N.C. \u00a7 602(A)(1).\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 38-2, p. 1-2]\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff argued that his complaint was constructively filed on December 27, 2013, when it was faxed to the Navajo Court Clerk which was within the two-year statute of limitations.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 38-3]\n   </strong>\n   Defendant argued that the effective date of filing was January 13, 2014, based on the date the clerk stamped the document.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 38-2, 38-4]\n   </strong>\n   The District Court of the Navajo Nation ultimately agreed with Defendant and granted the motion for summary judgment.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 38-5]\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff has appealed the decision to the Navajo Nation Supreme Court and is currently awaiting a ruling on that appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the tribal court issued a decision on the summary judgment motion, Plaintiff filed a wrongful death complaint alleging vicarious liability for negligent entrustment of a chattel and direct liability for negligent hiring, training, and supervision in New Mexico state district court.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 1-1]\n   </strong>\n   Defendant removed the case to Federal District Court in the District of New Mexico.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 1]\n   </strong>\n   On November 5, 2015, Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), or, in the alternative to stay the case pending Plaintiff's exhaustion of tribal court remedies, arguing the case should be precluded under the doctrine of res judicata.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 38]\n   </strong>\n   The Court ordered the case stayed until November 29, 2016, when, although the Navajo Nation Supreme Court had not yet issued a decision on the matter, the parties requested that the Court lift the stay and proceed to decide the motion.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 55, 58, 63]\n   </strong>\n   The Court now considers the parties' arguments on Defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's current lawsuit in federal court is merely an attempt to relitigate the claims that were decided on summary judgment in tribal court and should be barred under comity principles and the doctrine of res judicata.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 38]\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff responds that under New Mexico law, a dismissal of a claim as time-barred is not a decision on the merits, and the case should be allowed to proceed under the three-year statute of limitations for wrongful death claims in New Mexico.\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 41]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) allows for the dismissal of a complaint where the plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

One such exception is where the first forum is a federal court in one state, and the second forum is a federal court located in another state. There, the effect of the dismissal in the first forum is determined according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), which delineates the preclusive effect of federal actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

Federal courts generally have discretion in recognizing and enforcing tribal court judgments, but recognition must be refused where: (1) the tribal court lacked personal or subject matter jurisdiction or (2) where the party against whom enforcement is sought was not afforded due process of law.\n   <em>\n    MacArthur v.

Here, the parties have not challenged whether the tribal court had jurisdiction over the matter or whether plaintiff was afforded due process when the tribal court entered its order of dismissal. This Court recognizes the tribal court order as valid and enforceable, such that the tribal court case is deemed dismissed for untimely filing based on the statute of limitations in the Navajo Nation Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, as explained above, the Court concludes that a grant of summary judgment based on failure to comply with the statute of limitations of one jurisdiction does not preclude a subsequent action in another jurisdiction in which a longer limitations period would apply. Because this Court's order on the matter does not pass on the validity of the Navajo Nation Tribal Court's ruling, it does not implicate comity and tribal sovereignty principles. That is, the sole question resolved here is whether a valid, enforceable tribal court order dismissing the tribal court proceedings as untimely has a preclusive effect on a subsequent federal case applying a different, longer statute of limitations. For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Defendant's motion to dismiss will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Giant Four Corners, Inc.'s Rule 12(B)(6) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for Wrongful Death or, in the Alternative, to Stay the Case Pending Plaintiff's Exhaustion of His Tribal Court Remedies\n   <strong>\n    [Doc. 38]\n   </strong>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The Court recognizes that the dismissal is still pending on appeal to the Navajo Nation Supreme Court. However, for purposes of deciding this motion, the Court recognizes the most recent tribal court decision, which was the dismissal of Plaintiff's claims by the tribal district court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
