Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n   Three motions are pending:\n  </author>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   1. Cypress Engine's motion for reconsideration of the court's May 3, 2017 Memorandum and Order interpreting the settlement agreement between Cypress Engine and HDMS, (Docket Entry No. 85);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   2. HDMS's motion for summary judgment on its counterclaims against Cypress Engine, (Docket Entry No. 78); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   3. Powertech Marine's motion for summary judgment on Cypress Engine's claims, (Docket Entry No. 77).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the motions and responses, the record, the arguments of counsel, and the applicable law, the court: denies Cypress Engine's motion for reconsideration; grants in part and denies in part HDMS's motion for summary judgment on its counterclaims, and orders that no later than October 13, 2017, HDMS must submit evidence of the fee amount on the DTPA claim, segregating the fees it seeks for defending the DTPA claim from the other fees it incurred or, in the alternative, that the fees were for claims so interrelated that segregation is not required; and grants Powertech Marine's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The reasons for these rulings are set out below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cypress Engine purchased prechambers, an engine part, from HDMS. After Cypress Engine alleged that the prechambers were defective, Cypress Engine and HDMS negotiated a settlement under which Cypress Engine would return the prechambers within a certain time frame and HDMS would refund the purchase price, less a restocking fee. The negotiations occurred through a series of emails and a signed one-page \"outline\" of the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Cypress Engine had unpaid, past-due invoices from HDMS for transactions unrelated to the prechambers purchases. After the parties signed the settlement agreement, HDMS deducted the past-due invoices from the refunded amounts it paid Cypress Engine for the returned prechambers. Cypress Engine filed this suit against HDMS, alleging that it had breached the settlement agreement by taking the offset. Cypress Engine also sued Powertech Marine, alleging that it manufactured the defective prechambers that HDMS had sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   HDMS counterclaimed, alleging that Cypress Engine had breached the settlement agreement promise not to engage in competing business activities associated with prechambers during the period Cypress Engine was returning prechambers it had bought from HDMS for a refund. HDMS alleged that within days of signing the settlement agreement, Cypress Engine was selling prechambers. HDMS intended to refurbish the returned prechambers and resell them, which would compete with Cypress Engine's sales. HDMS alleges in its counterclaim that Cypress Engine breached the settlement agreement both by selling the prechambers and by filing this lawsuit asserting claims that Cypress Engine had released in the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   HDMS and Cypress Engine cross-moved for summary judgment. (Docket Entry Nos. 53, 55). HDMS moved for summary judgment dismissing Cypress Engine's claims, reserving the right to seek summary judgment on its own counterclaims later. (Docket Entry No. 53). Powertech Marine denies that it was the manufacturer\n   of the prechambers and moved for summary judgment on that basis. (Docket Entry No. 54). On May 3, 2017, the court issued a Memorandum and Order, granting HDMS's motion for summary judgment and dismissing Cypress Engine's claims against HDMS; denying Cypress Engine's motion for summary judgment and motion for leave to amend its answer; and denying Powertech Marine's motion for summary judgment, without prejudice and with leave to reurge. (Docket Entry No. 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Cypress Engine has moved for reconsideration of the court's Memorandum and Order, arguing that the court improperly interpreted the settlement agreement. (Docket Entry No. 85). HDMS has moved for summary judgment on its counterclaims against Cypress Engine. (Docket Entry No. 78). Powertech Marine has filed a second motion for summary judgment, seeking a ruling that it is not a proper party. (Docket Entry No. 77). Cypress Engine responded to both motions, (Docket Entry Nos. 84, 86). The court heard argument from counsel, and both Cypress Engine and HDMS supplemented their briefing. (Docket Entry Nos. 89, 90).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Each motion and response is analyzed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Cypress Engine's Motion for Reconsideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Cypress Engine urges the court to reconsider its interpretation of the parties' settlement agreement and its determination that the agreement consisted of the email exchanges and the one-page outline attached to the final email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Cypress Engine and HDMS agreed that they had a settlement agreement, but they disputed what that agreement consisted of. The court applied federal and Texas law to conclude that \"there is no indication in the email string or the one-page outline that the outline, standing alone, was intended to be the parties' fully integrated agreement.\" (Docket Entry No. 70 at 9). The one-page outline was attached to the final email from Shawn Bailes, a Cypress Engine employee. The email stated that \"[t]he offer and acceptance outlined in this email string constitutes agreement between [HDMS] and Cypress Engine on return quantities, prices, and timetable.\" (Docket Entry No. 70 at 10). The court ruled that the email string and the one-page outline, taken together, constituted the settlement agreement. Cypress Engine moves for reconsideration of this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not formally recognize a motion to reconsider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Mercury Ins.

HDMS's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   HDMS moves for summary judgment on its counterclaims that Cypress Engine breached the parties' settlement agreement by filing the present lawsuit and by selling prechambers during the buyback period. (Docket Entry No. 78 at 8). HDMS asserts damages in the form of the attorneys' fees it incurred in defending this lawsuit and the profits it lost from Cypress Engine's prechambers sales.

Is HDMS Entitled to Summary Judgment on its Counterclaim That Cypress Engine Breached the Settlement Agreement By Filing this Suit?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   HDMS argues that in the May 3, 2017 Memorandum and Order, (Docket Entry No. 70), this court found that, as a matter of law, Cypress Engine released the claims it raises in this lawsuit. (Docket Entry No. 78 at 15-16). Cypress Engine responds that in the Memorandum and Order, the court found that the claims were \"covered by\" the settlement agreement, but the court did not find that Cypress Engine promised not to sue on the claims it asserted in this lawsuit. (Docket Entry No. 84 at 13). Cypress Engine argues that without a covenant not to sue, HDMS cannot recover damages for fees incurred in defending those claims in this lawsuit. (Docket Entry No. 84 at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its May 3, 2017 Memorandum and Order, the court found that \"[t]he uncontroverted\n   record evidence shows that, as a matter of law, Cypress Engine waived its right to assert HDMS's offset as a breach of the settlement agreement.\" (Docket Entry No. 70 at 12). The court found that Cypress Engine's claims for breach of warranty and DTPA violation \"fall squarely within the 'entire issue' that the settlement agreement resolved. Cypress Engine cannot now assert claims it released in its settlement agreement with HDMS.\" (Docket Entry No. 70 at 15). Cypress Engine argues HDMS could raise the release of claims under the settlement agreement as an affirmative defense in this case, but HDMS does not have \"the right to an affirmative action.\" (Docket Entry No. 70 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Cypress Engine cites\n   <em>\n    National Prop.

The court cannot grant HDMS relief on its damages counterclaim that Cypress Engine breached the settlement agreement by filing the present lawsuit. HDMS could, and did, raise the breach of the settlement agreement as an affirmative defense to Cypress Engine's claims, but HDMS cannot proceed with its counterclaim for damages for the breach. HDMS's motion for summary judgment on this counterclaim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Docket Entry No. 78 at 21). In the May 3, 2017 Memorandum and Order, the court found that \"HDMS presents uncontroverted record evidence that Cypress Engine's prechambers sales were a material breach\" of the parties' settlement agreement. (Docket Entry 78 at 21 (citing Docket Entry No. 70 at 13)). The court's ruling on this issue does not limit HDMS to a defense to a claim by Cypress Engine. The undisputed record evidence shows that, as a matter of law, Cypress Engine breached the settlement agreement when it sold prechambers during the buyback period, competing with HDMS's prechambers sales. HDMS is entitled to summary judgment on this counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   HDMS seeks $46,016.40 in damages, the difference between the retail-price-less-restocking-fee amount that HDMS refunded Cypress Engine for the returned prechambers ($98,528.40), and the lower amount that HDMS could have paid for those prechambers by buying them on the wholesale market ($52,512.00). HDMS labels this wholesale price the \"fair market value.\" (Docket Entry No. 78 at 21). HDMS argues that had it known that Cypress Engine would continue to sell prechambers during the time HDMS was repurchasing them from Cypress Engine, HDMS would not have agreed to the repurchase arrangement in the settlement. (Docket Entry No. 78 at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Cypress Engine responds that HDMS failed to mitigate its damages because it did not resell the prechambers it acquired from Cypress Engine in the retail market and deduct the amount from the amount it refunded Cypress Engine. (Docket Entry No. 84 at 16-17). HDMS argues that Cypress Engine failed to plead mitigation as an affirmative defense, forfeiting\n   the right to assert that defense now.

Cypress Engine argued that HDMS failed to mitigate its damages in its response to HDMS's motion for summary judgment, filed on September 20, 2017. (Docket Entry No. 86). Counsel argued the merits at a hearing held on October 2, 2017. (Docket Entry No. 91). The court allowed HDMS to supplement its submissions with added case support. (Docket Entry No. 90). The defense raised issues relating to HDMS's own actions, and HDMS had the information it needed to respond to the defense. The court finds that allowing Cypress Engine to raise the affirmative defense of HDMS's failure to mitigate damages at the summary judgment phase did not result in unfair surprise or prejudice to HDMS. The failure to plead the affirmative defense is excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"The party asserting failure to mitigate has the burden of proving facts establishing lack of mitigation and must prove the amount by which the damages were increased by failure to mitigate.\"\n   <em>\n    Balfour Beatty Rail v.

Tex. 2016). Cypress Engine has met that burden. Cypress Engine has shown that HDMS's damages claim fails to take into account the retail resale value of the 96 returned prechambers. (Docket Entry No. 84 at 16). HDMS argues that it could have bought those 96 prechambers at wholesale for less than the retail amount it paid Cypress Engine for the 96 prechambers, increasing its profit margin. (Docket Entry No. 78 at 21-22). If HDMS had resold the 96 returned prechambers at retail value, it would not have lost money, as Cypress Engine points out. (Docket Entry No. 84 at 16-17). There is no record basis to find that HDMS attempted but was unable to resell the returned prechambers at the retail price. HDMS's failure to mitigate its damages by reselling the 96 prechambers Cypress Engine returned caused the damages HDMS now seeks. HDMS is not entitled to recover damages\n   for Cypress Engine's sale of prechambers during the period it was returning them to HDMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Is HDMS Entitled to Attorneys' Fees?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   HDMS's claim for attorneys' fees is based on two theories: (1) \u00a7 38.001(8) of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code provides for recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees for a breach of contract claim; and (2) Cypress Engine brought its DTPA claim in bad faith, which entitles HDMS to fees and costs under \u00a7 17.50(c) of the Texas Business &amp; Commerce Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In response, Cypress Engine argues that: (1) HDMS failed to plead its attorneys' fees as special damages; (2) Texas law does not support recovering attorneys' fees as actual damages, not only as damages incidental to actual damages, which HDMS cannot prove; (3) \u00a7 38.001(8) does not apply to Cypress Engine because it is an LLC; (4) HDMS failed to present the fee claim to Cypress Engine in a timely manner; (5) \u00a7 17.50(c) does not apply because the court has not yet addressed the merits of Cypress Engine's DTPA claim; (6) if \u00a7 17.50(c) does apply, Cypress Engine's DTPA claim is not groundless and was not brought in bad faith or to harass; (7) HDMS cannot show the amount of attorneys' fees it incurred in defending against Cypress Engine's DTPA claim, since HDMS successfully limited discovery to breach of the settlement agreement; and (8) HDMS seeks unreasonable and excessive fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

Requests for standard disclosures, proof of background facts, depositions of the primary actors, discovery motions and hearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host of other services may be necessary whether a claim is filed alone or with others. To the extent such services would have been incurred on a recoverable claim alone, they are not disallowed simply because they do double service. Accordingly, we reaffirm the rule that if any attorney's fees relate solely to a claim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees. Intertwined facts do not make tort fees recoverable; it is only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be segregated....This standard does not require more precise proof for attorney's fees than for any other claims or expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Frazin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117466\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/413/378/#p413\">\n    413 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   414 (citing\n   <em>\n    Chapa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8334680\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/212/299/#p310\">\n    212 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   313-14 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although HDMS is entitled to recover the attorneys' fees it incurred in defending against Cypress Engine's DTPA claim, HDMS seeks the entire amount of attorneys' fees-$393,300.87-it incurred in defending against all the claims before the court's May 3, 2017 ruling.

Powertech Marine's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Powertech Marine moves for summary judgment dismissing the claims against it on the ground that it is an\n   improper party. (Docket Entry No. 77). Powertech Marine argues that it did not manufacture the prechambers, did not issue a product warranty to Cypress Engine, and did not contract with Cypress Engine. (Docket Entry No. 77 at 5). Powertech Marine asks the court to declare Cypress Engine's continued litigation against Powertech Marine groundless and in bad faith and award Powertech Marine attorneys' fees. (Docket Entry No. 77 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In response, Cypress Engine maintains that there are genuine factual disputes material to deciding whether Powertech is the correct party. Cypress Engine asks to conduct discovery, but does not specify what discovery it needs to respond to the summary judgment motion. (Docket Entry No. 86 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Powertech submitted an affidavit from Steve Powers, the director of Powertech Marine and the coowner of Premium OEM Parts, LLC, known as POEM, stating that POEM manufactured the prechambers at issue. (Docket Entry No. 77-1). Powertech also submitted an affidavit from George Erickson, the president of HDMS. (Docket Entry No. 77-2). Both affiants state that Powertech did not manufacture the prechambers and that HDMS did not purchase any prechambers from Powertech Marine. Powertech Marine also submitted invoices dated from January to December 2013, showing shipments of prechambers from POEM to a company called Premium Power Solutions, then from Premium Power Solutions to Cypress Engine. (Docket Entry No. 77, Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Cypress Engine submitted a number of invoices from the same period between Propulsion Technologies and POEM, sent to POEM at the same address as Powertech Marine. (Docket Entry No 86-1). Some, but not all, of the invoices appear to include prechambers. (Docket Entry No. 86 at 7). But neither Cypress Engine's invoices nor the other evidence it points to show that Powertech Marine is the same entity as POEM. The record evidence provides no explanation of why, after repeatedly being told that POEM was the manufacturer of the prechambers and the correct entity to sue, Cypress Engine refused to at least add POEM as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Cypress Engine has failed to show why it could not respond to Powertech Marine's motion without additional discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Krim v.
