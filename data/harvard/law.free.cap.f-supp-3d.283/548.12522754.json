After due consideration, the Motion is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part. The Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiff's wrongful-dishonor claim and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiff's unjust-enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed. Plaintiff is a Mexican national residing in Chihuahua, Mexico. Plaintiff married Amida Anna Loya Galindo\n   in 2004 and remains married to her. Plaintiff was previously married to Irene Amparan de Villarreal, who died in April of 2000. First Presidio Bank opened for business in 1975 in Presidio, Texas. Big Bend Banks, N.A., merged with First Presidio Bank on or about January of 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff held a checking account and several certificates of deposit with Defendants. The instant case concerns a dispute over five certificates of deposit that First Presidio Bank issued to Plaintiff between April of 1983 and June of 1984. Each of these certificates of deposit were payable to Plaintiff or Irene Amparan de Villarreal, contained language restricting their transferability and assignability, and automatically renewed upon maturity at prevailing market interest rates. Either Plaintiff or Irene Amparan de Villarreal could have redeemed the certificates of deposit without the signature of the other by presenting the original, physical certificate of deposit to the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff placed the physical certificates of deposit in a safe deposit box that he rented at First Presidio Bank when they were first issued. Plaintiff's checking account with the Bank was closed in 2008 with a negative balance. In May of 2014, Plaintiff retrieved the physical certificates of deposit from the safe deposit box. Plaintiff subsequently requested that the Bank redeem the certificates of deposit. The Bank concluded that Plaintiff had already redeemed the certificates of deposit in question and refused. The Bank has no records concerning the certificates of deposit in question other than two microfilm rolls of quarterly records from the mid-1980s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 24, 2015, Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Compl., ECF No. 1. On March 16, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Second Amended Complaint, now the operative complaint in this matter, asserting two causes of action against the Bank: (1) wrongful dishonor under Section 4.402 of the Texas Business &amp; Commerce Code ; and (2) unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Second Am. Compl., ECF No. ECF No. 60. This Court conducted a bench trial of this matter on June 12, 2017 and June 13, 2017. Defendants moved for judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(c) on June 13, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot.

The four certificates of deposit from 1983 indicate that they are \"\n   <em>\n    [p]ayable\n   </em>\n   to the depositor\n   <em>\n    upon presentation and surrender\n   </em>\n   of this certificate.\" Pl.'s Exs. 1-4 (emphasis added). The remaining certificate of deposit from 1984 indicates that First Presidio Bank \"\n   <em>\n    will pay\n   </em>\n   this certificate ...\n   <em>\n    when you present and deliver it\n   </em>\n   to us[.]\" Pl.'s Ex. 5 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The relevant language-\"payable ... upon presentation and surrender\" and \"will pay ... when you present and deliver it\"-contemplates the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of payment at some later date,\n   <em>\n    conditional\n   </em>\n   on the occurrence of events in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. 1-4, 5. Indeed, the holder of a certificate of deposit could choose to never seek payment by allowing the certificate of deposit to renew indefinitely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Ex. 1 (describing how the certificate of deposit \"will be automatically renewed for successive terms\" unless the depositor redeems it or the bank notifies the depositor of its intention to cash in the certificate). Certificates of deposit that can be renewed in perpetuity are dissimilar to checks, for example, which contain instructions to pay in the here and now. Here, the certificates of deposit contain a\n   <em>\n    promise of payment\n   </em>\n   that may only be actuated by some subsequent event.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. 1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Perhaps a closer question is whether the certificates of deposit became \"written instructions to pay money\" when Plaintiff attempted to redeem them in 2014. Crucially here, however, Plaintiff testified that he attempted to redeem the certificates of deposit personally after removing them from the safe deposit box.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Villarreal Dep. 95-96. Requesting payment in person, even while simultaneously presenting documents that evince a\n   <em>\n    promise to pay\n   </em>\n   , is distinct from providing\n   <em>\n    written instructions to pay money\n   </em>\n   , as required to show the existence of an order under Section 3.103. Plaintiff's request to redeem his CDs is unlike other items courts have deemed to be an \"order\" or \"written instruction to pay money\"-for example, a check or money order-because Plaintiff made the payment request in person, and not in writing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmers Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748710\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/361/516/\">\n    260 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   171 ;\n   <em>\n    W &amp; D Acquisition\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=817%20A.2d%2091\">\n    817 A.2d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court accordingly finds that neither Plaintiff's certificates of deposit nor his personal request to redeem the certificates of deposit were \"orders\" within the meaning\n   of the Business and Commerce Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%203.103\">\n    Tex.

Defendants' arguments related to the presumption-of-payment doctrine, statutes of limitation, and laches fail for the reasons stated in this Court's order denying summary judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In a recapitulation of their summary-judgment arguments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants contend that the presumption-of-payment doctrine, the relevant statutes of limitation, and laches bar Plaintiff's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

The Court is aware that, unlike at the summary-judgment stage, when considering a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(c), it does not owe any special inferences to the plaintiff, nor must it consider the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koenig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206554347\">\n    2015 WL 6554347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Nevertheless, the Court's analysis in its order denying summary judgment was not particularly fact-bound, nor did it hinge on granting favorable inferences to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Order of January 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This Court concluded, as a matter of law, that the presumption of payment of debts after a twenty-year lapse has no application in Texas and that Plaintiff's certificates of deposit would suffice to rebut the presumption of payment were it to apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-14. Additionally, the Court found that the relevant time interval for limitations purposes was the less-than-one-year period from Plaintiff's demand for payment from the Bank and Plaintiff's initiation of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   14-17. Accordingly, the Court concluded that Plaintiff's claims were not barred by limitations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Court found that Plaintiff had not engaged in unreasonable delay in asserting his legal or equitable rights, nor had Defendants detrimentally changed their position as the result of any unreasonable delay, nor were there extraordinary circumstances of the type to justify a dismissal based on the laches defense before the statute of limitations had run.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20. Thus, the Court rejected Defendants' invocation of the laches defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court reiterates those conclusions here and incorporates the arguments made in support of those conclusions from its Order of January 17, 2017 in full.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court does not grant judgment as a matter of law to Defendants based on the presumption-of-payment doctrine, limitations, or laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
