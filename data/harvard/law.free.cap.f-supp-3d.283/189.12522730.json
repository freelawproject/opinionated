(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 5 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 73-80). In a prior Opinion and Order, entered on May 10, 2016, the Court largely denied the motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Kumitake Hamada, the alleged owner of the painting when it was sold at auction, and allowed Galin's equitable lien claim to proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galin v.

To the extent relevant here, the Court found that, although the \"entruster provision\" of the Uniform Commercial Code,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20U.C.C.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202-403\">\n    N.Y.

Not surprisingly, Hamada now moves, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for summary judgment on Galin's remaining claims, arguing that they are barred by the entruster provision. (Docket Nos. 52, 53 (\"Def.'s Mem.\")). Hamada also moves, pursuant to Rules 11, 26, and 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for sanctions against Galin. (Docket No. 47; Def.'s Mem. 19-21). For the reasons that follow, Hamada's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, his Rule 37 motion for discovery-related sanctions is DENIED, and his Rule 11 sanctions motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, taken from the admissible materials submitted by the parties, are, unless otherwise noted, undisputed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Costello v.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-19, 20, 27, 31; Docket No. 54 (\"Def.'s SOF\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-8; Docket No. 65 (\"Pl.'s SOF\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-8). The prior month, Ramus had purchased the painting at auction at Christie's for\n   $319,000. (Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 3). Galin never took physical possession of the painting; instead, Ramus retained it to resell for a profit. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9). Ramus did sell the painting, in November 1989, but he did not inform Galin. Ramus sold the painting to the Coe Kerr Gallery as part of a transaction in which Ramus gave the painting and $450,000 to the gallery in exchange for a painting by Frank W. Benson, which Ramus valued at $819,382.15. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; Docket Nos. 54-6 (\"Coe-Kerr Records\") &amp; 54-7 (\"Ramus Records\")). Notably, Ramus had occasionally conducted business with the Coe Kerr Gallery prior to the transaction involving \"Ice Storm\" (Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 14), and this sort of transaction-involving the exchange of paintings by each side-was a practice of both Coe Kerr and Ramus at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the sale, Ramus never paid Galin his portion of the proceeds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). Perhaps relatedly, Ramus around then began to have difficulties, financial and otherwise; he was eventually indicted, convicted of various charges, and sent to prison in 1996. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 22). In the meantime, no later than December 1995, Galin learned that \"Ice Storm\" had been sold to the Coe Kerr Gallery, which, at that point, was no longer in business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28). Galin did not contact any of the former principals of the Coe Kerr Gallery; nor did he register the painting with the Art Loss Register. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28). But over the past twenty years he has \"sporadically\" contacted museums and galleries to inquire about the painting's current location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28). In May 2015, Galin learned that the painting would be sold at auction by Christie's, and he contacted Christie's to assert an ownership interest in the painting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). By agreement, the painting was sold and Christie's currently holds the sale proceeds pending a determination as to which party-Hamada or Galin-had good title to the painting at the time of the sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). Galin alleges that the sale proceeds are rightfully his because he held title to the painting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As noted, Hamada moved to dismiss Galin's claims, arguing-among other things-that they were barred by the entruster provision of the Uniform Commercial Code. (Docket No. 10, at 10-11). Although the Court agreed that was \"likely,\" it refrained from dismissing on the ground that the entruster provision is an affirmative defense and that its application was not clear on the face of the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202733132\">\n    2016 WL 2733132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2. On June 15, 2016, after entry of the Court's Opinion and Order, the parties appeared for a conference to discuss the parameters of discovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 26 (\"CMP\") &amp; 27 (\"Conf. Tr.\")). At the conference, the Court limited discovery \"to the circumstances surrounding the transfer [of the painting] to Coe-Kerr Gallery,\" reasoning that, \"if the entruster provision [did] apply to that transfer and Coe-Kerr Gallery acquired good title, [then] Mr. Galin [h]as no valid claim with respect to Mr. Hamada notwithstanding Mr. Hamada's knowledge or lack thereof of the earlier circumstances surrounding Mr. Ramus.\" (Conf. Tr. 10). The case management plan memorialized this ruling: \"As discussed on the record at the initial conference, discovery will be limited to the circumstances surrounding the transfer of the painting at issue from Mr. Ramus to the Coe-Kerr Gallery and application of the entrustment provision.\" (CMP 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 1, 2016, the date discovery closed, Ramus was deposed by Galin's counsel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 48-9 (\"Supp. Ramus Depo.\")). Right before the deposition, Galin's counsel e-mailed a list of documents that he said might be shown to Ramus during the deposition, including two documents identified as numbers 35 and 36. (Docket No. 55-3, at 2). Hamada's\n   counsel responded, objecting to the use of the documents numbered 35 and 36 on the ground that he had never received any documents numbered above 33A. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Galin's counsel did not use the contested documents during the Ramus deposition, but did produce them two days later. (Docket No. 55-4). During the deposition-which was conducted by Galin's counsel in California (with the other counsel appearing by phone)-Ramus testified that he had received a call the day before from Galin's \"friend\" (and former counsel), David Johnson,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   who \"seemed to indicate that there was some question of Summary Judgment coming up, and they wanted a very specific bit of information regarding to the transaction concerning 'Ice Storm.' \" (Supp. Ramus Depo. 38). Ramus testified that Johnson had told him \"they just wanted to make sure there was some specific piece of information concerning the transaction with Coe Kerr Galleries that would forestall Summary Judgment,\" but Johnson \"didn't tell [Ramus] what that piece of information was.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The day after Ramus's deposition, Hamada's counsel sent a letter to Galin's counsel advising him of Hamada's intent to seek Rule 11 sanctions \"for the frivolous and unsupported allegations in the Complaint\" unless the Complaint was withdrawn. (Docket No. 48-12, at 1). A few days later, Hamada's counsel also sent an e-mail to Galin's counsel asking that counsel provide the \"specifics\" of what \"admissible evidence\" was adduced during discovery in support of Galin's claims. (Docket No. 48-13). Galin's counsel did not respond. (Docket No. 49 (\"Def.'s Sanctions Mem.\") at 5). The present motions followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    THE MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court begins with Hamada's motion for summary judgment.

Apr. 24, 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this case, there is no real dispute that the threshold requirements of the entrustment provision-\"entrustment\" of a good to \"a merchant who deals in goods of that kind\"-are met. First, Galin plainly entrusted the painting to Ramus. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 64 (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"), at 11-15 (making no argument regarding \"entrustment\")). Galin never took physical possession of the painting. Instead, by explicit agreement, Ramus retained possession of the painting and was granted authority to resell it, with the intention of splitting the proceeds with Galin (and a third co-owner). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 7-9; Docket No. 54-3 (Galin-Ramus agreement)). Thus, Galin expressly \"acquiesce[d]\" in the \"retention\" by Ramus of the painting for resale-and thus \"entrusted\" it within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20U.C.C.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202-403\">\n    N.Y. U.C.C. Law \u00a7 2-403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3). The fact that Ramus subsequently failed to pay Galin his portion of the resale proceeds is immaterial.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20U.C.C.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202-403\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (providing that whether the \"possessor's disposition of the good[ ] has been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law\" is irrelevant to the question of whether the good was entrusted). Second, Ramus was concededly \"a merchant who deal[t] in goods of\" the same kind, as he was an art dealer at the time and certainly \"deal[t]\" in paintings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 2; Pl.'s Opp'n 11 (\"It is not disputed that ... Ramus was [an art dealer].\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thus, whether the entrustment provision applies here turns on whether Coe Kerr Gallery was a \"buyer in ordinary course of business.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20U.C.C.%20%C2%A7%202-403\">\n    N.Y. U.C.C. \u00a7 2-403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2).

First, the sale price of the painting was not \"obviously below market.\" On May 23, 1989, Ramus purchased the painting from Christie's at public auction for the price of $319,000. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-19; Def.'s SOF \u00b6 19). A few months later, in November, Ramus traded the painting and $450,000 in exchange for a Frank W. Benson painting, which Ramus valued at $819,382.15. (Def.'s SOF \u00b6 12). Ramus's records from the time show that he valued the Wyeth painting at $338,395.93 at the time of sale (the $30,986.22 difference being accounted for as \"additional charges\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ramus Records 1). Thus, Ramus sold the painting for $19,395.93 more than the price at which he had purchased it at auction only months earlier-a price that cannot be said to be \"obviously\" below market value. Notably, if anything, Galin himself seems to concede the point, asserting that the \"price paid for Ice Storm\" was \"high\" and \"grossly exaggerated.\" (Pl.'s Opp'n 14). But-separate and apart from the fact that Galin fails to support that assertion with admissible evidence-it is not clear how that could be the case, as Ramus purchased the painting in a public auction for only slightly less than the resale price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At a minimum, there is no evidence in the record that Ramus resold the Wyeth painting for anything close to a \"bargain\" price that would have put the Coe Kerr Gallery on notice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3905540\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/937/390/#p423\">\n    937 F.Supp.2d at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a \"red flag\" where the purchaser valued the works \"at markedly\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   prices shortly after acquiring them\" and where a \"significant discrepancy\" existed between the price paid and an art expert's fair market value appraisal (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    Kozar v.

Ct. 2011) (finding a potential \"red flag\" based on a \"bargain price\" where Christie's \"set opening bids on [the] painting at $40,000\" but the purchasers did not deny paying \"only $1600 for the painting\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, there is no evidence that the transaction between Ramus and Coe Kerr Gallery deviated from their prior transactions or general practices. In his deposition, Ramus testified that \"[t]here were no specific types of transactions. We did any kind of transaction that I could imagine doing,\" including trading paintings, exchanging cash, and \"combinations of that.\" (Docket No. 54-2 (\"Ramus Depo.\"), at 36-37). Consistent with that testimony, Ramus exchanged the Benson painting for cash and another painting only one year later. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ramus Records 1). Similarly, Warren Adelson, a principal of the Coe Kerr Gallery at the time of the transaction at issue, testified that the Gallery had a practice of trading pictures with other dealers: \"[G]enerally, when dealers trade pictures, it's, I'll give you two cats for a dog. That kind of thing.... Sometimes it involves money, sometimes-there are all kinds of variables with situations like that.\" (Docket No. 54-8 (\"Adelson Depo.\"), at 13). Notably, Galin once against seems to concede the point, acknowledging that \"[t]ransactions involving the exchange of paintings with other art merchants was a practice of both the Coe Kerr Galley and Ramus at the time.\" (Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 15). Accordingly, the \"Ice Storm\" transaction did not differ from prior transactions in any way that did alert, or should have alerted, the Coe Kerr Gallery that Ramus lacked authority to sell the painting.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201108526\">\n    2009 WL 1108526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (reaching a similar conclusion where \"[t]here [was] no allegation that the negotiations or procedure of the sale differed from previous-and uncontroversial-agreements between [the parties]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With respect to the third kind of red flag, Galin's assertion that the Coe Kerr Gallery knew about Ramus's alleged financial difficulties can be swiftly rejected. In his declaration, Galin characterizes \"Ramus's own conduct\" as the \"primary red flag,\" claiming that Ramus's financial problems began as far back at October 1987. (Galin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30). Galin adds that the \"art world in general ... surely knew about\" Ramus's financial issues. (Pl.'s Opp'n 15). But Galin provides no record citation or documentation to support these assertions. To the contrary, he acknowledges that Ramus, at the time, was \"lying as he needed in order to keep going\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and that he himself-despite being a lifelong friend-was in the dark as to Ramus's financial difficulties. (Docket No. 54-4 (\"Galin Depo.\"), at 33). Ramus, meanwhile, testified that he \"would have done [his] very best for no one to know because who's going to do business with [him] if they kn[e]w [he was] in distress.\" (Ramus Depo. 91). Indeed, he testified that he \"tr[ied] to keep up a strong front\" because he viewed the market downturn as short-term and believed it \"would straighten itself out and [ ] everybody would get paid everything they were owed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91, 93). In any event, whenever Ramus's financial difficulties began (and the record on that is not clear), there is no evidence to suggest that the Coe Kerr Gallery had any reason to believe Ramus was in trouble. In fact, Adelson testified that he did not have any suspicions about Ramus's \"honesty and integrity\" when he dealt during the relevant time period. (Adelson Depo. 20). And even after the sale, Ramus\n   was able to make large cash payments to the Coe Kerr Gallery, supporting the conclusion that Ramus was not yet in financial trouble-as well as the conclusion that the Gallery would not have had any reason to suspect that he was in financial trouble. (Coe Kerr Records 2-8). Five years later, of course, Ramus was indicted and filed for bankruptcy. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42, 52). But there is no evidence to suggest that the Coe Kerr Gallery had reason to know of Ramus's financial troubles at the time of the sale (if indeed he even had any at that time).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Joseph P.

The absence of that red flag alone compels the conclusion that the Gallery was a buyer in the ordinary course for one simple reason: Ramus\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   the owner of the painting (albeit only in part) and\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   actual authority to sell it. That is, had the Gallery investigated the provenance of the painting prior to the purchase (given the passage of time, it is not clear whether or to what extent it did), it would have discovered: that Ramus had, in fact, purchased the painting at public auction from Christie's only a few months earlier (for not much less than it was being sold); that he was, in fact, a partial owner of the painting; and that his co-owners had, in fact, granted him authority, in writing, to resell the painting (consistent with earlier arrangements for other works). (Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5, 8; Docket Nos. 5-1, 54-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Galin does allege that he and Ramus had an additional oral agreement requiring his consent prior to any sale of the painting (Compl. \u00b6 26), but-putting aside the absence of any evidence to support the existence of such an agreement-there is no evidence whatsoever that the Coe Kerr Gallery knew, or should have known, about it. Indeed, the only evidence in the record regarding the Gallery's knowledge-namely, Adelson's deposition testimony-supports the conclusion that the Gallery did not know about Galin or the fact that Ramus was only a partial owner of the painting. (Adelson Depo. 25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 17). In short, there is no evidence that anything about the transaction would have given the Coe Kerr Gallery reason to believe that Ramus did not own the painting (because he did) or that he did not enjoy the right to sell it (because he did).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3905540\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/937/390/#p423\">\n    937 F.Supp.2d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a red flag where the paintings were listed \"as owned by SOG in the exchange paperwork-even though the provenance and cataloguing materials unmistakably identified Davis or the Davis estate as the owner\"). The fact that Ramus did not follow through on his private agreement with Galin (and the other co-owner), although regrettable, does not change that fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Graffman v.

Galin's remaining arguments against summary judgment are either irrelevant or unavailing. First, Galin argues that, because\n   <em>\n    Hamada\n   </em>\n   is an art dealer,\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   had a duty to investigate the provenance of the painting. (Pl.'s Opp'n 13-14). But, as the Court has previously noted, the circumstances of the transfer to Hamada are irrelevant to whether Galin has a valid claim against him. (CMP 7; Conf. Tr. 3). That is, whether the entrustment provision applies turns exclusively on the circumstances of the Ramus-Coe Kerr Gallery transaction; and if it does apply, then good title to the painting passed to the Coe Kerr Gallery, and Galin lost his interest in the painting (and, by extension, lacks standing to sue anyone other than Ramus). Second, Galin claims that the Coe Kerr Gallery could not be a buyer in the ordinary course of business because \"Ramus owed them money at the time of the transaction,\" referring to a $90,000 debt noted on one of the invoices contained in the record. (Pl.'s Opp'n 14). It is true that the Uniform Commercial Code excludes from its definition of a \"buyer in the ordinary course\" any \"transfer ... in total or partial satisfaction of a money debt.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20U.C.C.%20%C2%A7%201-201\">\n    N.Y. U.C.C. \u00a7 1-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(9). But Galin's argument is premised on a (hopefully inadvertent) mischaracterization of the record, as the referenced invoice post-dates the relevant sale and appears to have been prepared by Ramus in conjunction with his resale of the\n   <em>\n    Benson\n   </em>\n   painting in 1990. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ramus Records 1 (noting that the Benson painting was acquired from the Coe Kerr Gallery and that, as of February 1,\n   <em>\n    1991\n   </em>\n   , \"$90,000 remains due to Coe Kerr Gallery\")). Galin does not cite (and, unsurprisingly, the Court could not find) any authority for the proposition that a debt arising\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   a sale undermines a party's status as a buyer in the ordinary course of business with respect to\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the final analysis, Galin's arguments against application of the entrustment provision here boil down to nothing more than speculation and a conclusory assertion that something was amiss. Tellingly, when asked whether he had \"any reason to believe that Coe Kerr Gallery acted criminally,\" Galin responded: \"We're going back to my gut feeling.\" (Galin Depo. 83). But such unsupported suspicions are patently insufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. While the Court is sympathetic to Galin's predicament, these are precisely the circumstances in which the entruster provision is meant to operate: Galin assumed the risk when he gave the painting to Ramus to resell and, unfortunately, that risk did not pay off. To the extent that Galin has a remedy at this late date, it is from Ramus, not Hamada. The Court thus concludes that Coe Kerr Gallery was a buyer in the ordinary course of business and that the entruster provision applies. Accordingly, Hamada's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    THE MOTIONS FOR SANCTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court turns, then, to Hamada's two motions for sanctions. The first, under\n   Rules 26 and 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is for alleged discovery violations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 52; Def.'s Mem 19-21). The second, under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, seeks sanctions against Galin for having filed and maintained this action and, relatedly, for his alleged failure to conduct any preliminary investigation before filing his complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 47; Def.'s Sanctions Mem.). The Court will address each motion in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Discovery Sanctions Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Hamada's motion for discovery-related sanctions can be swiftly rejected. Hamada's motion is based on two alleged violations: Galin's failure to produce certain documents (including those numbered 35 and 36) prior to the close of discovery and Galin's counsel's alleged failure during the Ramus deposition to obey the Court's order limiting discovery to the circumstances surrounding the sale of the painting from Ramus to the Coe Kerr Gallery. (Def.'s Sanctions Mem. 6-11). With respect to the former, however, Hamada does not identify what the documents at issue are, let alone how they are relevant to the issues in this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Valentini v. Citigroup, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-CV-1355 (JMF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204407065\">\n    2013 WL 4407065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 16, 2013) (noting that, to warrant sanctions under Rules 26 and 37, the moving party must show, among other things, \"that the missing evidence is 'relevant' to the party's claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find it would support that claim or defense\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). And, in any event, given the Court's ruling on summary judgment, any violation by Galin was plainly harmless-and thus not a basis for sanctions under Rule 37.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). As for the latter, although Galin's counsel could surely have done a better job of hewing to the line between permissible and impermissible discovery, the Court is not persuaded that counsel went far enough over the line to warrant sanctions. For one thing, many of the questions flagged by Hamada as objectionable-for example, questions about the operations of Ramus's business at the time (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. 16-17); about Ramus's prior relationship, if any, with Adelson (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22); about Ramus's prior dealings with the Coe Kerr Gallery (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25); and about the usual way Ramus structured his art transactions (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27, 36)-did, in fact, relate to the existence or non-existence of red flags surrounding the Ramus-Coe Kerr Gallery transaction. For another, as the Court noted previously, Hamada's counsel's own conduct during the Ramus deposition was not entirely praiseworthy, as he made \"repeated\" and unwarranted \"objections as to form-unconnected to the Court's order with respect to the scope of discovery.\" (Docket No. 61). Accordingly, to the extent that there is any basis for sanctions under Rules 26 and 37 -and it is debatable whether there is-the Court exercises its discretion and declines to impose them here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    S. New England Tel. Co. v. Global NAPs Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794549\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/123/#p143\">\n    624 F.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that the decision whether to impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 37 is left to the discretion of the district court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Rule 11 Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   By contrast, Hamada's Rule 11 motion requires a more extended discussion. To the extent relevant here, Rule 11(b) provides that, \"[b]y presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper ... an attorney ... certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances ... the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will\n   likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2), (b)(3). If a court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, Rule 11(c) authorizes the court to \"impose an appropriate sanction.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(1). A sanction, however, \"must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. The sanction may include nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of part or all of the reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses directly resulting from the violation.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rule 11 thus imposes an \"affirmative duty on each attorney to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the viability of a pleading before it is signed.\"\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez v.

Put simply, as the Court intimated in its earlier Opinion and Order, although it seemed \"likely\" based on Galin's own allegations that the entruster provision would apply to bar Galin's claims against Hamada, it could not be said-in the first instance-that application of the provision was \"patently clear.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202733132\">\n    2016 WL 2733132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

That is because, based on amendments to Rule 11 in 1993, \"a litigant's obligations with respect to the contents of ... papers are not measured solely as of the time they are filed with or submitted to the court, but include reaffirming to the court and advocating positions contained in those pleadings and motions after learning that they cease to have any merit.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, Advisory Committee Notes, 1993 Amendment, subdivisions (b) &amp; (c). In light of those amendments, a party is not immune from sanctions merely because it \"had a reasonable basis at the time\" it filed its initial pleading \"to believe\" that its claim was valid.\n   <em>\n    Bunnell v.

As an initial matter, it could not have been clearer going into discovery that, if the entruster provision applied, Galin had no viable legal claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202733132\">\n    2016 WL 2733132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"The Court agrees with Defendant that, if the entruster provision applies to the 1989 sale from Ramus to Coe-Kerr, Plaintiff's claims fail as a matter of law-without regard for the circumstances under which Defendant himself procured the painting.\"). (\n   <em>\n    See also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Conf. Tr. 10 (\"[F]or the reasons I articulated in my opinion ... if the entruster provision does apply to that transfer and Coe-Kerr Gallery acquired good title, [then] Mr. Galin [h]as no valid claim with respect to Mr. Hamada....); CMP 7 (limiting discovery to the circumstances surrounding the transfer of the painting from Ramus to Coe Kerr Gallery)). And, as Hamada lays out in his Rule 11 motion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Sanctions Mem. 3-5) and as the Court discussed above in connection with summary judgment, discovery yielded no admissible evidence whatsoever to support Galin's assertion that there were red flags surrounding the transfer of the painting from Ramus to the Coe Kerr Gallery. In fact, discovery yielded quite the opposite: myriad evidence\n   <em>\n    supporting\n   </em>\n   application of the entruster provision here (namely, a\n   fair purchase price, no knowledge of Ramus's financial difficulties, an exchange structured in a manner standard for the parties, etc.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Notably, Galin himself acknowledged the absence of factual support for his position when he testified that, beyond his \"gut feeling,\" he had nothing \"specifically ... to point [to]\" that showed Coe Kerr acted fraudulently in connection with the painting transfer. (Galin Depo. 82-83). Yet Galin and his counsel continued to represent to the Court, both orally and in his opposition to Hamada's motion for summary judgment, that a legal and factual basis existed to support his Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 58, at 4 (counsel stating to the Court that \"we have gathered some evidence from Mr. R[am]us which I think is very helpful to our cause, to our claims\"); Pl.'s Opp'n 10-15). It is particularly telling that the majority of Galin's opposition to Hamada's motion for summary judgment is devoted to irrelevant issues, such as\n   <em>\n    Hamada's\n   </em>\n   procurement of the painting (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n 2-10), and that the relevant portion of the opposition lacks even one citation to the record (or, really, to any applicable case law). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15). Quite simply, apart from conclusory statements-for example, that \"there were numerous red flags\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15)-Galin has never once, in any manner, produced an admissible piece of evidence weighing against application of the entruster provision here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that, once discovery closed, Galin and his counsel had an obligation under Rule 11 to withdraw the Complaint because they knew-by that point if not earlier-that their allegations on the central (and dispositive) issue in the case were \"utterly lacking in support.\"\n   <em>\n    StreetEasy, Inc. v.

But Galin points to no admissible evidence in support of that assertion except the fact that Ramus resold the Benson painting one year after the Coe Kerr Gallery transaction for $300,000 cash and a \"[p]ainting valuing a minimum of $100,000 at cost\"-that is, less than half of what he had paid for it a year earlier. (Ramus Records at 1-3). But Galin himself points to plausible explanations for that markdown-namely, a five-year decline in the art market prompted by a stock market downturn and Ramus's financial difficulties. (Galin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30). In any event, Coe Kerr Gallery would have had no knowledge of the subsequent sale (which post-dated the sale of the Wyeth painting at issue). And notably, while Galin provides no admissible evidence regarding the value of the Benson painting, Hamada provides evidence that a similarly sized Benson, estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million, sold for $4,182,500 in a Sotheby's auction in 1995 (when the art market had presumably rebounded from the earlier slump).
