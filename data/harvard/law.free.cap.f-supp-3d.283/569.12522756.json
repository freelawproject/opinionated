Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The crux of the Plaintiff's argument for remand is that negligence claims against nonsubscribing\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   employers are nonremovable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201445\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Federal district courts in Texas are split as to whether nonsubscriber negligence claims arise under the TWCA and must be remanded when removed from state court.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pyle v. Beverly Enters.-Tex., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829398\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/826/206/#p209\">\n    826 F.Supp. 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209 (N.D.

Tex. 2000) (finding that nonsubscriber negligence claims do arise under the TWCA and are nonremovable).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff offers two arguments in favor of remand. First, Plaintiff argues that her\n   claims do in fact arise under the TWCA, rendering them nonremovable pursuant to \u00a7 1445(c). Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 16-22. Next, Plaintiff argues that \"the division between district courts ... creates an ambiguity in the law sufficient to warrant remand.\" Reply 1, 3. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's claims do not arise under the TWCA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff primarily argues that negligence claims against a nonsubscriber arise under the TWCA because such claims require the resolution of a substantial question under the TWCA. Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 19-22. Defendants, on the other hand, essentially argue that negligence claims against a nonsubscriber are common law claims rather than claims created by the TWCA. Resp. 5-6. Defendants further argue that nonsubscriber negligence claims do not require the resolution of a substantial question under the TWCA because they do not implicate a purely legal issue involving interpretation of the TWCA's provisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164328\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/125/209/#p210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has held that \"arising under\" in \u00a7 1445(c) should be construed in the same manner as \"arising under\" in \u00a7 1331, the federal question statute.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The Court notes, however, that wholesale application of the case-law construction of \u00a7 1331 to \u00a7 1445(c) gives rise to several difficulties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Federal question jurisdiction exists in cases \"arising under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, it is axiomatic that \"federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,\" and that \"it should be presumed that a cause lies outside of that limited jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v.

Accordingly, there is a presumption against a broad construction of \"arising under\" in the context of \u00a7 1331.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v.

Consequently, applying the restrictive construction of \"arising under\" in \u00a7 1331 to \u00a7 1445(c) results in a restrictive reading of \"arising under\" in \u00a7 1445(c). That reading counsels in favor of removability and conflicts with the Fifth Circuit's admonition that courts \"should read \u00a7 1445(c) broadly\" in favor of remand.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1801841\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/931/1086/#p1092\">\n    931 F.2d at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Another difficulty relates to the actual meaning of \"arising under\" in the federal question statute. In that context, \"arising under\" means (1) federal law creates the cause of action or (2) the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on the resolution of a substantial question of federal law.\n   <em>\n    Empire Healthchoice Assur., Inc. v. McVeigh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276298\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/677/#p690\">\n    547 U.S. 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276298\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/677/#p690\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276298\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/677/#p690\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). The Fifth Circuit, however, has not had occasion to apply the substantial-question basis to \u00a7 1445(c). Rather, in cases where the Fifth Circuit addressed the construction of \"arising under\" in \u00a7 1445(c), it focused on whether the TWCA created the cause of action at issue.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ehler v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318953\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/66/771/#p773\">\n    66 F.3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773 (5th Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he focus must be on the source of the right of action.\"). Accordingly, there is no certainty that the Fifth Circuit would even apply, in some modified form, the substantial-question basis to \u00a7 1445(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Setting aside these observations, and assuming the construction of \"arising under\" in \u00a7 1331 applies to this case, the Court nevertheless agrees with Defendants that\n   Plaintiff's claims do not arise under the TWCA. Applying the \"arising under\" case law from the federal question context to \u00a7 1445(c), there are two bases that potentially bar removal to federal court-and, in turn, necessitate remand of cases removed from state court-under \u00a7 1445(c) : (1) the TWCA creates Plaintiff's cause of action; or (2) Plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of the TWCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McVeigh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276298\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/677/#p690\">\n    547 U.S. at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276298\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/677/#p690\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper v.

R &amp; L Carriers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. EP-17-CV-122-PRM, slip op. at 7 (W.D. Tex. June 12, 2017) (same). Although Plaintiff appears to concede that the TWCA does not create her cause of action, and thus, remand is not required pursuant to the first \"arising under\" basis, the Court examines both bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The TWCA does not create a cause of action for negligence against nonsubscribing employers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Concerning the first \"arising under\" basis, Plaintiff correctly observes that the TWCA \"does not expressly create a cause of action against a non-subscribing employer.\" Mot. \u00b6 19. Indeed, while the TWCA deprives nonsubscribers of certain common law defenses and requires an injured employee to prove the nonsubscriber's negligence, it does not contain language that specifically authorizes an employee to bring suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Labor Code \u00a7 406.033(a), (d). Moreover, the TWCA is silent as to what in particular an employee must prove to recover from a nonsubscriber for a workplace injury. Instead, the statute simply states that the employee must \"prove negligence of the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9187497\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/195/#p203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 406.033(d). Consequently, the Court agrees with another Judge of this Court that \"the most natural reading of [ \u00a7 406.003 ] is that it assumes such a right to sue already exists and thus comes from the common law.\"\n   <em>\n    Poljanec v. Home Depot U.S.A. Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. SA-14-CV-318-XR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202050946\">\n    2014 WL 2050946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D. Tex. May 19, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   That reading is supported by the statutory structure of the TWCA applicable to employees who are covered by workers' compensation insurance. Under the TWCA, workers' compensation benefits are the exclusive remedy for a work-related injury suffered by an employee of a subscribing employer. Tex. Labor Code \u00a7 408.001. The TWCA's provisions define what types of benefits are available and explain how to compute the amount of benefits an injured employee may claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202050946\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 408.001 - 408.222. Moreover, the TWCA contains detailed provisions describing compensation procedures an injured employee must follow to file a claim and receive payment of his or her benefits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202050946\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 409.001-409.024. The TWCA also outlines the complex administrative process relating to the adjudication of disputes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202050946\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 410.001-410.308. Such an extensive regulatory framework stands in stark contrast to \u00a7 406.033's minimal provisions that merely bar nonsubscribers from raising certain common law defenses. That difference indicates that a nonsubscriber's employee must look outside the TWCA's framework to recover for a work-related injury, and supports the interpretation that the common law creates the cause of action for negligence against a nonsubscriber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, dicta from both the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court of Texas strongly suggest that the TWCA does not create a cause of action for negligence against a nonsubscriber. In\n   <em>\n    American International Specialty Lines Insurance Co. v.

While these pronouncements are not dispositive here, they support the finding that the TWCA does not create a cause of action for negligence against a nonsubscriber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, based on the language in \u00a7 406.033, the TWCA's statutory structure, and dicta from the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court of Texas, the Court concludes that the TWCA does not create a cause of action for negligence against a nonsubscriber. Rather, a negligence claim against a nonsubscriber is a common law claim against which a nonsubscriber is barred from asserting certain defenses.

Recently, courts addressing whether negligence claims against a nonsubscriber arise under the TWCA have dealt with the issue in one of two ways. Some courts, relying on the fact that the Fifth Circuit has not definitively decided the issue, point to the split among district courts and conclude that there is ambiguity in the law.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Glenn v.

Therefore, in light of the fact that almost every court to decide the issue in recent years has ruled that negligence claims against a nonsubscriber do not arise under the TWCA, Plaintiff's argument that there is a split among the courts is substantially undercut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, while the Fifth Circuit has expressed that \"it is axiomatic that ambiguities are generally construed against removal,\"\n   <em>\n    Butler v.

Indeed, when a federal court entertains a case without subject matter jurisdiction, \"it is nothing less than an unconstitutional usurpation of state judicial power.\" 13 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3522 (3d ed. 2008). For example, courts construe ambiguity in state law in favor of remand when improper joinder of a defendant is at issue because it implicates the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travis v.

To the contrary, the Fifth Circuit has found that \"the statutory restriction against removal is not a matter of substantive jurisdiction, but rather a procedural defect.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Unlike a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which requires remand if discovered any time before final judgment, a procedural defect is waivable.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515693\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/985/783/#p786\">\n    985 F.2d at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, while \u00a7 1445 bars the removal of certain cases, it does not prohibit a plaintiff from bringing those cases in federal court initially.\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Ins. Co. v. Trejo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525527\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/39/585/#p588\">\n    39 F.3d 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588 (5th Cir. 1994). Consequently, claims arising under workers' compensation laws are not claims that federal courts lack jurisdiction to adjudicate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Rather, the Fifth Circuit has explained that the underlying policy of \u00a7 1445(c) is based on states' enactment of \"expedient and less expensive administrative procedures for adjudicating claims of injured workers.\"\n   <em>\n    Patin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641809\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/782/#p788\">\n    77 F.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Workers' compensation claims are made nonremovable \"to encourage the use of [those] administrative procedures and to prevent the undue burden that is placed on the worker when an action is removed to federal court, where such procedures generally do not apply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641809\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/782/#p788\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That policy \"does not appertain, though, when the cause of action at issue is independent of the administrative procedures applicable to a state workers' compensation claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641809\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/782/#p788\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, given this Court's finding that nonsubscriber negligence claims are common law claims that are independent from the TWCA's administrative procedures, the policy behind \u00a7 1445(c) is inapplicable to such claims. Accordingly, while ambiguity should generally be construed in favor of remand, the Court concludes that the concerns animating that principle are not strong in this particular case because the Court's subject matter jurisdiction is not at issue and because nonsubscriber negligence claims are not the type of claim that \u00a7 1445(c) is aimed at making nonremovable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Consequently, based on this Court's obligation to decide the issue, the growing consensus among federal district courts in Texas that nonsubscriber negligence claims do not arise under the TWCA, and the policy underlying \u00a7 1445(c), the Court declines Plaintiff's invitation to remand this case based solely on perceived ambiguity in the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Indeed, whereas the substantial-question basis in the context of \u00a7 1331 involves a federal issue embedded in a state-law claim, claims such as those in this case involve a state workers' compensation issue embedded in a state common-law claim.
