(Talbots) by two former Talbots employees, individually and on behalf of a proposed class of employees, alleging various violations of the California Labor Code (the\n   <em>\n    Lopez Action\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Talbots sought defense costs and indemnification for the\n   <em>\n    Lopez Action\n   </em>\n   from its insurer, defendant AIG Specialty Insurance Company (AIG), which in turn denied coverage under the terms of Talbots' policy. Talbots responded by bringing suit in this court, alleging breach of contract (Count I) and breach of the implied covenant of good\n   faith and fair dealing (Count II).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   AIG now moves to dismiss the Complaint, arguing that the claims brought against Talbots in the\n   <em>\n    Lopez Action\n   </em>\n   fall within various exclusions to the AIG Policy. The court agrees and will grant the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Talbots is a specialty retailer and marketer of women's apparel, accessories, and shoes. In October of 2014, Talbots' parent company, Tailor Holdings, LLC (Tailor), purchased a Management Liability for Private Companies policy from AIG (the Policy). The Policy, which applied to Tailor's subsidiaries (among them Talbots\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), included three separate coverage sections: 1) the Directors and Officers Liability Coverage Section (the D &amp; O Coverage Section); 2) the Employment Practices Liability Coverage Section (the EPL Coverage Section); and 3) the Fiduciary Liability Coverage Section. The parties agree that only the first two coverage sections are implicated in the current dispute. The Policy, in effect from October 1, 2014, to October 1, 2015, was issued in Massachusetts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Policy Exclusions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both the D &amp; O Coverage Section and the EPL Coverage Section require AIG to advance defense costs and pay losses incurred by an insured arising from claims against the insured, subject to the exclusions and exceptions that are at issue in this case. Exclusion 4(q) of the D &amp; O Coverage Section provides that AIG is not liable for \"Loss in connection with any Claim made against an Insured ... alleging, arising out of, based upon, or attributable to the employment of any individual or any employment practice, including, but not limited to, wrongful dismissal, discharge or termination, discrimination, retaliation or other employment-related claim.\" This provision sweeps broadly: any claim against the insured \"arising out of, based upon, or attributable to\" the insured's employment practices is excluded from coverage under the relevant section.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    That civil action, currently pending in Alameda County Superior Court in California, is\n    <em>\n     Ricardo Lopez, et al. v.

The specific counts alleged in the complaint, and their corresponding provisions of the California Labor Code, were as follows: 1) Unpaid Overtime (\u00a7\u00a7 510 and 1198); 2) Unpaid Meal Period Premiums (\u00a7\u00a7 226.7 and 512(a) ); 3) Unpaid Rest Period Premiums (\u00a7 226.7); 4) Unpaid Minimum Wages (\u00a7\u00a7 1194, 1197, and 1197.1); 5) Final Wages Not Timely Paid (\u00a7\u00a7 201 and 202); 6) Wages Not Timely Paid During Employment (\u00a7 204); 7) Non-Compliant Wage Statements (\u00a7 226(a) ); 8) Failure to Keep Requisite Payroll Records (\u00a7 1174(d) ); and 9) Unreimbursed Business Expenses (\u00a7\u00a7 2800 and 2802). In Count 10, the\n    <em>\n     Lopez\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs also alleged that Talbots engaged in unfair business practices in violation of Section 17200 of the California Business and Professions Code because the alleged employment law violations allowed Talbots to \"unlawfully gain[ ] an unfair advantage over other businesses.\"\n    <em>\n     Lopez\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 116. In broad terms, the\n    <em>\n     Lopez Action\n    </em>\n    alleged that Talbots \"engaged in a uniform policy and systematic scheme of wage abuse against their hourly-paid or non-exempt employees within the State of California,\" a scheme that involved \"\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , failing to pay them for all hours worked, missed meal periods and rest breaks in violation of California law.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 27.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    After Talbots notified AIG of the lawsuit, AIG denied coverage by letter dated September 30, 2015. According to the Complaint, AIG took the position that the\n    <em>\n     Lopez Action\n    </em>\n    did not constitute an employment claim as defined by the EPL Coverage Section. Talbots asked AIG to reconsider its position and to examine coverage under the D &amp; O Section. AIG again denied coverage, stating that coverage under the D &amp; O Section was unavailable because the\n    <em>\n     Lopez Action\n    </em>\n    triggered that section's exclusion for claims \"alleging, arising out of, based upon, or attributable to\" the employment practices of the insured.

Counts 5-9 allege violations of state labor regulations that govern how employers must disburse wages, maintain records relating to employees, and reimburse employees for business expenses. Talbots cites no authority or persuasive rationale for the proposition that these claims do not also \"aris[e] out of,\" or are \"attributable to,\" Talbots' \"employment of any individual or any employment practice\" under the terms of Section 4(q) of the D &amp; O Coverage Section.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Nor are the claims advanced in these counts included in the definition of Employment Practice Violations in Section 2(b) of the EPL Coverage Section.

However, Talbots makes no compelling argument for why this distinction matters when interpreting the scope of the exclusionary clauses in the insurance policy at issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Furthermore, the unfair business practices claim at issue in the\n    <em>\n     Lopez Action\n    </em>\n    alleges that Talbots gained an unfair advantage over other businesses solely because of the employment-related violations enumerated in Counts 1-9. In other words, Count 10 is merely an alternative statutory theory of recovery for the same alleged injuries to Talbots' employees-injuries which clearly arose out of the company's employment and labor practices.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Ultimately, this is not a case where the allegations in the California Superior Court lawsuit \"are 'reasonably susceptible' of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms.\"\n    <em>\n     Ruggerio Ambulance Serv., Inc. v.

This argument is completely beside the point. The D &amp; O Coverage Section contains a broad exclusion for any claims arising out of employment practices, presumably\n     <em>\n      because\n     </em>\n     there is a separate section of the policy (the EPL Section) which deals with employment practices violations and defines with specificity what forms of violations are covered under the policy.
