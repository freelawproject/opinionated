In the petition before this Court, Watson alleges that his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated because (1) his conviction was based on perjured testimony; (2) his conviction was based upon evidence that the prosecution knew or should have known was false; and (3) the prosecution withheld material exculpatory evidence. Watson's attack on his conviction centers on the recantation testimony of a critical prosecution witness, Christine Holloway. For the reasons stated below, Watson's petition should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 9, 1991, Mark Johnson was shot and killed at 1961 Schieffelin Avenue in the Bronx, New York.

(\"Resp't Appeal Br.\"), at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 13, 1993, following a jury trial, Watson was convicted of murder in the second degree. (Tr. 879, 946:6-949:7). Judgment in the case was entered on November 23, 1993, and Watson was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Tr. 543:6-544:19, 575:23-576:2). According to Holloway, on the night of the shooting, she was returning home from her job as a corrections officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   528:14-529:13). While driving on Schieffelin Avenue in the Bronx, Holloway saw a BMW automobile with its lights on parked near a fire hydrant and someone standing beside the car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   530:2-531:15). Holloway then turned right from Schieffelin Avenue into her building's parking lot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   530:2-532:4). As Holloway was driving forward in the parking lot and preparing to\n   back her car into a parking space, another person wearing a \"dark-colored hooded jacket\" or \"sweater hood\" and \"dark pants\" walked in front of her car, whom Holloway ultimately identified as the petitioner. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    531:24-533:5, 534:11-17, 543:25-544:19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Holloway testified that \"their face was in a scowl, like they was angry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   534:7). She described his eyebrows as being \"like a hood over [his] eyes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   535:16-17). There was nothing blocking her view of him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   545:17-20). She saw his eyes, his mouth, and his forehead just below the hairline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    588:21-590:20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the person walked in front of her car, Holloway backed her car into a parking spot while still facing the direction that she saw the person walk past.

After Holloway parked, she heard a gunshot, looked up, and saw the person who had walked in front of her car shooting the person she had previously seen by the BMW. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    536:24-538:19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The shooter began to chase the victim and run in the direction towards Holloway, and she again had an opportunity to view the shooter's face and other aspects of his appearance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    538:6-539:9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The shooter chased the victim around a building, out of Holloway's line of sight.

Then, the shooter returned from around the building and Holloway again had an opportunity to see him across Schieffelin Avenue.

After the police arrived on the scene, Holloway exited her car and eventually went to the police precinct to report what she saw. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    541:22-542:11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As part of the investigation into the shooting, Holloway participated in a line-up to identify the shooter, during which she identified Watson. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    542:12-544:19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Holloway also gave an in-court identification of Watson as the shooter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    543:25-544:19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Holloway testified that she was approximately five feet away from the shooter when she first saw him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   544:21-545:15). Nothing blocked her view of the shooter and there was lighting provided by the exterior lights of her car and lights in the parking lot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Tr. 545:17-546:2). Holloway repeated that she was able to see the shooter's face. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    546:3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). When asked if she had any doubt about her identification of the petitioner, she answered \"no.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   543:20-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Monique James testified that she was in the bathroom of her apartment at 1961 Schieffelin Avenue when she heard gunshots, looked out a nearby window, and saw a \"black male\" of medium build and height running along the sidewalk. (M. James: Tr. 625:8-626:18, 629:6-12, 631:10-632:17, 634:8-636:12). Monique's sister, Robin James, was fourteen years old at the time of the shooting and testified that she was in her bedroom doing her homework when she heard gunshots, looked out her bedroom window, and also saw a man, dressed in black pants and a black \"hoody\" sweatshirt, holding a gun in his right hand and shooting at another man who was running ahead of him. (R. James: Tr. 648:23-650:15, 652:7-653:15, 663:2-11). The man being shot at fell to the ground approximately 18 feet away from her and directly across from the James's apartment. (R. James: Tr. 653:20-655:25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Detective Sevelie Jones testified that Robin told him that the shooter was a \"male black five feet eight, thin build, dark skin, approximately twenty years of age.\" (Jones: Tr. 735:9-15). Detective Jones showed Robin a photo array, and she identified Watson from the frontal array pictures. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    736:4-737:3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Because she could make this identification from the frontal pictures, the detective did not ask\n   her to make an identification from the profile pictures. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    737:4-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Monique described the shooter as a \"[m]ale, brown skin, eighteen to twenty-two years of age, skinny, five feet nine\" but stated that \"she cannot I.D.\" the shooter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   729:15-19, 730:6-8). She identified Watson as the shooter from the profile array pictures but could not make an identification from the frontal array pictures. (M. James: Tr. 638:18-639:20, 641:23-644:24; Jones: Tr. 737:9-739:3). On October 15, 1991, two separate line-ups were conducted in which Monique and Robin positively identified Watson. (M. James: Tr. 639:6-642:22, 645:1-646:9; R. James: Tr. 666:10-668:12; Jones: Tr. 700:5-705:24, 757:2-761:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Detective Frank Morelli testified that on November 20, 1991, Holloway identified Watson as the shooter during a lineup. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Morelli: Tr. 510:3-526:5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Tr. 542:12-544:19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defense case consisted of two witnesses: Jesus Jimenez, a resident of the area who claimed to have seen the shooting and was familiar with Watson; and Marguerite Martin, a friend of Holloway. On the night of the shooting, Jimenez heard gun shots, looked out his window, and saw a man standing with his back to a body in the street. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jimenez: Tr. 770:2-771:8). Jimenez testified that the shooter then \"shot twice to a car,\" and then \"ran off.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   771:9-13). The shooter passed in front of Jimenez's window, but Jimenez could not see his face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   776:11-18). Jimenez knew Watson (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    773:24-774:11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) and was sure that Watson was not the shooter because the shooter did not \"have the same body features as Mr. Watson,\" and walked differently than Watson, who was \"bowlegged and [had] pigeon feet,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   776:19-777:6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Martin's grandchildren played with Holloway's children and she was thus familiar with Holloway. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martin: Tr. 790:22-791:14). Martin testified that she discussed the homicide with Holloway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   792:9-12). According to Martin, a few days after the shooting, Holloway told Martin that she had seen the shooter run past her car but \"could not see his face.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   792:18-793:6). The two discussed the case further and Holloway said that \"the police were harassing her to be a witness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   793:16-19). The first time that the two discussed the homicide, Holloway claimed that \"it was impossible for anybody to see the [shooter's] face because of the hood.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   794:2-9). Martin indicated that she had been acquainted with the petitioner for years and that he was a friend of her children and other relatives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   794:14-17, 795:22-796:18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C. Appeal of the 1993 Conviction and the First Federal Habeas Petition\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Watson appealed his conviction, raising as issues that he was improperly excluded from the questioning of two jurors, that a juror was improperly discharged, that he was denied a full cross-examination of Holloway, that the trial court erred in not questioning a juror post-verdict, and that his sentence should be reduced in the interest of justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

At the hearing Holloway recanted her 1993 trial testimony and stated that she was doing so voluntarily. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Hearing Tr. 59:2-62:5, 65:1-13). She claimed that her affidavit recanting her trial testimony was true. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   60:8-61:7). Holloway said she had not learned the outcome of Watson's trial until she was approached by Watson's investigator in Georgia and that after that time she began to doubt her testimony. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   58:21-59:14, 81:12-14). On cross-examination, however, Holloway also claimed that the testimony she gave at trial was \"the truth as [she knew] it at the time.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   69:6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Holloway testified that she told detectives shortly after the shooting that she could not identify anyone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   37:16-38:3). At a precinct interview, Holloway again said she could not identify the shooter from any photos shown to her. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   38:9-41:10). However, the detectives showed her a single photo of Watson and intimated that they thought he was the shooter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   40:22-42:6). Holloway was distracted after having recently signed a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" order for her brother in the hospital and could not focus on the facts of the shooting, and told the detectives of her distraction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   41:19-42:6). After being shown the single photo of Watson, Holloway then saw a photo array of people with Watson in it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   42:16-44:8). She claimed she picked Watson from the array simply by noting that it was the same person detectives had just shown her an individual picture of, without meaning that Watson was the shooter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   43:25-44:23). Holloway believed that she was selecting the person who committed the\n   crime, but admitted that she did not recognize the photo as the man who was in the parking lot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   44:16-46:20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Holloway also agreed in the statement that \"everything\" that she testified to at trial was the truth as she remembered it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   69:6-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As previously noted, in her statement to the DA, Holloway stated that she had seen the shooter's profile and his face front-on as he initially walked past her car. Holloway Statement 23:2-25. But at the hearing she denied this. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Hearing Tr. 27:15-16). Holloway attempted to explain the differences between her statement to the DA and her hearing testimony-most notably her views on the accuracy of her identification-based on her fear of telling prosecutors the truth and their aggressive behavior when she gave the DA her statement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   120:6-121:5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Holloway's hearing testimony varied from what she said to the DA in another respect: while she told the DA that she was nervous and even afraid to be approached by Watson's investigator (Holloway Statement 10:13-17, 12:1-11, 36:16-24), at the hearing she claimed she had no reason to be fearful because she had done nothing wrong (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Hearing Tr. 70:2-71:10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The petitioner called a retired detective, Hal Sherman, who took measurements of the area where the shooting occurred.

Sherman recorded his measurements in a diagram of the crime scene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Diagram of Crime Scene, dated July 13, 2011 (annexed as Ex. 12 to Boyle Exs.). Based on this diagram and Sherman's testimony, Holloway was approximately 250 feet from where the shooter chased Johnson, and 275 feet from the sidewalk on which the shooter walked after turning around.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Mem. at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The petitioner also called Diana Almonte, a former girlfriend of the petitioner, who testified that on the night of the shooting, she saw a person in a hoodie point a gun at Johnson. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Almonte: Hearing Tr. 124:22-24, 126:25-127:3, 135:17-139:25, 164:18-165:18). Almonte testified that she could not identify that shooter and could not even identify his race or sex, though she said that he was a \"little\" taller than her (which was 5'1?). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   138:1-24). Almonte testified that petitioner's family members had come to her house on more than one occasion prior to the hearing and that she felt \"harrass[ed]\" and \"scared\" by them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   152:15-154:9).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones: Hearing Tr. 303:13-18). He testified that he spoke to Holloway on the evening of the murder and that she was calm, relaxed, and professional. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   306:7-309:20). He recalled preparing the photo array and testified that he never showed Holloway a single photo because he was \"never taught that way.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   309:24-311:22, 313:22-314:13).

He said that he never suggested to Holloway that she pick out a particular subject.

We begin by noting that we interpret the word \"previously\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B) to ask whether the factual predicate could have been presented in the original petition. Here, the factual predicate for Watson's claims rests entirely with Holloway's recantation and testimony regarding alleged police misconduct. Watson has alleged that he did not learn of Holloway's change of heart until 2011, long after his original petition was filed in 1999.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Boyle Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Watson also has shown that Holloway's recantation \"could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(i). Certainly, there is no evidence that anyone might have thought that Holloway had any testimony favorable to petitioner until she was found. Nor does respondent argue that petitioner did not act diligently in seeking to determine if Holloway had changed her testimony. Thus the first requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(i) has been established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Whether the second requirement, contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(ii), is established is not as clearcut. Here, testimony was admitted that two individuals-Monique James and Robin James-had identified the defendant at a photo-array and at a lineup, although neither sister could make an in-court identification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.B above. The question thus becomes whether in the absence of Holloway's testimony and looking only at the James sisters' identifications and the other evidence at trial, Watson has shown by \"clear and convincing evidence\" that \"no reasonable factfinder would have found\" Watson guilty.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(ii). The lack of an in-court identification from the sisters would certainly be troubling to a jury. Also, notwithstanding these identifications, Monique initially told the police that she \"cannot I.D.\" (Jones: Tr. 730:8), and Robin testified at one point that she did not get a \"good\" look at the shooter (R. James: Tr. 663:15-17). There was no other evidence identifying the petitioner as the shooter. In light of this dearth of proof, we conclude that Watson has shown by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable jury would have found him guilty if Holloway's testimony was shown to have been perjurious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   III.

As we have recounted, and as Justice Price noted, there were a number of inconsistencies between Holloway's statement to the DA and what she testified to at the hearing. 440.10 Decision at 8. He also noticed inconsistencies between Holloway's affidavit-which said she had \"long been haunted and disturbed\" by her participation in Watson's trial, Holloway Aff. \u00b6 19-and her hearing testimony, where she said she had not learned of the trial's outcome until Watson's investigator approached her (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Hearing Tr. 58:21-59:14).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   440.10 Decision at 8-9.

Justice Price specifically noted this inconsistency. 440.10 Decision at 10, 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Justice Price also considered Holloway's original trial testimony in the context of all the surrounding evidence before him, including Holloway's later recantation. 440.10 Decision at 28-34.

Holloway Statement 69:14-16. On cross-examination at the hearing, Holloway again claimed that the testimony she gave at trial was \"the truth as [she knew] it at the time.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Hearing Tr. 69:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Justice Price further found troubling the fact that Holloway never sufficiently explained her reaction to her being contacted by the defense investigator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   440.10 Decision at 36. Noting that Holloway claimed in her statement to the DA that she had felt pressured and even \"scar[ed]\" into complying with the defense investigator's questions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Holloway Statement 36:16-24, 73:23-74:14, Justice Price found that Holloway never provided a \"coherent explanation that such pressure and intimidation did not factor in her signing the recantation affidavit,\" 440.10 Decision at 36.

He found that Holloway had not \"meaningfully refute[d] [her] credible trial testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Watson urges this Court to reject the state court's hearing determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Mem. at 36. Watson's main contention is that Justice Price focused exclusively on the reliability of Holloway's recantation without focusing on other evidence suggestive of perjury at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Watson argues that Holloway's recantation testimony that she could not see the shooter because his hoody was drawn so close to his face was corroborated by testifying witness Diana Almonte.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21. Almonte testified at the hearing that she could not see the shooter's face because of his hoody. (Almonte: Hearing Tr. 138:7-139:3). Justice Price did consider Almonte's testimony, however, and noted, correctly, that she testified that she had so little ability to see the shooter's face that even Watson \"could have been the shooter.\" 440.10 Decision at 43 (citing Almonte: Hearing Tr. 162-163). More importantly, Almonte's view of the shooter right before the killing and Holloway's view of him passing in front of his car occurred at\n   different points in time and from different vantage points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Watson alleges that Justice Price \"misstated the record\" by claiming that Almonte \"could not provide a description\" to the police. Pet'r Mem. at 21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   440.10 Decision at 15. Watson correctly notes that Almonte did indeed give a description to the detectives (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Jones: Hearing Tr. 326:15-327:24), but that description did not include a description of the shooter's face. Indeed, it was clear that Justice Price understood this distinction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   440.10 Decision at 15 (\"[Almonte] told [detectives] that she was unable to see the man's face. As such, Ms. Almonte could not provide a description.\"). Additionally, while Watson points out that Almonte testified that \"nothing about the shooter brought to mind Shane Watson,\" Pet'r Mem. at 21 (citing Almonte: Hearing Tr. 143, 164), she also testified that Watson \"could have been\" the shooter (Almonte: Hearing Tr. 163:8-18). We thus do not believe that Justice Price's description of Almonte's testimony casts doubt on his factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Watson correctly points to\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Ortega\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a trial court should not rest solely on a witness's incredible recantation to determine whether that witness's trial testimony was truthful. Pet'r Mem. at 18-19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109075\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/102/#p107\">\n    333 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   107 ). However, in\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   there was another witness who directly contradicted whether the recanting witness was even physically present for the events he claimed he saw as well as proof of other perjurious statements by the recanting witness related to the case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109075\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/102/#p107\">\n    333 F.3d at 105, 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no such evidence here. The only evidence that Holloway incorrectly identified Watson at the 1993 trial is her own recantation. Thus, focusing on the credibility of Holloway's testimony was the proper analysis for the hearing judge. Additionally, unlike this case,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Ortega\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   dealt with a situation where the state court \"explicitly refused to make a finding on the credibility\" of the recanting witness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109075\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/102/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109075\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/102/#p107\">\n    at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Watson also claims that Holloway's recantation and claim of perjury was supported by the physical layout of the crime scene as indicated by Sherman's hearing testimony. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sherman: Hearing Tr. 170:11-186:22). Watson claims that Sherman's measurements of the parking lot corroborate that Holloway was \"about 250 feet\" away from where the shooter chased the victim in 1991 and \"over 275 feet from\" the shooter when he walked away after the shooting. Pet'r Mem. at 23-24. Moreover, \"since she parked head-in,\" Holloway would have had to \"crane her neck\" to see the shooter running after the shooting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Watson argues that, based on Holloway's hearing testimony, at one point, it would have been impossible for Holloway to have seen the face of the shooter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. This argument, however, assumes that Holloway's testimony at the hearing was truthful and accurate as to her car's position in the parking lot. While the testimony at the hearing undercut Holloway's original estimate as to the distance between her and the shooter the second time she saw him, we do not believe that the omission of a discussion of this testimony casts doubt on Justice Price's findings. And, of course, Holloway's trial testimony was that the closest view she had of the shooter was at the moment he first passed by her car. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Tr: 544:21-545:16). The testimony at the hearing did not undercut the trial testimony regarding the distance between Holloway and the individual who passed in front of her car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Watson also points to several instances where he asserts Justice Price misinterpreted Holloway's testimony. For instance, Watson claims Justice Price erred in finding\n   that Holloway began to doubt her trial testimony only after being approached by defense investigators, when in fact Holloway had long felt uncertain of her identification; in finding that ideas of trial error were first placed in her mind by defense attorneys; and by ignoring Holloway's unwillingness to express her doubts to the DA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Mem. at 26-28. But Holloway gave conflicting testimony on even these points. Thus, Holloway claimed she doubted her trial testimony shortly after the 1991 trial. Holloway Statement 13:1-24. But she also agreed that she began developing doubts \"only after\" it was constantly brought up to her,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   70:24-71:10, and that she had \"moved on\" after 20 years,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   12:14-25. Holloway claimed that any ideas about the suggestibility of her identification was prompted by her conversations with defense attorneys (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   39:16-41:23), and she also stated the defense pressure made her begin to question her identification, though she initially stood by it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   71:15-73:21. Holloway testified that she was worried about expressing doubts to the DA (Holloway: Hearing Tr. 120:1-121:5), but also conceded that she told the DA in 2013 that she stood by her identification and that she picked out the shooter that she recognized (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   103:16-105:1). Justice Price could properly conclude that Holloway's conflicting testimony demonstrated her unreliability as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Watson alleges that prosecutors \"badger[ed]\" Holloway during her 2013 interview with the DA, and that this intimidation was missed by Justice Price. Pet'r Mem. at 31. Watson references several \"lecture[s]\" and \"chastise[ments]\" from the prosecution to essentially goad Holloway into giving the answers they wanted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32. To the extent that Watson is attacking Justice Price's credibility determination based on his failure to reference this claim, his decision in fact references it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   440.10 Decision at 35 (noting that Holloway considered the prosecutors to be \"aggressive\"). In any event, Justice Price could properly construe the transcript of the statement in light of the testimony of the court reporter, who testified at the hearing that Holloway's demeanor was normal and that the prosecutors at the meeting did not raise their voices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Perez: Hearing Tr. 386:16-388:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Watson argues that Justice Price erred in not referencing the trial testimony of Marguerite Martin, a witness who testified at the 1993 trial that Holloway \"told her that she was unsure of her identification but had to stick with it because she had been pressured by the police.\" Pet'r Mem. at 25. Martin did testify at trial and did say that Holloway told her that \"[s]he heard shots. A man ran past her car with a hood on his head. She could not see his face.\" (Martin: Tr. 792:23-24). Martin also claimed that, while discussing the case, Holloway felt that \"the police were harassing her to be a witness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   793:16-19). But Martin's account was not only inconsistent with Holloway's trial testimony, but also with Holloway's statement to the DA. When asked in 2013 by prosecutors whether she told \"anybody that [she was] acquaintances with ... about what was happening with this case,\" Holloway said \"[h]ell no. And put that down in capit[al] letters.\" Holloway Statement 88:10-15. We do not believe the omission of a discussion of Martin's testimony alters the deference owed to Justice Price's credibility findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Watson attacks Justice Price's crediting of Detective Jones's testimony that he did not tell Holloway about any other eyewitnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Mem. at 26. Detective Jones testified that he would not have suggested to Holloway that anyone in the photo array was the suspect. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones: Hearing Tr. 312:1-20). Detective Jones also denied showing Holloway an individual\n   photo, or any other photograph, before showing her the array. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   313:22-314:13). To attack this testimony Watson points to the fact that Watson was placed in the \"# 1\" position in two of the photo arrays. Pet'r Mem. at 33-34. Justice Price could choose to accept, however, Jones's testimony there was no \"rhyme or reason\" to putting Watson in that position in both arrays. (Jones: Hearing Tr. 311:7-22). Watson also points to what amount to inconsistencies between Jones's recollection at the 2013 hearing of Holloway's conduct in 1991.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Mem. at 34-35. But such inconsistencies could easily be attributable to minor errors of memory resulting from a lapse of 22 years that did not otherwise undermine his testimony as to other more critical matters. Similarly, we do not view petitioner's argument that Jones did not use proper procedures in presenting photo arrays to the James sisters,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, as detracting from Justice Price's assessment of Jones's overall credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Watson argues, Pet'r Mem. at 26, that there was evidence that Jones was untruthful because (1) Holloway testified at the hearing that Detective Jones told her about other witnesses in an effort to apparently ease her concerns about making a false identification (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Holloway: Hearing Tr. 41:19-42:11); and (2) Detective Jones showed Holloway the photo array after he obtained an identification from one of the James sisters (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Jones: Hearing Tr. 354:19-356:17, 360:16-24). Watson argues that Jones must have told Holloway about the other witnesses because she would have had no other way of knowing about them. Pet'r Mem. at 26. We reject this argument because it assumes that Holloway's recantation testimony is necessarily accurate. Additionally, just because Detective Jones interviewed Holloway shortly after another eyewitness in 1991 does not mean that Jones told her about other witnesses. Obviously, Holloway could have easily become aware at the time of the trial (not to mention during the process of preparing for the hearing) that the James sisters had identified the petitioner, as this was the subject of public testimony. Justice Price could accept Detective Jones's testimony that he did not show Holloway an individual photo, or any other photograph, before showing her the array (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Jones: Hearing Tr. 313:22-314:13), and his testimony that he did not tell Holloway about any other eyewitness (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   315:3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Of course, there was much contradictory evidence from Holloway on this point. Contrary to the statement in her affidavit that she was shown a single photograph of the petitioner prior to being shown the photo array, Holloway Aff. \u00b6 12, at her session before the DA, Holloway did not recall ever being shown a single photograph, Holloway Statement 59:25-60:19. Also, contrary to her statement in the affidavit that a detective identified the petitioner as the perpetrator before she made her identification, Holloway Aff. \u00b6 12, at the session with the DA she stated only that a detective said \"we know who it was,\" Holloway Statement 17:6-7, and she could not recall whether that occurred before she looked at \"a picture\" (presumably referring to the photo array since she did not state that she had been shown a single photograph),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   17:8-19. She also stated that she did not let the detective influence her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   19:24-20:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   A New York State Supreme Court Justice heard all the evidence on this question and concluded that Holloway's recantation of her testimony was not credible and that her trial testimony was in fact \"credible.\" 440.10 Decision at 37. We do not have the authority to conduct a\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record and reach our\n   own conclusion as to whether Holloway's recantation was credible. Rather, we are bound to overturn that finding only if there is \"clear and convincing\" evidence to support doing so. We cannot make that finding here. In light of the absence of any other significant evidence showing that Holloway's trial testimony was untruthful, we cannot find that the evidence of actual innocence is supported by \"new reliable evidence\" such as a \"trustworthy eyewitness account[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    513 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or that it is more likely than not that \"any reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt\" about Watson's innocence,\n   <em>\n    House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275461\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/518/#p536\">\n    547 U.S. at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275461\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/518/#p536\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Watson's second petition for a writ of habeas corpus (Docket # 28) should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   We recognize that this case presents difficult questions and it is possible that with the application of a different standard of review as to our consideration of the state court opinion, the result might have been different.
