Each county's motion is brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Arthur, Sr., James M. Brower, Grace B. Hardison, and James L. Cox (collectively \"Individual Plaintiffs\"), commenced this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act, (the \"NVRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020507\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Voting Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 79.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)

The Cumberland and Moore Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing in each of their respective motions; while in all three motions, the County Boards each contend that Plaintiffs' claims are now moot. (ECF Nos. 57 at 10-17; 60 at 4-19; 62 at 6-19.) In addition to Plaintiffs filing a Consolidated Opposition to County Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, (ECF No. 69), Defendant the North Carolina State Board of Elections, its Chairman, Secretary, Executive Director, and Members of the Board, each named in their official capacities (collectively \"State Defendants\"), filed an Opposition to Motions to Dismiss by County Defendants, (ECF No. 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As to the first contention that Plaintiffs lack standing to sue individual county officials in their official capacities, the Cumberland Defendants cite no legal authority to support this argument and this Court finds none. \"[O]fficial-capacity suits 'generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.' \"\n   <em>\n    Andrews v.

Consequently, this first argument fails. As to the Cumberland Defendants' second argument-that Individual Plaintiffs lack standing to bring claims against them since no Individual Plaintiff alleges that he or she was a registered voter in Cumberland County-Plaintiffs do not dispute the Cumberland Defendants' contention. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69.) Therefore, to the extent that Individual Plaintiffs Arthur, Brower, Hardison, and Cox, assert claims against Cumberland Defendants, the Cumberland Defendants' motion is allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Cumberland Defendants' third argument requires an examination of the allegations in the Complaint in greater detail. The Cumberland Defendants challenge the standing of each Organizational Plaintiff on both organizational and representational standing grounds. (ECF No. 60 at 7-14.) However, these Plaintiffs do not contest that the Moore NAACP has standing to sue the Cumberland Defendants. Plaintiffs do argue, however, that the North Carolina NAACP has representational\n   standing to bring claims arising from the harm to its members and organizational standing to bring claims on its own behalf. (ECF No. 69 at 23-29.) The Court will therefore only examine whether the North Carolina NAACP has standing to assert claims against the Cumberland Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The North Carolina NAACP disputes the Cumberland Defendants' contention that its representational standing claim fails because the North Carolina NAACP cannot identify one specific member whose voter registration was purged. (ECF No. 69 at 25-29.) Plaintiffs argue that they have specifically identified one member, Mr. Brower, who was injured by Defendants' challenged conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) However, Plaintiffs do not contend that Mr. Brower's injury resulted from, or is traceable to, the challenged conduct of the Cumberland Defendants. Rather, Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that all of Mr. Brower's injuries result from the conduct of the Moore Defendants. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 13.) Therefore, the North Carolina NAACP cannot rely on Mr. Brower's injuries to establish representational standing to sue the Cumberland Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The North Carolina NAACP next argues, in the alternative, that it can establish representational standing to sue the Cumberland Defendants on the ground that all of its members are likely to be harmed. (ECF No. 69 at 27.) Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that the North Carolina NAACP \"has plausibly alleged that all of its members are likely to suffer future harm if Defendants' unlawful conduct is not enjoined, and that allegation is independently sufficient for [representational] standing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There is a \"limited exception\" to the identification requirement, which applies only when \"all members of an organization are harmed.\"\n   <em>\n    S.

As earlier stated, an organization can establish standing to sue \"on its own behalf when it seeks redress for an injury suffered by the organization itself.\"\n   <em>\n    White Tail Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969188\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/451/#p458\">\n    413 F.3d at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The North Carolina NAACP alleges that it \"has been forced to divert its valuable and limited resources away from its core mission and planned voter-mobilization, voter-protection, and voter-education activities ... in order to investigate, respond to, mitigate, and address the concerns of its members resulting from Defendants' unlawful\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   voter challenge and purging practices.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 89.) The North Carolina NAACP has, therefore, established a cognizable injury by alleging that Defendants' \"practices have hampered [its] stated objectives causing [it] to divert its resources as a result,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Action NC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271599\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/216/597/#p616\">\n    216 F.Supp.3d at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Further, the North Carolina NAACP has not only plausibly alleged but has also provided evidence to show that these injuries are fairly traceable to the conduct of the Cumberland Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69 at 20-21.) Specifically, Plaintiffs point out that North Carolina NAACP President Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II sent multiple letters to the State Board concerning the conduct of the Cumberland Defendants. (ECF No. 5 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19.) Plaintiffs also assert that other staff members and volunteers communicated with NAACP members, including some from Cumberland County, who were concerned that their voter registrations might be challenged or purged. (ECF No. 69 at 21.) In addition, Plaintiffs contend that after learning of the conduct of the Cumberland Defendants, the North Carolina NAACP began an investigation that \"included interviews,\n   reviews of publicly available information, and requests for further information from individuals with first-hand knowledge of the challenges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) The Court, therefore, concludes that the North Carolina NAACP has standing to pursue its claims against the Cumberland Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by the Cumberland Defendants' arguments that the North Carolina NAACP cannot establish organizational standing. The Cumberland Defendants contend that the many of the North Carolina NAACP's allegations are too \"conclusory.\" (ECF No. 60 at 9, 10, 13.) However, the Court concludes that the North Carolina NAACP has satisfied the requirements of standing doctrine on the basis of the factual allegations and evidence discussed above. The Cumberland Defendants also argue that the North Carolina NAACP's diversion of resources is too insubstantial to establish a cognizable injury. (ECF No. 60 at 11-12.) However, the Cumberland Defendants cite no case to support this argument, while a number of courts have concluded that resource diversions similar to the North Carolina NAACP's were sufficient to establish cognizable injuries.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Arcia\n   </em>\n   , 772 F.3d at 1341-42 (finding a cognizable injury where an \"organization expended resources to locate and assist the members to ensure that they were able to vote\");\n   <em>\n    Nnebe v.

The Cumberland Defendants finally argue that the North Carolina NAACP's injuries are not particularized. (ECF No. 60 at 10-11.) The Cumberland Defendants cite no case to support this argument and the Court concludes that it lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Moore Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Moore Defendants contend that the Individual Plaintiffs lack standing to bring claims against them because none of the Individual Plaintiffs alleged a cognizable injuries that are fairly traceable to the Moore Defendants. (ECF No. 62 at 17-18.) Specifically, they argue that Mr. Brower is the only Individual Plaintiff in this case that has a connection to Moore County; and that Mr. Brower never suffered a cognizable injury since the challenge to his voter registration status was dismissed and he was therefore never removed from the voter rolls.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.) Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Brower \"suffered an injury-in fact fairly traceable to the unlawful conduct of Moore County Defendants, and thus he has standing.\" (ECF No. 69 at 30.) Plaintiffs also argue that \"a voter need not actually have been purged from the rolls or prevented from voting\" to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This Court agrees with Plaintiffs' argument that Mr. Brower did not need to be \"purged from the rolls or prevented from voting\" to demonstrate injury, (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1839001,5706570\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/28/1268/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charles H.

Further, in addition to alleging that Mr. Brower was harmed when his right to remain registered to vote was challenged before the 2016 election, Plaintiffs' Complaint also alleges that Mr. Brower remained at risk of being harmed by the Defendants in a similar manner in future elections. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 80.) Specifically, the Complaint states that \"Defendants' practice of permitting and enabling challengers to bring systematic, coordinated,\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   challenges to large numbers of registered voters ... subject[s] [Plaintiffs] to a real and imminent risk that they will be unlawfully purged from the voter rolls and consequently denied their right to vote in the upcoming November 8, 2016 general election, as well as in subsequent elections.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79, 80.) The Court concludes that Mr. Brower has plausibly alleged that he suffered a cognizable injury-in the form of his substantial risk of future harm-that is traceable to the challenged conduct of the Moore Defendants. Thus, Mr. Brower has standing to sue the Moore Defendants. The Court further concludes, however, that no other Individual Plaintiff sufficiently alleged any similar injury resulting from the conduct of the Moore Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, to the extent the Complaint alleges claims brought against Moore Defendants by Plaintiffs Arthur, Hardison, and Cox, the Moore Defendants' motion is allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Moore Defendants also contend that the North Carolina NAACP and the Moore NAACP lacked standing to bring their claims. (ECF No. 62 at 18-19.) The Moore Defendants support this contention by arguing that the Organizational Plaintiffs did not \"identify any harm to the Plaintiffs\"; failed to specifically identify any of their members who were injured; and pled conclusory allegations supported by facts that were insufficient to substantiate those allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Organizational Plaintiffs identify one specific individual whose injury results from the challenged conduct of the Moore Defendants, i.e. Mr. Brower. (ECF Nos. 1 \u00b6 13; 69 at 25.) As discussed earlier, Mr. Brower has adequately demonstrated that he has standing to sue the Moore Defendants as an individual.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   . The Organizational Plaintiffs cannot establish standing on the basis of Mr. Brower's injury, however, as the Complaint does not allege that Mr. Brower was a member of the North Carolina NAACP or the Moore NAACP at the time the Complaint was filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n    554 U.S. at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677135\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/724/#p734\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed\"). Rather, the Complaint alleges that \"Mr. Brower\n   <em>\n    has been\n   </em>\n   a member of the Moore County NAACP within the last five years and\n   <em>\n    is currently renewing\n   </em>\n   his membership.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 13 (emphasis added).) Consequently, the Organizational Plaintiffs cannot establish representational standing against the Moore Defendants on\n   the basis of Mr. Brower's injuries because their Complaint does not identify Mr. Brower as a member of either organization at the time the litigation commenced. Further, the Organizational Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that all of their members in Moore County will be affected by the challenged activity of the Moore Defendants for the same reasons that the North Carolina NAACP is unable to satisfy this exception with respect to the conduct of the Cumberland Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The North Carolina NAACP and the Moore NAACP, however, can establish organizational standing to sue the Moore Defendants. Contrary to the Moore Defendants' contention, both Organizational Plaintiffs have asserted that they were harmed in the form of resource diversion. (ECF. No 69 at 19-23, 30-31.) The Court has already concluded that the North Carolina NAACP's resource diversion is a cognizable injury.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   . Further, this resource diversion of the North Carolina NAACP is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the Moore Defendants. (ECF. No 69 at 19-23.) Similarly, the Moore NAACP has also demonstrated cognizable injury, in the form of resource diversion, that is fairly traceable to the conduct of the Moore Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 7 \u00b6 24; 69 at 31.) Specifically, the Moore NAACP asserts that its \"staff members spent [time] researching and investigating the purges, requesting information from ... and writing letters to the [Moore County Board of Elections],\" in response to the Moore Defendants' Conduct. (ECF Nos. 7 \u00b6 24; 69 at 31.) Further, the Moore NAACP asserts that this time \"would have [been] spent instead on disseminating information about Early Voting opportunities, publicizing the Moore County NAACP Branch's Rides-to-the-Polls program, and recruiting and training volunteer[s]\" for \"get-out-the-vote efforts.\" (ECF Nos. 7 \u00b6 24; 69 at 31.) Accordingly, the Court concludes that both Organizational Plaintiffs have established standing to sue the Moore Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Because these defendants make essentially the same or overlapping arguments related to mootness, the Court will address these arguments as those of the County Boards, collectively. While a number of these arguments have no bearing on the issue of mootness, the court has consolidated what appear to be the County Boards' major arguments as follows: (1) all injunctive relief requested has been granted by the Court, the November 8, 2016 election has passed and \"[t]he only relief left for consideration by the Court seeks to change an interpretation of North Carolina election laws which is not within the control of the various County [Boards],\" (ECF No. 62 at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 56 at 1; 59 at 2-3, 60 at 15-16); (2) the State Board controls the conduct of the County Boards and will continue to be a party to the action and subject to any order issued by the Court and thus the allegedly wrongful conduct by the County Boards cannot reasonably be expected to recur, (ECF Nos. 57 at 15; 62 at 7); and (3) the County Boards are not proper parties to this lawsuit because the State Board controls the interpretation and enforcement of all of North Carolina's election laws, (ECF Nos. 57 at 11-14; 62 at 7, 10-15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs respond to County Boards' arguments of mootness first and foremost by asserting that their claims against the County Boards remain live. (ECF. No. 69 at 15-17.) Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that: (1) a preliminary injunction does not moot a complaint for permanent injunctive relief; (2) the County Boards did not voluntarily cease their offending conduct but instead \"ceased only in response to the preliminary injunction,\" which does not moot the case; and (3) the County Boards are proper parties \"as the entities implementing\" the voter challenge statutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12, 15-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court begins with the County Boards' argument that because all injunctive relief requested by the Plaintiffs has been granted and the November 2016 election has passed that the case or controversy that connects the County Boards to this lawsuit is extinguished. The County Boards argue that as a result of these events, \"[t]he only relief left for consideration by the Court\" is the Plaintiffs' request \"to change an interpretation of North Carolina election laws.\" (ECF No. 62 at 8.) The premise of this argument-that all injunctive relief requested by the Plaintiffs has been granted-is simply not correct. Plaintiffs also seek a permanent injunction against the County Boards, in addition to declaratory relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 1 at 38-39.) In addition, while the emergency relief provided by the preliminary injunction may, in large part, have been directed at ensuring that Plaintiffs were not deprived of their franchise during the then-impending November 2016 election, neither Plaintiffs' alleged injuries, nor the relief they seek against the County Boards, are limited to that election only. Plaintiffs have clearly alleged future harm. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 79, 80.) Further, the Court only considered the Plaintiffs' NVRA claims at the preliminary injunction stage of these proceedings; Plaintiffs have also alleged that the conduct of County Boards violates the Voting Rights Act as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) Accordingly, this argument advanced by County Boards woefully fails to demonstrate that Plaintiffs' claims are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Next, the Court will address the County Boards' argument that the allegedly wrongful conduct by the County Boards cannot reasonably be expected to recur because the State Board will continue to be a party to this action and thus subject to any order issued by the Court; and because the State Board controls the conduct of the County Boards and can thus direct their compliance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   To provide some context to this argument, the Court will briefly summarize the respective roles of the State Board and county boards of elections in hearing voter challenges as set forth under North Carolina law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"When a challenge is made [under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20163-85\">\n    N.C.

(ECF Nos. 57 at 12; 62 at 11-12.) They contend that the State Board's compliance with this Court's preliminary injunction demonstrates that the challenged conduct of the County Boards is not reasonably expected to recur because the State Board can direct the County Boards to comply with any order issued by this Court. (ECF Nos. 57 at 12-13; 62 at 12.) This argument is neither compelling, nor is it relevant to the issue of whether Plaintiffs' claims are moot. Moreover, this Court disagrees with the County Boards' assertion that the fact that the State Board is also subject to any order issued by this Court demonstrates that the County Boards would decline to implement the voter challenge statute in the absence of an order enjoining them from doing so. As argued by Plaintiffs, the failure of the County and State Boards to agree on either the scope of the Court's preliminary injunction or the meaning of the directive issued by the State Board in response, \"highlights the importance of retaining all parties in the litigation.\" (ECF No. 69 at 17.) The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Next, the Court will discuss the County Boards' argument that the claims against them are moot because they are no longer proper parties to this lawsuit. They argue that plaintiffs can no longer point to any connection between the County Boards and the implementation of the challenged statute. (ECF Nos. 57 at 13-14; 62 at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Contrary to these assertions, the County Boards continue to be responsible for implementing the voter challenge statutes under North Carolina law. As the State Board contends in its brief, this responsibility falls squarely on the County Boards. (ECF No. 65 at 6-7.) Further, the State Board argues that \"the County [Boards] play a uniquely direct role in challenge proceedings\" brought under the pertinent statutes, namely that: (1) decisions of each County Board regarding voter challenges are appealable, not to them, but to the state superior court, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20163-90.2\">\n    N.C. Gen.

The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The County Boards rely heavily on two opinions issued by courts in this state to support their argument that they are no longer proper parties to this suit, however, the Court finds that these cases do not support the County Boards' position.
