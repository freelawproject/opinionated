Petitioners decry what they claim to be Respondents' arbitrary enforcement. But in doing so, Petitioners force a confrontation with a fundamental principle of our Constitution's separation of powers-this Court's very authority to resolve the case before it. Unlike the Supreme Court, the jurisdiction of the inferior federal courts consists solely of that which Congress grants. And of that which Congress gives, Congress may take away. Respondents direct the Court to a provision of the Controlled Substances Act that they believe strips the Court of jurisdiction over this action. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court are the parties' motions for summary judgment (ECF Nos. 33 &amp; 42-1). The parties have thoroughly briefed the issues in responses (ECF Nos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   42 &amp; 46), replies (ECF Nos. 47 &amp; 48), and even in a separate motion (ECF Nos. 38 &amp; 45), making the instant Motions ripe for decision. For the reasons set forth below, Respondents' Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . This action is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   for want of jurisdiction but without prejudice. Accordingly, all pending motions are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are undisputed by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Woods and McDonald's Statement of Material Facts, Feb. 15, 2017, ECF No. 34; Resp'ts' Resp. to Pet'rs' Statement of Material Facts, Mar. 15, 2017, ECF No. 42-2. Petitioners are both licensed physicians employed by the Henderson County Community Hospital (\"HCCH\") in Lexington, Tennessee. In order to prescribe and handle controlled substances, a physician must obtain a registration from the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"). Both Petitioners voluntarily surrendered their DEA registrations while undergoing inpatient treatment for addiction and substance abuse-Woods in 2011 and McDonald at some point before 2002. Since 2013 and 2002 respectively, however, Woods and McDonald have had full prescribing authority. During the approximately 14 years that McDonald has had such authority, he has reapplied for and been granted DEA registration five times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In their Second Amended Complaint, Petitioners allege the following facts that Respondents lack sufficient information to either admit or deny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl., Dec. 2, 2016, ECF No. 22; Answer, Feb. 24, 2017, ECF No. 36. Woods and McDonald are the only two hospitalists at HCCH. McDonald has been working at HCCH since 2002, though he was a staff doctor for the vast majority of that time. Woods has been working at HCCH as a hospitalist since April 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since his involvement with the DEA began, Woods has attempted to keep the DEA informed of his employment. Prior to beginning his work at HCCH, Woods informed the DEA that he would be working at HCCH. Also before his employment began at HCCH, Woods spoke with a DEA agent about his recordkeeping responsibilities at HCCH in light of his agreement with the DEA. The DEA agent confirmed that Woods did not have to submit prescriptions written for inpatient treatment. Thus, the DEA knew that Woods would be working at HCCH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 10, 2016, the DEA was on-site at HCCH, and an agent informed Dr. Woods that he believed that, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201301.76\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Woods must have a waiver from the DEA in order to work at HCCH. The agent later confirmed this belief, called Woods, and told him that HCCH must have a waiver from the DEA in order for Woods to work at HCCH. The agent told Woods that he could not work at HCCH while the waiver was applied for and processed. Woods was suddenly and unexpectedly out of work. Before the agent's conversations with Woods on that day, the DEA had never told Woods that he needed a waiver to work at HCCH. The DEA agent also called HCCH that day and told HCCH that it must have a waiver for Woods to work at HCCH and Woods could not work until the DEA granted a waiver. The DEA agent further informed HCCH that it must apply for a waiver for any other physician who had surrendered\n   his or her DEA registration for cause. The agent instructed HCCH that any such physician could not work until the DEA granted a waiver. HCCH identified McDonald as the only other physician working at HCCH that met this criterion. HCCH then informed both Woods and McDonald that they could not work again until the DEA granted a waiver. This was also the first time that McDonald had heard of the waiver requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The DEA granted HCCH waivers for both Woods and McDonald on January 18, 2017.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioners filed their initial Complaint requesting a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") and a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 1) on November 10, 2016, and an Amended Complaint (ECF No. 2) the following day.

On December 6, 2016, the Court held a hearing regarding Petitioners' request for a preliminary injunction. Min. Entry, Dec. 16, 2016, ECF No. 30;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion for Prelim. Inj., Nov. 23, 2016, ECF No. 18. At the hearing, Respondents consented to entry of a preliminary injunction allowing the uninterrupted work of Petitioners during the litigation of this case. Min. Entry, ECF No. 30. In the order that followed, the Court found that all four factors used in analyzing a preliminary injunction issue swung in Petitioners' favor, including likelihood of success on the merits. Prelim. Inj., Dec. 12, 2016, ECF No. 32. Accordingly, the Court issued an injunction. Order Granting Motion for Prelim. Inj., Dec. 6, 2016, ECF No. 31; Prelim.

Petitioners also request a permanent injunction prohibiting Respondents from enforcing section \u00a7 1301.76(a) against them at HCCH or any other future employment. Second Am. Compl., at 16, ECF No. 22. Petitioners' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 33) makes the above arguments and others, while Respondents' joint Response and Cross-Motion (ECF No. 42) raises the issues of subject-matter jurisdiction, standing, and sovereign immunity, in addition to responding to Petitioners' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. When deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must review all the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

In reviewing a\n   motion for summary judgment, the Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and it \"may not make credibility determinations [ ]or weigh the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Laster v. City of Kalamazoo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240597\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/714/#p726\">\n    746 F.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 726 (6th Cir. 2014). When the motion is supported by documentary proof such as depositions and affidavits, the nonmoving party may not rest on his pleadings but, rather, must present some \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Statements of Undisputed Material Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before beginning its analysis, the Court finds it necessary to address a procedural issue\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   related to the statements of undisputed material facts that must accompany summary judgment motions. Local Rule 56.1 provides that \"any motion for summary judgment made pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 shall be accompanied by a separate, concise statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue for trial.\" W.D. Tenn. R. 56.1(a). This includes cross-motions. Petitioners correctly point out that Respondents' cross-motion failed to include a statement of undisputed material facts. They urge the Court to deny Respondents' cross-motion because of this deficiency and cite cases where district courts have done exactly that. Pet'rs' Resp. to Resp'ts' Cross Motion for Summ. J., at 2, Mar. 29, 2017, ECF No. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court declines to do so here for two reasons. First, this situation, where both parties have moved for summary judgment, reduces the prejudice of Respondents' error. The purpose of the requirement of a statement of undisputed material facts is \"to assist the Court in ascertaining whether there are any material facts in dispute.\" W.D. Tenn. R. 56.1(a). Here, because both parties have moved for summary judgment, they agree \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact....\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   John Woods, M.D. and Tom McDonald, M.D.'s Summ.-J. Motion, at 1, Feb. 15, 2017, ECF No. 33 (\"Woods and McDonald move this Court for entry of a judgment in their favor on the grounds that there are no genuine issues of material fact for trial.\"); Mem. in Opp'n to Pet'rs' Motion for Summ. J. and in Supp. of Resp'ts' Cross Motion for Summ. J. at 3, Mar. 15,\n   2017, ECF No. 42 (citing Rule 56's summary judgment standard).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, this case has a \"limited factual universe-no discovery has been propounded or depositions taken.\" Mem. in Further Supp. of Resp'ts' Cross Motion for Summ. J., at 2 n.1, April 12, 2017, ECF No. 48. Although Respondents did not file their own statement of undisputed material facts, they did respond to Petitioners' statement, which is relatively short.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Woods and McDonald's Statement of Material Facts, ECF No. 34; Resp'ts' Resp. to Pet'rs' Statement of Material Facts, ECF No. 42-2. While the Court agrees with Respondents' reasoning here, the Court admonishes them to avoid such error in the future by either requesting an excuse of this requirement prior to filing a summary judgment motion or collaborating with opposing counsel in the event that the parties file cross-motions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Oakley v. City of Memphis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%206908345\">\n    2010 WL 6908345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20143451\">\n    2010 U.S. Dist.

Nonetheless, the Court finds that the factual record is sufficiently developed in order to rule on both summary judgment motions without a statement of undisputed material facts from Respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based upon the undisputed material facts before it, the Court now turns to the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

For example, finding, used in the singular form, can be an archaeological term that could lead to an absurdity in the context of the CSA if its meaning was forced upon \"findings.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding,\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary.\n   </em>\n   In its broadest sense, a finding could be interpreted as a \"discovery\" or \"the act of a person or thing that finds.\" Finding,\n   <em>\n    The Random House Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   (2d unabridged ed. 1987). But as this still does not fit with the actions of the DEA, it is easy to see that Congress did intend to use \"findings\" in the plural form. \"Determinations,\" however, does not have a separate definition from determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Determination,\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary.\n   </em>\n   This creates a dilemma for the Court's interpretation of \"conclusions\" since Congress might have easily meant to have imparted the meaning of either the singular or plural form of the word based on their language usage in the same sentence of the statute. Other things being equal, the Court is inclined to defer to the language actually used by Congress. A common rule of statutory construction, however, guides the Court to the same result. The Court must, if possible, give effect to every word in a statute.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While the subject \"all final determinations, findings, and conclusions\" refers to the administration of a particular matter by the DEA, the exception to \"final and conclusive decisions\" permitting judicial review by the United States Court of Appeals indicates that \"final and conclusive decisions\" functions to establish a general prohibition on judicial review of matters that fall within the scope of \"final determinations, findings, and conclusions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   But the \"final\" that directly modifies \"determinations, findings, and conclusions\" remains. And the Court must grapple with the competing sense of \"finality\" that permeates the meaning of the modified words in an endeavor to avoid any surplusage if at all possible. The use of \"final\" here is best understood as making the point that the decision, inquiry, judgment, or other last act must truly be at its end. This syntactic choice appears to embody the idea of the working hypothesis-the DEA might have reached a preliminary determination or a provisional conclusion. Such things are not a \"final and conclusive decision\" that cannot be reviewed except by the United States Court of Appeals. The\n   DEA's action must have reached its end.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is left to conclude that \"final determinations, findings, and conclusions\" simply refers to the decisions, judgments, inquiries, or other last act of the DEA's process that marks the end of the DEA's examination of the merits of a particular matter. \"Final decisions\" or \"final decision\" thus becomes a convenient and not incorrect shorthand for the otherwise cumbersome language of this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At first glance, a decision seems remarkably different from \"the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.\" But a closer examination of \"agency action\" reveals that the phrase captures any final act taken by an agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) - (6), (13). By the terms of the APA, an agency action is \"an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 551(13). \" '[O]rder' means ... a final disposition ... in a matter other than rule making....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 551(6).

Thus, in terms of final acts by an agency, such action is necessarily either an order or rule making, both of which constitute an \"agency action.\" As the DEA is unquestionably an agency, this means that any final decision is necessarily also a \"final agency action.\" But is a \"final agency action\" also a final decision? The Court thinks it likely. Any action taken by DEA, once finalized, is captured by the plain language of section 877. \"Decisions\" seem to be the primary target of the language, but as it also contains reasoned judgments, the results of an inquiry, or other last acts, it would seem that end of the matter marks the beginning of the courts of appeals' jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court holds no gap exists between \"final agency action\" under the APA and \"final determinations, findings, and conclusions\" under the CSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

This action satisfies the\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   test because the DEA's decisionmaking process has concluded and the decision had legal consequences for both Petitioners. At the initiation of this action, the DEA had completed its informal adjudication and determined that Petitioners could not work at HCCH under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201301.76\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) absent a waiver.

Once it informed HCCH that they could not employ Petitioners without a waiver, the DEA had effectively concluded its enforcement of the regulation.

Instead, Petitioners claim that the Court has jurisdiction over this matter because they\n   are not challenging a final action but the applicability of the regulation entirely. In support of this proposition, Petitioners direct the Court to\n   <em>\n    Monson v.

However, the Court finds it difficult to ascribe to this reading of section 877. At the outset, there is no requirement that the DEA \"issue\" anything.

Informal adjudications constitute a residual category including 'all agency actions that are not rulemaking and that need not be conducted through \"on the record\" hearings.' \"). If it wanted to restrict \"determinations, findings, and conclusions\" to formal adjudications-\"where there has been [a] formal finding, conclusion or determination based on a record\"-Congress could do so quite easily.\n   <em>\n    Monson v.

But Congress has not done so, and there is thus no reason to suspect that Congress intended section 877 to involve only those decisions issued at the conclusion of a formal process. Again, the Court merely uses \"final decision\" as a convenient shorthand. As the Court has discussed at length, \"determinations, findings, and conclusions\" captures all final actions of the DEA under Title 21, and those final actions become \"final and conclusive decisions\" for the purposes of precluding the district courts\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   from reviewing the actions. The application of the regulation fits well within that broad scope, and, as a result, section 877 precludes the Court from entertaining any challenge to the application of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201301.76\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
