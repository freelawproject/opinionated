The Motion has been fully briefed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will grant the Motion insofar as Plaintiff agrees to the dismissal of certain claims, but will deny the Motion as to the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and depression. Compl. \u00b6 12. Plaintiff was diagnosed when young, and he has received treatment for a number of years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He has been in therapy and periodically has taken psychiatric medications for these conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From 2007 through 2016, Plaintiff continuously took medication for his psychiatric diagnoses. Compl. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was employed by UNMH from October 30, 2007, until his employment was terminated on March 23, 2016. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. During this time, Plaintiff occasionally experienced increased symptoms due to his psychiatric conditions, but because he was able to predict when these episodes would occur he was able to continue working with the aid of his medications. Compl. \u00b6 18. He performed his job duties satisfactorily during this time. Compl. \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, Plaintiff's symptoms became more frequent and intense in the beginning of 2016, and his medical providers recommended that Plaintiff begin structured therapy and more consistent treatment. Compl. \u00b6 19. In February 2016 Plaintiff began receiving treatment and therapy through Outcomes, a UNMH-sponsored health care program. Compl. \u00b6 20. Outcomes recognized that Plaintiff's psychiatric condition required more frequent therapy sessions and work accommodations for his deteriorating mental health.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff submitted paperwork to UNMH under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq., for this purpose. Compl. \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about March 7, 2016, Plaintiff experienced an episode of severe anxiety that caused him to take leave for ten days on his physician's recommendation. Compl. \u00b6 22. On March 17, 2016, Plaintiff's Outcomes health care provider Daniel Crowder signed off on an FMLA Certification of Health Care Provider, noting that (1) the onset of Plaintiff's serious health condition was February 26, 2016; (2) the estimated\n   duration of the condition was one year; (3) the recommendation was weekly to biweekly therapy for six months to one year; (4) Plaintiff suffered from decreased attention and focus leading to lowered productivity; (5) Plaintiff suffered from PTSD; (6) Plaintiff's condition would periodically cause intense symptoms; (7) these episodes of intensity could occur 1-2 times per day, would cause Plaintiff to be ineffective at work, and would periodically prevent Plaintiff from performing his work duties in such a manner as to require him to be absent from work. Compl. \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 18, 2016, Plaintiff's first day back at work from leave, Plaintiff delivered this Certification to his supervisor, Defendant Lopez, along with a signed FMLA Notice of Eligibility that was dated that same day. Compl. \u00b6 24. Lopez filled out UNMH's Notice of Eligibility that day and noted that Plaintiff had submitted his medical certification, but marked both the \"yes\" and the \"no\" boxes as to whether a workplace accommodation was required despite the provider's statement in the certification that Plaintiff's condition would periodically require Plaintiff to be absent from work. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 23, 2016, Plaintiff was at work when he experienced increased symptoms including severe anxiety. Compl. \u00b6 27. Plaintiff approached Lopez with concerns about his condition and requested that he be allowed to leave work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Lopez replied that taking leave should not be a problem since it was FMLA-related, but stated that he would get clarification before responding to the leave request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff continued to work for approximately 30 more minutes, then met again with Lopez. Compl. \u00b6 28. At this time Lopez informed Plaintiff that UNMH could not accommodate Plaintiff's request because several other employees were out of the office.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff returned to work although the intensity of his symptoms had not subsided.

Compl. \u00b6 30. Lopez became angry with Plaintiff and began to accuse Plaintiff of not doing his job.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This confrontation exacerbated Plaintiff's symptoms and Plaintiff experienced a panic attack.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff began to suffer hot flashes, a startle response, and uncontrollable irritability. Compl. \u00b6 31. Plaintiff warned Lopez that he was experiencing the symptoms of a panic attack, but Lopez continued to accuse Plaintiff of poor job performance. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32. Plaintiff was overcome by anxiety and rushed out of Lopez's office, leaving behind his badge and personal belongings. Compl. \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As Plaintiff left, he called his girlfriend Danielle Telles and told her he was experiencing severe symptoms and needed immediate medical help. Compl. \u00b6 34. Plaintiff contacted his providers and requested treatment, but he could not get an appointment until the next morning so he went to the UNMH Mental Health Urgent Care Clinic where he was seen and treated. Compl. \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Telles called Lopez to advise him that Plaintiff had sought treatment for his March 23 panic attack.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Telles followed up on March 24, 2016, with further calls to Plaintiff's supervisors. Compl. \u00b6 36. In accordance with UNMH policy, Telles called Defendant Duenas at least two hours before Plaintiff was scheduled to work on March 24, 2016, and left a message informing Duenas that Plaintiff was receiving medical treatment for his symptoms from the previous day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Telles did not receive\n   a return call from either Lopez or Duenas. Compl. \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff was released from UNMH Mental Health on March 24, 2016, but was given a medical note stating that he could not return to work before March 28, 2016. Compl. \u00b6 38. Since she had not received any response to her earlier calls, Telles left a message with the secretary of the department where Plaintiff worked asking Plaintiff's supervisors to call Telles as soon as possible so that Telles could update them on Plaintiff's prognosis and his expected absence from work until March 28, 2016. Compl. \u00b6 39. But Plaintiff's supervisors still did not respond to the message. Compl. \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, on March 28, 2016, at approximately 4:00 p.m. Telles received a phone call from Defendant Hilton, who was the department manager and Lopez' supervisor. Compl. \u00b6 41. Hilton informed Telles that she would not discuss any issue related to Plaintiff with Telles.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Soon after, Plaintiff received a letter from UNMH dated March 23, 2016, and advising that Plaintiff's employment with UNMH had ended due to his alleged voluntary resignation on March 23, 2016. Compl. \u00b6 42. The letter was from Hilton, and noted that Plaintiff had requested FMLA leave but stated that the request was denied because Plaintiff's FMLA leave had not yet been approved. Compl. \u00b6 43. Plaintiff did not resign from his position with UNMH.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff characterizes the letter as \"a fabrication of Lopez and Hilton to justify an unlawful termination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During Plaintiff's unemployment appeal hearing, UNMH and Hilton admitted that (1) they knew of Telles' telephone calls to UNMH regarding Plaintiff; (2) they intentionally decided not to return Telles' calls; (3) they knew that Plaintiff had requested leave on March 23, 2016, for a condition related to the contents of his FMLA paperwork; and (4) if they had known of the severity of Plaintiff's medical condition on March 23, 2016, Plaintiff would not have been separated from his employment. Compl. \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on these circumstances, Plaintiff filed suit against all Defendants for FMLA interference (Count I), FMLA retaliation (Counts II and III), violation of due process (Count IV), breach of implied contract (Count V), retaliatory discharge (Count VI), and wrongful termination (Count VII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff brings his claims under \u00a7 2615(a) of the FMLA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and New Mexico common law.

Although Defendants cite Rule 12(b)(6) in their Motion, Defendants have answered the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer (Doc. No. 5). The Court will therefore consider the Motion under Rule 12(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"A motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is treated as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Richfield Co. v.

Mot. at 2. Plaintiff acknowledges that UNMH is entitled to sovereign immunity from suit based on the self-care provision of the FMLA, \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

Plaintiff therefore consents to the dismissal of Counts I, II, and III as to Defendant UNMH only. Resp. at 3. Plaintiff also acknowledges that the remedial scheme of the FMLA forecloses a retaliatory discharge claim under \u00a7 1983 as pleaded in the Complaint, and Plaintiff agrees that Count VI should be dismissed. Resp. at 16. Accordingly, the Court will dismiss Counts I, II, and III against UNMH and Count VI against all Defendants, and the Court will analyze the parties' arguments only as to Plaintiff's remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

It is unlawful for any employer to interfere with or retaliate against an employee's exercise or attempted exercise of these rights. \u00a7 2615(a). But Defendants Lopez, Duenas, and Hilton argue that they cannot be held individually liable as employers under the FMLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The definition of \"employer\" in the FMLA is substantively identical to that in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

There is a split among the circuits on this point. Defendants rely on cases from the Fourth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, which have drawn a distinction between the public and private sectors. While these Courts have acknowledged that the definition of \"employer\" in the FMLA is similar to that of the FLSA and that the statutory language provides for individual liability, they have concluded that, at least under the FMLA, this extends only to private-sector employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reached this conclusion based on its past precedent interpreting the term \"employer\" in the FLSA to exclude a public official acting in his or her individual capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wascura v.

Because of the similarity of the statutory definitions of \"employer,\"\n   <em>\n    Wascura\n   </em>\n   reasoned that the FMLA must be interpreted identically to the FLSA. Therefore the FLSA precedent was controlling and prohibited any individual liability for a public employee under the FMLA.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414167\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/57/1004/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But this conclusion is not required in the Tenth Circuit, which has no analogous precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

The Sixth Circuit, however, had not previously decided the individual liability of a public employee under either the FLSA or the FMLA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097224\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/811/#p828\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 832 n.27.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   therefore looked to the text of the FMLA and concluded that the statute compelled a distinction between public and private employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097224\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/811/#p828\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097224\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/811/#p828\">\n    at 829-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite the similarity of the FMLA to the FLSA, the Sixth Circuit concluded that small textual differences required that they be interpreted differently. It relied primarily on the separation of the individual liability provision, \u00a7 2611(4)(A)(ii)(I), and the public agency provision, \u00a7 2611(4)(A)(iii), into two distinct clauses. Because the term \"employer\" is followed by a dash, the Court determined that clauses (i)-(iv) after the dash all modified that term, but that there was no punctuation suggesting an interrelationship between them. Confusingly, it emphasized that clause (ii) was followed by a second dash, which it viewed as creating a relationship between subclauses (ii)(I) and (ii)(II), although this reasoning seems contrary to its argument that the first dash did not link clauses (i)-(iv). The Court also stated that an interpretation that allowed\n   for the individual liability of public agency employees would render \u00a7 2611(4)(B) superfluous. Finally,\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   opined that commingling the public agency and individual liability provisions would restate the language of the FLSA, which would be inconsistent with the rest of the FMLA where parts of the FLSA are directly referred to rather than paraphrased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   relied heavily on the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Keene v.

The plain language of the FMLA states that an \"employer\" includes a public agency, which \"shall be considered to be a person engaged in commerce or in an industry or activity affecting commerce[,]\" and that it also includes \"any person who acts, directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such employer[.]\" \u00a7 2611(4). The implementing regulations state that this section mirrors the FLSA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.104\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Nothing in the text of the FMLA suggests that the word \"employer\" in the individual liability provision has a different meaning than the statutory definition of \"employer\" set forth in the same section to specifically include public agencies. The Court therefore concludes that the FMLA subjects an employee of a public agency \"who acts ... in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such employer\" to individual liability for violations of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nevertheless, the individual Defendants maintain that Plaintiff has not sufficiently pleaded their qualifications as employers. They argue that, to be liable, individuals must have an organizational role beyond a managerial position. They assert that Plaintiff has failed to plead that any of them had any responsibilities within UNMH other than those of a supervisor or manager. Plaintiff contends that Defendants are mischaracterizing the facts of the Complaint and attempting to unjustifiably narrow the statutory definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Individual liability in this circuit through qualification as an \"employer\" under the FMLA has been thoroughly reviewed and analyzed by District Judge James Browning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saavedra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260889\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/748/1273/#p1283\">\n    748 F.Supp.2d at 1283-88, 1291-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, Plaintiff relies on Defendants' alleged failure to comply with the \"just cause\" requirement and other unidentified policies and procedures. The Court notes that the failure to follow contractual policies and procedures does not necessarily constitute a violation of federal due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174554\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/1039/#p1044\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the facts as alleged in the Complaint suggest that Plaintiff had a protected interest in his employment and that his employment was terminated without any prior notice or hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants base their motion to dismiss this claim primarily on their theory that Plaintiff voluntarily resigned from his position.

The individual Defendants contend that they are therefore entitled to qualified immunity because\n   Plaintiff has not established that their conduct violated his constitutional right. But Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants neither possessed nor articulated just cause for his dismissal. Further, even if just cause did exist, where Plaintiff possesses a protected interest in his position he must still be afforded an opportunity to respond before his employment is terminated.

While Defendants assert that \"[i]t is not uncommon\" for certain administrative procedures to be required even when an employee has been discharged, they do not contend that UNMH had such requirements or that Plaintiff failed to fulfill them. Further, the failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense that does not implicate the legal sufficiency of the Complaint because the exhaustion of administrative remedies is not an element of the cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UJI 13-2302 NMRA; UJI 13-2303 NMRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiff has not alleged any specific conduct constituting a breach of contract and has not described the policies or procedures alleged to have been violated by Defendants.
