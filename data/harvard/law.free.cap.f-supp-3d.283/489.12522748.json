Thus, there is a logical relationship between Count One and Count Two. Further, in order to prove Count Three, Honest Services Mail Fraud, the government must prove that an \"official act\" occurred; this burden is also required for the government to prove Count Two. Indeed, the Court's statutory interpretation of \"official act\" in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   related to honest services fraud, not bribery.\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The parties agreed that they would define honest services fraud with reference to the federal bribery statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"). Thus, the government must prove that an \"official act\" occurred for both Count Two and Count Three, using the same definition from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Accordingly, there is a logical relationship between Count Two and Count Three. With a logical relationship between all Counts, the court\n   <strong>\n    FINDS\n   </strong>\n   that the Counts are properly joined under Rule 8 as part of a common scheme or plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nonetheless, the Defendant alleges that prejudice would occur, if Count Two remains joined with Counts One and Three. In this regard, the Defendant claims: (1) the government must \"overcome the overinclusiveness and ambiguity found throughout the Indictment in order to establish that any bribery conduct\" occurred; (2) \"if the counts are not separated, the charges of conspiracy and honest services fraud runs [sic] the risk of confusing the jury\" (3) \"the cumulation of the evidence ... would not only challenge the government's ability to properly segregate the specifics of each Count, but also would require a degree of mental gymnastics that could easily overwhelm the jury's ability to segregate each specific allegation,\" and associated evidence; and (4) \"putting the conspiracy and honest services fraud Counts before the jury without first addressing the government's burden to ... establish any bribes certainly presents an unnecessary risk that the jury would find Mr. Miserendino guilty of bribery based upon misguided perceptions of criminal disposition,\" based on Counts One and Three. Mot. to Dismiss/Sever at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With regard to the Defendant's first ground of prejudice, the government has the burden at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Winship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/#p363\">\n    397 U.S. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363-64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/#p363\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/#p363\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970). Any \"overinclusiveness\" and \"ambiguity\" that the Defendant alleges in the Indictment can be tested at trial via the government's introduction of evidence. It does not prejudice the Defendant in such a way as to necessitate severance in the way Rule 14 contemplates. With regard to the Defendant's second ground of prejudice, the government will be required at trial to prove an \"official act\" occurred for both honest services fraud and bribery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This overlap in the statutory definition of \"official act\" means that there is little risk of confusing the jury regarding the evidence required for each count. The jury will be instructed by the court to consider each count separately, and the evidence pertaining thereto, as well there will be separate jury instructions for each count and the elements for which proof is required beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With regard to the Defendant's third ground of prejudice, all three charges relate to alleged transactions that are connected as part of a common scheme or plan, pursuant to Rule 8. There is no evidence or reasoning presented that the \"cumulation of evidence,\" Mot. to Dismiss/Sever at 17, with which the Defendant is concerned would occur. The relatedness\n   of the conduct charged makes joinder proper, and supersedes any risk of prejudice that may arise from the jury's supposed inability to segregate the Counts and corresponding evidence, as the Defendant alleges. Lastly, with regard to the Defendant's fourth ground of prejudice, the Counts are joined because they \"constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 493-94. As such, evidence of one Count \"would ordinarily be admissible at a separate trial for the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Foutz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"315451\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/540/733/#p736\">\n    540 F.2d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit has established that no additional prejudice to a defendant results from such counts being tried together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"315451\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/540/733/#p736\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"315451\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/540/733/#p736\">\n    at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Therefore, the Defendant has failed to allege sufficient prejudice resulting from the joinder of these Counts, such that severance under Rule 14 is necessary. \"It is not enough for the defendant to show that severance offers him 'a better chance of acquittal.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cardwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881049\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/378/#p385\">\n    433 F.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.
