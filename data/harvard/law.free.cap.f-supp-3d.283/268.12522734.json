Kuhns and his wife, Shannon C. Kuhns, bring this diversity\n   action for declaratory relief against the defendant, The Travelers Home and Marine Insurance Company (\"Travelers\"), claiming that Travelers wrongfully denied them stacked, underinsured motorist coverage. Even though Mr. Kuhns acknowledges that he expressly waived stacked, underinsured motorist coverage when he initially bought his motor vehicle insurance policy from Travelers, he claims that Travelers was required to provide him with another opportunity to waive such coverage when he subsequently added a new vehicle to his policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Travelers contends, however, that it was not required to do so and that the waiver Mr. Kuhns initially executed had continuing effect, such that it was valid at the time of the subject motor vehicle accident. Having extensively reviewed the substantive law of Pennsylvania, regarding such stacking issues, we conclude that the Kuhns are not entitled to the relief that they seek in this action. Thus, for the reasons set forth below, we will grant Travelers's pending motion for summary judgment, and deny the Kuhns's pending cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 18, 2015, the Kuhns filed a complaint (\n   <em>\n    doc. 1\n   </em>\n   ) under the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to which Travelers filed an answer with affirmative defenses (\n   <em>\n    doc. 6\n   </em>\n   ). The parties subsequently consented to proceed before a United States Magistrate Judge (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    doc. 12\n   </em>\n   ), and the matter was reassigned to the undersigned Chief Magistrate Judge pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    doc. 13\n   </em>\n   ). Following reassignment, we held a telephonic case management conference with the parties (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    doc. 14\n   </em>\n   ), and in accordance with that conference, we issued an order (\n   <em>\n    doc. 16\n   </em>\n   ), setting forth the deadlines that would govern this action moving forward. Thereafter, the parties filed a document titled, \"The Parties' Joint Stipulation of Facts\" (hereinafter, \"Joint Stipulation\" or \"Stipulation\") (\n   <em>\n    doc. 17\n   </em>\n   ), followed by cross-motions for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    docs. 20, 24\n   </em>\n   ). Before we turn to the merits of those motions, however, we set forth the undisputed, material facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or around May 7, 2008, Travelers issued a motor vehicle insurance policy, bearing policy number 982954574 101 1, effective May 9, 2008, to November 9, 2008\n   (\"Policy\"), to Mr. Kuhns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Doc. 17\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.

This Declarations sheet is similar to the \"Automobile Policy Declarations\" sheet (\n   <em>\n    doc. 24-2\n   </em>\n   at 17-20) that was issued at the inception of the Policy, as both sheets reflect non-stacked, uninsured and underinsured motorists benefits of \"$100,000 each accident\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moreover, Travelers never requested (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16) or required (\n   <em>\n    doc. 20-1\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12) Mr. Kuhns \"to complete any forms in order to replace or add vehicles to the [Policy],\" including the fourth vehicle.

Further, the Kuhns never paid insurance premiums for stacked, uninsured or underinsured motorists coverages (\n   <em>\n    doc. 20-1\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19); rather, they merely paid the premiums as invoiced by Travelers under the terms of the Policy as it was originally written\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    doc. 17\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18).

Travelers further asserts that because this clause is continuous in nature, the statutory waiver requirement under \u00a7 1738(c) was never triggered. Thus, based on these assertions, Travelers contends that it was under no obligation to provide or secure a new waiver from the Kuhns. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The plain language of the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle clause provides that, in addition to any of the vehicles shown in the Declarations, coverage will also be extended\n   to newly-acquired vehicles, and specifically, private passenger autos, pickups, and vans, so long as: those newly-acquired vehicles were acquired during the policy period; the insured asked the insurer to insure those vehicles within 30 days of becoming the owner; and with respect to any pickups or vans, there is no other insurance policy out there that provides coverage for those vehicles. In other words, the Policy will extend coverage to any vehicles shown in the Declarations, as well as any new vehicles the insured(s) subsequently acquires, provided that these conditions are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Applying that framework here, we find that, at the inception of the Policy, coverage was only being extended to the three vehicles shown in the original \"Automobile Policy Declarations\" sheet-i.e., the Dodge Ram Pickup, the Dodge Durango, and the Chevrolet C30.\n   <em>\n    Doc. 24-2\n   </em>\n   at 17-20. But, we further find that, when the Kuhns subsequently acquired a fourth vehicle-i.e., the Ford F150 Pickup Trick-coverage also began being extended to that vehicle pursuant to the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle clause. The reason for this is that requisite conditions of that clause were satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Indeed, the Joint Stipulation makes clear that the Kuhn's fourth vehicle, which was a pickup, was acquired during the Policy period.\n   <em>\n    Compare doc. 17\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1 (asserting that when the Policy was originally issued to the Kuhns, it had effective dates of May 9, 2008, to November 9, 2008)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7 (asserting that the Kuhn's fourth vehicle was added to the Policy on July 1, 2008, a date that falls well within the timeframe of those effective dates). The Joint Stipulation also makes clear that the Kuhns's fourth vehicle was added to the Policy within 30 days of having been purchased (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13), and that it constituted a \"covered auto\" as defined in Section J.2 of the Policy (the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle clause) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). And, finally, while not made clear by the Joint Stipulation, neither party has argued, and we see no evidence to suggest, that there was another insurance policy out there, providing coverage for the Kuhns's fourth vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Accordingly, because the conditions of the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle clause had been satisfied, coverage was automatically extended to the Kuhns's fourth vehicle on the date that they became the owner of that vehicle, and such coverage continued to be extended for the existing policy period. Thus, since this coverage was automatic and continuing, we conclude, under\n   <em>\n    Sackett II\n   </em>\n   , that the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle clause is continuous, and not finite, in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   We find that our conclusion is supported by\n   <em>\n    Satterfield v.

In support of this argument, the Kuhns have raised the following assertions: that their fourth vehicle was similarly added to the Policy by way of a declarations sheet and endorsement; and that the language of the instant after-acquired-vehicle clause is comparable to that of the one in\n   <em>\n    Bumbarger\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   We first review the Kuhns's contention that, similar to the facts of\n   <em>\n    Bumbarger\n   </em>\n   , their fourth vehicle was added to the Policy pursuant to a declarations sheet and endorsement, not an after-acquired-vehicle clause. We find, however, that their contention is inconsistent with how Pennsylvania's Insurance Commissioner interprets after-acquired-vehicle clauses in the context of stacking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sackett II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303465,4089237\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/940/329/\">\n    940 A.2d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reiterating the Commissioner's interpretation as follows: \"the mechanism by which vehicles generally are added to existing policies is via 'newly acquired vehicle clauses,' which are made practically necessary by the mandate of the MVFRL for financial responsibility as a prerequisite to operation of a motor vehicle,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1786, and are included universally within automobile insurance policies issued in Pennsylvania.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We also find that their contention is inconsistent with the plain language of the instant Policy. Under the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle clause, coverage will be extended to a new vehicle, on the date the Kuhns become the owner of that vehicle, so long as the following conditions have been satisfied: the Kuhns acquired the new vehicle during the policy period; they asked Travelers to insure that new vehicle within 30 days of becoming the owner; and with respect to any pickups or vans, the new vehicle was not already covered under another insurance policy. These conditions, as discussed above, were satisfied, and therefore, the Policy automatically extended coverage to the Kuhns's fourth vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   It bears emphasis, that the Policy would have extended such coverage regardless of whether Travelers issued the new \"Automobile Policy Declarations\" sheet on July 1, 2008. Indeed, while the fourth vehicle\n   may have certainly been \"added\" to this \"Automobile Policy Declarations\" sheet, neither the adding of the fourth vehicle to that sheet, nor the issuance of that sheet, triggered Travelers's contractual duty to extend coverage to the Kuhns's newly-acquired vehicle. Instead, its duty was triggered by the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle clause.\n   <em>\n    Doc. 24-2\n   </em>\n   at 23. And, in this regard, we find it particularly fitting to echo the insightful words of Justice Stabile in his dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Bumbarger\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   New waivers are required when there has been a \"new\" purchase of insurance. New insurance does not include additions to an existing policy that merely extends coverage on a continuous basis. Ultimately, decisions in stacking cases must rest upon an examination of contractual language. Interpreting contracts is nothing new to our courts. The resolution of these cases can be and will be made much simpler if we return to interpreting contracts, as opposed to deciding cases based purely upon the manner in which a vehicle is added to a policy. The latter ignores our duty to engage in contractual analysis[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    Pergolese\n   </em>\n   , 162 A.3d at 502 (Stabile, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Next, we address the Kuhn's argument that the language of the instant after-acquired-vehicle clause is similar to that of the one in\n   <em>\n    Bumbarger\n   </em>\n   . In support of this argument, the Kuhns have raised several allegations. To the extent the Kuhns allege that, like the clause in\n   <em>\n    Bumbarger\n   </em>\n   , the Policy's clause distinguishes between vehicles that are added to a policy and vehicles that replace those, which are already insured thereunder, we find that their argument is unpersuasive. The sheer fact that an after-acquired-vehicle clause differentiates between replacement and add-on vehicles is not alone dispositive of whether the clause is continuous or finite in nature. Instead, the pertinent inquiry is to ascertain the specific terms of that clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Further, to the extent that the Kuhns allege that the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle clause is finite in nature, just as it was in\n   <em>\n    Bumbarger\n   </em>\n   , we also find that this argument is unpersuasive. As discussed above, the coverage under the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle is automatic, and continues in effect throughout the existing policy period. As also discussed above, the\n   <em>\n    Bumbarger\n   </em>\n   Court failed to include the relevant policy provisions in its opinion, and it further failed to offer a meaningful discussion on why the after-acquired-vehicle clause before it was, in fact, finite. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Bumbarger\n   </em>\n   , is of little value to us here, especially since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has plainly spoken on such stacking issues in\n   <em>\n    Sackett I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Moreover, to the extent that the Kuhns similarly argue that various conditions of the Policy's after-acquired-vehicle clause-such as the condition of notice-render it finite in nature, we once again find that their argument is unpersuasive. Conditions subsequent, such as notice and the payment of premiums, do not render an after-acquired-vehicle clause finite in nature.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sackett II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303465,4089237\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/940/329/\">\n    940 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   334 (citing\n   <em>\n    Christensen v.

Conclusion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   To conclude, we have been tasked with applying Pennsylvania's statutory provisions of stacked, underinsured motorist coverage, as set out in the MVFRL. Those statutory provisions, which have largely been interpreted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sackett I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sackett II\n   </em>\n   , lead us to the conclusion that the Kuhns are not entitled to the declaratory relief that they seek in this action. Thus, for the reasons discussed herein, we will grant Travelers's pending motion for summary judgment, and deny the Kuhns's pending cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   An appropriate implementing order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    We refer specifically to Mr. Kuhns since he appears to be the only \"[N]amed [I]nsured\" under the subject policy.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     doc. 24-2\n    </em>\n    at 17, 57.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Pursuant to the Local Rules for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, a party moving for summary judgment must attach to the motion \"a separate, short and concise statement of the material facts[,]\" and the non-moving party is required to submit \"a separate, short and concise statement\" in response thereto.
