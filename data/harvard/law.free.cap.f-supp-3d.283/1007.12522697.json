Ms. Koontz claims that this law violates both the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. This matter comes before the court on Ms. Koontz's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 3).

And multiple private individuals testified to the same effect. Several individuals emphasized the need to oppose \"Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions\" campaigns, which protest the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel by applying economic pressure to Israel. During a committee hearing about the bill\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that became the Kansas Law, the Director of Marketing and Research for the Kansas Department of Commerce testified that Israel and Kansas are substantial trading partners. The Department of Commerce calculated that in 2016, Kansas exported $56 million worth of commodities to Israel while importing $83 million from Israel. The Kansas Law's fiscal note asserted that the Kansas Law would not affect the Kansas state government fiscally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Boycott of Israel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2017, plaintiff Esther Koontz began boycotting Israeli businesses. She first became motivated to boycott Israel in 2016 when she saw a presentation about conditions in Israel and Palestine. And on July 6, 2017, Mennonite Church USA passed a resolution calling on Mennonites to take steps to redress the injustice and violence that both Palestinians and Israelis have experienced. Ms. Koontz is a member of a Mennonite Church organization. Specifically, this organization's resolution called on Mennonites to boycott products associated with Israel's occupation of Palestine. As a consequence, plaintiff decided she would not buy any products or services from Israeli companies or from any company who operates in Israeli-occupied Palestine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Efforts to Contract with Kansas\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff is a curriculum coach at a public school in Wichita, Kansas. As part of her regular duties, she supports her school's curriculum and teaches teachers how to implement it. Before she began working in this position, plaintiff taught math in the Wichita public schools. During the 2016-17 academic year, the Kansas State Department of Education (\"KSDE\") selected plaintiff to participate as a teacher trainer in KSDE's Math and Science Partnership program. In this program, KSDE contracts with professional educators to provide coaching and training to public school\n   math and science teachers throughout Kansas. Plaintiff wants to participate in the program, both to enhance her career and earn extra spending money. Plaintiff would have earned an extra $600 per day (plus travel expenses) for each training she gives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 31, 2017, plaintiff successfully completed the requisite training to serve as trainer for the program. Shortly afterward, the program director for the Math and Science Partnership, Melissa Fast, began sending plaintiff travel requests asking her to lead training programs for other teachers. Plaintiff said she was willing to conduct three of the trainings that Ms. Fast initially offered her. In the future, plaintiff asserts, she would like to do as many training sessions as she can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 10, 2017, the program director asked Ms. Koontz to sign a certification confirming that she was not participating in a boycott of Israel, as the Kansas Law requires. Initially, plaintiff did not respond because she wanted to consider her options. On August 9, 2017, plaintiff emailed the program director and told her that she had decided to refuse to sign the certification. The program director responded that Kansas could not pay plaintiff as a contractor unless she signed the certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite plaintiff's eligibility and interest in participating in the Math and Science Partnership program, the KSDE declined to contract with plaintiff because she would not sign the certification. But in this case, defendant Randall D. Watson\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   submitted an affidavit from the Secretary of Administration, Sarah Shipman. It asserts that Secretary Shipman would have waived the certification requirement if plaintiff had asked her to do so. It is undisputed that plaintiff did not apply for the waiver authorized by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075\">\n    Kan.

There, two candidates for popularly elected judicial office challenged two provisions in the Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1111. The provisions prohibited candidates for judicial office from making certain pledges and personally soliciting support for their campaigns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Two candidates sued, presenting both a facial and as applied challenge asserting that these restrictions infringed their First Amendment rights of political expression.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Our court concluded that the claims were ripe and found that plaintiffs likely would succeed on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It thus entered a preliminary injunction forbidding enforcement of the provisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal,\n   <em>\n    Stout\n   </em>\n   's defendants again challenged the ripeness of plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1115-16. They argued that no one had initiated a disciplinary action against the judicial candidates for violating the restrictions and so, \"plaintiffs' fears of prosecution are illusory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1117. The Circuit rejected defendants' argument, reasoning: \"So long as the [provisions] remain in effect in their current form, the state is free to initiate such action against candidates [for judicial office].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1118 (citing\n   <em>\n    Grant v.

Ms. Koontz's boycott of Israel does not expose her to fear of prosecution (as in\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416060\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/1495/#p1499\">\n    64 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1501 ) or professional discipline (as in\n   <em>\n    Stout\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552456\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1107/#p1114\">\n    519 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1118 ). Instead, the Kansas Law simply disqualifies plaintiff from eligibility for reaping the benefits of a contract with the State of Kansas that she otherwise would have received,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a contract compensating plaintiff for serving as a trainer for the Math and Science Partnership. But the court concludes that this difference is immaterial. The challenged Kansas Law still imposes a hardship on plaintiff and, potentially, others subject to its disqualifying provision. As long as the Kansas Law \"remains in effect in [its] current form, the state is free\" to use it to disqualify other contractual aspirants.\n   <em>\n    Stout\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552456\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1107/#p1114\">\n    519 F.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Stout\n   </em>\n   , this presents the requisite hardship for purposes of the ripeness analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Potential \"Chilling Effect of the Challenged Law on First Amendment Liberties\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The second factor of the relaxed ripeness test requires the court to assess \"the chilling effect the challenged law may have on First Amendment liberties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552456\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1107/#p1114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1116 (citing\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416060\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/1495/#p1499\">\n    64 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1499-1500 ). In its cases applying this factor, the Circuit has expressed an important corollary to it. When the challenged statute is unconstitutionally vague, that vagueness \"greatly militates in favor of finding an otherwise premature controversy to be ripe.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416060\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/1495/#p1499\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1118 (citing\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416060\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/1495/#p1499\">\n    64 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1503 ). Indeed, the Circuit has observed that a plaintiff \"should not have to risk prosecution, under a statute whose scope is unclear, before [her] challenge to the constitutionality of that statute is ripe.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416060\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/1495/#p1499\">\n    64 F.3d at 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This corollary, then, frames the threshold question under this second factor: Is the Kansas Law challenged here vague? In one sense, it is not. It imposes a bright line rule. All prospective contractors must certify to Kansas that they are not boycotting Israel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kan. Stat. Ann \u00a7 75-3704f(a). If they don't so certify, they can't contract with the state. But a second aspect of the Kansas Law injects a significant degree of uncertainty. This provision authorizes the Kansas Secretary of Administration to waive the Kansas Law's certification requirement \"if the secretary determines that compliance is not\n   <em>\n    practicable\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416060\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/1495/#p1499\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 75-3704f(c) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   When is compliance \"not practicable?\" The Kansas Law does not say. Indeed, it provides no guidance about the meaning intended for this important term. Defendant's Opposition to plaintiff's injunction motion (Doc. 11) is mum on the subject as well. It never mentions the issue at all. But at oral argument, defense counsel described the standard applied to date by Kansas's Secretary of Administration. The Secretary has received, defense counsel represented, a few requests to waive the certification requirement. Some requests were submitted by putative contractors who asserted that they just didn't \"want to fill out another government form and deal with the state government to be a contractor.\" Counsel argued that the Secretary reasonably had determined it was \"practicable\" for these stubborn applicants to comply with the Kansas Law's certification requirement. Counsel contrasted this kind of contractor with Ms. Koontz. He explained that the plaintiff is \"a member of a church, a church [where] there's a religious belief that would oppose doing business with Israel.\" So, defense counsel asserted, the Secretary of Administration \"would grant the waiver when presented with evidence; [but] not [grant a waiver to a contractor who] just [said,] 'I don't want to do it.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court is not yet prepared to decide the constitutional sufficiency of such a malleable, uncertain definition for a term so central to the Kansas Law and to the ripeness analysis of plaintiff's claim.

Plaintiff's harm stems not from her decision to refuse to sign the certification, but rather from the plainly unconstitutional choice the Kansas Law forces plaintiff to make: She either can contract with the state or she can support a boycott of Israel. Her harm is ongoing because the Kansas Law is currently chilling plaintiff's and other putative state contractors' speech rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In short, the court finds that Ms. Koontz has shown that she will sustain irreparable harm unless the court enjoins defendant from enforcing the Kansas Law's certification requirement. She thus has shouldered her burden on the second element of the injunction standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Does plaintiff's irreparable harm outweigh any harm defendant will sustain if the court grants the preliminary injunction?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that her irreparable harm outweighs any harm defendant would bear if the court issued a preliminary injunction. Plaintiff asserts that defendant \"does not have an interest in enforcing a law that is likely constitutionally infirm.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edmondson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523191\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/742/#p771\">\n    594 F.3d at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff also argues that a preliminary injunction against the Kansas Law would maintain the status quo because the Kansas Law is sufficiently new that any harm to the State of Kansas and defendant is minimal. On the other hand, plaintiff argues that she and other state contractors will suffer great harm because defendant is depriving them of a constitutional right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Defendant argues that plaintiff has not shown any imminent or threatened injury and an injunction will harm Kansas and defendant greatly. Defendant notes that in 2016, Kansas exported more than $56 million worth of goods to Israel and imported more than $83 million worth of goods. Defendant fears that enjoining the Kansas Law will cause Israeli companies to refuse to do business in Kansas, or with Kansas companies, and thus harm the Kansas economy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendant's argument is not persuasive. Defendant adduced no evidence that Israeli companies will refuse to do business in or with the State of Kansas unless its ban against Israeli boycotts is enforced. And defendant has not forwarded any evidence that Kansas commerce has increased because of, or in anticipation of, the boycott ban. If such evidence existed, one would expect the defense to have access to it and have presented it. It didn't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   After balancing the relative harms imposed by a preliminary injunction, the\n   court finds that the continuing harm to plaintiff's First Amendment rights-and those of persons similarly situated-outweighs defendant's speculative suggestion that an injunction will harm him, the State of Kansas, or Kansas merchants. Ms. Koontz has carried her burden on this third part of the injunction test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Is the requested injunction adverse to the public harm?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The fourth and final touchstone of the preliminary injunction standard requires the injunction's proponent to show that it will not be adverse to the public interest. Plaintiff argues that a preliminary injunction will serve the public interest because it will protect constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edmondson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523191\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/742/#p771\">\n    594 F.3d at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" '[T]he public interest will [certainly] be served by enjoining the enforcement of the invalid provisions of state law.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bank One, Utah v.

Defendant also argues that it is in the public interest to enforce a law that prevents Kansans from discriminating against foreign companies doing business in Kansas. Last, defendant argues that enforcing the Kansas Law is in the public interest because the Kansas Law passed the Kansas House 99 to 13 and the Kansas Senate 36 to 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Here, the court already has concluded that it is highly likely that the Kansas Law is invalid and thus enjoining it will protect a constitutional right.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Part IV.A.1. Defendant has failed to produce evidence that an injunction will affect Kansas's relationship with Israeli companies. While the Kansas Law may have been passed by the legislature with flying colors, that showing merely would demonstrate that one state legislature had enacted a statute. Such a showing would not place the Kansas Law on the same level as an amendment to our Constitution-the very first amendment adopted by our founders and one ratified by three fourths of our states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. V. A desire to prevent discrimination against Israeli businesses is an insufficient public interest to overcome the public's interest in protecting a constitutional right. The court finds that an injunction will serve the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For reasons explained above, the court grants plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT\n   </strong>\n   plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 3) is granted.
