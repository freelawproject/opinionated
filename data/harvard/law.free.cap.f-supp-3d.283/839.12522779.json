The parties tried all six patents before a jury who, on August 4, 2015, found that Blue Coat infringed the '844, '968, '731, '633, and '780 patents and awarded Finjan a total of $39,528,487 in lump-sum damages.\n   <em>\n    Blue Coat I\n   </em>\n   , ECF 438 at 2-3, 6-7.

On this point, the Court agrees with Finjan that key-value pairing can be a \"database\" within the context of the '494 patent. The parties stipulated that \"database\" should be construed as \"a collection of interrelated data organized according to a database schema.\" ECF 180 at 1. Key-value pairings are a way of organizing interrelated data-keys to their related values. To the extent that \"schema\" implies a greater level of organization and/or relation between data than this, the Court finds it inappropriate to restrict the scope of \"database\" in this way. The plain language of claim 10 simply recites \"database,\" and nothing in the specification suggests that \"database\" should be restricted to any certain degree of data organization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

Indeed, the specification contrasts \"database\" with single-dimensional data structures (i.e., that have no interrelation) such as \"list\" or \"array,\" but it provides no further clarification.

Instead, the parties dispute whether PDF Labels and YARA rule hits constitute \"security profile data ... including a list of suspicious operations.\" Both of these issues are factual questions for the jury. For example, with respect to PDF Labels, Blue Coat's own expert acknowledges that at least some of the labels that can be assigned to PDFs indicate the existence of certain operations within the PDF.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   Ex. 27 to Finjan Mot.

Turning to [Redacted] the Court agrees with Blue Coat that there are at least disputed questions of material fact as to whether this comprises\n   a \"database\" that \"stor[es] ... security profile data.\" By the plain language of claim 10, \"security profile data\" must \"includ[e] a list of suspicious operations.\" Reading this limitation in light of the specification makes it clear that the \"security profile data\" must include (in addition to, for example, other types of metadata) a selective list of suspicious operations, not an indiscriminate list of all operations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '194 patent at col. 9 ll. 34-37 (describing how \"if the code scanner ... determines that the resolved command is suspect, then the code scanner ... decodes and registers the suspicious command and its command parameters as DSP data\"). Indeed, Finjan has itself taken a similar position before the PTAB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 to Blue Coat Opp. at 16, ECF 237-4 (\"Simply listing every operation, regardless of whether it is suspicious, does not create a list of suspicious computer operations without the additional step of deeming certain operations as suspicious.\"). Whether [Redacted] meets this bar is at least a disputed question of fact. On one hand, Mr. Runald, a Blue Coat employee, [Redacted] Ex. 4 to Finjan Reply at 201:19-202:9, ECF 249-12. On the other hand [Redacted] are not themselves \"suspicious operations.\" For example, [Redacted]\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8 to Blue Coat Opp. at 56:1-5, 197:1-4, ECF 238-11; Ex. 6 to Blue Coat Opp. at BC2-0070332, ECF 237-6; Ex. 7 to Blue Coat Opp. at BC2-0426163, ECF 238-10. Thus, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on the basis that [Redacted] is the infringing \"database.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Turning to [Redacted] the Court also finds that there are material questions of fact as to whether this is a \"database\" which \"stor[es] ... security profile data\" within the meaning of claim 10. For example, [Redacted] Ex. 45 to Finjan Mot. at BC2-1895322, ECF 227-34. However, pattern data\n   <em>\n    used for\n   </em>\n   matching is not the same as matches of suspicious operations that have been located for a particular file. Further, [Redacted]\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 8 to Blue Coat Opp. at 210:16-22, ECF 238-11 [Redacted] Ex. 9 to Blue Coat Opp. at 29:3-11, ECF 238-12 [Redacted] Thus, there are at least disputed questions of fact as to whether [Redacted] \"stor[es] ... security profile data\" which includes a \"list of suspicious operations,\" not all operations. Accordingly, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on the basis that [Redacted] is the infringing \"database.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Turning to the [Redacted] the Court also finds that there are material questions of fact as to whether this comprises a \"database\" that \"stor[es] ... security profile data.\" For example, [Redacted] Ex. 48 to Finjan Mot. at 90:8-18, ECF 227-36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 6 to Finjan Reply at 253:15-17. However, there is conflicting evidence as to whether these patterns amount to a \"list of suspicious operations.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 5 to Finjan Reply at 48:20-25, ECF 249-16 [Redacted] Accordingly, this is a factual dispute that must be left for the jury.

Cir. 1984). Accordingly, in order to bear its burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence at trial, Blue Coat will need to present \"testimony from one skilled in the art [which] identif[ies] each claim element, state[s] the witnesses' interpretation of the claim element, and explain[s] in detail how each claim element is disclosed in the prior art reference.\"\n   <em>\n    Schumer v.

Accordingly, because the ultimate issue of the validity of the '844, '968, and '731 patents was litigated in\n   <em>\n    Blue Coat I\n   </em>\n   , Blue Coat is estopped from re-litigating it here. Finjan's motion for summary judgment that the '844, '968, and '731 patents are not invalid is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. '844, '968, '731, and '086 Patents : Estoppel Due to Denied IPR Petitions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finjan argues that Blue Coat should be estopped from challenging the validity of the '844, '968, '731, and '086 patents because it filed IPR petitions for these patents and the PTAB denied institution under a lower evidentiary standard. Finjan Mot. 22. Blue Coat responds that Finjan is wrong as a matter of law, and that none of the institution decisions even have persuasive effect because the prior art combinations asserted here are different. Blue Coat Opp. 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court agrees with Blue Coat. Finjan cites no authority for the proposition that denying institution creates estoppel, and the Court is aware of none. Further, because the asserted combinations differ, the PTAB's decisions have little relevance to the validity issues before the Court. Accordingly, Finjan's motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    v. '494 Patent : Invalidity Theories Relying on Nachenberg Reference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Finjan seeks summary judgment that the '494 patent is not invalid over any theory relying on the Nachenberg reference because Blue Coat cannot prove that it is a printed publication that was publicly available before the priority date of the '494 patent. Finjan Mot. 21-22. Blue Coat does not substantively rebut Finjan's arguments, but instead offers to drop the Nachenberg reference from the combination of Griffin, Ji '348, and Nachenberg that it has asserted against the '494 patent. Blue Coat Opp. 20-21. In reply, Finjan objects that Blue Coat's proposal is in direct contravention of the Court's scheduling order, which states that \"references for a single obviousness theory shall not be changed or revised for subsequent election of asserted prior art\" and that \"obviousness combination A, B, C, and D\" \"may not be changed or revised to the combination A, B, and C.\" ECF 41 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court agrees with Finjan that, pursuant to its scheduling order, Blue Coat cannot now revise its invalidity theory of obviousness over Griffin, Ji '348, and Nachenberg to obviousness over Griffin and Ji '348. Further, because Blue Coat provides no rebuttal for Finjan's arguments\n   that Nachenberg is not a printed publication, the Court adopts Finjan's view. As such, any obviousness combination that includes the Nachenberg reference-including Blue Coat's proposed combination of Griffin and Ji '348-is not a valid obviousness combination and Blue Coat may not seek to invalidate the '494 patent on those grounds. Finjan's motion for summary judgment that the '494 patent is not invalid over any theory relying on the Nachenberg reference is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    vi. '086 Patent : Priority Date\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finjan argues that summary judgment that the '086 is not invalid should be granted for any theory relying on Ji '348 because Ji '348 is not prior art to the '086 patent. Finjan Mot. 24-25. On November 28, 2016, the PTO issued a reexamination certificate for the '086 patent, which newly reflected that the '086 patent could claim the benefit of a priority date to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/030,639 (\"the '639 provisional application\"), filed on November 8, 1996. Finjan argues that, in light of the reexamination certificate, Ji '348 is not prior art to the '086 patent, as Ji '348 claims a priority date of September 10, 1997. Finjan also points out that the PTAB found the reexamination certificate persuasive in IPR2016-01444, as it determined that, in light of this reexamination certificate, Blue Coat had not shown a reasonable likelihood of prevailing in establishing that the priority date of the '086 patent was no earlier than November 6, 1997.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .; Ex. 25 to Finjan Mot. at 3, 6-9, ECF 229-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Blue Coat responds that summary judgment is inappropriate, as there are disputed questions of fact as to whether the '639 provisional application discloses claim 24's \"transmitter\" element. Blue Coat Opp. 18. In reply, Finjan argues that this is unpersuasive, as the PTAB found that there was support for the elements of claim 24 in its decision. Finjan Reply 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Both parties' arguments on this issue are unconvincing: Finjan effectively argues that the Court should award an earlier priority date to the '086 patent because the PTAB did so, while Blue Coat baldly asserts lack of written description support without offering any supporting argument or evidence. However, because Finjan, as the moving party, bears the initial burden, its shortcomings govern. Finjan has not met its burden of showing that it is entitled to summary judgment that the '086 is not invalid under invalidity theories relying on Ji '348. Accordingly, Finjan's motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    vii. Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In summary, for one or several reasons discussed above, Finjan's motion for summary judgment of no invalidity is GRANTED with respect to the '731, '580, '844, '968, and '494 (for theories relying on Nachenberg) patents. Finjan's motion for summary judgment of no invalidity is DENIED with respect to the '408, '086, and '494 (for all other theories) patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Blue Coat Mot. 11-13. Blue Coat argues this is the case because SSLV and ProxySG must each independently decrypt and re-encrypt the SSL traffic that pass through them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1543775\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/352/1119/#p1124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As support, Blue Coat points to its documentation on \"Us[ing] the SSL Visibility Appliance with a ProxySG\" states that \"[i]n this architecture SSL traffic is decrypted twice: once on the ProxySG, and then again on the SSL Visibility Appliance.\" Ex. 7 to Blue Coat Mot. at BC2-0024427, ECF 225-7.

As support, Finjan cites to its expert Dr. Cole's report and deposition testimony, where he opines that a non-SSL connection exists between SSLV and ProxySG because SSLV sends an unencrypted connection request message to the ProxySG. Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6 1796, ECF 240-6 (\"the SSLV create a non-SSL connection between them to transfer information including a connection request message using the ProxySG as the second security computer\"); Ex. 10 to Finjan Opp. at 240:12-241:7, ECF 240-16. Finjan also cites to several excerpts from Blue Coat's documentation which describe how, after SSLV has decrypted intercepted traffic, it can pass that decrypted intercepted traffic to other attached security appliances. Ex. 15 to Finjan Opp. at BC-0024354, ECF 241-16 (\"sending non-SSL flows to the attached security appliances\"); Ex. 9 to Finjan Opp. at BC2-0025898, ECF 241-10 (\"Intercepted plaintext is delivered to attached devices as a valid regenerated TCP stream via the SSL Visibility's network ports.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   There is no genuine dispute that SSLV and ProxySG do not share a \"non-SSL connection.\" Instead, all of the evidence cited by the parties agrees that, when SSLV and ProxySG are deployed in combination, they share an SSL connection. The \"Blue Coat Systems V2800 and SV3800 Administration and Deployment Guide\" relied on by Finjan explains how, when SSLV is deployed in a cooperative configuration with a \"proxy device\" (such as a ProxySG) to inspect outgoing traffic, each use certificate re-sign to gain access to the encrypted traffic. Ex. 9 to Finjan Opp. at BC2-0025920, ECF 241-10 (\"The existing proxy re-signs the original server certificate and then the SSL Visibility re-signs the modified server certificate it receives.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 to Finjan Opp. at BC2-0024727, ECF 241-2 (\"The existing proxy re-signs the original server certificate and then the SSL Visibility re-signs the modified server certificate it receives.\"). This means that SSLV and the proxy device perform an SSL handshake: as part of the certificate resigning technique, the proxy, after it receives a certificate from the server, will re-sign the server's certificate and replace the server's public key with its own public key and send that to the SSLV.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1543775\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/352/1119/#p1124\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at BC2-0025918-19. This makes it such that, when SSLV transmits outgoing traffic to the proxy, it will encrypt the traffic with the proxy's public key.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1543775\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/352/1119/#p1124\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is an SSL connection. In addition, Blue Coat's \"Use the SSL Visibility Appliance with a ProxySG\" document explains how, when SSLV is deployed in combination with a ProxySG to inspect incoming traffic, it is given the ProxySG's private key so that it can decrypt incoming traffic. Ex. 7 to Blue Coat Mot. at BC2-0024427, ECF 225-7. SSLV receives this traffic from the ProxySG (which received it from the internet), which decrypts it, inspects it, and re-encrypts it with its public key before passing it off to SSLV.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1543775\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/352/1119/#p1124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This too is an SSL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   connection. The testimony of Blue Coat's employee David Wells also confirms that, when SSLV and ProxySG are deployed in combination, traffic is decrypted and re-encrypted at every step. Ex. 24 to Blue Coat Mot. at 90:12-22, ECF 226-26. This also suggests that SSLV and ProxySG share an SSL connection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   None of the evidence cited by Finjan contradicts this. First, the only evidence of a \"non-SSL connection\" that Dr. Cole cites is the \"connection request message\" that SSLV sends to ProxySG. Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. at \u00b6 1796, ECF 240-6; Ex. 10 to Finjan Opp. at 240:12-241:7, ECF 240-16. However, as Dr. Cole admitted, this is simply an initial message that is sent \"before the session between the client and the server.\" Ex. 21 to Blue Coat Mot. at 75:3-9, ECF 226-24. All SSL connections begin with an unencrypted initial message (e.g., the \"client hello\" in the SSL handshake,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 21 to Blue Coat Mot. at 16:11-19:15, ECF 226-24), so this initial \"connection request message\" gives no indication that SSLV and ProxySG do not share an SSL connection. Second, the excerpts that Finjan cites from Blue Coat's documentation (Ex. 15 to Finjan Opp. at BC-0024354, ECF 241-16 and Ex. 9 to Finjan Opp. at BC2-0025898, ECF 241-10) refer to the unencrypted traffic that SSLV can pass to attached security devices, which are separate from the ProxySG in the SSLV/ProxySG combination that Finjan accuses. Thus, these excerpts are irrelevant. Accordingly, Finjan has failed to raise a genuine dispute that SSLV and ProxySG share a \"non-SSL connection.\" Summary judgment of noninfringement is appropriate for at least this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. SSLV and ProxySG do not communicate a \"connection request message including cached attributes of the signed server certificate\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Another critical aspect of the system recited in claim 1 is that the \"first security computer\" maintains a cache of server certificates, which improves overall performance by saving the second security computer from always having to send the full server certificate to the first security computer. '580 patent, col. 5 ll. 14-16. To enable this, claim 1 requires that when a client sends a request to initiate an SSL connection with a server, the first security computer sends a \"connection request message\n   <em>\n    including cached attributes of the signed server certificate\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1543775\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/352/1119/#p1124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 8 ll. 1-2. This allows the second security computer to make sure that the cached certificate for that server is up-to-date.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1543775\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/352/1119/#p1124\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 5 ll. 17-21, col. 5 ll. 30-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Blue Coat argues that the accused combination of SSLV and ProxySG do not meet the \"connection request message including cached attributes of the signed server certificate\" limitation because SSLV, as a transparent proxy, does not itself send a connection request. Blue Coat Mot. 10. Instead, according to Blue Coat, the client sends a connection request message and it invisibly passes through SSLV.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1543775\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/352/1119/#p1124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In support, Blue Coat points to its SSLV documentation, Ex. 23 to Blue Coat Mot. at BC2-1607593, ECF 225-23, and testimony from David Wells, Ex. 24 to Blue Coat Mot. at 35:18-36:1, ECF 226-26. Blue Coat also argues that it does not infringe this limitation because SSLV does not send any \"cached attributes of the signed certificate\" and Finjan's expert provided no opinion or evidence on this element in his report. Blue Coat Mot. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Finjan responds that SSLV does indeed send a \"connection request message\" to ProxySG because \"otherwise the products could not operate together\" and \"the connection request would never be forwarded to the web server.\" Finjan Opp. 9-10. It does not, however, cite any supporting evidence for these arguments. Finjan also argues that the \"connection request message\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   sent from SSLV includes \"cached attributes of the signed server certificate,\" \"such as the expiration date of the certificate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. As support, Finjan cites to Dr. Cole's report, which states, in addressing the \"connection request\" element, that \"the SSLV create [sic] a non-SSL connection between them to transfer information including a connection request message using the ProxySG as the second security computer.\" Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6 1796, ECF 240-6. Finjan also cites to portions of Dr. Cole's deposition, where he testified on redirect:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   Q Can you explain-I believe you were cut off earlier.

So that fully satisfies that element of claim 1f.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   Q And what is the signed certificate?

Finjan further cites\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to excerpts that relate to the \"connection request\" element in varying degrees, including: portions of Dr. Cole's report that address the \"certificate comparator\" and \"cached attributes\" elements, Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6\u00b6 1843-45, ECF 240-6; excerpts that discuss the SSLV's ability to import certificates, Ex. 2 to Finjan Opp. at BC2-0024427, ECF 241-3, Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6\u00b6 1725-1726, ECF 240-6; testimony discussing the SSLV's ability to send decrypted information to attached security devices, Ex. 14 to Finjan Opp. at 112:1-14, ECF 240-24; and testimony about the handshake request passing through the SSLV, Ex. 12 to Finjan Opp. at 86:2-22, ECF 240-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court finds that a genuine dispute exists as to whether SSLV communicates a \"connection request message\" to ProxySG. Several pieces of evidence describe how SSLV forwards a request sent from the client to initiate an SSL session (i.e., the \"client hello\" in the SSL handshake).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 12 to Finjan Opp. at 86:2-22, ECF 240-20 (testimony from David Wells agreeing that \"the handshake request will go through the SSL Visibility Appliance to the SSL server\"); Ex. 24 to Blue Coat Mot. at 35:18-36:1, ECF 226-26 (testimony from David Wells discussing how the client hello message passes through the SSLV to the server). Blue Coat also does not appear to dispute that SSLV forwards this request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blue Coat Mot. 10. This at least raises a material question of fact as to whether SSLV communicates a \"connection request message\" to the ProxySG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   However, there is no genuine dispute that, even if SSLV communicates a \"connection request message,\" it does not \"includ[e] cached attributes of the signed server certificate.\" Even construing all of the evidence in favor of Finjan, there is\n   simply no evidence of this claim element. Indeed, David Wells explicitly testified to the contrary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   An important point with the Visibility Appliance is that the handshake message from the client to the server that initiates the handshake, the client hello message, is passed through\n   <em>\n    without being modified\n   </em>\n   , and that means that the server will see exactly what it would have seen if the Visibility Appliance wasn't present, and it will choose its responses to that handshake in the same way it would have done if the Visibility Appliance wasn't present either.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Ex. 24 to Blue Coat Mot. at 35:18-36:1, ECF 226-26 (emphasis added). Other evidence submitted by the parties also confirms that, when SSLV forwards a request from the client to initiate an SSL session to the ProxySG (i.e., a \"client hello\"), it does not \"includ[e] cached attributes of the signed server certificate\" in this request.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 9 to Finjan Opp. at BC2-0025916-21, ECF 241-10; Ex. 15 to Finjan Opp., ECF 241-16; Ex. 16 to Finjan Opp., ECF 241-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   None of the evidence cited by Finjan raises a genuine material dispute on this point. Neither of the excerpts from Dr. Cole's report or deposition testimony which address the \"connection request ...\" element (Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6 1796, ECF 240-6 and Ex. 10 to Finjan Opp. at 240:2-241:14, ECF 240-16) point to any evidence of a \"connection request message\" (let alone one that \"includ[es] cached attributes of the signed server certificate\"). Instead, Dr. Cole just makes the bare assertion that this element exists. Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6 1796, ECF 240-6; Ex. 10 to Finjan Opp. at 240:2-241:14, ECF 240-16. This is insufficient as a matter of law. Expert opinions are not evidence; thus, an expert's unsupported assertion that an accused product contains a claim element is not sufficient to raise a material dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rohm and Haas Co. v. Brotech Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1000592\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/127/1089/#p1092\">\n    127 F.3d 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1092 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (affirming district court's determination that patentee failed to prove infringement where the patentee \"offered nothing more than its expert's general opinion that the accused product or process infringed the patents\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The remaining excerpts cited by Finjan also do not raise any material question of fact that SSLV sends \"cached attributes of the signed server certificate.\" Dr. Cole's report at \u00b6\u00b6 1843-45 relates to caching and comparing certificate attributes at the ProxySG (the alleged \"second security computer\") and does not address the contents of any \"connection request message\" that is sent from SSLV to ProxySG. The excerpt at Ex. 2 to Finjan Opp. at BC2-0024427, ECF 241-3 and Dr. Cole's report at Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6\u00b6 1725-1726, ECF 240-6 discuss SSLV's ability to import certificates, which is an initial configuration setting which allows SSLV to decrypt traffic coming\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   the ProxySG and does not relate to any \"connection request message\" that is sent from SSLV to ProxySG. The testimony at Ex. 14 to Finjan Opp. at 112:1-14, ECF 240-24 discusses how SSLV sends decrypted information to attached security devices. This is unrelated to communications between SSLV and ProxySG. Finally, the testimony from David Wells at Ex. 12 to Finjan Opp. at 86:2-22, ECF 240-20 actually agrees that \"the handshake request [from the client] will just go directly through the SSL Visibility Appliance to the SSL server,\" which, if anything, supports an inference that, when SSLV forwards a request sent from the client to initiate an SSL session, the request is unmodified and does not include \"cached attributes of the signed server certificate.\" Thus, none of the evidence cited by Finjan raises a material dispute that the SSLV does not communicate a \"connection request\n   message including cached attributes of the signed server certificate.\" Summary judgment of noninfringement is appropriate for at least this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   For at least the two independent reasons discussed above, the Court finds that Blue Coat is entitled to summary judgment.

Finjan Opp. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   At the time of the hearing, the parties agreed that there was no fundamental dispute as to the meaning of \"programming language\" and that it may be given its plain and ordinary meaning. ECF 270. However, the parties appear to have different conceptions of what this plain and ordinary meaning may encompass: Blue Coat contends that file types such as text, EXE, PDF, ZIP, XML, GZIP, or RAR are not \"programming languages,\" whereas Finjan contends they are.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Blue Coat Mot. 15-16,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Finjan Opp. 14. The parties' experts, purported persons of ordinary skill in the art, also appear to disagree as to whether a file type can be a \"programming language.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Ex. 30 to Blue Coat Mot. at 111:23-113:22, ECF 226-38 (testimony from Dr. Nielson, Blue Coat's expert, that \"identification of file type does not identify programming languages\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Ex. 28 to Blue Coat Mot. at 195:3-196:23, ECF 226-34 (testimony from Dr. Mitzenmacher, Finjan's expert, that [Redacted] it will determine which programming language the program code appears to be\"). Thus, before turning to questions of infringement, the Court must first clarify the scope of \"programming language.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   While the Court agrees with Blue Coat that, in the most typical case, \"programming language\" refers to languages such as C, C++, Python, Java, or Perl, it agrees with Finjan that, within the context of the '408 patent, \"programming language\" carries a broader meaning. Claim 22 requires that, after a \"programming language\" is \"determin[ed],\" a \"scanner\" is \"instantiat[ed]\" for that \"programming language,\" which includes \"parser rules\" which \"define certain patterns in terms of tokens, tokens being lexical constructs for the specific programming language\" and \"analyzer rules\" which \"identify certain combinations of tokens and patterns.\" '408 patent, col. 21 ll. 48-57. Thus, a \"programming language\" must at least be something that has \"lexical constructs\" which can be recognized as \"tokens\" and put together in detectable \"patterns.\" The specification gives several examples of such \"programming languages:\" JavaScript, HTML, Visual Basic script, and\n   \"URI content.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 4 ll. 3-5, col. 6 ll. 20-23, col. 15 ll. 39-43. However, the specification also discloses that \"the present invention is ... applicable to parse and analyze binary content and EXE files.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 19 ll. 10-12. Thus, it must also be the case that \"determining any specific one of a plurality of programming languages\" includes detecting that a file is a binary file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vitronics Corp. v.

Carrying this forward, it at least seems possible that other file types, such as PDF, ZIP, XML, GZIP, or RAR, could also be said to be written in a sort of \"programming language,\" so long as they have definable \"tokens\" which could be put together in detectable \"patterns.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In light of this, the Court finds that there are material questions of fact as to whether DRTR \"determin[es] any specific one of a plurality of programming languages.\" Although it seems odd (and likely incorrect) to say that every file type is its own \"programming language\" even within the meaning of the '408 patent, the Court cannot conclude, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Finjan, [Redacted] As discussed above, this will turn on whether they have \"tokens\" which could be put together in detectable \"patterns,\" both of which are factual determinations that must be left for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Further, the parties do not dispute that DRTR includes code specific to at least some of the explicit examples of \"programming languages\" given in the '408 specification: HTML and JavaScript. '408 patent, col. 1 l. 66-col. 2 l. 2, col 4 ll. 2-5, col. 6 ll. 17-23, col. 9 ll. 7-15, col. 16 ll. 10-13. Although the Court agrees with Blue Coat that [Redacted] there may be no prior determination of a programming language, it cannot rule out, on summary judgment, that DRTR's logic of processing content does not somehow include a \"determin[ation]\" of a \"programming language.\" For example, the source code and other evidence submitted by the parties shows that, [Redacted] DRTR can determine that it is a text file that potentially contains HTML (or, said another way, is potentially an HTML file).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 34 to Finjan Mot. at ll. 272-366, ECF 227-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051592\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/1576/#p1583\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at l. 331 [Redacted] which treats the contents as if it were HTML and processes them accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 34 to Finjan Opp. [Redacted] ECF 240-42; Ex. 31 to Blue Coat Mot. [Redacted] ECF 226-40. Although it may be the case that DRTR's identification of HTML is more of a guess and not a perfect determination, the Court cannot conclude, construing the evidence the light most favorable to Finjan, that this is not a \"determin[ation].\" Thus, the Court cannot grant summary judgment of noninfringement on the basis of this limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Disputed questions of fact remain as to whether DRTR \"instantiat[es] a scanner for the specific programming language\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Claim 22 also requires \"instantiating a scanner for the specific programming language.\" The parties dispute whether DRTR satisfies this limitation for the same reasons they advance with respect to the \"determining ...\" limitation: in Blue Coat's view, DRTR does not practice this limitation because it only \"instantiat[es]\" scanners for file types, which are not programming languages. Blue Coat Mot. 17. Finjan, on the other hand, argues that file types are programming languages, so the fact that DRTR selects scanners based on file type at least creates a triable issue of fact. Finjan Opp. 16-17. Finjan also argues that DRTR satisfies this limitation [Redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Because disputed questions remain as to whether DRTR \"determin[es] any specific\n   one of a plurality of programming languages,\" disputed questions remain as to whether it \"instantiat[es] a scanner for the specific programming language.\" Thus, the Court cannot grant summary judgment of noninfringement on the basis of this limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Disputed questions of fact remain as to whether DRTR receives and analyzes an \"incoming stream\" of program code\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Claim 22 also requires that its receiving and analysis steps be performed on an \"incoming stream\" of program code. Blue Coat argues that, because DRTR begins processing a file only after the full or partial download has been completed, it does not operate on an \"incoming stream\" of program code. Blue Coat Mot. 17-18. According to Blue Coat, when DRTR receives a new URL to rate and categorize, [Redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 11 to Blue Coat Mot. at 120:5-21, 116:1-25, ECF 226-12; Ex. 27 to Blue Coat Mot. at ll. 570-583, ECF 226-32. [Redacted] DRTR begins its analysis. Blue Coat Mot. 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 11 to Blue Coat Mot. at 120:5-21, ECF 226-12; Ex. 27 to Blue Coat Mot. at ll. 570-583, ECF 226-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   [Redacted]\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finjan Opp. 17-19. Finjan nevertheless argues that DRTR analyzes an \"incoming stream\" for two reasons: (1) it dynamically rates the URL before its content is downloaded to a client computer,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17; and (2) [Redacted] as incoming content is being received.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18; Ex. 4 to Finjan Opp. (Mitzenmacher Rpt.) \u00b6\u00b6 856, 1025, 1028, 1038, ECF 240-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   At the time of the hearing, the parties agreed that there was no fundamental dispute as to the meaning of \"incoming stream\" and that it may be given its plain and ordinary meaning. ECF 270. However, the parties appear to have different views of what this plain and ordinary meaning may encompass: Blue Coat appears to interpret \"incoming stream\" as a byte stream that must come from an external source (i.e., a byte stream that is actively being downloaded), whereas Finjan appears to view \"incoming stream\" as a byte stream that can also come from a local source, such as a buffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The Court agrees with Finjan that an \"incoming stream\" need not be from an external source. The '408 patent does not place any restriction on where an \"incoming stream\" is read from and in fact itself discloses an example of an \"incoming stream\" that is read from a local buffer.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '408 patent, col. 14 ll. 23-25 (\"At step 500, the parser calls a tokenizer, such as tokenizer 210, to retrieve a next token from an incoming byte stream.\"). Thus, \"incoming stream\" must at least be as broad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vitronics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051592\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/1576/#p1583\">\n    90 F.3d at 1583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a claim interpretation that excludes a preferred embodiment \"is rarely, if ever, correct\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Blue Coat's noninfringement arguments are only based on its assumption that \"incoming stream\" must be coming from an external source. Because the Court disagrees with this view, Blue Coat is not entitled to summary judgment of noninfringement on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Disputed questions of material fact remain with respect to all of the limitations for which Blue Coat argues it is entitled to summary judgment. Accordingly, Blue Coat's motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of claim 22 of the '408 patent is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The '786 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Finjan accuses the following combinations of infringing claim 1 of the '786 patent : (1) ProxySG, CAS, and MAA, (2) ASG with MAA, (3) WSS with MAS, and (4) WebPulse/GIN. Claim 1 recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   1. A processor-based method, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   receiving at a host server downloadable-information including a combination of non-executable and executable code;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   analyzing by a detection engine the downloadable-information to detect the executable code; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   causing by a packaging engine\n   <em>\n    mobile protection code to be communicated to at least one information-destination\n   </em>\n   of the downloadable-information, when the executable code is detected in the downloadable-information,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   wherein the causing mobile protection code to be communicated comprises forming the packaging engine a\n   <em>\n    sandboxed package including the mobile protection code\n   </em>\n   and the downloadable-information, and causing the sandboxed package to\n   <em>\n    be communicated to the at least one information-destination\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   '786 patent, col. 21 ll. 33-48 (emphasis added). \"Mobile protection code\" is \"code that, at runtime, monitors or intercepts actually or potentially malicious code operations.\" ECF 180 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also Blue Coat I\n   </em>\n   , ECF 118 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Blue Coat argues that it neither infringes this claim literally nor under the doctrine of equivalents. The Court addresses each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Literal Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Blue Coat argues that it does not literally infringe claim 1 because all of the accused combinations have fundamentally different architectures from what is required by claim 1. According to Blue Coat, claim 1 requires that a \"sandboxed package including the mobile protection code\" be delivered to the \"information destination\" so that the \"downloadable-information\" can be executed in a sandboxed environment at the \"information destination.\" Blue Coat Mot. 18-21. Blue Coat argues that \"information destination\" refers to the client user device, the machine which requested the \"downloadable-information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22. By contrast, Blue Coat argues, there is no sandboxed package that is delivered to the client device in the accused combinations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-22. Instead, all of the sandboxing happens at the MAA before the downloaded information reaches the client device.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Finjan does not dispute that, in the accused combinations, sandboxing happens on the MAA, rather than the client user device. However, Finjan maintains that the accused combinations infringe claim 1 because the MAA receives potentially suspicious content to sandbox from the ASG or CAS by way of a remote API, which includes parameters which influence how the MAA sandboxes the content. According to Finjan, these \"API directions\" are \"mobile protection code\" because they cause the MAA to monitor or intercept potentially suspicious operations of the downloaded content.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finjan also argues that, in the accused combinations, the MAA (or MAS) is the \"information-destination,\" and that the meaning of \"information-destination\" is broad enough to include any information destination, such as a firewall, server, the MAA, or a client user device.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22. As support for its infringement position, Finjan relies on Blue Coat documentation, which explains how the MAA's remote API can be used to submit sample files to the MAA or create a task to be queued and performed by the MAA. Ex. 24 to Finjan Opp. at BC2-0003335, 37, ECF 241-25. Finjan also relies on the report of its expert, Dr. Cole, who opined that the ASG and CAS \"communicate\" a \"sandboxed package including the mobile protection code\" because they send digital content to be sandboxed to an MAA via an API call, then \"submit mobile protection code to the MAA via another API call which is run by the MAA to monitor the behavior of the sample,\" and that the API \"allows for the\n   MAA to receive updated system software and base images that are used in the MAA for the processing\" as well as \"patterns used as part of the sandboxed package.\" Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6 2173, ECF 240-6;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2172-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that the parties do not appear to fundamentally disagree as to how the relevant portions of the accused combinations work: Finjan agrees with Blue Coat that the MAA (not the user client device) performs sandboxing, and Blue Coat agrees with Finjan that the MAA can receive files to sandbox from an ASG or CAS by way of a remote API, the parameters of which can affect how the MAA sandboxes the file. Finjan Opp. 19-21; Ex. 24 to Finjan Opp. at BC2-0003335, 37, ECF 241-25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Blue Coat Mot. 20-21. Instead, the parties' dispute turns on two discrete issues: (1) whether the MAA is an \"information-destination;\" and (2) whether an API call is \"mobile protection code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   The Court finds that at least this second issue entitles Blue Coat to summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As previously noted, the Court construed \"mobile protection code\" to mean \"code that, at runtime, monitors or intercepts actually or potentially malicious code operations.\" ECF 180 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also Blue Coat I\n   </em>\n   , ECF 118 at 5. At the time of the hearing, the parties agreed that there was no fundamental dispute as to the meaning of \"code\" and that it may be given its plain and ordinary meaning. ECF 270. However, the parties appear to have different views of what this plain and ordinary meaning may encompass: Blue Coat contends that \"code\" must be limited to executable code, whereas Finjan views it as broad enough to include API calls.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Blue Coat Mot. 21, Blue Coat Reply 11-12,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Finjan Opp. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The Court agrees with Blue Coat that \"code\" in \"mobile protection code\" is executable code. The specification consistently describes \"mobile protection code\" as something that is executed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 18 ll. 7-46, col. 20 ll. 44-65. This makes sense given that one cited advantage of the '786 patent is that it \"does not require pre-installation of security code within a Downloadable destination;\" instead, the mobile protection code can provide its own package of security code that can be run at the destination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 4 ll. 61-62. This also comports with the testimony of Finjan's experts, Drs. Cole and Medvidovic, who described \"code\" as something that executes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 22 to Blue Coat Mot. at 70:20-75:16, ECF 225-22 (Dr. Medvidovic describing how \"typically, you'll provide the code that implements that method inside of a block that's delimited by open curly brace\"); Ex. 21 to Blue Coat Mot. at 186:24-187:2, ECF 226-24 (Dr. Cole referring to \"code to run\"). Moreover, as Blue Coat points out, the Court implicitly addressed this question in its claim construction order in\n   <em>\n    Blue Coat I\n   </em>\n   , where it rejected the notion that mobile protection code includes anything other than the code that itself operates to monitor and intercept suspicious operations.\n   <em>\n    See Blue Coat I\n   </em>\n   , ECF 118 at 7-8 (explicitly excluding \"protection policies ... 'for causing one or\n   more predetermined operations to be performed' \" from construction of mobile protection code). Thus, for these reasons, the \"code\" in \"mobile protection code\" must be executable code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   In light of this clarification, there is no material factual dispute that the API calls that CAS and ASG use to submit sample files to the MAA are not \"mobile protection code.\" As the parties agree, these API calls just provide the interface that CAS or ASG can use to launch the execution of sandboxing routines that already reside on the MAA; the API calls are not themselves the executable code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finjan Opp. 20 (\"parameters that cause the MAA to monitor or intercept operations\"); Ex. 21 to Blue Coat Mot. at 182:23-25, ECF 226-24 (\"It [MAA] absolutely has code that would monitor or intercept potentially malicious code operations.\"). Thus, the accused combinations do not satisfy this element. For at least this reason, Blue Coat is entitled to summary judgment. Blue Coat's motion for summary judgment of no literal infringement of claim 1 of the '786 patent is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Doctrine of Equivalents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Blue Coat also moves for summary judgment that it does not infringe claim 1 under the doctrine of equivalents. To prove doctrine of equivalents at trial, Finjan must \"show[ ] on a limitation-by-limitation basis that the accused product performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way with substantially the same result as each claim limitation of the patent[ ] ....\"\n   <em>\n    Wavetronix LLC v. EIS Electronic Integrated Systems\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048900\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/1343/#p1360\">\n    573 F.3d 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Blue Coat argues that it does not infringe claim 1 under the doctrine of equivalents because the accused products do not provide the same function, the same way, and with the same result as the limitations of claim 1. Blue Coat Mot. 22-23. Specifically, Blue Coat argues that the accused combinations do not provide the same function because the function of claim 1 is to prevent malicious attacks by files already received at the destination computer, whereas the function of the accused combinations is to gather information about a potentially suspicious file and determine whether it is dangerous before sending it to the destination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048900\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/1343/#p1360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Blue Coat argues that the accused combinations do not provide this function in the same way because claim 1 packages a potentially suspicious file with mobile protection code and sends it to its destination, whereas the accused combinations analyze the file at the MAA and then, if it is not dangerous, sends it unpackaged to its destination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Blue Coat argues that the accused combinations do not achieve the same results because claim 1 results in running a downloadable in a safe environment at the destination, whereas the accused combinations result in preventing delivery of the downloadable if it is deemed dangerous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Finjan argues that there are at least disputed issues of fact as to whether Blue Coat infringes under doctrine of equivalents, citing its expert Dr. Cole's report as providing \"ample evidence\" to support this. Finjan Opp. 22 (citing Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6\u00b6 2159-66, 2235-41, ECF 240-6). Finjan cites to no other \"evidence\" outside its expert's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The Court finds that there is no material dispute that Blue Coat does not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents. Dr. Cole's opinion is based entirely on his assumption that the API calls that ASG or CAS make to the MAA are \"mobile protection code.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 to Finjan Opp. (Cole Rpt.) \u00b6\u00b6 2159-66, 2235-41, ECF 240-6. As discussed above, this is incorrect based on undisputed facts. Finjan cites to no other \"evidence\" that Blue Coat infringes under the doctrine of equivalents; thus, it fails to\n   raise a material dispute as to this issue. Accordingly, Blue Coat is entitled to summary judgment. Blue Coat's motion for summary judgment of no infringement of claim 1 of the '786 patent under the doctrine of equivalents is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    D. WebPulse/GIN Sandboxing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   BlueCoat moves for summary judgment that \"WebPulse/GIN sandboxing\" does not infringe the '844, '494, '786, '621, and '086 patents. Blue Coat Mot. 23-25. According to Blue Coat, one necessary component of Finjan's allegations with respect these patents is that \"WebPulse/GIN\" sends content to MAA(s) to sandbox.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. [Redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Blue Coat argues that infringement is impossible in both of these cases because these MAA(s) do not send their results to GIN.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (citing Ex. 13 to Blue Coat Mot. at 282:18-21, ECF 226-14).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.
