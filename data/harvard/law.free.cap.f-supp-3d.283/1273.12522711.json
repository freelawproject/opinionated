For the reasons that follow, the Motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hay alleges that over the course of roughly three years, he was an employee of ALH as an insurance agent at three of its collectively operated facilities. (Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 3-19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hay first contracted with AmeriLife and Health Services of Lake County, LLC (\"Lake\") in December 2012. (Doc. 37 at 3; Hay Depo., Doc. 39-1 at 19:24-20:10.) Subsequently, Hay left Lake and contracted with AmeriLife and Health Services of Central Florida, LLC (\"Central\") in October 2013. (Doc. 37 at 3; Hay Depo. at 28:7-9, 28:24-25, 29:12-18.) Hay then left Central and contracted with AmeriLife and Health Services of Polk County, LLC (\"Polk\") in December 2014, where he remained until his contract was terminated in September 2015. (Doc. 25 \u00b6 40; Doc. 37 at 3; Hay Depo. at 33:16-24.) As part of his contract with Polk, Hay executed an Independent Agent Agreement (\"Agreement\"), Non-Compete Agreement (\"Non-Compete\"), and Declaration. (Doc. 39-1 at 169-82, 199-200.) Hay also executed almost identical agreements with Lake and Central. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 151-68, 195-98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the heading \"Relationship of the Parties,\" the Agreement provides that Hay would \"be an independent contractor and that nothing contained herein shall be construed as creating the relationship of employer and employee ... for any purpose.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 151.) The Agreement additionally states that \"[Hay] [would] not be treated as an employee for any reason, including for purposes of the Federal Insurance\n   Contributions Act (FICA), the Social Security Act, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, Federal Income Tax Withholding[,] or State Income tax Withholding, if applicable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Hay was to \"be responsible for and pay any and all expenses incurred in conducting business under the terms of [the] Agreement\" and was \"not eligible to participate in any fringe benefit programs sponsored by [Polk].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Agreement moreover sets forth that Hay \"[would] be acting on [his] own behalf and not as an employee ... of [Polk],\" and that Hay was prohibited from \"hold[ing] [himself] out in any capacity other than as an independent agent of the Insurance Company to which [he was] appointed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 13, 2015, Hay was admitted to the Winter Park Memorial Hospital due to two blood clots in his leg. (Doc. 25 \u00b6 25; Doc. 37 at 5.) Hay was discharged from the hospital on the next day, at which time he was referred to Baldwin Park, Florida Veterans' Administration (\"VA\") for coordinated care with his primary care physician (\"PCP\"). (Doc. 25 \u00b6 28; Doc. 37 at 5.) Hay's PCP recommended him three weeks bed rest, and Hay informed his ALH manager, Chance Robinson (\"Robinson\"), of his PCP's recommendation that same day. (Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; Doc. 37 at 5-6.) In response, Robinson told Hay, \" 'oh, wow, well take care of yourself and keep us up to date.' \" (Doc. 25 \u00b6 33; Doc. 37 at 6.) Hay asserts that he additionally: (1) faxed his PCP's recommendation letter to ALH; (2) faxed his PCP's recommendation letter to ALH's supervisor, Lee Jay Hart, in Winter Haven, Florida; and (3) called ALH's headquarters in Clearwater, Florida to inform them of the situation and of his need for leave pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"). (Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.) Further, Hay asserts that he kept in touch with Robinson over the following weeks and informed Robinson of his plan to return to work on October 4, 2015. (Doc. 25 \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 23, 2015, ALH alleges that Polk received email correspondence from an insurance company with which Hay had been appointed to through Polk, the Independent Order of Foresters (\"Foresters\"). (Doc. 37 at 6.) Foresters purportedly advised Polk that Hay had applied to and was being appointed by a competing insurance agency, American Senior Benefits (\"ASB\"), and informed Polk that Hay's appointment with Foresters through Polk was terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) ALH asserts that Polk additionally received a copy of correspondence from Foresters to Hay, welcoming Hay and assigning him a producer number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Hay's contract with Polk was subsequently terminated on September 29, 2015. (Doc. 25 \u00b6 40; Doc. 37 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 28, 2016, Hay filed his Amended Complaint (Doc. 25) against ALH alleging violations of the FMLA. Specifically, Hay asserts that ALH interfered with his FMLA rights and retaliated against him for exercising his FMLA rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-52.) ALH now moves for summary judgment against Hay. (Doc. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. 37 at 11;\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hay Depo. at 112:15-19.) Additionally, Hay does not refute ALH's contention that Hay had the right to employ assistants to help with administrative functions of the sales process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37 at 11.) Nonetheless, Hay attests that ALH had the right to change Hay's commission schedule and to modify the agreements. (Doc. 54 at 5-6.) Hay also asserts that Hay was required to attend a mandatory new hire training session, to use certain forms and checklists, and to schedule routine meetings with managers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) The parties dispute whether Hay set his own hours, schedule, and driving route, whether Hay could choose which products to sell, and whether Hay could exercise independent judgment regarding his sales techniques. (Doc. 37 at 11; Doc. 54 at 5-7, 9; Doc. 54-1 at 4, 5.) The parties also disagree as to whether Hay was required to attend mandatory morning meetings and whether he was adversely affected by missing same. (Doc. 37 at 11; Doc. 54 at 7; Doc. 54-1 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While ALH undeniably exerted some control over Hay, the Court does not find that ALH exercised substantial control over a meaningful part of Hay's business. In addition to Hay's ability to generate leads and employ assistants, the Court finds it notable that Hay was permitted to obtain certain other work while contracted with ALH, and in fact, did work full time for Connextions as a benefit counselor while working for ALH. (Doc. 37 at 13; Hay Depo. at 54:9-16, 56:4-7, 61:1-10.) While not dispositive, the record also evidences that both Hay and ALH understood Hay to be an independent contractor. For instance, the language of the Agreement clearly labels Hay as an independent contractor, Hay treated himself as an independent contractor for tax purposes, and Hay referenced himself as an independent contractor during his deposition. (Hay Depo. at 26:3-7, 38:2-8; Doc. 54 at 11-12.) The factor of control collectively weighs in favor of ALH's position that Hay was an independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    B. Relative Investments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The terms of the agreement provide that Hay would be responsible \"for any and all expenses incurred in conducting business\" with ALH. (Doc. 39-1 at 169.) Hay does not refute ALH's assertion that Hay paid for his own desk, chair, copier, fax machine, secretarial services, phone expenses, technology fees, transportation expenses, and lead acquisition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37 at 13-14.) Hay in fact admits that he leased the use of a desk, iPad, and leads for $175.00 per month. (Doc. 54-1 \u00b6 14; Doc. 54 at 8.) Even so, Hay argues that \"[his] expenditures were minor compared to those of [ALH] for advertising, facilities, maintenance, recruitment, training, etc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, \"the Eleventh Circuit has not adopted a comparative approach to this factor,\" and therefore Hay's argument is not persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Heningburg v.

Opportunity for Profit and Loss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is undisputed that Hay received compensation on a commission-only basis. (Doc. 37 at 12; Doc. 54 at 9.) The parties additionally agree that Hay was not precluded from obtaining outside work while contracted with ALH, and Hay in fact worked full time for Connextions as a benefit counselor while working for ALH. (Doc. 37 at 13; Doc. 39-1 at 54:9-16, 56:4-7, 61:1-10.) Hay attests that he did not have the ability to negotiate the rates at which he was paid, and the parties dispute whether Hay could choose which products he would sell or set his own hours, schedule, and driving route. (Doc. 37 at 11; Doc. 54 at 5, 7, 9; Doc. 54-1 at 5.) On the whole, the Court finds that the opportunity for profit and loss is a neutral factor in determining whether Hay was an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    D. Skill and Initiative Required\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is undisputed that to become an insurance agent, Hay had to pass a state exam, obtain proper licensure, and take continuing education courses. (Doc. 37 at 14; Doc. 54 at 10.)

In\n   <em>\n    Scantland\n   </em>\n   , the court found that technician plaintiffs were \"dependent upon [defendant] to equip them with the skills necessary to do their jobs\" where plaintiffs were not required to have any previous experience, and evidence was presented that defendant provided plaintiffs approximately three weeks of on and off the job training.\n   <em>\n    Scantland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755954\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/1308/#p1311\">\n    721 F.3d at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast to the factual scenario in\n   <em>\n    Scantland\n   </em>\n   , Hay admits that he \"was a licensed agent when he first associated with Lake and throughout his relationship with Central and Polk, having obtained his licensure without assistance or training from ALH.\" (Doc. 37 at 14.) ALH also attests that Hay advised clients without a supervisory presence. (Doc. 37 at 14.) The highly specialized nature of Hay's position is indicative of an independent contractor relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    E. Permanency of Relationship\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Incontrovertibly, the Agreement was for an indefinite duration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 54 at 11; Doc. 39-1 at 212.) Also, Hay contracted with Lake, Central, and Polk between December 2012 and September 2015, \"never staying contracted with any one more than 14 months.\" (Doc. 37 at 14-15.) Further, while contracted with ALH, Hay worked full time for Connextions as a benefit counselor. (Doc. 37 at 13; Doc. 39-1 at 54:9-16, 56:4-7, 61:1-10.) These undisputed facts suggest that Hay lacked the permanence of relationship that is indicative of an employment arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    F. Degree to which Hay's Tasks were Integral\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Both parties agree that Hay's tasks as an insurance agent were integral to ALH's business. (Doc. 37 at 15; Doc. 54 at 11.) Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of an employer-employee relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    G. Weighing the factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the facts before it, the Court finds that four factors-control, investment, skill/initiative, and permanency/duration-favor ALH's position that Hay was an independent contractor. The degree to which Hay's tasks were integral to ALH's business, however, favors Hay's position\n   that he was an employee. Finally, the profit/loss factor is neutral. It is clear that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact precluding summary judgment. Thus, considering all inferences drawn from the underlying facts in a light most favorable to Hay and resolving all reasonable doubts against ALH, the Court concludes that summary judgment will be entered in ALH's favor on Hay's FMLA claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
