(\"Transco\") to forcibly take and use land owned by the plaintiffs as part of an interstate fossil fuel pipeline, known as the Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline (the \"Pipeline\"). Plaintiffs also allege that Transco violated the RFRA by forcibly taking plaintiffs' land by condemnation. Before the Court are plaintiffs' amended motion for a preliminary injunction and the defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The individually named plaintiffs are all Sisters of the Adorers.\" [ECF 10, \u00b6 1.] Plaintiffs claim the construction and operation of the Pipeline through land they own in Columbia, Pennsylvania would violate their free exercise of religion protected by RFRA. They seek a preliminary injunction enjoining Transco from constructing and operating the Pipeline on their property until this Court has considered their RFRA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 31, 2015, Transco filed an application with FERC under section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (\"NGA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(c), for authorization to construct and operate the Pipeline. On February 3, 2017, FERC issued a \"Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity\" (\"FERC Order\") authorizing Transco's proposed route for the Pipeline that would require use of the Adorers' property. The FERC Order granted Transco the right to take private property along the route of the Pipeline by eminent domain if landowners such as the Adorers would not agree to voluntarily convey their land. Many interested parties, including affected landowners, requested a rehearing of the FERC Order. Significantly, the Adorers did not present their RFRA claims (or raise any other objections) to FERC either initially or by requesting a rehearing. To date, FERC has not addressed the merits of the requests for rehearing of the FERC Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Adorers refused to voluntarily convey their land. As a result, on April 14, 2017, Transco filed a \"Verified Complaint in Condemnation of Property Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 71.1\" in this Court to condemn a portion of the Adorers' property to allow Transco to construct, install and operate the Pipeline on the Adorers' property. The Adorers neither responded to the Verified Complaint nor to Transco's motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of Transco's right to condemn. After an evidentiary hearing on July 7, 2017, this Court granted Transco's motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 23, 2017, this Court granted possession of the Adorers' property to Transco.\n   <em>\n    Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC. v.

[ECF 22, at 19.] Having failed to do so, plaintiffs are barred by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717r(a) and 717r(b) from pursuing what amounts to collateral review of the FERC Order before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that such a result conflicts with the \"sweeping super-statute\" nature of RFRA and further argue that the fact Congress made RFRA applicable \"to all Federal law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after November 16, 1993,\" ... \"unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this chapter,\" means that RFRA supersedes the exclusive jurisdiction provisions of the NGA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-3(a), (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the result conflicts with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(c) which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (c) Judicial relief\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.

According to plaintiffs, if they are now foreclosed from proceeding with their RFRA claims before this Court, they will have been deprived of their opportunity to assert their RFRA claims in a \"judicial proceeding,\" as guaranteed by \u00a7 2000bb-1(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In a case directly on point and not referenced by plaintiffs in their opposition papers, Judge Bartle of this Court rejected these very same arguments.\n   <em>\n    Radio Luz v.

Specifically, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The government argues that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims raised in plaintiffs' complaints. It contends that pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20402\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is the United States Court of Appeals, not the district court, that has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of FCC regulations. In essence, it is the government's position that the radio broadcasters are seeking to litigate their claims in the wrong forum. Instead of proceeding in the district court, the government maintains that plaintiffs should first seek to have their constitutional and statutory challenges decided by the FCC and then seek judicial review of any adverse order of the FCC by appealing directly to the court of appeals. [citation omitted].... Plaintiffs assert that this court has jurisdiction because of the federal questions involved and pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb. That section sets forth Congress's findings in support of RFRA and its purposes for enacting the statute. Nowhere does the statute specifically confer jurisdiction on federal district courts to hear all RFRA claims. Rather, it states, 'A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.' 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(c).

In\n   <em>\n    General Finance\n   </em>\n   , the targets of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission filed suit in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction to prevent the agency from investigating their activities. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit faced the question of whether the district court had jurisdiction over the suit pursuant to \u00a7 1331 despite the fact that Congress had prescribed that investigatory targets may obtain judicial review of the agency's investigations only when the agency brings a subpoena enforcement action against the target.
