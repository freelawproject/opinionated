KARAS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Betty, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\") brings this Action against Defendant PepsiCo, Inc. (\"Defendant\"), alleging that Defendant's 2016 Super Bowl commercial infringed on its copyrighted advertisement pitch. Plaintiff additionally asserts breach of contract, unjust enrichment, conversion, and unfair competition claims arising in large part from Defendant's unauthorized use of the copyrighted material. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Dkt. No. 1).) Before the Court is Defendant's Motion To Dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (the \"Motion\"). For the reasons to follow, Defendant's Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's Complaint and certain documents that are integral to the Complaint, and are taken as true for the purpose of resolving the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is an advertising agency that creates and develops \"innovative and high quality creative and advertising concepts and storylines.\" (Compl. \u00b6 5.) Defendant is a global food and beverage company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Since June 2012, Defendant has been the title sponsor of the National Football League Super Bowl halftime show. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Some 115 million people watched the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant, hoping to have a memorable halftime commercial, began soliciting ideas for its 2016 halftime commercial in September 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) After reviewing an initial round of submissions, Defendant decided to solicit new ideas from advertising agencies that did not participate in the initial group. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) On October 29, 2015, Plaintiff was invited to participate in a telephone briefing, which was held on October 30, 2015, during which Defendant explained a general outline of what it envisioned for the Super Bowl commercial. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff was given until November 6, 2015, to prepare a presentation outlining ideas for the commercial. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Parties allegedly agreed, \"based on past practices between them and industry custom,\" that a \"Statement of Work would be negotiated, prepared and executed if [Defendant] liked a presented advertising storyline and wanted to move forward into production with it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Until a Statement of Work is executed, \"[Plaintiff] retains all rights, title and interest to each concept and advertising storyline it develops.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 6, 2015, Betty attended a meeting at Defendant's offices, during which Plaintiff presented eight concepts for the Super Bowl commercial to Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) Among the concepts presented were concepts that Plaintiff titled \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox,\" \"Parallel Universe,\" and \"Flop Joy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).) At the end of the meeting, Plaintiff provided Defendant four USB drives containing the concepts for the commercial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Defendant allegedly \"reacted favorably\" to Plaintiff's presentation, and requested, later that night, that certain refinements be made to certain of the concepts by 9:00 a.m. on November 9, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 9, 2015, Plaintiff presented the refined concepts to Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) The \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox\" storyline allegedly contained the following elements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a. The spot was descriptively named \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox\" with a proposed specific play on the Joy of Pepsi. \"All Kinds\" described the variety of music, dance, fashion, and overall room vibe depicted in the storyline. \"Living Jukebox\" described the human representation of what a jukebox could be, with seamless music changes and genre variety and with the ability to transport the viewer to imagine a scene consistent with a created joyous feeling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   b. The spot starts with someone walking inside a room;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   c. The viewer travels through various rooms with a hero character, which was presented as potentially being a single powerful performer for all music renditions, and the same principle dancers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   d. The hero character moves seamlessly from room to room throughout the set design;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   e. Every time the hero character enters a new room, the genre of music and dance style immediately switches to reflect a new vibe in that room;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   f. The set design stylistically changes as does the fashion/wardrobe of the cast, as the viewer moves to the next room;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   g. Seamless wardrobe changes were proposed for the hero character; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   h. Clean seamless cuts/camera shots are used as the rooms and genres change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) During the presentation, Plaintiff's Chief Creative Officer emphasized that dancers would be performing in the background of each room and there would be different dance styles shown. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) \"As the shot moved from room to room, the dance moves would change to reflect the changes in music genre.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's Chief Creative Officer also allegedly emphasized that the commercial would be created to appear as one consecutive shot as the hero performer moved from one room to the next. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff provided Defendant with sample images to illustrate how each room could change throughout the commercial. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff sought and obtained a copyright in the materials presented to Defendant during the presentation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Michael S. Elkin, Esq., in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. To Dismiss Ex. B (\"Copyright\") (Dkt. No. 23).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant here, the copyrighted material includes two slides describing the \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox\" concept. The first slide states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Concept: All Kinds/Living Jukebox\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   There is no one correct way to experience joy. It's different for everyone and that should be celebrated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The spot starts outside a giant Brooklyn(like) warehouse. We're given the camera perspective of someone walking in. Outside the door, a man plays an acoustic guitar singing an acoustic rendition of the Joy of Pepsi. As we enter the warehouse the genres start to change and unfold while the song remains the same and continues in the spot the acoustic singer left off. We travel through various rooms where we experience the song in different genres. As each genre changes so does the fashion, clothes, and vibe of the room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Rock\u2022Rap\u2022Jazz/Swing\u2022Classical\u2022Metal\u2022etc\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Think for reference going from a metal interpretation of the Joy of Pepsi to a lone singer with an Adele like quality with a single beam of light shining on her. Think of going from rock an [sic] upright bass plucking out the \"ba ba ba ba ba\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The spot ends walking out the other side of the warehouse where a doo wop/acapella crew is standing around a fire lit in a trash can.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   V/O or title: Joy takes all kinds. Pepsi.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Copyright 3.) The second slide contains the following additional elements for consideration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Considerables:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Doesn't have to be a walkthrough of the warehouse. Can be achieved on one stage while making clean cuts from genre to genre.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Can be a single powerful performer Celeb or Not who pulls off all renditions\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Can incorporate quick changes (wardrobe the way magicians accomplish quick changes ... one dress comes off, another is underneath ready to go)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Crowdsource renditions of Joy of Pepsi as contests on social media\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Below this text are six pictures meant to give the viewer an impression of the concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff created the initial concepts and the refined concepts presented at the November 9, 2015 meeting based upon an agreement between the Parties that Plaintiff would be paid $5,000 for such services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 25.) \"The agreement [Plaintiff] made with [Defendant] did not relate to any right to use, or any licensing or assignment of, the copyright and other intellectual property rights in the advertising storylines which [Plaintiff] presented to [Defendant]....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted).) Defendant did not pay Plaintiff the agreed upon $5,000 during the November 9, 2015 meeting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On December 2, 2015, Defendant advised Plaintiff that Defendant had chosen to move forward with different concepts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Defendant nonetheless allegedly used the \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox storyline, with executional adjustments, to produce the Super Bowl halftime commercial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29 (internal quotation marks omitted).) According to Plaintiff, \"[t]he Super Bowl halftime commercial [Defendant] aired during the 2016 Super Bowl copies, is fundamentally based on, and is derivative of, the All Kinds/Living Jukebox advertising storyline [Plaintiff] presented to [Defendant].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30 (internal quotation marks omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The halftime commercial opens on a jukebox selecting a record with a Pepsi logo at its center. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Kimera Rosen Ex. A (\"Halftime Commercial\") (Dkt. No. 22).) The commercial then changes focus from the jukebox to Janelle Mon\u00e1e, and a room full of other people, dancing in a red 1960s style diner to \"Do you Love Me\" by the Contours. After several seconds dancing in the diner, Mon\u00e1e kicks open a door into a second, all white room filled with a second group of dancers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While Mon\u00e1e walks through the door her wardrobe changes, and so does the music and the style of the dance. Mon\u00e1e and the other dancers are shown dancing to \"Express Yourself\" by Madonna. After a brief period in the white room, Mon\u00e1e runs through a second door and into a blue, modern-day dance club. As the scene transitions into the dance club, Mon\u00e1e's outfit changes again. In this room, Mon\u00e1e dances to a modern rendition of the \"Joy of Pepsi\" jingle, while holding and sipping a bottled Pepsi. As the commercial ends, the camera zooms out and the viewer is shown that the three rooms combine together to make an image of the Pepsi Globe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff has identified the following similarities between the \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox\" concept and Defendant's Super Bowl commercial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   a. As with \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox,\" the commercial is implemented as if and so as to suggest the viewer is transported into a human jukebox, with seamless music changes and genre variety and the ability to imagine a scene consistent with a created joyous feeling;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   b. As with \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox,\" a single powerful performer (hero character) is used to perform all music renditions, genres and fashion changes as she dances seamlessly from room to room;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   c. As with \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox\", the commercial follows a hero character moving from room to room through each doorway used in the complete set design;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   d. As with \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox,\" every time the hero character enters a new room, the genre of music immediately changes to reflect a new vibe;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   e. As with \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox,\" the set design stylistically changes, along with the fashion/wardrobe of the cast, as the hero character moves from room to room;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   f. As with \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox,\" seamless wardrobe changes are used for the hero character;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   g. As with \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox,\" the dance style changes along with the music genre as the hero character enters and exits each room;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   h. As with \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox,\" the commercial uses clean, seamless cuts/camera shots, with the hero character dancing from genre to genre; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   i. Specifically reflecting one of the critical elements of the \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox\" name, the commercial opens on the direct focus of [Plaintiff's] main theme, a jukebox.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 31.) As of May 3, 2016, the Super Bowl halftime commercial has been aired nationally over 7,500 times. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Another advertising agency, The Marketing Arm, which was not part of the original group of agencies that pitched ideas to Defendant and did not participate in the October 30, 2015 telephone briefing, has allegedly taken credit for the commercial aired during the Super Bowl. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Plaintiff alleges that even if The Marketing Arm did present concepts to Defendant, those concepts \"had far fewer elements in common with the Super Bowl halftime commercial than did 'All Kinds/Living Jukebox.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After Defendant learned that Plaintiff was contemplating filing this Action, Defendant tendered a $5,000 payment along with a purchase order for the \"Betty Super Bowl Ad Creative Concept.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Plaintiff rejected this payment on the ground that Plaintiff did not want it to\n   appear as though it agreed to transfer any ownership rights in the concepts to Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant infringed on Plaintiff's copyright to the \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox\" concept by airing the commercial without Plaintiff's permission. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Plaintiff has allegedly been harmed by Defendant's actions because Defendant has not compensated Plaintiff for using Plaintiff's intellectual property and Plaintiff has not received the public recognition it believes it is owed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff additionally asserts four state-law causes of action: breach of contract, unjust enrichment, conversion, and unfair competition. All of these causes of action stem largely from the same conduct described above-Defendant's use of Plaintiff's concept and ideas without permission or executing a Statement of Work. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45, 49, 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this Action by filing the Complaint on June 7, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1.) Pursuant to a memo endorsement, Defendant filed its Motion and supporting papers on November 22, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 20-23.) Following a series of scheduling modifications, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 25, 27), Plaintiff filed opposition papers on January 20, 2017, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28), and Defendant filed a reply on February 24, 2017, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    II. Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff's claims can be divided into two separate categories: state-law claims and a copyright infringement claim. Defendant attacks the state-law claims-breach of contract, unjust enrichment, conversion, and unfair competition-on the ground that they are preempted by the Copyright Act because the claims relate exclusively to Defendant's alleged reproduction and distribution of Plaintiff's copyrighted material. With respect to the breach of contract claim specifically, Defendant argues that even if the claim is not preempted, Plaintiff has not stated a claim for breach of contract because Plaintiff has not alleged adequately the existence of a contract. Defendant attacks Plaintiff's copyright infringement claim on the ground that the \"All Kinds/Living Jukebox\" concept and the 2016 Super Bowl commercial do not share substantial similarities and therefore Plaintiff cannot state a claim. The Court will address these argument in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Supreme Court has held that although a complaint \"does not need detailed factual allegations\" to survive a motion to dismiss, \"a plaintiff's obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Plaintiff's argument strays slightly from the allegations in the Complaint. The breach of contract claim consists of three paragraphs. The first incorporates the first 40 paragraphs of the Complaint, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 41), the second alleges that \"[Defendant] breached the agreement it made with [Plaintiff] that it would enter into a Statement of Work with [Plaintiff] as to any advertising storyline which it wanted to use or otherwise acquire rights,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42), and the third alleges that Plaintiff has been damaged by the breach, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). Nowhere does Plaintiff allege that Defendant promised to pay Plaintiff for the use of any of Plaintiff's concepts. Indeed, the thrust of Plaintiff's Complaint is that Defendant reproduced and distributed copyrighted material without Plaintiff's permission. The Court is skeptical that Plaintiff has alleged more than an unjust enrichment claim, which would be preempted, but will assume that Plaintiff was attempting to allege an implied-in-fact contract.

For now, it is sufficient that Plaintiff's concept contains protectable elements and that the works \"share a similarity of expression.\"\n   <em>\n    Hogan v.

Leave to Amend\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In a footnote at the end of its papers, Plaintiff requests permission to file an amended pleading in the event that the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n 26 n.9.) Plaintiff specifically notes that it has \"additional information about the contract relationship between the [P]arties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Given this representation, the Court will give Plaintiff one final opportunity to state a claim. Plaintiff may file an amended pleading within 30 days of the date of this Opinion remedying the deficiencies identified about with respect to its failure to state a claim for breach of contract. The other state-law claims are dismissed with prejudice because better pleading cannot cure the fact that they are preempted by the Copyright Act. If Plaintiff does not file an amended pleading, Defendant shall file an Answer within 45 days from the date of this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    III.
