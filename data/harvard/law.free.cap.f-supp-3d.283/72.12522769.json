PAULEY III, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Port Authority Police Benevolent Association, Inc. (\"PAPBA\") brings this action against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (the \"Port Authority\"), asserting violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"). More specifically, PAPBA challenges Port Authority policies requiring its police officers to submit to annual medical examinations and fitness-for-duty examinations. Both parties move for summary judgment. PAPBA's motion for summary judgment is granted as to Count I. PAPBA and the\n   Port Authority's motions for summary judgment are granted in part as to Count II. The Port Authority's motion for summary judgment is granted as to Count III. The parties' motions are denied in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action concerns the proper balance between the privacy interests of Port Authority police officers and the public interest in security and safety at Port Authority facilities. The Port Authority is an interstate governmental agency that operates transportation facilities in the New York metropolitan area, including airports; bridges; tunnels; train, bus, and marine terminals; and the World Trade Center site. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) There are 1,570 police officers within the Port Authority's sworn ranks, and all of them are members of PAPBA, the labor union that represents non-supervisory sworn personnel. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PAPBA negotiated with the Port Authority over the terms and conditions of employment for police officers. Those terms and conditions are embodied in a Memorandum of Agreement (the \"MOA\") that spans 419 pages and meticulously describes seemingly every facet of employment. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Kathleen Gill Miller, dated June 6, 2017, ECF No. 33 (\"Miller Decl.\"), Ex. A.) The Port Authority negotiated for the right to conduct annual medical examinations, and PAPBA agreed to such examinations in return for a paid day off. The annual medical examination is referenced in Section XIV.12 of the MOA, titled \"Overtime: Compensatory Time.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miller Decl., Ex. A, at 20.) References to fitness-for-duty examinations are also sprinkled throughout the MOA's provisions relating to long term leave, military leave, and sick leave. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miller Decl., Ex. A, at 27, 227, 331.) But in an ironic twist, having negotiated certain benefits for its members, PAPBA now claims they violate the ADA and FMLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Port Authority Police Officer Job Responsibilities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The MOA generally describes the job duties of Port Authority police officers as including: (1) patrolling Port Authority facilities on foot or by vehicle; (2) operating various emergency vehicles; and (3) being responsible for the \"protection of life and property at a facility on an assigned tour.\" (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 8-9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Miller Decl., Ex. A, at 212-14.) In short, Port Authority police officers are responsible for the security of the Port Authority's facilities and the safety of people using them. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 6.) Their duties encompass responding to various emergencies, including \"criminal activity, fire, sick or injured patrons, vehicular accidents, traffic problems, terrorist activity, and bomb threats.\" (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 7.) The parties do not dispute that Port Authority officers carry and/or use firearms and are authorized to make arrests. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 8.) The MOA further recognizes that police officers' duties may include \"[c]ontinual standing and/or walking,\" \"[o]ccasional running and/or physically demanding activities,\" and \"[using] firearms skillfully.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miller Decl., Ex. A, at 214.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Mandatory Medical Examinations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Annual Medical Examinations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Port Authority requires police officers to submit to two types of medical\n   examinations, which are the focus of the parties' summary judgment motions. First, PAPBA members must submit to an annual medical examination that includes completion of a questionnaire (the \"Health Questionnaire\") as well as a full physical examination. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 12.) The Health Questionnaire poses an array of questions that probe an officer's physical and mental health history. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 13; Affidavit of Robin Martin, dated April 25, 2017, ECF No. 35 (\"Martin Aff. II\"), Ex. C.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The physical examination consists of a battery of tests performed by Port Authority doctors, including (1) blood work to detect conditions including diabetes and anemia ; (2) kidney- and liver-function tests to detect conditions including alcohol use or high blood pressure ; (3) a chest X-ray to detect conditions including lung cancer, pulmonary function, and heart condition; (4) a urinalysis to detect conditions including diabetes or infection; (5) a vision test; (6) a hearing test; (7) an electrocardiogram ; and (8) a hernia exam for male officers. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) The annual examination is the same for all Port Authority police officers, \"regardless of the officer's rank or job assignment.\" (Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 37:13-39:12, 48:10-48:18 (confirming that all officers-including police officers, sergeants, detectives, lieutenants, captains, and above-are subject to the annual physical examination).) Interestingly, it appears that no Port Authority police officer has been discharged as a result of failing the annual medical examinations. (Oral Arg. Hr'g Tr. at 35:4-35:15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Fitness-for-Duty Examinations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Injured-on-Duty Fitness-for-Duty Examinations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Port Authority requires police officers to report to the Office of Medical Services (\"OMS\") for periodic fitness-for-duty examinations if the officer is absent because he is injured on duty. An officer who is injured on duty must report to OMS within 24 hours (if possible) to be examined by a Port Authority doctor so that OMS can authorize the appropriate treatment under workers' compensation, which covers all officers injured on duty. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.) Thereafter, an officer injured on duty must generally report to OMS every two weeks for evaluation or for reauthorization of treatment. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 24-25; Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 50:7-51:10.) However, OMS's Medical Director acknowledged that the two-week frequency of subsequent visits was a \"general guideline,\" (Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 50:24-50:25), and that frequency depended on the nature of the injury or condition. (Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 46:22-47:14, 49:9-49:20; 61:24-62:19; Miller Decl., Ex. D (providing for re-evaluation of employees not fit for duty every two to four weeks \"depending on the nature of the illness\").) Thus, in some circumstances, follow up visits might not be scheduled. (Martin Aff. II \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As for their substance, these fitness-for-duty examinations are \"specific to the injury, or any other systems that could affect the injury or that could affect the ability for that employee to perform the full duties\" of the position. (Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 62:11-62:19.) Under the operative OMS protocol, these examinations-which \"encompass the evaluation and the follow up of occupationally related injuries\"-are comprised of (1) an \"appropriate medical history as to complaints and symptoms, medication, allergies, etc.\"; (2) a physical examination \"consistent with [the] chief complaint and as extensive as needed to formulate [a] working diagnosis\"; and (3) \"x-rays, laboratory tests, or multiphasic evaluations to help confirm diagnosis.\" (Miller Decl., Ex. D;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Sick Leave Fitness-for-Duty Examinations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Police officers on leave for illness or injuries that were not sustained on the job follow a slightly different protocol. They are required to report to OMS on the sixth day of absence, if possible. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 31.) Following that initial examination, the officer is ordinarily required to report to OMS every two to four weeks, depending on the nature of the illness or injury. (Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 13; Lenzo Decl., Ex. 19.) According to the OMS Medical Director, this examination includes (1) a medical history directed to the reasons the employee is absent and what the symptoms are; and (2) a medical examination tailored to the illness or injury. (Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 69:3-69:19.) The relevant OMS protocol governing sick leave examinations confirms that the physical examination should be \"consistent with [the] chief complaint and as extensive as needed to formulate [a] working diagnosis.\" (Lenzo Decl., Ex. 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Here, by contrast, PAPBA challenges the Port Authority's\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   policy requiring police officers to undergo periodic annual medical examinations and fitness-for-duty examinations. Relying on district court decisions from outside this Circuit, PAPBA contends that to comply with the ADA, the Port Authority's policy may only require employees to submit to a medical examination \"when there is substantial reason to doubt the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the job.\" (Plaintiff's Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Plaintiff's Brief\"), ECF No. 50, at 5.) But this standard cannot logically apply to a general policy of medical examinations or inquiries. The cases on which PAPBA relies address the separate factual scenario involving an individual employee-if individualized evidence were required before a generalized policy could be implemented\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , then no policy could ever be implemented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Instead,\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   illumines the \"different approach that a court should take in addressing a general policy rather than an employer's inquiry or examination of an individual employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109048\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/88/#p94\">\n    333 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, it claims that the purpose of annual medical examinations is to ensure that police officers possess the requisite physical health to perform the essential functions of the job and to assess whether the officer has a condition that might interfere with his ability to perform. Stated differently, the annual medical examination is needed given the safety-sensitive nature of being a police officer, which includes responding to emergency situations and being authorized to carry a firearm. (Martin Aff. II \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   PAPBA counters that compulsory annual medical examinations are not a business necessity for police departments because neither the New York City Police Department nor the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department had required their police officers to submit to such examinations. (Plaintiff's Brief, at 3 (citing Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 4; Lenzo Decl., Ex. 3).) But as the Second Circuit has noted, \"what constitutes a business necessity will undoubtedly vary in different workplaces,\"\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109048\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/88/#p94\">\n    333 F.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is no less true among police departments of different sizes and with different structures, functions, and priorities. Moreover, the relevant inquiry is not whether any particular examination or inquiry is vital to the business, but whether the\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of the examination or inquiry is a business necessity. Here, the record reflecting the duties and responsibilities of Port Authority police officers establishes that the Port Authority's asserted purpose of ensuring that its police officers can adequately safeguard its facilities and the safety of those who patronize them is a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   business necessity. The \"danger that may be posed\" by a police officer who is mentally or physically unfit is \"obvious and undisputed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transp.

In other words, there must be some justification for concluding that the policy is necessary for the class of employees affected, even though the employer need not justify the policy as to each individual employee.

Thus, the Port Authority has not demonstrated reasonable grounds to require all of its police officers to submit to annual medical examinations, as opposed to a narrowly defined class of police officers for whom annual medical examinations may be necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As for breadth, OMS's Medical Director consistently described the annual medical examinations as a \"comprehensive\" physical examination that could identify any health condition or issue that, if left untreated, might eventually impact the police officer's ability to perform the job safely.

And importantly, the annual medical examination can also identify conditions having no impact on a police officer's ability to perform the job. (Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 100:18-100:20.) While such an examination may be reasonably effective in ferreting out dormant conditions, including those that might ultimately affect an officer's job performance, the annual medical examination is \"broader [and] more intrusive than necessary\" to achieve this purpose-especially in the absence of some reason to doubt the class's ability to perform the job.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grassel v.

In contrast, the Port Authority's annual medical examinations are-by its own admission-intended to be comprehensive and to reveal a panoply of conditions, including those having no relevance to an officer's ability to perform the job.

The fitness-for-duty examinations for officers who are absent because of illness or injury not sustained on duty are also within the scope of \u00a7 12112(d)(4) because they require the officer to reveal \"the nature of the illness or condition causing the absence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transp.

First, the Port Authority contends that the fitness-for-duty examinations for officers who are injured on duty are necessary to authorize medical treatment, as provided by the workers' compensation statutes of New York and New Jersey. It asserts that these fitness-for-duty examinations also enable OMS doctors to determine fitness for light duty positions as a means to curb overtime costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 62:20-63:8; Affidavit of Robin Martin, dated March 17, 2017, ECF No. 34 (\"Martin Aff. I\") \u00b6 2.) Next, the Port Authority advances two business necessities to justify its fitness-for-duty examinations for officers absent due to non-occupational injury or illness: (1) to curb excess absence and overtime costs by using officers in light duty positions; and (2) to determine whether the police officer can safely return to work in some capacity. (Defendant's Memorandum, at 13-17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Martin Aff. I \u00b6 2.) This Court analyzes the justifications for injured-on-duty examinations and non-injured-on-duty examinations in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Fitness-for-Duty Examinations for Injury on Duty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Port Authority requires officers who are injured on duty to submit to an examination generally within 24 hours of the injury so that treatment under workers' compensation can be authorized. Following this examination, employees\n   who are not fit for duty are directed to report to OMS every two to four weeks, depending on the injury, for evaluation and reauthorization of treatment. The scope of these examinations is circumscribed by the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In support of this policy, the Port Authority points to the interpretative guidance for the ADA's implementing regulations, which clarifies that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201630.14\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)\"permits periodic physicals to determine fitness for duty or other medical monitoring if such physicals or monitoring are required by medical standards or requirements established by Federal, State, or local law that are consistent with the ADA and this part ... in that they are job-related and consistent with business necessity.\" 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App'x. The interpretative guidance provides several examples of such medical standards or requirements, including (1) federal safety regulations \"that regulate bus or truck driver qualifications\"; (2) laws establishing \"medical requirements for pilots or other air transportation personnel\"; or (3) statutes that require \"employees exposed to certain toxic and hazardous substance be medically monitored at specific intervals.\" 29 C.F.R. Part 1630 App'x. Unlike these examples, however, New York's and New Jersey's workers' compensation statutes do not establish any police-related medical standards or medical requirements. Rather, the New York statutory provision cited by the Port Authority only outlines when and how often an employee must provide notice and subsequent progress reports of medical treatment for a claim to be valid and enforceable against the employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Workers%27%20Comp.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law \u00a7 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -a(4)(a). Likewise, although the New Jersey provision that the Port Authority invokes mandates that employees submit to examinations following a work-related injury to receive compensation under the statute, it does not promulgate any medical standards governing these examinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J. Stat. Ann. 34:15-17. The Appendix to 29 C.F.R. Part 1630 is therefore of little help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, the fact that these workers' compensation provisions allude to periodic examinations or progress reports for specified statutory purposes does not\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   bring the fitness-for-duty examinations into conformity with the ADA. For instance, an employee who suffers an occupational injury may be required to undergo physical examinations under New Jersey's workers' compensation statute without implicating the ADA-whether because the occupational injury is not a disability under the ADA, or because the examination does not reveal that the employee has a disability or the nature or severity of the disability. But here, the fitness-for-duty examinations fall within the ambit of \u00a7 12112(d)(4) because they may reveal that an individual is disabled or the nature or severity of the disability. Thus, to pass muster under the ADA, the policy subjecting police officers who are injured on duty to these fitness-for-duty examinations must satisfy the business necessity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This Court's research has not unearthed any case authority explicitly analyzing whether the authorization of medical treatment for workers' compensation may constitute a business necessity. Here, the EEOC's enforcement guidance is instructive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109048\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/88/#p94\">\n    333 F.3d at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing such agency publications as \"at least a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts ... may properly resort for guidance\" (quotation marks omitted)). In guidance titled \"Workers' Compensation and the ADA,\" the EEOC states that \"[t]he ADA does not prohibit an employer ... from asking disability-related questions or requiring medical examinations\" of an employee with an occupational injury\n   \"that are necessary to ascertain the extent of its workers' compensation liability.\" EEOC Guidance No. 915.002,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%2033161338\">\n    1996 WL 33161338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Sept. 3, 1996). Determining whether an employee is eligible for worker's compensation benefits is particularly vital in this case, where the Port Authority must approve all medical bills and render payment as a self-insured. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 23; Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 46:23-47:14; Miller Opp. Decl., Ex. M.) Therefore, the Port Authority has established that authorizing medical treatment for workers' compensation is a valid business necessity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition to establishing that authorizing treatment for workers' compensation is a business necessity, the Port Authority must also demonstrate that the class subjected to the policy is reasonably defined. Here, the injured-on-duty fitness-for-duty examinations apply only to Port Authority police officers who sustain an occupational injury. The justification for limiting these examinations to this class of police officers is almost by definition consistent with the articulated business necessity.\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   , however, also requires that the policy of fitness-for-duty examinations for officers injured on duty genuinely serve the need to authorize workers' compensation treatment, and that the examinations be no broader or more intrusive than necessary.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   EEOC Guidance No. 915.002,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%2033161338\">\n    1996 WL 33161338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"However, the questions and examinations must be consistent with the state law's intended purpose of determining an employee's eligibility for workers' compensation benefits .... Examinations and questions must be limited in scope to the specific occupational injury and its impact on the individual and may not be required more often than necessary to determine an individual's initial or continued eligibility for workers' compensation benefits.\") The undisputed record reflects that the fitness-for-duty examinations are tailored to the employee's \"chief complaint\" and are limited in scope to formulating a working diagnosis. (Miller Decl., Ex. D; Lenzo Decl. Ex. 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 62:11-62:19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   PAPBA contends that because the Port Authority's doctors specialize only in internal medicine, occupational medicine, and gastroenterology, there are \"myriad medical conditions\" that its doctors are not qualified to diagnose or treat. (Plaintiff's Brief, at 3 (citing Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 51:11-53:11).) But PAPBA does not come forward with evidence to support this proposition, or to refute the Port Authority's evidence that its doctors are \"all occupational specialists because they have worked in this field for a number of years\" and are \"experienced in evaluating occupationally-related illnesses and injuries.\" (Martin 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 53:12-53:23.) No reasonable jury could find that having the Port Authority's doctors conduct these fitness-for-duty examinations is not a \"reasonably effective method\" of determining eligibility for workers' compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109048\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/88/#p94\">\n    333 F.3d at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, this Court concludes that these examinations actually contribute to the Port Authority's authorization of medical treatment by allowing it to ascertain the officer's eligibility for workers' compensation without being broader than necessary to diagnose the condition. As such, the Port Authority satisfies the business necessity exception as to these injured-on-duty fitness-for-duty examinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Port Authority's motion\n   for summary judgment is granted for these fitness-for-duty examinations, and PAPBA's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Fitness-for-Duty Examinations for Injury or Illness Not Sustained on Duty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The fitness-for-duty examinations for officers who are absent because of non-work-related injury or illness generally mirror those for officers who are absent because of work-related injuries. Police officers who fall in the former category must report to OMS on their sixth day of absence, and then every two to four weeks depending on the injury or illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The threshold inquiry for determining whether the business necessity defense has been satisfied asks whether the asserted purpose behind the policy of medical examinations or inquiries is vital to the business. The Port Authority contends that the sick leave fitness-for-duty examinations are necessary (1) to curb excess absence and overtime costs by using officers in light duty positions; and (2) to determine whether the police officer can safely return to work in some capacity. In support of the first justification, the Port Authority submitted records that estimate the yearly cost of sick leave to the Port Authority as well as the estimated cost of overtime backfill as a result of sick leave.

While these costs are no doubt significant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Port Authority does not provide any evidence indicating how much of these costs are attributable to\n   <em>\n    excessive\n   </em>\n   absences or evidence quantifying the costs that would be saved by using officers in light-duty positions. On this record, this Court cannot conclude that the Port Authority's general desire to reduce sick leave and overtime costs-a \"mere expediency\" doubtlessly shared by\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   employer-rises to the level of being vital to its business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109048\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/88/#p94\">\n    333 F.3d at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An employer cannot simply demonstrate that an inquiry is convenient or beneficial to its business.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Port Authority's second rationale-ensuring that its police officers can safely return to work-is a valid business necessity, given the Port Authority's responsibility for maintaining safety and security at its facilities and responding to emergencies.

The Second Circuit answered this question in\n   <em>\n    Coutard\n   </em>\n   , which held that \"the obligation of an employee to give notice of his need for FMLA leave is not the obligation ... to provide the employer with all of the necessary details to permit a definitive determination of ... FMLA's applicability at or before the time of the request,\" but \"in the absence of a request for additional information, an employee has provided sufficient notice to his employer if that notice indicates reasonably that ... FMLA may apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Coutard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277272\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/102/#p114\">\n    848 F.3d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   But PAPBA's proposed amendments put the cart before the horse. PAPBA fails to plausibly allege that Officer Arias provided\n   adequate notice to the Port Authority of his intent to take FMLA leave\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   -much less that Officer Arias suffered an injury or interference with his exercise of or attempt to exercise his FMLA rights. PAPBA's only contention on this score is a sinewy claim that the Port Authority purportedly failed to comply with FMLA regulations.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Westchester Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3808301\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/769/448/#p468\">\n    769 F.Supp.2d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (finding that \"technical violations\" without allegations of resulting harm do not state a FMLA interference claim);\n   <em>\n    Donnellan v.

July 22, 1999) (dismissing plaintiff's FMLA interference claim where plaintiff had not shown that technical violations of FMLA's designation regulations had denied plaintiff her FMLA rights). Even viewing PAPBA's claim in a light most favorable to plaintiff, the proposed FMLA claim cannot survive a motion to dismiss, and leave to amend would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Further, while PAPBA's supplemental letter glibly asserts that additional discovery is unnecessary if leave to amend is granted, (PAPBA Supp. Ltr. Br., at 5), this Court is unconvinced. For one thing, although discovery in this action for Counts I and II has been complete since March 13, 2017, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   March 13, 2017 Joint Letter, ECF No. 21), there is no indication that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   discovery has been taken as to Officer Arias. In particular, the record is bereft of any reference to Officer Arias that would allow this Court to determine whether any notice he may have provided to the Port Authority was sufficient to trigger FMLA obligations with respect to the Port Authority fitness-for-duty examination policy. And because \"adequacy of notice is usually a fact-specific question,\"\n   <em>\n    Coutard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277272\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/102/#p114\">\n    848 F.3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , discovery on this issue would likely be necessary to resolve the FMLA claim, further delaying resolution of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In addition to the futility of the proposed amendments and the likelihood of further delay if leave to amend were granted, the late stage of this action counsels against granting leave. Courts in this Circuit have \"consistently found prejudice and denied amendments where discovery has already been completed and summary judgment motions have been filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Greenberg v.

Br., at 4 n.1.) This argument is unpersuasive. Courts are \"free to conclude that ignorance of the law is an unsatisfactory excuse\" for delay in requesting leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    Cresswell v.

There is no reason that PAPBA could not have named\n   an individual plaintiff on March 27, 2017, when PAPBA filed its second amended complaint appending the FMLA claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berman v.

This Court recognizes the wisdom in requiring police officers to undergo regular medical screening or medical examinations to ensure that they can protect the public. But where such examinations implicate the privacy interests under the ADA, they must be consistent with business necessity. The Port Authority makes that showing for its injured-on-duty fitness-for-duty examinations, and this Court grants summary judgment to the Port Authority with respect to those examinations. But because the Port Authority has not established that its compulsory annual medical examinations or sick leave fitness-for-duty examinations are consistent with business necessity, the ADA compels summary judgment for PAPBA on those examinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Nevertheless, this Court would be remiss if it did not express skepticism about a labor union negotiating healthcare benefits for its members and then turning around and suing the employer to rescind some of them. This irony is particularly stark given the current healthcare debate in the United States and the worries of many Americans about whether their medical needs will be met. Port Authority police officers enjoy better healthcare than most Americans. Their collective bargaining agreement requires the Port Authority to pay the full premium costs for their healthcare insurance. Until today, not only did Port Authority police officers have free medical care, they received a day's pay for submitting to an annual medical examination. This Court wonders how many Americans would welcome such a generous arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   PAPBA's motion is granted in part and denied in part, and the Port Authority's motion is granted in part and denied in part. The parties are directed to submit a proposed judgment consistent with this Opinion &amp; Order by November 3, 2017. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motions pending at ECF No. 31 and ECF No. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The parties have appended to their motion papers various excerpts of the February 8, 2017 Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of Robin Martin, the Medical Director of the Office of Medical Services for the Port Authority.
