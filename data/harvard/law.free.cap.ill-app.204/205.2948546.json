In an action to recover damages for death resulting from injuries by being struck by a street car, where it appeared the deceased was thirty-three years old, with good sight and hearing, that his view on the street was unobstructed, and that he attempted to cross the street rapidly midway between two intersecting streets in front of a car which was approaching at a high rate of speed, held that ordinary prudence should have warned the deceased that death or injury was almost certain to result to him under such circumstances, and that he was guilty of negligence which proximately contributed to his death and precluded recovery against the owner of such street car.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\" pgmap=\"231\">Error to the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.
