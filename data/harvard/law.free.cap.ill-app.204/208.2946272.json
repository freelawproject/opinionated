Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 6<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what constitutes a dangerous appliance. The fact that a serious injury was inflicted by a mechanical device appurtenant to a planer called a \u201cdog,\u201d and that soon after an accident, upon diligent search and inquiry, an efficient method of protection was discovered and applied, making such planers and dogs harmless, held to stamp such appliance as dangerous under section 3 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1911 (J. &amp; A.
