L. Child, defendant, to recover for money loaned by the deceased to the defendant and interest thereon and money collected by the defendant in the lifetime of the deceased from parties owing him and which had not been accounted for or paid to him. From a judgment for plaintiff for $795.83, defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b185-10\" pgmap=\"185\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b185-11\" pgmap=\"185\">1. Assumpsit, action of, \u00a7 93<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when verdict deemed to be based upon amount of check alleged to represent money loaned. In an action to recover for money in part loaned to and in part collected by the defendant, where the verdict was for an amount exactly equal to that of a certain check stated to represent the money loaned and interest thereon and was excessive as a valuation of two teams of mules, the proceeds of the sale of which the defendant collected, and there being no other proof in the case, held that such verdict should be taken as upon such check alone.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b185-12\" pgmap=\"185\">2. Assumpsit, action of, \u00a7 87*\u2014what presumption arises from receipt of check from deceased person. The mere fact that the defendant received from the plaintiff\u2019s intestate a certain check and received the money thereon could not create the presumption that the intestate loaned the defendant the amount of the check, but the ordinary presumption would be that the money was paid because it was due and owing by the intestate to the defendant, in an action to recover such amount.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b185-13\" pgmap=\"185\">3. Assumpsit, action of, \u00a7 89*\u2014when evidence insufficient to show that check is for money loaned. Evidence held insufficient to sustain the finding that a certain check given by plaintiff\u2019s intestate to the defendant, who received the money thereon, was for money loaned to the defendant, in an action to recover the amount of such check.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\" pgmap=\"185\">A bill of particulars filed showed an item of a check for $600 as for money loaned to the defendant and cashed by him, and another item for money arising from the sale by the defendant of two teams of mules belonging to the deceased.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-6\" pgmap=\"185\">George W.

Assumpsit, action of, \u00a7 92<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction is misleading. An instruction that a $600 item in a hill of particulars was based upon a certain check for that amount in evidence, held misleading , in an action to recover for money loaned in which such bill of par- \u00a1 ticulars was filed, as in order to sustain that item it would be necessary not merely to show the check but also that it was an advancement or loan to the defendant.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
