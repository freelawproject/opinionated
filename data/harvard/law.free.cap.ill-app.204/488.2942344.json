In an action by an employee of a subcontractor against a contractor to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff falling from a stairway, where the declaration alleged that the defendant had provided such stairway for the use of the workmen in the construction of the building but that it was not properly guarded by a handrailing, and the evidence tended to establish such allegation, held that it was not open to the objection of variance, notwithstanding the evidence failed to sustain the further allegation in the declaration that the defendant had constructed the stairway.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b516-6\" pgmap=\"516\">8. Appeal and error, \u00a7 438*\u2014when objection of variance may not be raised.
