Kuebler, complainant, against George J. Kuebler, defendant, for divorce on the ground of extreme and repeated cruelty, for the conveyance of certain property, and for alimony and solicitor\u2019s fees. From a decree for divorce and for alimony and solicitor\u2019s fees, based upon an agreement between the parties, defendant appeals as to that part of the decree which relates to alimony and solicitor\u2019s fees.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\" pgmap=\"282(143) 283(99)\">Complainant in her bill claimed that certain property standing in the name of the defendant should be decreed to be hers in equity and good conscience. The defendant in his answer denied the charges \u00e1nd complainant\u2019s title to the property, and filed a cross-bill for divorce for desertion, which complainant denied. The master to whom the case was referred reported the complainant\u2019s interest in the property amounted to $481.40, which had subsequently been paid her, and that the property stood in the defendant\u2019s name, subject to a trust for $3,000 and complainant\u2019s dower interest, and that the household furniture belonged to the defendant, with exceptions; and he reported that the bill be dismissed as to the property. On trial by a jury, the defendant was found guilty and the cross defendant not guilty. Thereafter, in open court an agreement was made between the parties that the complainant would vacate the property occupied by her as a homestead and that the defendant would pay her $100 a month alimony and her solicitor\u2019s fees of $400, and the court directed a decree to be prepared accordingly. The complainant vacated the property. She filed no exceptions to the master\u2019s report. Thereafter the decree as directed was presented in court, and the defendant presented objections as to alimony and solicitor\u2019s fees fixed therein in accordance with the agreement as excessive, unreasonable and beyond his financial ability.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-7\" pgmap=\"283\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-8\" pgmap=\"283\">Divorce, \u00a7 64<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when party estopped to repudiate terms of decree hosed upon agreement.
