In a suit for divorce on the ground of extreme and repeated cruelty, where the only acts of cruelty shown were nine years apart, one of which was a mere slapping in the face, not producing any bruise, after which the parties continued to live happily together for many years, and the other occurred while complainant was trying to get a stick pin away from defendant, when he turned and knocked her down, apparently not in anger, held, that the court did not err in directing a verdict for the defendant.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b656-6\" pgmap=\"656\">3.
