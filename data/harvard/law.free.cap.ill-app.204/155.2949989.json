Plaintiff ordered the boy away, and then defendant came up with a hoe and began digging an opening, which Kelly filled up with a shovel as fast as it was made. A fight with hoe and shovel followed until they were separated, plaintiff receiving from the hoe a gash in his leg an inch deep and an inch and a half long, for which this action was brought.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b182-8\" pgmap=\"182\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b182-9\" pgmap=\"182\">1. Assault and battery, \u00a7 22<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when verdict is not excessive. In an action for assault and battery, evidence held sufficient to sustain a verdict for eight hundred dollars damages for personal injuries, where such injuries required medical attendance at times for two weeks and prevented plaintiff from practicing his profession as a dentist for some time, and left a permanent scar and caused pain at times for six months after the injuries were sustained, and grounds for exemplary damages appeared.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b182-10\" pgmap=\"182\">2.
