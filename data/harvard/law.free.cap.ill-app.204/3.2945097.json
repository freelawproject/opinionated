Kurfiss, deceased. From a decree that the defendant George Mathis pay into court $975, with interest, as balance due on accounting, less $50 allowed him as compensation for his services as trustee, defendant George Mathis appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-15\" pgmap=\"29(90) 30(133)\">By the will the defendant George Mathis was devised in trust for the testator\u2019s son, said John Kurfiss, deceased, the son\u2019s share in the testator\u2019s estate, with directions to pay the interest thereon to the son annually during the son\u2019s life and at his death to pay such share to the son\u2019s heirs, share and share alike, and that whenever a home could be safely secured the trustee was to so invest the trust estate, provided the home could be secured \u201cso as to be entirely without incumbranee,\u201d in which case it was to be deeded to the son and the trust ended. The trustee received as such trustee $2,342.52. He entered into a written contract with Gottlieb Vetter for the purchase of a home for said John Kurfiss for $1,500, paying $300 cash and agreeing to pay the balance in instalments or six months after the death of said Vetter, the contract containing other provisions as to payment and a provision that the property should be deeded to said John Kurfiss or his heirs. Said John Kurfiss and his family took possession of the property and remained there up to his death. The trustee paid $1,052.25 from the trust fund on the purchase, also $450 to said John Kurfiss for repairs, remodeling and improvements on the place.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b30-9\" pgmap=\"30\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b30-10\" pgmap=\"30\">1.

Trusts, \u00a7 263*\u2014when trustee is not in default in making settlement with heirs. Where the beneficiary of a trust fund died leaving adult and several minor heirs, held that the trustee of such fund would not be in default because he did not make settlement and accounting with the heirs immediately after the death of such beneficiary, where the adult heirs could not enforce such settlement and accounting without having a guardian appointed for the minor heirs, and they failed to do so.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-6\" pgmap=\"30\">Jacob Cantlin, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-7\" pgmap=\"30\">Philip H.
