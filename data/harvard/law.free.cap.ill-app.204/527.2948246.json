Keogh &amp; Company, a corporation, defendant, to recover a balance of $260.22 as part of the selling price of ten carloads of coal shipped to defendant. From a judgment for defendant on its set-off for $702.15, plaintiff brings error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-9\" pgmap=\"553(189) 554(32)\">Plaintiff claimed for coal furnished at defendant\u2019s request and upon an account stated, which defendant\u2019s affidavit of merits denied, and said affidavit stated also that defendant objected to the quality of the coal delivered ; that it refused to pay therefor and requested its removal, and that it was not the kind ordered, but of an inferior quality. Defendant\u2019s set-off was for money paid for coal and freight, which defendant stated it had to pay before it could get the coal, and defendant stated further it paid immediately thereon to the plaintiff the purchase price of the coal, not then knowing or having means of finding out that it was of an inferior grade and not as ordered and unfit for use; that immediately, upon finding this out, it notified plaintiff it would not accept the coal and requested its removal, and that the amount due defendant from plaintiff for such coal and freight and for unloading of cars was $985.50. Plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of merits alleged such freight charges were part o.f the purchase price of the coal and that all of the coal was of the quality represented at time the order was taken. Five cars of the coal were shipped to defendant\u2019s factory at Soldier\u2019s Grove, Wisconsin, and five cars to its factory at East Dubuque, Illinois.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b554-7\" pgmap=\"554\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b554-8\" pgmap=\"554\">1.
