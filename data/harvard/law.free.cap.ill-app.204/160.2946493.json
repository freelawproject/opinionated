Petitions and motions for a change of venue and affidavits in support thereof and the ruling of the court thereon can only be made a part of the record by being incorporated in the bill of exceptions or certificate of evidence, both in chancery and at law, and a mere showing in the abstract that a petition for a change of venue was filed and denied would be insufficient to secure a review of such denial.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b187-7\" pgmap=\"187\">3.
