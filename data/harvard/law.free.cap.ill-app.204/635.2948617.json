The doctrine of estoppel in pais is to prevent injuries arising from conduct or declaration which have been acted on in good faith and which would be inequitable to permit the party to retract, and in order to create such estoppel the party estopped must have induced the other party to occupy a position which he would not have occupied but for such acts and declarations, and which also must be such as would ordinarily lead to the result complained of.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
