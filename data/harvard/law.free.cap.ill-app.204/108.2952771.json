In an action for damages for personal injuries negligently sustained, where it appeared in proof that the defendant, while training a horse which she knew was accustomed to rear up whenever a curb bit was used and would not back, asked the plaintiff, a boy under sixteen and one-half years old, and a stranger to her, to back the horse, not telling him about the horse\u2019s disposition, and the plaintiff accordingly got on the horse and pulled on the curb bit, with which he was not acquainted, in order to back the horse as directed by the defendant, whereupon the horse reared and fell backward, breaking plaintiff\u2019s leg, evidence held sufficient to sustain a verdict for the plaintiff.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\" pgmap=\"134\">Error to the Circuit Court of Lake county; the Hon.
