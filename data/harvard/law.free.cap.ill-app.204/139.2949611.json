Where additional insurance was permitted in a fire policy, held that it would be immaterial in an action on such policy for a loss whether other insurance was in force when the policy was issued or that other insurance was issued thereafter and canceled before the loss, and that there was no error in refusing to admit evidence as to such other insurance.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
