Cooke Company, a corporation, complainant, against E. R. Stege Brewery and Patrick Ahem, defendants, to determine the right to certain rents paid by complainant into court. Prom a decree ordering payment of the fund, less the amount of the master\u2019s fees to be paid therefrom, to the defendant E. R. Stege Brewery, and taxing costs other than the master\u2019s fees against the defendant Ahem, the defendant Ahem appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-9\" pgmap=\"398(152) 399(52)\">The claim of the defendant E. R. Stege Brewery was predicated upon a sheriff\u2019s deed issued upon an execution sale of the premises in controversy under a judgment for $1,605.38 recovered by it against the defendant Ahern. The latter\u2019s claim was based upon the fact he was lessor of the premises, that he, at the time of the sale, owned an estate of homestead therein, and that such homestead was not set off to him and his equity of redemption was not then nor since worth $1,000. Ahern also filed a cross-bill praying removal of said deed as a cloud upon his title, upon which issue was formed. Such homestead estate was adjudicated in Ahern\u2019s favor in the case of Dooley v. Ahern, 191 Ill. App. 140. Ahern\u2019s claims were sustained by the master\u2019s report, to which no exceptions were filed. Before entry of decree confirming such report, Ahern moved to dismiss Ms cross-Mil. The motion was deMed and decree entered, setting aside the sale and deed, vacating the satisfaction of the judgment and restoring the judgment, and directing payment of the money in the clerk\u2019s hands, $561.55, to the defendant E. R Stege Brewery and applied upon its judgment.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-7\" pgmap=\"399\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-8\" pgmap=\"399\">1.
