In an action to recover money paid on the purchase of a new automobile, where the plaintiff claimed that the chassis of the car delivered was not new, held that an instruction that the plaintiff had the burden of showing that the chassis was \u201ca used and second-hand chassis,\u201d and that unless he so showed he could not recover, was erroneous, as from the evidence the jury could reasonably understand that \u201ca used and second-hand chassis\u201d was one that had been sold or used by a purchaser, which was not the charge made, and as such instruction omitted the important elements of age and wear.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\" pgmap=\"448\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Where defendant agreed to sell plaintiff a new automobile, held that he could not avoid his obligation by furnishing a car worn by showing it to prospective purchasers or moving it from place to place for providing equipment \u201cand similar purposes,\u201d as such use alone might so wear a car as to materially impair its operation.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"ARs\" pgmap=\"449\">3.

In an action to recover money paid on the purchase of a new automobile based upon a claim that the car furnished was, from age and wear, from whatever cause, not new, held that an instruction that even if the uses wore the automobile to the breaking point the plaintiff could not recover was erroneous, as if the jury should believe that the use and wear had been shown to be more than reasonably should be in a new car of the kind and price, plaintiff would be entitled to recover.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b449-6\" pgmap=\"449\">4.
