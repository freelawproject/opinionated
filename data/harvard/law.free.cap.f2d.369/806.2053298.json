At the close of the appellant\u2019s case the District Court ruled that there was no coverage because the appellee was not an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce as defined by the Act. The Court found that the undisputed evidence showed that the appellee was a local construction company and did not have two or more employees who handled, sold or otherwise worked on any goods or material shown to have moved in commerce, or were engaged in the production of goods for commerce, and that no two of appellee\u2019s employees were engaged in commerce in any manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">Our review of the record convinces us that no error was committed. The judgment is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
