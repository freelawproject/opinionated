Affirmatively the union was required to notify the company that it had no objection to the continued employment of DiBoff and to make DiBoff whole for loss of wages and to post appropriate notices. 152 N.L.R.B. No. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">The Board now petitions for enforcement, and respondent challenges the factual determinations of the Board upon two issues: (1) whether Powell, in operating the union hiring hall, discriminated against DiBoff; (2) if so, whether such discrimination was improperly motivated or was the result of innocent mistake. Upon neither issue were the Board\u2019s findings clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">There is ample support for the Board\u2019s finding that Powell referred other list 2 carpenters to Rayber-Kief in disregard of its agreed quota while denying such reference to DiBoff. There is no basis for an assumption that the referred carpenters were requested by name, and in any case an inference of a continuing request for DiBoff was available under the facts. The Board was not in error in holding that such conduct amounted to discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-18\">The union asserts that in finding that the discrimination was motivated by animus, the Board has disregarded credibility determinations of the hearing examiner. We disagree. The hearing examiner did not reach this question, having concluded that there was no discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-19\">The Board\u2019s order is entitled to enforcement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
