In the first count of a three-count indictment, Benson was charged, with two others (Holloway and Smith), with \u201cconcealing\u201d the stolen motor vehicle; in count two the three were charged with \u201creceiving\u201d it; count three charged Benson, alone, with \u201cstoring\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-24\">Upon the government\u2019s motion, nolle prosequi, the indictment was dismissed as to Smith. After one mistrial because of the jury\u2019s failure to agree, the case went to trial against Holloway and appellant Benson. Holloway was acquitted, Benson was convicted. Benson\u2019s motion for severance, made prior to the second trial, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-25\">Appellant asks that we grant him a new trial, assigning the following alleged errors: first, the denial of his request for severance; second, the reception of evidence of admissions made by his code-fendant outside of appellant\u2019s presence; third, latitude allowed the government in cross-examining a defense character witness; and fourth, the inconsistency of the jury\u2019s verdict, in that it acquitted Benson and his codefendant Holloway of \u201cconcealing\u201d and \u201creceiving\u201d the stolen vehicle as charged in counts one and two, but convicted Benson of \u201cstoring\u201d it, as charged in count three.</p>\n<p id=\"A9P\">1) Severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-28\">Appellant\u2019s request for a separate trial was based on the fact that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the first trial two government witnesses had testified to admissions made by the codefendant Holloway which implicated appellant Benson in the alleged criminal enterprise. Appellant avers that such evidence prejudiced him, and charges that with knowledge of its likely use upon retrial the District Judge should have granted a severance. The disposition of such a motion was a matter within the discretion of the District Judge. Sharp v. United States, 195 F.2d 997, 999 (C.A.6, 1952); United States v. Cohen, 124 F.2d 164, 166 (C.A.2, 1941), cert. den. 315 U.S. 811, 62 S.Ct. 796, 86 L.Ed. 1210. The District Judge\u2019s ruling would be reversed by us only if we were persuaded that it \u201cresulted in an infringement upon the accused\u2019s right to receive a fair trial,\u201d Maupin v. United States, 225 F.2d 680, 682 (C.A.10, 1955), or that he had abused his discretion. Bullock v. United States, 265 F.2d 683, 689 (C.A.6, 1959) cert. den. 360 U.S. 909, 79 S.Ct. 1294, 3 L.Ed. 1260. We are not so persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\">2) Reception of evidence of admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Evidence was received of admissions made by appellant\u2019s codefendant Holloway which were clearly hearsay as to appellant Benson, but were admissible against Holloway. The District Judge adequately admonished the jury that such evidence should not be considered by them in passing upon the case against Benson. Had the motion for severance been granted, such evidence would not have been admissible. Inasmuch as we are remanding for a new trial which will involve only Benson, such evidence will then be subject to appropriate objection. We consider further discussion unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">3) Cross-examination of character witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Upon cross-examination of a defense character witness, government counsel inquired as to the witness\u2019 criminal record. He was permitted to show that some 30 years before, the witness had been convicted of a felony and served a prison sentence, and the district attorney then proceeded to inquire whether the witness had many other charges.\u201d Upon objection, the District Judge told the jury that they were not to consider charges and announced the familiar rule: \u00ab</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cIt is convictions that may be considered by the jury in weighing this man\u2019s testimony and the convictions must involve moral turpitude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The government attorney then, emphasizing that the witness was a character witness, proceeded over objection, first to disclose that the witness had been charged, but acquitted of, \u201cviolation of age of consent\u201d [we assume statutory rape] some 32 years before when the witness was a teenage boy. The examination then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">\u201cQ. You mean you haven\u2019t been in conflict with the law since then ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">\u201cA. I have been acquitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">\u201cQ. Do I understand you to say that you have not been in difficulty with the law, arrested, and so forth, on charges since 1954?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t believe I have a conviction on any charge. I don\u2019t believe I have a conviction on any charge. I have been acquitted on any I have been accused of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">\u201cQ. Driving while under the influence ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-15\">\u201cA. Been acquitted on driving while under the influence by a Grand Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-16\">\u201cQ. What about the drunkenness charges here in the City of Knoxville, how many of those \u2014 -how many fines have you paid in the past few years ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-17\">\u201cA. I couldn\u2019t say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-18\">\u201cQ. When was the last time you were down at the police station on a charge of drunkness and other violations ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-19\">\u201cA. I believe last year while driving under the influence. The Grand Jury returned a not true bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-20\">\u201cQ. In fact, you have some 18, 20 or 25 drunkenness charges in the city\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-21\">\u201cMr. Simpson: May it please the Court, I am still raising the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>and moving for a mistrial on the part of defendant Benson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\u201cQ. \u2014for the past few years ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cThe Court: Your motion is overruled, the motion for a mistrial is overruled and we are going through with this trial, gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cA. Not the past few years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">It was proper to test the witness\u2019 credibility by showing previous convictions, but we consider that the foregoing examination violated the rule which the District Judge had already announced. Such was the correct rule. In Henderson v. United States, 202 F.2d 400, 406 (C.A.6, 1953) we said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201c * * * the cross-examination should be limited to showing convictions for felonies or crimes involving moral turpitude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">We were there dealing with cross-examination of a defendant charged with crime who had taken the stand in his own defense. But such rule applies to the cross-examination of any witness whose credibility is in issue. Rizzo v. United States, 304 F.2d 810, 831 (C.A.8, 1962), cert. den. 371 U.S. 890, 83 S.Ct. 188, 9 L.Ed.2d 123; Ramirez v. United States, 294 F.2d 277, 284 (C.A.9, 1961); 3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 980a (3rd ed. 1940). It is true that greater liberality is indulged in the cross-examination of a character witness as to his knowledge of arrests of and charges made <em>against the defendant whose character is the subject of the inquiry. </em>Accord, United States v. Gosser, 339 F.2d 102, 112 (C.A.6, 1964). But the freedom in this regard remains qualified as Mr. Justice Jackson noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">\u201c[The] rule is sometimes confused with that which prohibits cross-examination to credibility by asking a witness whether he himself has been arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">\u201cArrest without more does not, in law any more than in reason, impeach the integrity or impair the credibility of a witness. It happens to the innocent as well as the guilty. Only a conviction, therefore, may be inquired about to undermine the trustworthiness of a witness.\u201d Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 482, 69 S.Ct. 213, 221, 93 L.Ed. 168, 177 (1948).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">The government has neither urged nor demonstrated that the proof of appellant Benson\u2019s guilt was so overwhelming that we should overlook the examination as not affecting his substantial rights. 52 (a) F.R.Crim.P. We are, therefore, constrained to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">4) Alleged inconsistency of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\"> Appellant Benson, along with his codefendant Holloway, was acquitted of \u201creceiving\u201d and \u201cconcealing\u201d the involved motor vehicle as charged in counts one and two. He was, however, convicted of \u201cstoring\u201d it as charged in count three. Such inconsistency will not vitiate the conviction under a count which properly charges the offense committed. United States v. De Lucia, 262 F.2d 610, 616 (C.A.7, 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
