The operation of the appellee\u2019s system has been stipulated: the remote, or mobile, radio transmitter emits a radio signal which is received by a stationary terminal and forwarded to a special operator at a toll switchboard. When a light flashes on this switchboard, the operator connects the remote caller into the standard telephone network. Thus, the connection of the remote caller with the standard network is done manually by one of appellee\u2019s operators located on ap-pellee\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The Mastini patent describes \u201cmeans\u201d by which signals from the remote radio-telephone <em>\u201ccause </em>the disconnection of the <em>local sub-station\u201d </em>from the standard network and simultaneously cause the connection of the remote radiotelephone. The controversy turns on the proper construction of the words we have emphasized. Mastini asserts that \u201ccause\u201d must be read to include appellee\u2019s manual operator and that \u201clocal sub-station\u201d includes appellee\u2019s switchboard. Chief Judge Ryan held that appellant was estopped to assert that the Mastini patent included any other than an automatic disconnection. He also held the Mastini patent \u201climited to a combination which contained a single subscriber\u2019s telephone.\u201d As we agree that the File Wrapper clearly shows the Mastini patent was so limited, there is no genuine dispute as to the facts and the granting of summary judgment was proper. Vermont Structural Slate Co. v. Tatko Bros. Slate Co., 233 F.2d 9 (2 Cir., 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Chief Judge Ryan correctly concluded that the Mastini patent was limited to automatic means. The patent itself sets out in detail the functioning of an automatic system but does not mention the possibility of manual operations. Further, the File Wrapper history illustrates that Mastini was forced to cancel his early claims because of various prior art references. To overcome these references, new claims were submitted and Mastini remarked: \u201cnone of [these references] describes the idea of automatically switching * * Elsewhere Mastini distinguishes his invention from one requiring the presence of an operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">It is equally clear that Mastini\u2019s \u201clocal sub-station\u201d cannot include a central switchboard. In the File Wrapper the sub-station is alternatively described as a \u201csubscriber\u2019s station\u201d and the patent itself clearly states that Mastini\u2019s invention requires alteration only at the subscriber\u2019s telephone, not at the central telephone plant. Again, as Mastini was forced to add this \u201csub-station\u201d to his claims to avoid rejection on the prior art, he is estopped to now include what he was forced to abandon to obtain his patent. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Nearly a year after the granting of summary judgment, appellant moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) for relief from the judgment on several grounds. His appeal from the denial of this motion has been consolidated with the principal appeal. In this Court, appellant asserts only the single ground that \u201cthe defendants have improperly influenced this Court in its decision by a preordinated, cunning, unconscionable plan or scheme of defense based upon a great deal of misrepresentations and misconducts.\u201d Chief Judge Ryan found that appellant was attempting to use a Rule 60 motion to relitigate the merits of his claim and that the allegations of fraud were not substantiated. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
