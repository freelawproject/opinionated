It further held that the defendant Secretary of Agriculture had authority to promulgate the Regulations. The Borden Company appealed from the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in the Secretary\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-22\">On review of the record we find no error. The Order and Judgment of the District Court entered July 13, 1966 will be affirmed on the well-reasoned opinion of Judge Lane. 256 F.Supp. 592 (1966).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
