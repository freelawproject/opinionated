We enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The Union was certified as bargaining agent of Respondent\u2019s employees October 19, 1962. On March 11, 1963, the Union and Moore\u2019s entered into a maintenance of membership agreement to run until March 10,1964, and thereafter from year to year, unless terminated by either party on written notice not less than sixty days prior to any expiration date. Under the terms of the agreement, Respondent could, \u201cat least\u201d fifteen days before expiration of the contract or any yearly renewal, inform its employees of their right to continue as Union members or withdraw from the Union. In December, 1963, the Union gave due notice of its desire to reopen the contract and negotiations followed until May 20, 1964. Moore\u2019s conduct during this period is the basis for the 8(a) (1) complaint. On May 25, Moore\u2019s challenged the Union majority and refused to recognize it as bargaining agent. The general counsel\u2019s complaint alleging the 8(a) (1) and (5) violations was filed on June 19, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The trial examiner found that Respondent had violated section 8(a) (1) but that it did not violate section 8(a) (5). With respect to the 8(a) (1) violation, the Board sustained the trial examiner\u2019s finding based on Respondent\u2019s circulation on March 2, 3 and 4, 1964, of a petition disavowing the Union among employees, prohibition of employees\u2019 conversations about the Union on their own time, suggestion of an \u201cinside\u201d union and interrogation of and threats to employees over support of the Union. The only issue presented concerning the 8(a) (1) violation is the substantiality of the evidence on the record as a whole. We have considered the objections made, and we hold that there was substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the findings of the Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">With respect to the 8(a) (5) violation, the trial examiner found that Moore\u2019s refusal to bargain was not unlawful because the Union did not command the support of a majority of the employees on March l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hearings Moore\u2019s contended that the \u201ccritical date\u201d for determining majority for purposes of the 8(a) (5) claim was March 11, 1964, the day after the contract, as renewed, expired. The examiner decided, however, that because of Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices beginning on March 2, the \u201ccritical date\u201d was March 1, subject to evidence that defections after that date were not caused by the unfair labor practices. Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 678, 687, 64 S.Ct. 830, 88 L.Ed. 1007 (1944); Joy Silk Mills, Inc. v. NLRB, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 185 F.2d 732, 744 (1954), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 914, 71 S.Ct. 734, 95 L.Ed. 1350 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">The trial examiner decided that on March 1 the bargaining unit consisted of 77 employees, finding that all but one of a group referred to as \u201claid off employees\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> should be excluded. He found that 44 of these 77 were Union members on March l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He further found, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ever, that in February, prior to any unfair labor practices, six of the Union members had an intention to leave the Union and that this evidence \u201cdisentangled\u201d their subsequent defections from other defections attributable to the unfair labor practices. This finding rested upon his inference of \u201cunequivocal action\u201d by the six employees, demonstrating their desire not to be represented. Five of these employees had signed a paper repudiating the Union, and the other, as well as two of the signers, had expressed their intentions to leave the Union to the Union steward. Thus, the examiner concluded that only 38 out of 77 supported the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The Board disagreed with the examiner and found that Moore\u2019s had unlawfully refused to bargain with the Union. The only finding of the Board we need consider is the inclusion of the six employees excluded by the examiner in determining majority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board found that the six employees took no unequivocal action to repudiate the Union until each wrote a letter of resignation to the Union and gave copies to Respondent and that since these letters were written after March 1 their resignations did not impair the Union majority. If the Board\u2019s finding is justified, the 8(a) (5) violation is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">There is no question of credibility of the testimony of the six employees, even though the examiner stated \u201cI credit their testimony.\u201d Their testimony is un-controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\"> From the uncontroverted testimony, the Board was entitled to draw the inference that the action taken by the six employees was not unequivocal. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 494, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). It was a reasonable exercise of the Board\u2019s expertise to rule that the evidence of disaffection in February was not \u201cdeterminative\u201d to disentangle the later unequivocal resignations from the other effects of Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). It was within the province of the Board to infer that the destruction of the signed paper and the comments to the Union steward indicated merely an unsettled attitude prior to the unfair labor practices. NLRB v. National Seal Corp., 127 F.2d 776, 779 (2d Cir. 1942). \u201cIt is for the Board, not the courts to determine how the effect of prior unfair labor practices may be expunged.\u201d Franks Bros. Co. v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 702, 704, 64 S.Ct. 817, 818, 88 L.Ed. 1020 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">We need not and do not reach the question of what evidence is necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>rebut the presumption that defections subsequent to unfair labor practices will be attributed to those practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We need go no further in affirming the Board\u2019s decision, reported at 152 N.L.R.B. No. 66 (May 19, 1965). So far as needed to support our judgment and reasoning, we adopt that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">. Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America, Local No. 64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">. We need not discuss the Board\u2019s challenged disagreement with the examiner\u2019s finding against the claim that Respondent was guilty of surveillance. There is sufficient basis, without that element, for the 8(a) (1) violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-10\">. The defense of good faith doubt of majority status was not raised in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b543-11\">. These employees were laid off by Moore\u2019s because of the termination of the night shift. The factual issue before the trial examiner was whether they had been terminated or merely laid off without a loss of employee rights. The examiner found that with one exception (Libakken) they were terminated prior to March 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b543-17\">. The trial examiner referred to \u201c42 or 43\u201d depending on the inclusion of one Schueler. This reference did not include Libakken, an admitted Union member who was one of the \u201claid off\u201d employees. The exclusion of Libakken from this total is the apparent source of confusion as to the total found by the Board to support the Union. See note 6 infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b544-5\">. In determining the size of the bargaining unit, the Board included an additional five of the \u201claid off\u201d employees, plus two others, for a total of 84. The number of Union supporters was found to be 49, on the basis of the following: the addition of the seven added to the unit total (who were admittedly Union members); the addition of the six employees excluded by the examiner because of their pre-unfair-labor-practice intention to leave the Union; and the subtraction of one employee included by the examiner but found by the Board to have joined the Union after March 1. Although there seems to be a disparity of one employee in the computations of the Board and the examiner (our computations based on the Board inclusions and exclusion put the number at 50), there is no need to consider it. If the Board was correct in including the six employees, the Union had a majority (at least 42 of 77, excluding Schueler and Libakken) without regard to the other findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b544-11\">. The Board\u2019s continued reference to the \u201ccritical date\u201d somewhat clouds the issue in this case. The rule supporting the choice of the \u201ccritical date\u201d is that an employer may not assert a lack of majority status as a defense to an 8(a) (5) violation when the defections are due to his previous unfair labor practices. Medo Photo Supply Co. v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 678, 687, 64 S.Ct. 830, 88 L.Ed. 1007 (1944); Joy Silk Mills, Inc. v. NLRB, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 185 F.2d 732, 744 (1950), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 914, 71 S.Ct. 734, 95 L.Ed. 1350 (1951). Our holding in this case is confined to the Board\u2019s refusal to consider \u201cequivocal\u201d evidence as determinative of the cause of the defections of the six employees involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
