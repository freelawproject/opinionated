He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison on each count, the sentences to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-25\">Acosta was one of about a dozen sailors of Philippine origin assigned to the U.S.S. INTREPID. In August 1963, the bonds in question were stolen from the locker of one of the sailors. His identification card was also stolen and used by the thief in cashing the bonds at the Naval base branch of the Virginia National Bank. The bank teller, however, was unable to recall who had presented the bonds to her and said she would be unable to identify the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-26\">The defendant, who was stationed in Florida at the time, was interviewed there in March 1965 by two United States Secret Service agents. In the course of the interview the defendant, at the agents\u2019 request, furnished them with several specimens of his handwriting, which were then forwarded to a document examiner in the United States Treasury Department. At the trial, the sole evidence which the government had to link the defendant with the offense was the testimony of this document examiner, who stated positively that the samples obtained from the defendant were written by the same hand that forged the endorsements on the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-27\">The defendant advances two arguments on this appeal. The first concerns the admissibility of the writing samples obtained from him, the contention being that he was \u201ccompelled\u201d to furnish the specimens, and that this was a violation of his Fifth Amendment priv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ilege against self-incrimination. The government\u2019s response is that he furnished the handwriting samples voluntarily, and further, that the securing and the admission of handwriting samples in evidence is not within the scope of the privilege. The District Judge found as a fact that the defendant furnished the agents the handwriting samples voluntarily and after he was warned that he need not comply with their request. We will not disturb this finding since it cannot be said to be clearly erroneous. The Judge expressly stated that he believed the testimony of the agents and found that of the defendant to be incredible. Counsel suggested in argument that the defendant may not have understood the warning, since he spoke English imperfectly, but the record shows that the defendant had served in the United States Navy for four years, and had the equivalent of one year of college education. Since the defendant took the stand on his own behalf, it is evident that the District Judge was in the best position to assess the defendant\u2019s ability to comprehend the English language.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Inasmuch as we uphold the District Court\u2019s finding that the handwriting samples were given voluntarily, we do not find it necessary to reach the issue of whether compelling a suspect to execute handwriting specimens is a violation of his privilege against self-inerim-ination. Cf. Schmerber v. State of Cal-lifornia, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), superficially, at least, a more extreme case than this, for there a blood sample was taken from the suspect\u2019s veins over his protest, yet the analysis was admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">The second point pressed by the defendant is that the testimony of the handwriting expert was insufficient to sustain the conviction. On its face, the document examiner\u2019s testimony is a firm foundation for the finding of guilt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Handwriting identification can be as certain and dependable as any other identification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While handwriting analysis may not be as scientifically accurate as fingerprint identification, it is, on the whole, probably no less reliable than eye witness identification which is often made after a quick glance at a human face. Naturally, when the record fails to furnish independent corroboration of guilt, the fact finder should receive the the handwriting testimony with heightened caution, but it cannot be said as a matter of law that such testimony, coupled with the trial judge\u2019s own observation of the exhibits, may in <em>no </em>event be found sufficiently persuasive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">One may harbor some scepticism about the government witness\u2019 self-assured statement on cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>that in thirty-five years he had never made a mistake in such a case, qualifying this statement only by the phrase \u201cso far as I know.\u201d This recalls Justice Holmes\u2019 famous observation, made in another context, that certitude is not the test of certainty. But though we attribute human fallibility to handwriting experts as to other witnesses, the judge or jury hears them out and makes an independent judgment upon the reliability of their testimony. To qualify as a witness, the expert is not required to prove that he has achieved a record of perfection.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In this case defense counsel did not dispute the qualifications of the expert, and it was for the trial judge to weigh his testimony in light of the witness\u2019 demeanor and the total impact of his testimony. The expert took pains to support his statement concerning the common authorship of the forged endorsements and the samples of defendant\u2019s handwriting, by citing in detail the reasons for his opinion. He pointed out the similarities he thought significant and explained why certain dissimilarities, skillfully pressed upon him in cross-examination, were without significance. Moreover, the District Judge could take into account the poor impression apparently made upon him by the defendant on the witness stand, since there were a number of minor points in his testimony reflecting adversely upon his credibility. It is, in addition, worthy of note that a second handwriting expert, selected by the defendant and paid for by order of the court under the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, likewise examined the samples obtained by the agents and the endorsements on the bonds, but did not testify at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The expert\u2019s testimony convinced the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt. An examination of the record and our own inspection of the handwriting samples do nothing to cast doubt upon the trial judge\u2019s finding, and indeed, seem to fortify it. The judgment is therefore Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-5\">. \u201cThe circumstantial evidence afforded by the handwriting [as analyzed by expert witnesses] may in a given case be more convincing than the testimony of * * * [purported eye witnesses].
