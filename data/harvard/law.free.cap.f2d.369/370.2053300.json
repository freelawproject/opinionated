Respondent was found to have violated Sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3), and was ordered to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found and to take certain affirmative action, including the posting of the customary notices and reinstatement of employee Mrs. June Men-shouse with backpay.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">No attorney for respondent appeared before this court for the oral argument. Instead a copy of a letter from respondent to the Regional Director was presented, stating respondent\u2019s intention to post the required notices and to comply with the order of the Board. The Board continues to seek enforcement of its order, stating that a backpay obligation owing to Mrs. Menshouse remains unpaid and, although Mrs. Menshouse appears to be presently employed by the respondent, the Board has no way of determining at this time whether she has been restored permanently to her former position, pay and seniority rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-18\">Assuming that respondent has complied with the Board\u2019s order (a fact which is denied by the Board), it is well settled that compliance with the order is no defense against the entry of a decree of enforcement. The order of the Board imposes a continuing obligation, and the Board is entitled to have a resumption of the unfair labor practices barred by an enforcement decree. Abandonment of an unfair labor practice does not cause the proceeding to become moot. N. L. R. B. v. Mexia Textile Mills, Inc., 339 U.S. 563, 70 S.Ct. 833, 94 L.Ed. 1067; N. L. R. B. v. Toledo Desk &amp; Fixture Co., 158 F.2d 426 (C.A.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-19\">We have reviewed the record and find the decision and order of the Board to be supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-20\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
