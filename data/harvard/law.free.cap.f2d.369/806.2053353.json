The trial was before the Court without a jury. Proof of guilt consisted of evidence of Hayes\u2019 accessibility to the check, the opinion of a handwriting expert that the endorsement was made by Hayes, and the examination by the District Judge himself of the check and authentic specimens of the accused\u2019s writing. The defense evidence comprised only Hayes\u2019 testimony denying the accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-18\">The determination of guilt by the District Judge was made after he had appraised the trustworthiness of the witnesses, the qualifications of the expert and his own comparison of the spurious endorsement with samples of the defendant\u2019s admittedly genuine handwriting. In somewhat like circumstances in United States v. Acosta, 4 Cir., 369 F.2d 41, decided November 2, 1966, we affirmed the finding of the trial judge, and we do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
