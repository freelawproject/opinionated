Defendant (appellee), Sunkist Growers, Inc., is an association of citrus producers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It has as its base 12,000 citrus growers in Southern California and Arizona. The growers are organized into local associations which operate packing houses. The associations-in turn are grouped into district exchanges and representatives from the exchanges make up the governing board of Sunkist. The Sunkist organization handles its members\u2019 fruit in effect from tree to store.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-21\">Appellant contends that the district, court erred (1) in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict; and (2) in ruling that Sunkist was organized in conformance with section 1 of the Capper-Yolstead Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and therefore could not be held in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act for conspiracy to restrain and monopolize trade in product oranges. If Sunkist Growers, Inc.,, was in fact organized as an agricultural cooperative association pursuant to the Capper-Volstead Act, as the district court found, any interorganizational dealings among the various agricultural cooperative associations are immune from the conspiracy provisions of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>1 of the Sherman Act;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but Sunkist may still be found liable under section 2 of the Sherman Act for wrongful use of monopoly power and attempt to monopolize.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The question presented under the first specification in error is whether the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that Sunkist wrongfully used monopoly power or attempted to monopolize trade in product oranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In ruling on a motion for a directed verdict the trial court is required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made. \u201cOn appeal, likewise, the appellate court must consider the evidence in its strongest light in favor of the party against whom the motion * * * was made, and must give him the advantage of every fair and reasonable intendment that the evidence can justify\u201d. 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 2316 (2d ed. 1951.) This is true \u201ceven though contrary inferences might reasonably be drawn\u201d. Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide, 1962, 370 U.S. 690, 696, 82 S.Ct. 1404, 1409, 8 L.Ed.2d 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Sunkist controlled approximately 70% of all oranges produced in Southern California and Arizona, and approximately 67% of the oranges diverted to product use. Product or \u201cexcess\u201d oranges are those not sold as fresh fruit. They are used to make various orange products and are the only kind used by plaintiff in its business. On a national basis Sunkist controlled 6 to 7% of the total production.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Other small cooperatives controlled for their own use approximately 18% of the oranges grown in Southern California and Arizona. The balance of the oranges, approximately 12%, represented those grown by independent growers and available to independent manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">Additional facts set forth in the order granting defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict include the following:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">(1) Prior to the development of the citrus juice industry there was no market for fruit not required by the fresh fruit market, and the remainder of the fruit, then called \u201cculls\u201d, was destroyed by the packing houses. With the development of the citrus juice industry, the demand for culls, now. designated \u201cexcess fruit\u201d, could be sold to processors to convert into juice and other byproducts.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">(2) At the beginning of its processing activity plaintiff had no difficulty in obtaining at a reasonable price sufficient fruit for its needs. When it was demonstrated that conversion of excess fruit into juice and other citrus by-products was profitable, Sunkist decided to process its own fruit and for that purpose organized Exchange Orange Products Company and Exchange Lemon Products Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-19\">(3) Fruit not so processed was sold to independent processors, including plaintiff. Sunkist had excess fruit available for sale to independent processors only when it was unable to process its own fruit. For several years Sunkist sold its excess fruit to independent processors by a bid system. All independent processors, including plaintiff, were invited to present bids for fruit to be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-20\">(4) As time went on and as Exchange Orange and Exchange Lemon developed processing capabilities, more and more excess fruit from Sunkist packing houses was channeled to Exchange Orange and Exchange Lemon until, at the present time, practically no Sunkist fruit is sold to independent processors.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>(5) Plaintiff attempted to obtain from other mutual citrus associations its requirement of fruit to process, only to find that such associations had entered into individual contracts with other processors; hence plaintiff was able to obtain very little fruit supply from mutual associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">(6) Approximately 12,000 citrus fruit growers annually signed contracts with Sunkist agreeing to sell fruit through the Sunkist organization. The contracts provided that if a grower did not abide by his contract, sanctions might be imposed. Occasionally a grower failed to sell his fruit to Sunkist, and sanctions were imposed by the Sunkist organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">(7) Sunkist trade-mark or trade name was a valuable asset, and defendant had spent large sums in establishing its trade-mark or trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">(8) Sunkist employees observed operations of member growers to make certain that the growers handled their crops through the Sunkist organization and if it was discovered that a member grower sold fruit contrary to his contract, a report was made to Sunkist and, in certain instances, penalties were imposed upon the violating grower.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">(9) The Department of Agriculture, pursuant to the school lunch program, requested bids for single strength orange juice. One year Sunkist bid but did not receive the contract and another year, Sunkist bid and was awarded the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">(10) Sunkist made a large profit from sale of citrus fruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">(11) The great majority of citrus grown in Southern California and Arizona goes into the fresh fruit market. The greater amount of oranges grown in Florida goes into the citrus products market. Fresh fruit from California, Arizona and Florida compete on the eastern and foreign markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">(12) It was possible for processors in Florida to make single strength orange juice, can and ship it to California, and sell it at the same price as (or at a price lower than) the Southern California-Arizona produced juice. Florida processors of single strength orange juice could assimilate transportation costs from Florida to California and sell their product in competition with single strength orange juice made within the Southern California-Arizona area. This was possible because of the lower price for which Florida fruit could be purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">(13) The price paid for Florida oranges was the dominant factor in determining the price for which single strength orange juice could be sole, to the ultimate consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">(14) There is also competition between single strength orange juice and orange juice concentrates. Neither of the parties is a producer of concentrated or frozen juice.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">The alleged violations of the Sherman Act arise out of \u201cSunkist\u2019s dominant control of oranges grown in Arizona and California together with its vertical integration and dual distribution with respect to oranges designated for product use * * * \u201d. More particularly, plaintiff complains that it was unable to purchase oranges for product use from Sunkist at a price that would enable it to compete with canned juice shipped in from Florida.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">The district court\u2019s granting of the directed verdict was premised upon the conclusion that the \u201crelevant market\u201d was national rather than limited to California-Arizona, and that in light of this plaintiff had not shown evidence of an illegal monopoly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The cases uniformly hold that \u201ca party has monopoly power if it has, over \u2018any part of the trade or commerce among the several states\u2019, a power of controlling prices or unreasonably restricting competition\u201d. United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 1956, 351 U.S. 377, 389, 76 S.Ct. 994, 1004, 100 L.Ed. 1264. In determining whether a party has monopoly power it is first essential to define the \u201crelevant market\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">This court has held that determination of the relevant market, \u201cboth as respects products and as concerns geographical area\u201d is a \u201cnecessary step precedent to determining whether within that market there was a probability\u201d of violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. Crown Zellerbach Corporation v. F. T. C., 9 Cir., 1961, 296 F.2d 800, 804, (cert. denied (1962)) 370 U.S. 937, 82 S.Ct. 1581, 8 L.Ed.2d 807. While Crown Zellerbach involved a violation of the Clayton Act with respect to corporate acquisitions, it is clear that the same determination must be made regarding the relevant market in actions for violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act. United States v. du Pont &amp; Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">.In the recent case of United States v. Grinnell Corp., 1966, 384 U.S. 563, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778, a civil suit for alleged violations of section 2 of the .Sherman Act, the Court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201c * * * That * * * case arose under \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act where the question was whether the effect of a merger \u2018in any line of commerce\u2019 may be \u2018substantially to lessen competition.\u2019 We see no reason to differentiate between \u2018line\u2019 of commerce in the context of the Clayton Act and \u2018part\u2019 of commerce for purposes of the Sherman Act.\u201d (384 U.S. at 573, 86 S.Ct. at 1705).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In determining the \u201crelevant market\u201d applicable in this case, it seems advisable first to analyze separately the factors involved in both the relevant <em>product </em>market and the relevant <em>geographic </em>market.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\n<em>Relevant Product Market</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ApFK\">United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., supra, relied upon by the district court in granting Sunkist\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, promulgated the test of \u201creasonable interchangeability\u201d to determine the relevant product market. The Government contended that cellophane was the relevant product market. The Court assumed that if this were true, du Pont would have'monopoly power over that market. The Court found, however, that cellophane was \u201creasonably interchangeable\u201d with other flexible wrappings, and that the relevant product market accordingly was \u201cflexible packaging materials\u201d rather than cellophane alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The rule of \u201creasonable interchangeability\u201d has been refined and modified in subsequent cases. In particular, the courts have recognized that there may be an outer market and one or more inner submarkets within which competitive effects are to be appraised, i. e. a relevant submarket may constitute the product market for antitrust purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">In Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 1962, 370 U.S. 294, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 8 L.Ed.2d 510, involving a merger found to be in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, the Court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">\u201cThe \u2018area of effective competition\u2019 must be determined by reference to a product market (the \u2018line of commerce\u2019) and a geographic market (the \u2018section of the country\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">\u201cThe Product Market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-13\">\u201cThe outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it. However, within this broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist which, in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes, (citation) The boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tity, the product\u2019s peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors.\u201d (370 U.S. at 324-325, 82 S.Ct. at 1523).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The rule of Brown Shoe was expressly applied to cases arising under section 2 of the Sherman Act in the recent case of United States v. Grinnell Corporation, supra, where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\u201cIn \u00a7 2 cases under the Sherman Act, as in \u00a7 7 cases under the Clayton Act (Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, [82 S.Ct. 1502, 8 L.Ed.2d 510]) there may be submar-kets that are separate economic entities.\u201d (384 U.S. at 573, 86 S.Ct. at 1704).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\n<em>Relevant Geographic Market</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In Brown Shoe, supra, the Court also set forth criteria to be used in determination of the geographic market:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201cThe Geographic Market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">\u201cThe criteria to be used in determining the appropriate geographic market are essentially similar to those used to determine the relevant product market. See S.Rep.No.1775, 81ct Cong.2d Sess. 5-6; United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 353 U.S. 586, 593 [77 S.Ct. 872, 1 L.Ed.2d 1057.] Moreover, just as a product submarket may have \u00a7 7 significance as the proper \u2018line of commerce,\u2019 so may a geographic submarket be considered the appropriate \u2018section of the country.\u2019 (Citing cases). Congress prescribed a pragmatic, factual approach to the definition of the relevant market and not a formal, legalistic one. The geographic market selected must, therefore, both \u2018correspond to the commercial realities\u2019 of the industry and be economically significant. Thus, although the geographic market in some instances may encompass the entire Nation, under other circumstances it may be as small as a single metropolitan area.\u201d (370 U.S. at 336-337, 82 S.Ct. at 1530).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">In the recent case of United States v. Pabst Brewing Company, et al., 1966, 384 U.S. 546, 552, 86 S.Ct. 1665, 16 L.Ed.2d 765, involving the acquisition in 1958 by Pabst Brewing Company of Blatz\u2019s Brewing Company, the Court held that the \u201cevidence as to the probable effect of the merger on competition in Wisconsin, in the three-state area (Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan), and in the entire country was amply sufficient to show a violation of \u00a7 7 (of the Clayton Act as amended by the Celler-Kefauver Anti-Merger Amendment)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in each and all of these three areas\u201d. In 1957, prior to the merger, the two companies had combined sales which accounted for 23.95% of the beer sales in Wisconsin, 11.32% of the sales in the three-state area, and 4.49% of the sales throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">The Court was unanimous in holding that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint. Mr. Justice Harlan (joined by Mr. Justice Stewart) in a concurring opinion agreed with the district court that viewing the entire continental United States as a relevant market, the evidence did not sustain the Government\u2019s contention that the acquisition might substantially lessen competition. They agreed with the majority opinion, however, as did Mr. Justice Fortas, that the Government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish prima facie that Wisconsin and the tri-state area were proper \u201csections of the country\u201d in which to measure the probable effects of the acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">In his concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Harlan said in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-15\">\u201cThe appropriate geographic area in which to examine the effects of an acquisition is an area in which the parties to the merger or acquisition compete, and around which there exist economic barriers that significantly impede the entry of new competitors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>* * *\u201d (384 U.S. at 556-557, 86 S.Ct. at 1671).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Whether a geographical location is or is not an \u201carea of effective competition\u201d is a question of fact in each case. United States v. Columbia Pictures Corporation, S.D.N.Y., 1960, 189 F.Supp. 153, 192. The area may be limited by differences in costs of production and transportation. Erie Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. F. T. C., 3 Cir. 1961, 291 F.2d 279, 281. \u201cA competitive price disadvantage arising from transportation costs is an important factor in determining the scope of a relevant market.\u201d United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Company, D.Del., 1963, 217 F.Supp. 110, 120; American Crystal Sugar Co. v. Cuban-Ameriean Sugar Co., S.D.N.Y., 1957, 152 F.Supp. 387, 398, Aff\u2019d, 2 Cir., 1958, 259 F.2d 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">It seems clear from the decided cases that (1) while the outer limits of the market may be determined by the competition of interchangeable products, (2) there may be a well-defined sub-market which constitutes the relevant market for antitrust purposes, which (3) must correspond to the commercial realities of the industry, (4) is affected by price disadvantages due to transportation costs, (5) is affected by availability of a buyer to supply and existence of economic areas which significantly impede competition, (6) is determined in part with relation to the parties affected in the suit, and (7) is a question of fact in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">We come now to an application of the criteria for determining both relevant product market and relevant geographic market to the facts in this case. In advance of trial it was the position of the trial court, as set forth in its pretrial order, that the relevant product market was product oranges and the relevant geographic market Southern California and Arizona. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the court was persuaded that the relevant product market included orange juices and concentrates and that the relevant geographic market was national rather than limited to Southern California and Arizona.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">It is clear from the evidence that <em>orange products </em>(single strength juice and frozen concentrates) were sold in a national market. Oranges could be processed in Florida, and the juice shipped to California and sold competitively with juice processed in California from Cali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>fornia oranges. Sunkist held a relatively small part of this national market and controlled neither quantity nor price.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">On the other hand, it is equally clear that it was uneconomical for producers of orange products to buy their <em>product oranges </em>in Florida or elsewhere than in the Southern California-Arizona area. Sunkist controlled 70% of all oranges grown in this area and 67 % of the product oranges. A substantial portion of the remaining product was unavailable to Case-Swayne.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Appellee does not question these facts, but contends that the relevant geographic market for product oranges was national on the theory that the product orange supply is tied irrevocably to orange product price. Appellee argues that product oranges \u201chave value only because they can be converted into a product which has value\u201d, and that \u201cthe value of product oranges cannot exceed that which will permit them to be processed into products and then compete in a national products market dominated by Florida\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">While product oranges may have little, if any, value per se, the same is true of many raw products. The market for raw products is among the processors rather than the ultimate consumer. We see no reason why the raw product may not be the relevant product market, even though it has little value in its raw state. Moreover, it is clear from the recent case of United States v. Pabst Brewing Company, supra, that even as to the processed product, the relevant market may at the same time be national, regional, and statewide in area.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\"> While Sunkist could not control the supply or price of canned juices because of competition from Florida in these products, there was substantial evidence that it did control the supply of product oranges from which juice was made in California and Arizona. In determining the relevant geographic market, a proper test is the <em>\u201c \u2018 * </em>* * geographic structure of supplier-customer relations.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, et al., 1963, 374 U.S. 321, 357, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 1739, 10 L.Ed.2d 915. The relevant market is determined in part by the market area \u201cto which the purchaser can practicably turn for supplies\u201d. Tampa Electric Co. v. National Coal Co., 1961, 365 U.S. 320, 327, 81 S.Ct. 623, 628, 5 L.Ed.2d 580.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is no question that Case-Swayne and other users of product oranges could not as a practical matter obtain product oranges from suppliers outside California and Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">Moreover, even though the price of product oranges in Florida would influence the price of product oranges in California, there was evidence from which the jury might find that Sunkist by reason of its control of the supply also as a practical matter controlled the price.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That is particularly true if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>should be found that Sunkist refused to sell to plaintiff and other independent buyers at any price.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">As Mr. Justice Fortas said in his dissenting opinion<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in the recent case of United States v. Grinnell Corporation, supra, \u201cThe central issue is where does a potential buyer look for potential suppliers of the service. \u2014 what is the geographical area in which the buyer has, or, in the absence of monopoly, would have, a real choice as to price and alternative facilities? This depends upon the facts of the market place, taking into account such economic factors as the distance over which supplies and services may be feasibly furnished, consistently with cost and functional efficiency.\u201d (384 U.S. at 589, 86 S.Ct. at 1713, 16 L.Ed.2d 778).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We conclude that there was evidence from which the jury might properly find that the relevant product market was product oranges and the relevant geographic market Southern California-Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\n<em>Evidence of Wrongful Use of Monopoly Power and Attempt to Monopolize</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">If the jury should find that Southern California and Arizona was the relevant market, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find further that Sunkist engaged in monopolistic practices or an attempt to monopolize proscribed by section 2 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">As the Court said in United States v. Grinnell Corp., supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">\u201cThe offense of monopoly under \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">* * * -X- X X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-13\">\u201cIn United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391 [76 S.Ct. 994, 1005, 100 L.Ed. 1264,] we defined monopoly power as \u2018the power to control prices or exclude competition.\u2019 The existence of such power ordinarily may be inferred from the predominant share of the market. In American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 797, [66 S.Ct. 1125, 1133, 90 L.Ed. 1575,] we said that \u2018over two-thirds of the entire domestic field of cigarettes and * * *; over 80 per cent of the field of comparable cigarettes\u2019 constituted \u2018a substantial monopoly.\u2019 \u201d (384 U.S. at 570-571, 86 S.Ct. at 1704).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">It is clear that Sunkist had possession of monopoly power in the relevant market, if that market is found to be the Southern California-Arizona area.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">It is true, as appellee contends, that size alone does not constitute an offense under the Sherman Act; nor does the mere possession of monopoly power. It is the wrongful use and exercise of that power which is proscribed by section 2 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-17\">However, the ultimate consideration in determining whether an alleged monopolist violates section 2 of the Sherman Act is \u201cwhether the defendants control the price and competition in the market for such part of trade or commerce as they are charged with monopolizing.\u201d United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., supra, 351 U.S. at 380, 76 S.Ct. at 999, 100 L.Ed. 1264. It is not always necessary to find a specific intent to find that an antitrust law has been violated. \u201cIt is sufficient that a restraint of trade or monopoly results as the consequence of a defendant\u2019s conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>or business arrangements (citing cases). To require a greater showing would cripple the Act. As stated in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 2 Cir., 148 F.2d 416, 432, \u2018no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing.\u2019 Specific intent in the sense in which the common law used the term is necessary only where the acts fall short of the results condemned by the Act.\u201d United States v. Griffith, 1948, 334 U.S. 100, 105, 68 S.Ct. 941, 944, 92 L.Ed. 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Appellant contends that Sunkist wrongfully exercised its monopoly power through (1) boycotting appellant by refusing to sell ..appellant product oranges while selling to other processors; (2) preventing TreeSweet from delivering oranges TreeSweet had committed to appellant; (3) controlling orange prices; and (4) eliminating competitors (or as with appellant, limiting their profits) by maintaining high prices for oranges or reducing supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The same acts are relied upon in support of appellant\u2019s contention that Sunkist intentionally attempted to monopolize the trade in product oranges in the relevant market. Appellant relies upon additional evidence of such intent in Sunkist\u2019s (1) admitted purpose to control all the oranges it could get and utilize all of them in its own manufacturing facilities; (2) preventing Placentia Orange Distributors from fulfilling its promise to sell appellant 5,000 tons of oranges in 1957; (3) policing the Sunkist system to punish violators of the Sunkist \u201crestrictive tying contracts\u201d; (4) wrongful use of dual distribution by lowering single strength juice prices after competing manufacturers had purchased product oranges at prices established by Sunkist; (5) use of consignment contracts and its low 1956 bid (compared with its 1955 bid) to the Department of Agriculture.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Appellee recognizes in its brief that \u201cthe key determination by the trial court was that the appellant\u2019s evidence * * established the fact that the relevant market for product oranges is a national market\u201d, but contends further that \u201cunder each of the tests which the courts have applied to determine whether or not a monopoly exists, the appellant\u2019s evidence conclusively established that there was no monopoly\u201d, and that with respect to each of the acts and incidents upon which appellant relies, Sunkist\u2019s conduct was \u201clegitimate, cooperative activity and not undertaken in an unlawful manner or for an unlawful purpose\u201d. There is substantial evidence to support appellee\u2019s denial of each of the alleged acts of monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">In determining the issues of monopolization and intent to monopolize, however, the evidence must be viewed as a whole. Ever though the proof as to each of the. specific acts may be insufficient in itself to establish wrongful use of monopoly power, the jury must look at the \u201cwhole picture\u201d, weigh the contradictory evidence and inferences and draw the \u201cultimate conclusion as to the facts\u201d. See Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide and Carbon Corp., supra, 370 U.S. at 699-701, 82 S.Ct. at 1411, 8 L.Ed.2d 777, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">As noted supra, in ruling on the directed verdict this court must give appellant \u201cthe advantage of every fair and reasonable intendment that the evidence can justify\u201d, and this is true \u201ceven though contrary inferences might reasonably be drawn\u201d. From a review of the record we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the question of whether Sunkist wrongfully exercised its monopoly power and intentionally attempted to monopolize the trade in product oranges. We do not find that appellant has established any of the alleged acts of monopoly \u2014 only that viewing the evidence as a whole, it has made a prima facie case for the jury.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\n<em>Section 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Appellant contends that Sunkist is not a person \u201cengaged in the production of agricultural products\u201d under Section 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act because only 80.12% of its members are associations composed of fruit growers, while 4.97% are corporate growers, and 14.91% are private profit-making corporations, individuals and partnerships which market through Sunkist the oranges they have purchased from growers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The district court concluded, and we think correctly, that under the decision of the Supreme Court in Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winekler &amp; Smith Co., supra, Sunkist Growers, Inc., is a cooperative organized in compliance with Section 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act. It is true, as appellant argues, that this issue was not specifically raised in the Winekler case, but the Court did describe the Sunkist organization in detail. This was prior to the merger with Exchange Orange and Exchange Lemon, but the Court concluded that the 12,000 growers were \u201cin practical effect and in the contemplation of the statutes one \u2018organization\u2019 or \u2018association\u2019 even though * * formally organized * * * into three separate legal entities\u201d. (370 U.S. at 29, 82 S.Ct. at 1136). The Court also said in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-15\">\u201cThe language of the Capper-Vol-stead Act is specific in permitting concerted efforts by farmers in the processing, preparing for market, and marketing of their products. And the legislative history of the Acts reveals several references to the Sunkist organization \u2014 then called the California Fruit Growers Exchange and numbering 11,000 members \u2014 including a suggestion by Senator Capper that this was a type of cooperative that would find \u2018definite legalization\u2019 under the legislation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-16\">\u201c * * * That the packing is done by local associations, the advertising sales, and traffic by divisions of the area association, and the processing by separate organizations does not in our opinion preclude these growers from being considered one organization or association for purposes of the Clayton and Capper-Volstead Acts.\u201d (370 U.S. at 28-29, 82 S.Ct. at 1136).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">With respect to appellant\u2019s contention that Sunkist is not a qualified cooperative under Capper-Volstead by reason of its \u201ccorporate growers\u201d, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>question was raised in the district court in United States v. Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Producers Ass\u2019n, D.D.C.1958, 167 F.Supp. 45, aff\u2019d in part, reversed in part on other grounds, 362 U.S. 458, 80 S.Ct. 847, 4 L.Ed.2d 880. In that case the Government urged that the words \u201cdairymen\u201d and \u201cfarmers\u201d should be restricted to natural persons. The district court held that it was immaterial \u201cwhether every member of the association is a natural person or a corporation.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The Supreme Court did not comment on this portion of the district court\u2019s opinion, although it considered at length the scope of the immunity granted by Capper-Volstead. It is clear from the district court\u2019s opinion that the cooperative included corporate growers. It seems likely that this fact would have been considered by the Supreme Court if there were any question regarding the status of the association as a qualified cooperative by reason of the corporate growers. V|</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 provides that in \u201cdetermining the meaning of any Act * * * of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise * * * the words \u2018person\u2019 and \u2018whoever\u2019 includes corporations * * * as well as individuals * * * <em>tf</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">We find nothing in the context of the Capper-Volstead Act to indicate that a corporation would not be considered a person within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Does the fact that the so-called agency associations (comprising 14.91% by number and 12.94% by volume) constitute a \u201cclass\u201d of membership prevent Sunkist from being a \u201cperson engaged in the production of agricultural products\u201d under section 1 of the Act? It will be noted from the stipulation of the parties (note 18) that the agency associations furnish their facilities and services on an independent contract basis, and that they do not participate in either gain or loss involved in marketing fruit through Sunkist. In other words, the growers receive full benefit of cooperative marketing through the agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">Associations organized under the Cap-per-Volstead Act \u201cmay make the necessary contracts and agreements to effect\u201d the purposes of the Act, i. e., \u201ccollectively processing, preparing for market, handling, and marketing\u201d their products. (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 291). The agency associations supply services which the growers require (packing house facilities) in handling and marketing their products. The fact that the \u201cpacking is done by local associations * * * and the processing by separate organizations\u201d does not preclude the growers from being considered one association for purposes of the Capper-Volstead Act. Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler &amp; Smith Co. supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-17\">This is not a case where the agreement in question goes beyond the legitimate objects of processing and marketing. See e. g. United States v. Borden Co., 1939, 308 U.S. 188, 60 S.Ct. 182, 84 L.Ed. 181. The Court there recognized that agricultural producers \u201cmay unite in preparing for market and in marketing their products\u201d, and may \u201cmake the contracts which are necessary for that collaboration\u201d, but they are not authorized to conspire with others in restraint of trade. The Court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-18\">\u201cIn this instance, the conspiracy charged is not that of merely forming a collective association of producers to market their products but a conspiracy, or conspiracies, with major distributors and their allied groups, with labor officials, municipal officials, and others, in order to maintain artificial and non-competitive prices to be paid to all producers for all fluid milk produced in Illinois * * * and also to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>control \u2018the supply of fluid milk permitted to be brought to Chicago\u2019.\u201d (308 U.S. at 205, 60 S.Ct. at 191).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Producers Association v. United States, supra, the court pointed out that the object of the conspiracy or combination was to eliminate a competitor and that the \u201callegations of the complaint * * * charge <em>anticompetitive activities which are so far outside the \u2018legitimate objects\u2019 of a cooperative </em>that, if proved, they would constitute clear violations of \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act * * * \u201d (362 U.S. at 468, 80 S.Ct. at 854, 4 L.Ed.2d 880). (Emphasis added). The Court said further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9z\">\u201cThe Embassy assets the Associatipn acquired are useful in processing and marketing milk, and we may assume, as it is contended, that <em>their purchase simply for business use, without more, often would be permitted and would be lawful under the Capper-Volstead Act. </em>-* * * phe contract of purchase here, viewed in the context of all the evidence and findings, <em>was not one made merely to advance the Association\u2019s own permissible processing and marketing business; </em>it was entered into by both parties, according to the court\u2019s findings as we understand them, because of its usefulness as a weapon to restrain and suppress competitors and competition * * (362 U.S. at 471-472, 80 S.Ct. at 856). (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The independent contracts with the agency associations were for the legitimate objects of processing and marketing. Under the statute Sunkist could have entered into these contracts \u201cwith separate organizations\u201d. The mere fact that the agency associations constitute a \u201cclass\u201d of membership does not in our opinion change the effect of the agency agreements or destroy the exempt status of the entire association.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\n<em>Request for Leave to File Second Supplemental Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Appellant next contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to file a second supplemental complaint alleging facts occurring after the filing of the original complaint. In our opinion, upon remand of this case, appellant should be permitted to file the supplemental complaint. As the Court said in Texarkana v. Arkansas, Louisiana Gas Co., 1939, 306 U.S. 188, 59 S.Ct. 448, 83 L.Ed. 598:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">\u201cWhere there is a good cause of action stated in the original bill, a supplemental bill setting up facts subsequently occurring which justifies other or further relief is proper. If the original decree in the trial court had not been entered, this supplemental petition would simplify the controversy. We think this procedure is equally applicable after remand for further proceedings.\u201d (306 U.S. at 203, 59 S.Ct. at 455).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">\n<em>Alleged Prejudice and Bias of Trial Judge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Finally appellant contends that the trial judge showed such marked prejudice against appellant that this court should order a new trial before another judge. In our opinion, the record does not support our issuance of the requested order. We are confident that the district court, upon remand and in the proper administration of its own functions, will insure that the retrial is conducted in the necessary atmosphere of total impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">It is ordered that the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201cAny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover three-fold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-10\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">\u201cEvery contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal: * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-13\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">Section 2 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-15\">\u201cEvery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person of persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-16\">. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendant moved for dismissal under Rule 41(b) E.R.Civ.P. or for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a). The court first indicated that it would dismiss pursuant to Rule 41(b), but later concluded that the motion for dismissal was improper and granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-23\">. In addition to Sunkist Growers, Inc., the complaint named Exchange Orange Products Company and Exchange Lemon Products Company as defendants.

The district court initially was of the opinion that the relevant market was Southern California and Arizona, but concluded, when all of the evidence was pre-seated, that the relevant market for product oranges was a national market, \u201cand that whatever happened in Florida directly affected prices in Oaifornia and vice versa.

Iu ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal or a directed verdict, following argument by counsel, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">\u201cI was of the opinion that Florida was not a part of the market; that it was to be limited to Southern California and Arizona. I was of the opinion and still am of the opinion that it would certainly be uneconomical to try to ship fresh fruit from Florida or from Texas to California for the purpose of being converted into orange juice. So I have to look first to what is the competition in this case, what are the competitive factors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">\u201cWell, if we include Florida ns part of the market, then of course Sunkist does not have a dominant place in this picture at all. It is a very minor part of the conversion of fresh fruit into orange juice, if we consider Florida ns a part of the market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">\u201cThen I thought we wore talking about product oranges, the monopoly of product oranges. But it seems to me that we now are talking about product oranges, but also about the juice squeezed from the product oranges.

In the prior opinion of the Court of Appeals, reported at 284 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1960), the only discussion of the exemption pertained to its extent, not to whether or not it was applicable. Furthermore, the Supreme Court, in granting certiorari, 368 U.S. 813, 82 S.Ct. 56, 7 L.Ed.2d 22.(1961), expressly limited its consideration to a single question, namely,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\">\u201cWhere a group of citrus fruit <em>growers </em>form a co-operative organization for the purpose of collectively processing and marketing their fruit, and carry out those functions through the agency of three co-operative agricultural associations, each of which is basically <em>ivholly owned and governed by those groiuers, and each of which is admittedly entitled to the exemption from the antitrust laws accorded to agricultural cooperatives by the Cap-per-Volstead Act </em>(7 U.S.C.A., see. 291) \u2014 is an unlawful conspiracy, combination or agreement established under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act [15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2] upon proof only that these <em>growers, </em>through the agency of these three co-operatives, <em>agreed among only themselves </em>with respect to the extent of the division of the function of processing between them or with respect to the price they would charge in the open market for the fruit and the by-products thereof processed and marketed by them?\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Even if the issue had been determined by the Supreme Court in <em>Winckler, </em>the admitted nature of Sunkist\u2019s present organizational make-up is such that the exemption should no longer be held properly to apply. The privilege to act together in \u201cexempt\u201d associations is conferred only upon \u201cpersons engaged in the production of agricultural products. * * 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 291. The plain import of the statutory language is that such an association must be composed <em>solely </em>of agricultural producers. Regardless of whether Sunkist was thus composed at the time of the <em>Winckler </em>decision in 1962, as the Supreme Court\u2019s order granting certiorari, supra, indicates, it is clear that the composition is no longer the same. In our case, it is conceded that the so-called \u201cagency associations,\u201d which comprise almost 15% of the membership of the Sunkist organization, are <em>not </em>growers or producers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority, in disregarding the significance of this factor, may have been influenced by the absence of decisions squarely holding that an association must be composed entirely of growers in order to qualify for the exemption. I point out that, while there are no decisions to that effect, there are none to the contrary. The opinions in a number of cases contain language which suggests the conclusion which I see to be plainly required by the statute\u2019s terms. Some of this language is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">\u201cThe persons to whom the Capper-Volstead Act applies are defined in \u00a7 1 as <em>producers of agricultural products * </em>* *. <em>They </em>are authorized to act together \u2018in collectively processing, preparing for market, handling, and marketing in interstate and foreign commerce\u2019 their products. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u201cThe right of <em>these agricultural producers </em>thus to unite * * * cannot be deemed to authorize any combination or conspiracy <em>with other persons </em>in restraint of trade that these producers may see fit to devise.\u201d United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 204-205, 60 S.Ct. 182, 84 L.Ed. 181, 191 (1939) (Emphasis supplied.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">\u201cThe chief defense set up by the Association was that, because of its being a cooperative composed <em>exclusively of dairy farmers, </em>\u00a7 6 of the Clayton Act and \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Capper-Volstead Act completely exempted and immunized it * * *. Accordingly the court dismissed the Sherman Act \u00a7 2 monopolization charge, where the Association was not alleged to have acted in combination with others, but upheld the right of the Government to go to trial on the Sherman Act \u00a7 3 and Clayton Act \u00a7 7 charges <em>because they involved alleged activities with </em>the owners of Embassy and other <em>persons who were not agricultural producers.\u201d </em>Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Producers Assn., Inc. v. United States, 362 U.S. 458, 461-462, 80 S.Ct. 847, 851, 4 L.Ed.2d 880 (1960) (Emphasis supplied.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201cThus, the full effect of \u00a7 6 is that a <em>group of farmers </em>acting together * * * cannot be restrained * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">\u201cThe Capper-Volstead Act * * * extended \u00a7 6 of the Clayton Act exemption to capital stock agricultural cooperatives * * *. The general philosophy of both was simply that <em>individual farmers </em>should be given * * * the same unified competitive advantage * * * available to businessmen * * * \u201d Id., 362 U.S. at 465-466, 80 S.Ct. at 853 (Emphasis supplied.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-14\">\u201c[0]ur decision in no way detracts from earlier cases holding agricultural cooperatives liable for conspiracies with outside groups, United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, [60 S.Ct. 182, 84 L.Ed. 181] * * * \u201d Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler <em>&amp; </em>Smith Citrus Products Co., 370 U.S. 19, 30, 82 S.Ct. 1130, 1136, 8 L.Ed.2d 305 (1962).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-16\">\u201cThe Court concludes that a combination between two or more agricultural cooperatives to fix prices of their products is exempt from the antitrust laws <em>provided that no other person that is not such an organization or a member of such a group is a part of the combination.\u201d </em>United States v. Maryland Cooperative Milk Pro., 145 F.Supp. 151, 155 (D.D.C.1956) (Emphasis supplied.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-17\">\u201cAlthough the Capper-Volstead Act * * * and the Clayton Act * * * give <em>some privileges to combinations </em>of agricultural <em>producers, a combination of producers and distributors </em>to eliminate competition and fix prices at successive stages in the marketing of an agricultural product <em>is not privileged.\u201d </em>United States v. Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Pro. Ass\u2019n, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 180, 179 F.2d 426, 428 (1949) (Emphasis supplied.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-18\">\u201cThe exemptions are accorded and immunities are conferred on agricultural cooperatives and their activities. <em>When they </em>step outside of their field and <em>conspire with persons who are not producers of agricultural commodities, </em>they are <em>beyond the scope of the exemptions.\" </em>United States v. Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Pro. Ass\u2019n, 167 F.Supp. 45, 51-52 (D.D.C.1958), modified, 362 U.S. 458, 80 S.Ct. 847, 4 L.Ed.2d 880 (1960) (Emphasis supplied.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-19\">The persistent theme of the foregoing excerpts is that a cooperative, even though it otherwise qualifies for exemption under the Capper-Volstead Act, forfeits its exemption when it combines with non-producers. If that is so, then it is logically inconsistent to hold that a cooperative, while composed in part of non-producers, may yet qualify for the exemption.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-5\">. In its footnote 18, the majority refers to a portion of a stipulation wherein the parties agreed that the agency associations furnished to Sunkist their \u201cfacilities and services on an independent contract basis * * The stipulation does <em>not </em>say that the associations were independent contractors. It recites that they were <em>\u201cmembers\u201d </em>of the Sunkist system. If the association were truly separate and independent, then that determination should be made, in the first instance, by the District Court. If they were not \u201cmembers\u201d of the Sunkist system, then, as I see it, the exemption of the Capper-Yolstead Act is irrelevant to the issue of the propriety of Sunkist\u2019s dealings with them.
