See Boruff v. United States, 5 Cir., 310 F.2d 918, Lyles v. United States, 5 Cir., 346 F.2d 789, and Miller v. United States, 5 Cir., 356 F.2d 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">We have carefully considered the briefs filed by appointed counsel and by appellant himself and find that there is no merit in the contention that Bunn himself was not seen selling the pills, the subject matter of the prosecution. There is ample evidence of his involvement in the actions of the other defendants. Neither do we find any error in the rulings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-17\">As to matters raised in this court for the first time, they are without any support in the record and can, therefore, not be noticed on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-18\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
