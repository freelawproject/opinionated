S. Atlantic Starling, against the vessel\u2019s corporate owner, based upon the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688, and general maritime law. Appellant\u2019s complaint contained counts alleging both negligence and unseaworthiness of the vessel. The district court, sitting without a jury, ruled against appellant in both respects. On this appeal, appellant complains only of the failure of the court to find the vessel unseaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-21\">The events which gave rise to the present legal action occurred during a voyage which began in Mobile, Alabama, in August, 1960. On December 29, 1960, while the vessel lay anchored in the harbor of Iloilo, Philippine Islands, appellant was stabbed in the abdomen by the officer\u2019s messman, Carlos Contreras. Appellant immediately drew a revolver which he carried on his person and fired upon the fleeing Contreras, who jumped overboard and swam ashore.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-22\">Concerning the circumstances leading up to the stabbing, the district court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-23\">During the voyage libellant [appellant] carried a loaded revolver on his person at all times, cursed the members of the crew frequently, served the crew inedible and inadequate meals, accused the crew of various illegal acts, withheld money from them at various ports, sailed on several occasions, .leaving crew members stranded in foreign ports, and had crew members arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>while in port on liberty, all without just cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">Libellant went so far as to physically abuse members of the crew and longshoremen brought aboard the vessel to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">Libellant was particularly abusive to the officer\u2019s mess man, Carlos Contreras, frequently cursing and abusing him and referring to him as a \u201cdog,\u201d \u201cChilean Red\u201d and \u201cCommunist dog.\u201d He cancelled Contreras\u2019 allotment and denied him liberty in port.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5v\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">The record is replete with examples of libellant\u2019s complete disregard for the rights and safety of the members of the crew and his frequent abuse and berating of the crew members in general, and Carlos Contreras in particular.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The district court felt that the above-enumerated circumstances precipitated the assault by Contreras. Based upon the evidence, the district court also concluded that Contreras was a \u201cquiet, peaceful, efficient seaman * * * [and] was equal in disposition and seamanship to the ordinary men in the calling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\"> A vessel owner may be held liable in damages for wilful injuries inflicted upon one member of the ship\u2019s crew by another member who is not equal in disposition and temperament to the \u201cordinary men in the calling.\u201d This liability is based upon the concept that the presence of \u201ca seaman with a wicked disposition, a propensity to evil conduct, [and] a savage and vicious nature\u201d renders the vessel unseaworthy. Boudoin v. Lykes Bros. S. S. Co., 1955, 348 U.S. 336, 75 S.Ct. 382, 99 L.Ed. 354; McConville v. Florida Towing Corp., 5th Cir. 1963, 321 F.2d 162; Jones v. Lykes Bros. S. S. Co., 2nd Cir. 1953, 204 F.2d 815, cert. den. 346 U.S. 857, 74 S.Ct. 72, 98 L.Ed. 370. Furthermore, the question of whether the assaulting crew member is \u201cnot equal in disposition and seamanship to the ordinary men in the calling\u201d is a question of fact. Clevenger v. Star Fish &amp; Oyster Co., 5th Cir. 1963, 325 F.2d 397, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Appellant, however, relying upon Clevenger v. Star Fish &amp; Oyster Co., supra, asserts that this Court should hold that as a matter of law the presence of Contreras rendered the S. S. Atlantic Starling unseaworthy. This we decline to do. The evidence in the record clearly substantiates the findings of the district court concerning the temperament of Contreras. This is particularly true since the judicial standard for a seaman\u2019s shipboard conduct is more liberal than that required of the ordinary man ashore. See Walters v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 2nd Cir. 1962, 309 F.2d 191, 193; Boorus v. West Coast Trans-Oceanic S.S. Line, 9th Cir. 1962, 299 F.2d 893; Jones v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co., supra. It is furthermore apparent from the evidence that appellant was, to a large degree, responsible for his own injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">The holding of this Court in the <em>Clev-enger </em>case in no way dictates a contrary result. The decision in that case was predicated upon the fact that the district court had applied erroneous criteria in deciding the unseaworthiness issue. Furthermore, the assault there involved was of a much more shocking nature. In that case, the libellant, Clevenger, was on deck unloading the vessel\u2019s catch. Whitaker, the first mate, was in the hold below. There was a delay in the unloading operation and the two men \u201cexchanged seamen\u2019s unpleasantries. Then, without a word of warning, Whitaker climbed a ladder to the deck at a time when Clev-enger was facing the other way and drove a \u2018devil\u2019s fork\u2019 deep into Clev-enger\u2019s back.\u201d 325 F.2d at 398. Unlike the present case, there was no evidence of prior provocation by the libellant. Also, it is evident that the Court in <em>Clevenger </em>was influenced by the fact that the attacker was the libellant\u2019s superior and was in a position of responsibility on the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Clearly, the holding of <em>Clevenger </em>is not dispositive of the present case. We feel that the district court correctly decided the entire matter and we therefore Affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
