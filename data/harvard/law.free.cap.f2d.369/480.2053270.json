(hereafter \u201cthe Company\u201d), the agreement by its terms to continue in effect until July 31, 1967. Paragraph 13 of the agreement establishes a grievance procedure and paragraph 16(a) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-19\">\u201cAny question of fact arising out of the interpretation of this agreement or the alleged violation of the express terms of this agreement which is not settled in accordance with the grievance procedure outlined in Step 5 shall at the request of either party.be submitted to a Board of Arbitration. The statement of the question to be arbitrated shall be mutually agreed upon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJf\">The other material provisions to the instant dispute are paragraph 62 which sets out the scale of wages agreed upon for the several classifications of employees covered by the agreement and paragraph 63 which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmP\">\u201cIf during the voyage, [an employee] is assigned to another rating higher than his own, he shall receive the higher rate of pay during such assignment and his hours shall become the hours of the new assignment. If he is assigned to a lower rating through no fault of his own, there shall be no reduction in wages or overtime rate for the remainder of the voyage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>his hours shall become the hours of the new assignment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In March 1965, the Association presented a grievance to the Company with respect to the reduction in assignment of employee Victor Mewa from fireman to wiper. Similar grievances were shortly thereafter filed with respect to reductions in assignment of employees Chester Bell and Wesley Ensign. The grievance procedure having been unsuccessfully exhausted, the Association requested arbitration and sought a meeting with the Company to agree upon the question to be arbitrated. Following two meetings between the parties, the Company by letter proposed the following statement of the question to be arbitrated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cDoes the term \u2018remainder of voyage\u2019 contained in Section 63 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement dated June 1, 1964 between [the Company and the Association] mean until the vessel reaches the first northern port of call, or does it mean until the crew member is discharged from the vessel?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVy4\">Rejecting this formulation as too narrow, the Association proposed by return letter the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cThe question is whether an agreement was arrived at, at a meeting held on October 20,1964, between [the Company and the Association], that once the company would promulgate and furnish a list of oilers and FWT\u2019s the men on the aforesaid list would be permanent oilers and FWT\u2019s even if assigned to a lower rating through no fault of their own and would continue to receive the higher rate of pay in accordance with the list.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The Company immediately advised the Association that it did not consider the question proposed by the Association to be arbitrable. Thereafter, the parties remained unable to agree upon a statement of the question to be arbitrated and the Association instituted the present action to compel arbitration under \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 \u00dc.S.C. \u00a7 185(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">In its complaint, the Association alleged that the Company refused to submit the Association\u2019s formulation of the issue to arbitration in violation of paragraph 16 of the collective bargaining agreement. Following the service of the Company\u2019s answer, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court denied the Company\u2019s motion and granted the Association\u2019s motion, finding that the real issue to be arbitrated was \u201cthe alleged failure of the [Company] to pay the agreed wage scale to three of its employees who are members of the union.\u201d We affirm, but will restate the question to be submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The Company argues on this appeal that the Association\u2019s claim is not arbitrable as it would require the arbitrator (actually a board of arbitration) to make specific findings of fact concerning an alleged agreement other than the collective bargaining agreement. In support of this contention, the Company relies on the language of the arbitration clause limiting its application to \u201cany question of fact arising out of the interpretation of <em>this </em>agreement or the alleged violation of the <em>express terms </em>of <em>this </em>agreement * * (emphasis supplied). Although the fact questions to be resolved by the arbitrator must be relevant to an interpretation of the agreement providing for arbitration and not some other or different agreement, the court cannot determine for the arbitrator in advance those facts which he may deem relevant to his task.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-15\">As the parties have been unable to agree upon a statement of the question to be arbitrated, we formulate the question as follows: What are the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>er wag\u00e9s for employees Mewa, Bell and Ensign under the employment and wage provisions of the collective bargaining agreement? Should the arbitrator in resolving this question make any general determinations not required for the resolution of this dispute, the scope of his decision may be reviewed in appropriate proceedings. See Carey v. General Electrict Co., 315 F.2d 499, 508 (2d Cir. 1963), cert. denied 377 U.S. 908, 84 S.Ct. 1162, 12 L.Ed.2d 179 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The Company also urges that even if the dispute is arbitrable, arbitration cannot be compelled in the absence of mutual agreement between the parties concerning the issue to be submitted. Such an interpretation of the last sentence of paragraph 16(a) would emasculate the arbitration clause. We interpret this procedural provision of paragraph 16(a) as requiring the parties to make a reasonable effort to agree on the statement of the issue to be submitted. As reasonable efforts were made and were unsuccessful, the court may state the question to be arbitrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\">. Section 301(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">\u201cSuits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
