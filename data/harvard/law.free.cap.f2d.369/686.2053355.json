The court below had jurisdiction (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545), and so do we (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-21\">This appeal raises two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-22\"> 1. The sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b740-24\">There is no merit to the contention that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. See Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Appellant urges that \u201ccertain statements\u201d made by him after his arrest were inadmissible because contrary to the rule announced in Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>that the statements made come within the <em>Miranda </em>rule, that rule was held retroactive only to persons whose trials began as of June 13, 1966 or thereafter (Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 730, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).) Appellant was tried on March 29, 1966. Hence the <em>Miranda </em>rule does not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">2. The examples</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Appellant objects to certain examples given by the trial judge (when instructing the jury), in explanation of the difference between \u201cactual\u201d and \u201cconstructive\u201d possession, and between \u201cjoint\u201d and \u201csole\u201d possession. Without stating why or in what manner the illustrations were erroneous, appellant urges they were \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cconfused\u201d and did \u201cmislead\u201d the jury. We do not agree. We think they were of aid to a proper consideration of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">We find appellant had a fair trial, and no error exists. We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
