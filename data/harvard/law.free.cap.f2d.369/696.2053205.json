He was struck successively by the cars of the two defendants, who were traveling in adjoining lanes, approximately abreast.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-23\">The case was fairly submitted to the jury. Those instructions requested by the plaintiff which were not given were improper and misleading. Otherwise, no exception was taken to the charge, which we now find neither misleading nor unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-24\"> It is plain that the jury, with abundant reason, founded its verdict on a finding of negligence on the plaintiff\u2019s part. In reaching that conclusion, in light of the many items of substantial damages, it could not have been misled or influenced by the statements in reference to the government\u2019s lien for hospital charges, about which the plaintiff now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
