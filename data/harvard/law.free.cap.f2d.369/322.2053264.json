The case is a companion to Bartie v. United States, W.D.La.1963, 216 F.Supp. 10, aff\u2019d, 5 Cir. 1964, 326 F.2d 754, cert. den\u2019d, 1964, 379 U.S. 852, 85 S.Ct. 98, 13 L.Ed.2d 55. In both cases, the plaintiffs alleged that the United States, through the Weather Bureau, was negligent in \u201cfailing to give adequate, clear, correct and proper warning of the nature, intensity, location, path, velocity and speed, and the existence of a tidal wave of Hurricane Audrey, as well as the correct time it would strike the Louisiana coast and particularly Cameron Parish, Louisiana\u201d; that this negligence caused the death of the plaintiff\u2019s decedents. <em>Bartie </em>was selected for the test case and was fully litigated on the merits. The district court in that ease found that the United States was not negligent; that the actions of the Weather Bureau were not the proximate cause of the deaths of the plaintiff\u2019s family; that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by the provisions in the Federal Tort Claims Act excluding claims based on misrepresentation or abuse of a discretionary function. This Court affirmed the district court on the negligence and proximate cause issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-18\">In this case, the plaintiffs rely on the record in <em>Bartie, </em>and on the only new evidence, the testimony of Mr. Louis Allen, an expert meteorologist from Washington, D. C. Mr. Allen stated that he did not think employees of the Weather Bureau were negligent in gathering information and forecasting the storm. He disagreed only with (1) the language of the various advisories and bulletins, which he felt should have been more specific in warning residents of the entire parish to evacuate immediately, (2) the failure of the Bureau to advise that high winds and tides would precede the eye of the hurricane, and (3) the Bureau\u2019s policy of issuing advisories at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>fixed times on the basis of extrapolated positions rather than at any time it had positive information on the storm\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The district judge considered Mr. Allen\u2019s testimony, but concluded that \u201call in all, the record fails to establish affirmatively the requisite negligence on the part of the Weather Bureau.\u201d Accordingly, he entered judgment for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">We have considered Mr. Allen\u2019s testimony and the record in <em>Bartie. </em>We cannot say, on the entire record, that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
