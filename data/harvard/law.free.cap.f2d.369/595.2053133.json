Rewis. The action was brought upon the allegations of malpractice by the medical officer on duty at an Air Force base hospital in New Mexico, whose examination of the fifteen month old child of the appellants did not disclose aspirin poisoning, which did, in fact, twenty hours later, cause the death of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-17\">On this appeal from the findings of fact and conclusions of law by the trial court, the testimony must be viewed, of course, most favorably to the Government. Viewed in this light, the testimony showed the following tragic story. On September 4, 1963, at 9:34 P.M., Sergeant Joseph Rewis, then on active duty at Walker Air Force Base in New Mexico, brought his fifteen months old daughter, Joann, to the base hospital for treatment. Dr. Robert H. Finley was the Medical Officer on duty. He testified that, upon bringing the child to the hospital, Sgt. Rewis reported to him that the child had been well earlier in the day but had that evening started vomiting and having diarrhea, had not eaten well at the evening meal, and had been blue about the lips. Dr. Finley observed the child as she sat on her father\u2019s lap and thereupon examined the ears with an otoscope, the throat with tongue blade and flashlight, and felt the sides of the neck. He looked specifically for any sign of blueness, but saw no evidence of any blueness or cy-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>anosis. He listened to the chest but found it clear. The back of the throat was red and inflamed, and there was hypertrophy of the lymphoid or tonsular tissue on the back of the throat, but no pus or exudate. The child was \u201cfussy and irritable as you would expect of a sick child at almost ten o\u2019clock at night.\u201d Dr. Finley entered on his record that the child was hyperventilated. Upon giving his testimony at the trial, he explained that in using this term he did so as a routine observation and not as an indication of any excessive or pathological condition. He testified that she was breathing somewhat rapidly and was very excited and frightened at being examined by a doctor at that hour. Dr. Finley asked Sgt. Rewis whether the child had had \u201cany drugs or medicine earlier so that I can take this into account.\u201d He testified that \u201che very definitely stated that she had not.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The question whether the child\u2019s father told Dr. Finley about the possibility of her having eaten aspirin is dealt with by the government only as it reflects on the standard of medical care given by the doctor. The government does not take the position that Rewis knew of it but did not report it as a basis for a defense of contributory negligence or any related defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Dr. Finley had seen Joann\u2019s mother on an emergency call approximately two hours previously and had found that she was suffering from a viral infection involving the respiratory tract, and he diagnosed the child\u2019s condition similarly. He prescribed a decongestant for the child, baby aspirin every four to six hours, clear liquid diet, benedril expectorant, cough syrup and Coca Cola syrup for the nausea. After Sgt. Rewis took the child home, it continued to be nauseated and unsettled and cried during most of the night. It became \u201cglassy-eyed\u201d and unresponsive. On the following day, Sgt. Rewis brought the child back to the hospital and by the time Dr. Andrew Ageloff, the base pediatrician, who was called in for consultation, examined the child at about noon, it appeared that the child was semi-comatose, ten to fifteen percent dehydrated, and breathing \u201cvery, very rapidly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Upon being asked whether it was possible that the child had taken any medicine, specifically aspirin Sgt. Rewis said that she could not have taken any medicine. However, when the doctor, after further examination was taking a blood specimen and explaining to Rewis that there was a strong possibility that the child had gotten a large quantity of aspirin, the father \u201csuddenly recalled\u201d that the child, on the day before, at about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, had been playing with a bottle containing 300 adult aspirin tablets. Immediately, extensive measures were taken to save the child, including intravenous therapy, catheterization into one of the larger veins of the leg for fluid administration, oxygen and moistening environment in an oxygen tent, and, when an artificial kidney was located at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, an attempt was made to fly the child there, but Joann died at 7:20 P.M. of that evening at a hospital en route.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Drs. Finley and Ageloff both testified that the examination and treatment by Dr. Finley the night before the child\u2019s death adhered to the standard of care for the area. Similar testimony was given in response to a hypothetical question by a civilian doctor, Thomas W. Collier, M.D., of Brunswick, Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Two doctors called on behalf of the appellants, initially, on the basis of a hypothetical question presented by appellants\u2019 counsel which included an assumption that Sgt. Rewis had told Dr. Finley of the suspicion of aspirin poisoning, both testified that the proper standard of care owed to the patient had not been observed by the medical officer. Upon cross examination, however, upon the assumption that the testimony that the medical officer knew of the aspirin ingestion by the child was not true, these two doctors modified their testimony to agree that, on the hypothesis presented by the Government, they could not fault the doctor for the manner in which he treated the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">With respect to the cause of death and the question whether adequate treatment at 9:45 P.M. on September 4th would have saved the child\u2019s life, the testimony was such as would have permitted the trial court to have found either way. Dr. Collier, without expressing his own opinion, testified that an article written by a Dr. Doame presented a graph from which he concluded that, with a blood-level of 87.2 milligrams, at 19y2 hours after ingestion, the maximum blood-level count would have been 170%, \u201cand he considers the maximum blood-level above 160 as being incompatible with life.\u201d Dr. Finley testified that, \u201cIf it turns out that this child had a blood test, which showed a blood sali-cylate level of 87.5 milligrams percent,\u201d he would not have \u201cbeen able to save the child.\u201d He stated, \u201cThis would indicate that a degree of poison, or an amount of poison had been in the body which would be incompatible with life. While you don\u2019t stop trying, it is recognized that this is a fatal level.\u201d Further, Dr. Finley testified, \u201cIt is my impression that she probably would have died, however, as I stated before, therapy would have gone on in the hopes that this would have been one of the cases that would be saved.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">\u201cQ. And there are many cases that have been saved? There are worse cases than this, as a matter of fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">A. Not with the initial blood sali-cylate as calculated back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">Q. Well, you have just said that she might have been saved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">A. She might have been, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">In Dr. Ageloff\u2019s testimony, taken by deposition and without cross examination, he stated: \u201cQuite likely, no matter what therapeutic measures were instituted at the time [of her examination by Dr. Finley] she <em>might </em>have died.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Dealing with this same question, Dr. Shepherd testified that after a period of four to seven hours, a child with aspirin would show definite symptoms. In response to the question whether this was because \u201cthe aspirin would have already gone to work to deteriorate the system,\u201d he stated, \u201cnot to deteriorate the system, but the effects of aspirin poisoning would have begun to occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">The trial court denied recovery on two bases. The first, as stated in the Court\u2019s opinion, was, \u201cThe plaintiffs cannot recover in the instant case because there was no evidence to show that the alleged malpractice was the cause of the child\u2019s illness and subsequent death. Watson v. United States, 5 Cir., 346 F.2d 52 (1965) * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">The Court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-14\">\u201cIn the Watson case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed a holding of the District Court that the United States was not liable for the alleged malpractice of a public health service doctor in the outpatient clinic of the public health service hospital of Savannah, Georgia. The action had alleged negligent failure of the doctor to diagnose a serious disease, asserting that the delay in treatment resulting from the failure to diagnose had caused the loss of the claimant\u2019s leg. The Court of Appeals held that where there was no showing to any reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the loss of the leg could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>have been avoided, there can be no recovery. In the case at bar, there was no <em>testimony </em>by any of the experts showing that the child <em>would have </em>recovered if the diagnosis of aspirin poisoning had been made immediately and treatment begun instantaneously.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The trial court erred in its construction of our decision in the <em>Watson </em>ease. What occurred in that case is that the trial court, deciding the case without a jury, made a finding of fact that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">\u201cThe only medical testimony adduced on the effect of the delay between February 24 and April 25 was that <em>there was no causal relationship </em>between the said delay and the failure of the bypass graft. The Court finds that had the bypass graft been attempted in February, 1960, there <em>would have been, </em>to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, <em>no greater likelihood of success </em>of this operation, nor would there have been, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, any benefit derived by plaintiffs through the use of conservative treatment, even if same were to have been initiated in February of 1960.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The trial court in that case noted that the only testimony before it was to the effect that there was no causal relationship between the delay and the injury. This Court, based on that finding, affirmed the judgment. Here, it is not completely clear, but it appears that the trial court based its judgment in this aspect of the case upon the failure of any witness to testify in effect that \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d the child\u2019s life could have been saved. No such specific testimony is required in a case of this kind. The Court, upon the record as a whole, including the testimony of all of the witnesses bearing on the subject, is, as the fact finder, required to determine for itself whether a proper diagnosis and treatment on the evening of September 23rd would likely have prevented the loss of this life. See Sentilles v. Inter-Caribbean Shipping Corporation, 361 U.S. 107, 80 S.Ct. 173, 4 L.Ed.2d 142. The trial court might well have found, in light of the evidence before it that if the aspirin poisoning had been discovered and treated on the evening of September 4th, there was a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the child\u2019s life would have been saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">As the second basis for entering judgment for the United States, the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">\u201cMoreover, the testimony and the finding on the death certificate concludes that death was caused by aspirin poisoning, revealing that the ingestion of the aspirin was the proximate cause of the injury and resulting death. Thus, there can be no recovery for the alleged malpractice on the part of the attending physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">It is not clear what is intended to be conveyed by this paragraph, for it is certain that the Government itself concedes that, notwithstanding the ingestion of the aspirin by the fifteen months old child, there could still be a recovery under the circumstances of this case if, in fact, the medical treatment received by her at the hands of the medical officer in charge fell below the required standards of care and such failure caused the child\u2019s death. The Court\u2019s language cannot, of course, stand for the proposition that the fifteen months old child cannot recover because of contributory negligence, or any similar doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Finally, the trial court determined that there was no negligence on the part of the admitting doctor. The Court found that Dr. Finley was not advised as to the possibility of the child\u2019s having ingested aspirin in the afternoon, and the' Court found that \u201cshe was determined by the doctor to be crying and fussing and breathing rather rapidly.\u201d Other than the finding that the child was crying, a finding discussed later, the Court\u2019s findings were in accord with the statement of facts which we have made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">In considering whether the trial court\u2019s finding that there was no negligence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the part of the admitting doctor is to be affirmed, it is necessary that we consider the basis on which the trial court arrived at this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"AGu\">Dr. Shepherd, the only Board-certified pediatrician who testified in the case, gave a very positive and lucid explanation as to why, when a child of tender years, unable to speak for itself, appears before a doctor in a condition of hyperventilation or overbreathing, it is absolutely essential that the cause of such over-breathing be ascertained, because of the very strong possibility that aspirin poisoning may be its cause. Based on the hypothetical question presented to him by appellant\u2019s counsel, Dr. Shepherd clearly and plainly expressed the opinion that inadequate tests were made of Joann by the medical officer in charge. When his attention, however, was called to the hypothesis of the government, Dr. Shepherd\u2019s opinion was considerably modified. However, there were two assumptions made in the government\u2019s hypothesis that bear no support in the record. Dr. Shepherd finally said that if the examining physician had a reasonable basis for concluding that the overbreathing was attributed to a condition he found to be present, there would be no legal duty upon him to make any further tests of the kind that would have disclosed the presence of aspirin. He made it very plain, however, that this opinion was based upon two specific assumptions. One of them was that the examining physician observed the child while sitting calmly in her father\u2019s lap and breathing normally, followed thereafter with the excitement of an examination and <em>crying </em>as the result of which she appeared to be overbreathing. In his answer to the hypothetical question put by the government, which embodied all of the assumptions most favorable to the United States, including the statement, \u201cshe was crying and fussing and breathing rather rapidly\u201d, Dr. Shepherd said, \u201cIn my opinion, this doctor did not look into this problem as he should have looked into it on a fifteen month old child. Despite what you have told me, it is my opinion that the child, or any child, that is overbreathing is in difficulty. It is a danger warning.\u201d Then the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: If the doctor asked the father specific question about the baby getting any aspirin, and the father said, no, it did not, then what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">TEE WITNESS: Judge, if I could elaborate a little.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">THE WITNESS: Even if you ask him it is frequently true that we rarely with children who can\u2019t talk, and with parents who often don\u2019t see the child get poison we must always got to be alert to poison, [sic] We very frequently fail to get any history of any ingested poison and we very frequently turn up with children who are poisoned without a history, and this is one of the basic reasons, this is one of the keys as to why I feel this way, because it is mandatory in the treatment of children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I would just like to make a fair answer to you that in my opinion yes, he should have gone further because it is my opinion that this is a real danger signal if the child is overbreathing and I don\u2019t think it is the same from overbreathing from crying and overbreathing on a pathological basis and it has to be differentiated and this was not done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-12\">\u201cQ. Now, could overbreathing be caused by the lateness of the hour, by a virus, or by the fear of a doctor, would there be overbreathing there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"anf-dedup-0\">\u201cA. There could be overbreathing from fear in the process of crying and excitation, but as I have just said it is mandatory in a child who is over-breathing because the failure to recognize this is so very important, it is mandatory to separate this overbreath-ing from just crying and fussing and excitement, overbreathing on a pathological basis. This has got to be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-13\">\u201cQ. Therefore, every patient who comes to you with any form of over-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>breathing you immediately treat it for aspirin poisoning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201cQ. Excuse me. That was the basis of my hypothetical. I am asking you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"App\">\u201cA. I find out why they are over-breathing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u201cQ. And how do you find this out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE0e\">\u201cA. It is necessary \u2014 you don\u2019t stop until you find this out and you put them in the hospital, if necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\u201cQ. But how do you find this out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">\u201cA. You put them in the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">\u201cQ. Every child that is overbreathing in your office you put them in the hospital ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">\u201cA. If you want me to answer the question, I will be glad to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-12\">\u201cQ. Excuse me. I apologize for interrupting you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-13\">\u201cA. All right. You keep checking until you find to your satisfaction the cause of overbreathing. If this involves lab tests, you do lab tests. If you think necessary, if it involves X-rays of the chest, you do X-rays of the chest. If it involves hospitalization or consultant you do this. This has got to be done in a child who has respiratory difficulty, or a child who is overbreathing. Yes, because this in an infant fifteen months old is life and death. This is different from adults. Children get info acidosis. Their electrolytes get out of balance. They are in trouble when they are overbreathing, if it is on an electrolyte basis. This has got to be ruled out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">Thereafter, after presenting to Dr. Shepherd the entire hypothetical question which included the statement that the child was crying, he asked for the witness\u2019s opinion again. Thereupon, Dr. Shepherd answered and said, \u201cI qualify the answer, yes, by just one question, and that is, one supposition. If he felt that this breathing was due \u2014 this is my only problem in all that we have had in our discussion is this breathing, because I feel that this is the key to the whole thing, but if this breathing, in his mind, is due to nothing more that excitation in this hypothetical case, my answer to your question is yes.\u201d [That is, that proper medical standards were followed.]</p>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">Counsel for the Government asked Dr. Shepherd, \u201cWould it be correct to say that if a child is overbreathing, if a child is <em>crying vigorously, </em>you cannot determine if it is hyperventilating?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">To which Dr. Shepherd answered: \u201cAt the time it\u2019s crying ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-19\">\u201cQ. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">\u201cA. It would be very difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">Then, again, approaching the end of the examination, Dr. Shepherd said, \u201cHis overbreathing is from another point, and this is typical of aspirin, and with a negative chest and overbreathing child, you are obligated to find out why the child is overbreathing because he can die with aspirin poisoning, and this is where we disagree, and if you tell me that the doctor says that the child was overbreathing to the best of his judgment, because observing him sitting quietly, as he must have observed in his father\u2019s lap, he was breathing normally without stress, but <em>overbreathing with stress, </em>yes, I will say he absolutely was to the best of his judgment.\u201d The doctor then stated, \u201cYou stated in your hypothetical that he was sitting there quietly when he was not excited? This is the only point of contention that we have, Mr. Clark, I think.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACf\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think you have covered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-22\">* * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-23\">Now, the point of all of this discussion is that no where in the record is there any evidence that Joann was crying, much less \u201ccrying vigorously\u201d, nor was there any evidence that at any time that she was in Dr. Finley\u2019s presence when she was sitting quietly, if she did at any time sit quietly, her breathing was normal and calm, as is assumed by Dr. Shepherd in his answer to Government counsel\u2019s question, or that her breathing was any different under the examination procedures than when she was merely sitting in her father\u2019s lap. It seems clear that with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>out these qualifying assumptions in the Government\u2019s hypothetical case, Dr. Shepherd\u2019s opinion clearly states that there was a failure to pursue proper medical standards in not ascertaining the true cause of the hyperventilation. In other words, Dr. Shepherd\u2019s testimony would be unchanged from the strongest view expressed by him were it not for the improper assumptions, first, that' vigorous crying made it difficult to ascertain the real cause of overbreathing and, second, that the child was observed by the doctor breathing naturally and calmly while not being examined and then breathing rapidly when subjected to the excitement of the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The significance of this is further shown by the fact that the trial court, in its findings of fact, stated that Joann was \u201ccrying and fussing and breathing rather rapidly\u201d, indicating that this aspect of Dr. Shepherd\u2019s testimony may well have been a decisive element of the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">There is another rather slight error in the findings of the trial court, not \u2022supported by the testimony in the record and that is a statement that the child\u2019s father \u201calso stated that she had been blue in one of her lips.\u201d The actual testimony by Dr. Finley is that Sgt. Rewis \u201cstated that he had brought her in at this time because she had suddenly turned blue around the lips and this caused him concern.\u201d A considerable colloquy occurred at the trial in which appellants\u2019 counsel objected to that part of the question by Government counsel in which he embodied the language later used by the Court that the child \u201chad been blue in one of her lips.\u201d In light of the involved discussion by all of the experts with respect to the significance of \u201cblueness\u201d or \u201ccyanosis\u201d as an indicator of aspirin poisoning, we think this inaccurate finding of the facts is of more than passing concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">There is no substantial difference between the appellants and the United States as to the standards of medical care required in such a situation as is here present. The expert witnesses\u2019 opinions were recognized by both parties to be the proper basis for the trial court\u2019s determination whether the correct standard of care had been given. These opinions were, except for Dr. Finley\u2019s testimony and except for Dr. Ageloff\u2019s deposition, based on hypothetical questions. Of course, in order for the opinion to have any value it must be based on assumptions which the trier of the facts can find to have been proved. See United States v. Cooper, 5 Cir., 277 F.2d 857; International Paper Co. v. United States, 5 Cir., 227 F.2d 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The hypothetical question put by the government to each of the witnesses who gave an opinion as to the propriety of Dr. Finley\u2019s procedures, contained the improper assumption that the child was \u201ccrying and fussing.\u201d In view of the degree of importance attached by Dr. Shepherd to the need for isolating the cause for overbreathing, and in view of his positive testimony that it would be very difficult to test for overbreathing, if the child was crying, we think this may have led to the trial court\u2019s accepting Dr. Shepherd\u2019s qualified opinion based on the improper assumptions, rather than on his original opinion, which eliminated these assumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">So, too, did the hypothesis upon which Dr. Shepherd finally expressed an opinion favorable to the Government include the assumption that Dr. Finley had observed Joann sitting quietly on her father\u2019s lap breathing normally, and thereafter, while being examined, breathing faster, from which Dr. Shepherd concluded this might be a permissible basis for the examining physician to conclude that he had identified the source of the overbreathing. The record does not support any such assumption. There was no proof that Joann was at any time, while in Dr. Finley\u2019s presence, breathing in a normal fashion. The proof is that she was breathing rather rapidly, sufficient for Dr. Finley to have entered a notation on the record of examination that she was suffering from hyperventilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Of course, in making its findings, the trial court could completely disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the testimony of any one or more of the experts who testified for either party. However, since the opinion does not discuss the relative contentions made by the parties with respect to the expert testimony but rather seems to place the decision upon the failure to establish causation and upon the theory that the fact of the ingestion of the aspirin alone exculpated the government whatever the degree of performance by the examining doctor, we are unable to determine to what extent the improper assumptions of fact may have affected the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"> The ultimate burden of proof is, of course, on the plaintiff, who, to recover, must show both failure to give proper diagnosis or treatment and proximate causation. However, plaintiff\u2019s burden of going forward with evidence as to causation is satisfied and a prima facie case on causation is made out once he introduces evidence that the condition was one which would respond to medical treatment seasonably given and that there was a reasonable medical probability that had treatment been seasonably given the child would have continued to live. The question of reasonable medical probability is, of course, normally the subject of expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">If plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case is made out, then the burden shifts to the government to refute the evidence of reasonable medical probability that the child would have continued to live. In making out the prima facie case and in discharging the ultimate burden the plaintiff need not exclude every possible hypothesis that the child would have died but need only establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence the reasonable medical probability that it would not have died.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">While we think this case requires expert opinion on the issue of causation, the trial court may also consider a fundamental inconsistency in the government\u2019s position which, it appears to us, was not satisfactorily explained either in the district court or on this appeal. On the one hand the government claims the child\u2019s condition when she was first examined by the admitting doctor several hours after ingesting aspirin was not sufficiently far from normal that the doctor could be found to have failed to meet a proper standard of care in not recognizing and diagnosing her condition; but on the other hand it says the child\u2019s condition at that time had reached such stage that there was no reasonable medical probability of her continuing to live. In another trial perhaps the expert testimony can shed clearer light on whether it is possible for an infant of this age to be beyond a reasonable probability of salvation by medical help but at the same time display no such objective and discernible symptoms as would disclose to the examining physician, or even alert him, to the existence of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">In order that the court may apply the correct standard of evidence relating to causation, and in order that the court may reconsider its judgment in light of our decision that the finding that the child was crying was clearly erroneous, and that at least one expert opinion was based on several unproved facts, the judgment is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for a new trial. Upon such trial the parties should be permitted to introduce new evidence or rely on the present record to the extent they wish to do so. However, the trial court should give serious consideration to the contention of the appellant that the government should not be permitted to use the deposition testimony of Dr. Ageloff if he is still available as an Air Force medical officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">. Sgt. Rewis testified that when he took the child to the base hospital and when he was giving the history to the doctor, he told Dr. Finley Joann might have had access to some aspirin in the afternoon. However, the trial court discredited this testimony in view of the contrary testimony by the doctor. The resolution of the conflict is certainly not only permissible, but appears to us to be correct for it can hardly be conceived that, if given this clue, the doctor would have treated the patient as he did.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
