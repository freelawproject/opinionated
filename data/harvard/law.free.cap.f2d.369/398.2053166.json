This appeal is from Chief Judge Becker\u2019s order dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-22\">On April 17, 1951 appellant entered pleas of <em>nolo contendere </em>in three cases, each containing multiple counts, and was sentenced to a total term of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. He was released from prison on October 21, 1960 but retaken into custody as a mandatory release violator on September 24,1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-23\">The sole issue here is whether under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, appellant is entitled to have the time of his mandatory or conditional release treated as time served on his sentence. Appellant states the issue as: \u201cDoes time spent on parole or mandatory release count on a prisoner\u2019s sentence ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-24\">The answer to appellant\u2019s question is no. It is settled law in this circuit that a violator of a conditional release or parole has no such entitlement. Howard v. United States, 274 F.2d 100 (8th Cir. 1960); Hedrick v. Steele, 187 F.2d 261 (8th Cir. 1951). These two cases discuss the applicable constitutional provisions and statutes and resolve the issue squarely contrary to appellant\u2019s contentions here.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-25\">The District Court\u2019s order overruling the petition for habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
