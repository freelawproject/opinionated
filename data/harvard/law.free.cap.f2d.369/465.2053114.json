He was sentenced to two years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently, and also fined $2,000 on Counts 1 and 2. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Richman questions the sufficiency of the indictments and the sufficiency of proof of a fraudulent scheme. He also claims error in the instructions, in rulings on evidence and in limitation of cross-examination of government witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">Count 1 charged generally Richman\u2019s scheme to defraud through solicitation of advertisements in the <em>Labor Union Newspaper </em>by wilful false representations. It charged that to induce persons to believe the newspaper was an Indiana union paper located and published in Indiana, Richman engaged an answering service in Indianapolis to remail solicitations prepared by him in Chicago and mailed in bulk to the answering service for deposit in the mails in Indianapolis, that he engaged the answering service to accept letters mailed to that address and forward them unopened to him in Chicago, that he listed the <em>Labor Union Newspaper </em>in the Indianapolis telephone directory with the address of the answering service, that he knowingly used deceptive and misleading solicitations designed to induce persons to believe that the ads solicited would be published in an Indiana union newspaper and were renewals of ads previously placed in the <em>Labor Union Newspaper, </em>and that the scheme began June 9, 1951, and continued until the return of the indictment on December 18, 1964. All of these charges in the first count are incorporated by reference in each of the remaining twenty counts involved in the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">Count 1 specifically charges that \u201cfor the purpose of executing the aforesaid scheme\u201d on April 20, 1964, Richman caused two parcels to be delivered by mail to the answering service. Counts 7 and 13 each charge that on other particular dates Richman used the mails in sending parcels of solicitations to the answering service. The remaining counts charge that \u201cfor the purpose of executing aforesaid scheme,\u201d Richman caused letters to various individuals \u201cto be placed in * * * authorized depositories] for mail matter at Indianapolis,\u201d which letters contained solicitations for advertisements in the <em>Labor Union Newspaper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">Section 1341 provides that the offense is committed when \u201cfor the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do\u201d a person \u201c[1] places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered <em>by the Post Office Department, </em>or [2] takes or receives therefrom, any such matter or thing, or [3] <em>knowingly </em>causes to be delivered by mail * * * any such matter or thing * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">The language of the indictment indicates that Counts 1, 7 and 13 charge the third of these offenses and that the remaining counts charge the first. The first issue in this case is whether the phrase \u201cfor the purpose of executing aforesaid scheme\u201d in Counts 1, 7 and 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>is sufficient to charge the defendant with \u201cknowingly\u201d causing the items to be delivered by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">An indictment must contain all the elements of the offense charged but it is not insufficient for imperfections of form which are not prejudicial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 2, 7(c); United States v. Debrow, 346 U.S. 374, 376, 74 S.Ct. 113, 98 L.Ed. 92 (1953). The test of sufficiency is whether it informs the defendant of what charges he must meet and protects him against double jeopardy. Hagner v. United States, 285 U.S. 427, 431, 52 S.Ct. 417, 76 L.Ed. 861 (1932). The exact statutory words need not be used. Glenn v. United States, 303 F.2d 536, 538 (5th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, Belvin v. United States, 372 U.S. 922, 83 S.Ct. 737, 9 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We hold that the element of knowledge was sufficiently charged in Counts 1, 7 and 13 by the words \u201cfor the purpose of executing\u201d the scheme. The scheme to which this phrase refers was charged in Count 1 and incorporated by reference in Counts 7 and 13. The scheme charged \u201creasonably contemplated\u201d the use of the mails as the means of transporting the parcels named in Counts 1, 7 and 13. Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8-9, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954); Hart v. United States, 112 F.2d 128, 131 (5th Cir.), petition for cert. dismissed on motion of petitioner, 311 U.S. 722, 61 S.Ct. 6, 85 L.Ed. 471 (1940). Richman was charged with engaging the answering service to <em>rermil </em>solicitation letters prepared for mailing at his direction and mailed in bulk to the answering service, all in pursuance of his fraudulent scheme. Furthermore, as the Fifth Circuit has held, \u201cit is impossible for a person to cause an event <em>for a specific purpose </em>without knowledge of what he is doing.\u201d (Italics in original.) Glenn v. United States, 303 F.2d at 538-539.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Richman attacks the remaining counts of the indictment because they failed to contain the words \u201cto be sent or delivered by the Post Office Department.\u201d We see no merit in this contention because the scheme charged in Count 1 and incorporated by reference in these counts explicitly included the deposit of the stamped and addressed solicitation letters \u201cin the United States Mails.\u201d Olsen v. United States, 287 F. 85, 90 (2d Cir. 1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">We think the evidence favorable to the government, Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), amply justified the jury\u2019s inference that Richman devised the scheme with the intention of fraudulently inducing persons to believe that the paper was an Indiana union paper published in Indianapolis. Language which would have impeded the execution of the scheme was eliminated from the masthead of the Indiana edition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The solicitations themselves bore the tell-tale return address of the answering service in Indianapolis and instructed the recipient to return the \u201ccopy sheet\u201d promptly, \u201cc/o Copy Room.\u201d The details of the arrangement with 'the answering service disclosed by the evidence clearly justified the inference that the arrangement was for a fraudulent purpose in inducing belief that the paper was an \u201cIndianapolis and Indiana Union newspaper\u201d as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Richman relies on United States v. Kram, 247 F.2d 830 (3d Cir. 1957), to support his position on the issue of insufficient evidence. <em>Kram </em>is distinguished because the limited charge of intent there (that the solicitation was so drawn as to be intentionally misleading) precluded consideration of facts other than the misleading character of the solicitation itself. Here neither the charge nor the proof of fraudulent intent is confined to the material itself, and the proof of intent did not fall \u201cfar short\u201d as in <em>Kram.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Richman also claims error in the admission of evidence, in limitation of cross-examination and in the instruction of the jury. No objection was made to testimony of the effect on the intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>victims of the solicitations received. The point is therefore waived here, and there is no \u201cplain error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Over objection, the court admitted a postal inspector\u2019s testimony as to complaints received of earlier solicitations by defendant in Pennsylvania and testimony as to his investigation and letter to and response from Richman with respect to the solicitations. The court admitted the testimony on the issue of Richman\u2019s knowledge or intent and instructed the jury that the testimony was to be considered by the jury for \u201cno other purpose.\u201d We see no prejudicial error in the overruling of objections to admissibility of this testimony for the limited purpose stated in the instruction. Nor was there any prejudicial limitation of cross-examination. Complaints about instructions are waived because no objection was made to them at the trial, and no showing is made in this court that plain error was committed in any instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-12\">. \u201cOfficial publication of the Ohio Building and Construction Trades Oouncilt</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
