The record shows that appellant has appealed to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals from his state conviction and that the appeal is pending and undecided. In such circumstances, he has not exhausted his available remedies-in state courts. Lee v. State of Kansas, 10 Cir., 346 F.2d 48. The various claims that he makes can and should be decided in the Oklahoma courts. Nothing is presented to show that the state remedy is ineffective or inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
