Judgments for plaintiffs, and defendant brings error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Aq3\">Reversed, with directions.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-4\">Anna Dorsey brought an action to recover $20,000 damages for, malicious prosecution, and the jury rendered a verdict in her favor for $2,500. Her husband, Joseph Dorsey, brought an action for damages for loss of his wife\u2019s services, alleged to have been the result of the malicious prosecution, and the jury gave him a verdict for $250. We shall pass certain preliminary history in respect of the pleadings, and commence the statement of the case with the complaint in the Anna Dorsey action, which read in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-5\">\u201cSecond. That on or about the 4th day of October, 1920, the defendant, maliciously and without reasonable or probable cause therefor, charged plaintiff before Hon. Arthur A. Palmer, a justice of the peace in and for the village of Bernardsville, town of Bernards, in the state of New Jersey, with the crime of grand larceny, in having stolen certain articles of jewelry, and thereupon procured a warrant to be issued by the said justice for the arrest of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-6\">\u201cThird. That thereafter, and on or about the said 4th day of October, 1920, plaintiff was arrested upon said warrant, and imprisoned and detained for several hours in the police station in the village of Bernardsville, state of New Jersey, and there compelled to be thoroughly searched by the police authorities of said town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-7\">\u201cFourth. That immediately thereafter, and on the said 4th day of October, 1920, and at the instance and under the direction of the' defendant, plaintiff herein was discharged, and said prosecution was thereby wholly terminated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-8\">\u201cFifth. That the plaintiff was entirely innocent of the charge made against her by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-9\">\u201cSixth. That there was no reason or cause to believe that plaintiff was guilty of the charge made against her by defendant, and that defendant\u2019s conduct was malicious, wholly unwarranted, and without probable cause, or foundation in fact, and that he knew plaintiff to be innocent of said charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-10\">There was no allegation that there was a judicial hearing or determination of the alleged prosecution, or that plaintiff was discharged by a court of competent jurisdiction. In this respect, the complaint of Joseph Dorsey was similar. Motion was made at the opening of the case, and before a jury was impaneled, to dismiss the complaint. The motion was denied, and exception duly taken. Motions seasonably made later during the progress of the trial were denied and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-11\">Plaintiff Anna Dorsey was a nurse, in defendant\u2019s employ at his home in Bernardsville, N. J. On September 26, 1920, defendant\u2019s wife questioned plaintiff about the loss of certain jewelry. The following day, plaintiff was asked to go in a room where there were present other servants, Stryker, chief of police, and a police officer named McGee. Plaintiff was asked whether She was willing to \u201chave your things searched,\u201d and, having stated her willingness, her \u201cbelongings\u201d were searched, and the lost property was not found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-12\">Under date of October 4, 1920, defendant subscribed and swore to an affidavit before Arthur Palmer, recorder of the recorder\u2019s court in Bernardsville. This affidavit read, in part, \u201cCriminal Complaint, State of New Jersey. Joseph Larocque * * * upon his oath complains that on or about the 26th of September, in the year 1920, 15 * * one Anna Dorsey did unlawfully and feloniously take and carry away with intent to steal\u201d certain jewels (describing them), and \u201ctherefore he prays that the said Anna Dorsey be apprehended and held to answer the said complaint and dealt with as law and justice may require.\u201d Defendant, who was called as a witness by plaintiff, stated that his purpose in making this affidavit was that the \u201cchief of police * * * represented it to be my duty as a householder in tliat community, there having been a number of other inside robberies \u2014 as he exx&gt;ressed it, inside jobs \u2014 among my neighbors, to take a stand and help the police in finally tracking down these cases.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>No warrant was Issued at that time or on that day. Plaintiff was driven by defendant\u2019s chauffeur to the railroad station, pursuant to the instructions of defendant\u2019s wife to take defendant\u2019s child to school. In the railroad station, Stryker, chief of police, accompanied by McGee, arrested plaintiff. She was then driven to Miss Lillian Coe\u2019s, the overseer of the poor, where, pursuant to Stryker\u2019s instructions, she was searched by Miss Coe. She was then taken to defendant\u2019s house, where the chief of police searched all plaintiff\u2019s \u201cbelongings,\u201d and then told plaintiff that she \u201cwas eliminated from the case.\u201d The chief of police then left, and .plaintiff was not subjected \u201cto' any further restraint or confinement on account of this case.\u201d According to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, there was no evidence that defendant took any part in the release of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-4\">Palmer, the recorder, called by plaintiff, testified that the chief of police said to him that he needed a warrant, and that he \u201cwanted to have one in readiness, so that, if he needed it, he could use it, .and I find I have issued the warrant here, but it has never been handed to the officer. It was never taken out of my office, out of my file. It was never used.\u201d Asked whether It was not issued, Palmer answered, \u201cYes, it is, under my notion,\u201d but \u201cnever delivered for service. * * * The chief of police never asked for it.\u201d It then appeared that the warrant was made out on October 5, 1920; i. e., the day after plaintiff had been taken in custody by the chief of police and let go by him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-5\">Choate, Larocque &amp; Mitchell, of New York City (William R. Bayes and Joseph Larocque, both of New York City, of counsel), for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-6\">Arthur M.

In false arrest, malice is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In malicious prosecution, the arrest may be lawfully or unlawfully made, but the prosecution must have been begun and favorably ended, and there must be both malice and want of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Malice may be actual or malice in law; i. e., inferred from the facts and inferences deducible therefrom. If there be want of probable cause, malice may be inferred; but, per contra, even if malice is present, want of probable cause may not be inferred therefrom. Brown v. Selfridge, 224 U. S. 189, 32 Sup. Ct. 444, 56 L. Ed. 727. The trial judge seemed to be of the opinion that either malice or probable cause would suffice. This was error, but possibly was cured by the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"AqPx\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> But the uncured errors committed were much more vital. There never was a beginning of the prosecution. The mere filing of a complaint or affidavit is not enough. This must be followed by a prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> What Stryker did may or' may not have been a false arrest, but, if what he did was' an arrest, it was made without a warrant, and the arrest was in no sense the beginning of a prosecution by defendant. Cooper v. Armour (C. C.) 42 Fed. 215, 8 L. R. A. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> Further, in actions of this character, it must be alleged and proved that there was a termination of the prosecution by plaintiffs acquittal or legal discharge, or at least by such conduct of a defendant as brought about a discharge. There is no proof whatever in this case that defendant took any part in the release of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> There was no arraignment or hearing of any land before a court of competent jurisdiction. In brief, so far-as affects defendant, there never was a prosecution, malicious or otherwise. Wheeler v. Nesbitt et al., 24 How. 544, 16 L. Ed. 765; Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 25 L. Ed. 116; Whitten v. Bennett, 86 Fed. 405, 30 C. C. A. 140; Kline v. Hibbard, 80 Hun, 50, 29 N. Y. Supp. 807, affirmed 155 N. Y. 679, 49 N. E. 1099; Halberstadt v. New York Life Insurance Co., 194 N. Y. 1, 86 N. E. 801, 21 L. R. A. (N. S.) 293, 16 Ann. Cas. 1102; Ingram v. Root, 51 Hun, 238, 3 N. Y. Supp. 858; Apgar v. Woolston, 43 N. J. Law, 57; Thomason v. De Mott, 18 How. Prac. 529; Ragsdale v. Bowles, 16 Ala. 62; Carpenter v. Nutter, 127 Cal. 61, 59 Pac. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">In view of the foregoing, we deem it unnecessary to discuss other assignments of error, and in view of the undisputed facts it is plain that, on a new trial, plaintiff cannot recover. While, therefore, we have no power to dismiss the complaints (Slocum v. New York Life Ins. Co., 228 U. S. 364, 33 Sup. Ct. 523, 57 L. Ed. 879, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 1029), the judgments are reversed, with the direction to the District Court upon the new trial to dismiss the complaints for failure to allege the termination of the alleged malicious prosecution, as pointed out supra.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
