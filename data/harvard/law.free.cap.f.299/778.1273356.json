Without his testimony there could have been no conviction. It is unnecessary to detail the facts. Suffice it' to say that on a careful examination of the record we are not so clearly satisfied as to defendant\u2019s guilt that we may dismiss, as insufficient for reversal, errors urged on behalf of York.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Though the time to be allowed counsel for argument is within the discretion of the court, and in Wagman v. U. S., 269 Fed. 568, we held that a limitation in that trial before the argument began to 15 minutes (the time actually used was 22 minutes and no request for extension was made) would not be deemed an abuse of such discretion, the limitation in the instant case to 20 minutes over the protest of counsel, both before the argument and at the end of. exactly 20 minutes, and the refusal to extend the time to enable him fairly to cover the points he wished to urge, must,' in the circumstances, be deemed such an abuse. The evidence was circumstantial. The result depended in largest measure upon the jury\u2019s determination as to veracity between defendant and Boatman. The trial had taken a part\u2019at least of each of two days. There were important differences of recollection between court and counsel as to certain testimony. The evidence covered 233 pages when transcribed. The trial judge, though free to express his own views, both as to the facts and as to the credibility of the several witnesses, in his charge to the jury, should be the more careful, before expressing views adverse to defendant\u2019s credibility, to give defendant\u2019s counsel sufficient time fully to argue in favor thereof, especially as \u00abagainst one claiming to be an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Furthermore, just because he believes the accomplice, the trial judge should restrain any tendency to become an active participant in the trial; without unnecessary interference he should permit each side fully to present its case. The complaint here made of frequent interruptions in the cross-examination of the confessed criminal, Boatman, and of unsought protection of Boatman, lest he further incriminate himself on matters deemed important to the defense, seems to be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Boatman\u2019s testimony of defendant\u2019s participation in other similar offenses was received without objection; indeed, objection would have been unavailable, as it was relevant to defendant\u2019s intent. Defendant denied the charges made. Therefore, if the jury believed them to be true, they would necessarily believe that defendant, in denying them, failed to tell the truth. So believing, they would be justified in discrediting other parts of his testimony. While specific acts of wrongdoing are not of themselves admissible to rebut evidence of good reputation, or to discredit defendant as a truthful, witness, we cannot, in the circumstances of this case, deem the court\u2019s charge erroneous that, if the jury believed defendant guilty of these other offenses, they might take that into consideration in determining his credibility. ^</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Believing that for the errors noted justice requires that defendant be given a new trial, we note by way of caution our disagreement with court and counsel in their view that a verdict of guilty on one of the two counts is inconsistent with a similar verdict on the other. One may be guilty of interstate transportation of a stolen automobile, and also of selling, storing, or concealing it, knowing it to have been stolen and transported in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
