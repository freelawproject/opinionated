Cresson, from a directed verdict in favor of the defendant in a libel suit. The libel is based on matter (reproduced in footnote 1), published by the defendant\u2019s newspaper, purporting to be an account of the majority report of the committee appointed by Congress to investigate the escape of Grover Cleveland Bergdoll, a draft evader. The defense is that the matter complained of is, privileged in that it is a publication made in good faith and without malice, of a fair, impartial and correct report of a document issued by a committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress. The defendant also points out in its pleading that it published in the same newspaper article, following in close juxtaposition to the article complained of, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201cColonel Hunt was commandant at Governor\u2019s Island, where Bergdoll was imprisoned prior to liis escape. Colonel Cresson was the officer who prosecuted Colonel Hunt in the court-martial proceedings following Bergdoll\u2019s escape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">\u201c \u2018While there are many who participated in the conspiracy leading to Berg-doll\u2019s escape and the acquittal of those who brought it about, there are three who are infinitely more culpable than the rest. Those three are General An-sell, Colonel Hunt and Colonel C. C. Cresson\u2019 the majority declared.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Plaintiff contends that, on a sound interpretation, the congressional report does not charge him with participation in a conspiracy to aid Bergdoll in his escape to Germany, but only with a failure properly to prosecute Colonel Hunt, one of the defendants charged before a court-martial with neglect of duty resulting in Bergdoll\u2019s escape, and that defendant\u2019s publication, in reporting that he was charged with participation in such conspiracy, failed to give an accurate or even fair report of the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">There is abundant evidence in the record that Colonel Cresson was very zealous, if not overzealous, in pursuing the prosecution, in and out of the Army, of those concerned in Bergdoll\u2019s escape. But the truth or falsity, the justice or injustice of the committee\u2019s report, in so far as it relates to Colonel Cresson, is not a matter for judicial review; in any event it is not the question before us. The members of the Congressional committee are absolutely privileged, and while this court differs with the committee\u2019s conclusions on the facts recited in its report \u2014and doubtless there are no others else they would have been stated\u2014 nevertheless we have no authority in this action to review or revise those findings. Whether'or not the time has come when a sound public policy may be deemed to require some limitation of the absolute privilege, is a matter for legislative and not for judicial consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The sole question before us, therefore, is whether, in the absence of any evidence of .express malice on defendant\u2019s part, it so clearly appears that its article was a fair and impartial account of the Congressional report as to leave no question for submission to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">A careful reading and analysis of defendant\u2019s alleged libel indicate that the exact nature of the conspiracy in which plaintiff, with Hunt and Ansell, is alleged to have played a leading part, and his exact part therein, are not stated; the published article does not allege that they conspired to aid Bergdoll in his escape; it charges only that \u201cBerg-doll was aided in his escape to Germany by a conspiracy in which\u201d they played'the leading parts. A single conspiracy is thereby stated to have been charged in the congressional report, but its scope is not fixed. It might have been limited to .effectuating the escape; it might, however, equally well have been very much broader, including as separate steps, therein the actual escape and the protection against punishment of those participating therein. If, therefore, the committee\u2019s report charged a single conspiracy consisting of a number of successive steps, one of which was directly to aid Bergdoll\u2019s escape, and another the failure diligently to prosecute those charged with dereliction of duty in that respect, and if it further charged Cresson with having played a leading part in any of the stages of the single conspiracy, it necessarily charged him with participation in the single conspiracy, and the directed verdict was in that case proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>An examination of the resolution under which the committee acted, reproduced on the first page of the report, and of the other portions of the report relevant to this inquiry,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> demonstrates that such was the conspiracy and participation charged therein. As the entire report is a part of the pleadings, all portions thereof may be considered even though the trial court permitted only certain parts to be read to the jury. It appears therefrom that the committee was appointed because of a charge that there had been a plot or conspiracy, and was to investigate the persons who \u201cparticipated in a plot or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>spiracy to effect or to give aid to said escape or to prevent recapture or were derelict in the performance of any duty devolved or devolving upon them which contributed to making said escape possible, or prevented or hindered recapture or made it more easy for said Bergdoll to elude recapture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">But a single plot or conspiracy is thus referred toj and the committee adopted this view when it reported that \u201cwhile there are many who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>participated in the conspiracy leading to Bergdoll\u2019s escape and the acquittal of those who brought it about,\u201d the three who were infinitely more culpable than the rest were General Ans-ell, Colonel Hunt and Colonel Cresson; that \u201cas ugly as are many phases of this whole matter, none is more defenseless than the conduct of Colonel Cresson in his pretended prosecution of Colonel Hunt\u201d; \u201cthat to turn those loose who turned Bergdoll loose but adds insult to injury, and Colonel Cresson was the principal one of the instruments through which this latter offense was perpetrated.\u201d The committee further points out that to constitute a conspiracy it is not necessary for the parties to meet together or to enter into a formal agreement or even to have any previous acquaintance or to know the exact part to be performed by each, but any one who, with the knowledge of the facts, concurs in the plans of the original conspirators and comes in to aid their execution, is a co-conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We cannot avoid the conclusion that the committee charged that there was a single plot and that it comprised plans both for Berg-doll\u2019s escape and for the acquittal of those aiding therein. While Cresson\u2019s name is omitted from some paragraphs and sentences dealing with those directly aiding the escape, we do not believe such omission sufficient to indicate that the committee did not intend, as would otherwise appear, to charge Colonel Cresson with being a party to the plot as a whole. Inasmuch as we find that defendant has accurately summarized the committee\u2019s report, it is unnecessary to consider whether or not or under what circumstances of ambiguity, either of language or of legal construction, a newspaper must, at its peril; correctly determine the exact charge made before it is privileged to publish an honest and otherwise fair summary of a legislative committee report.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Again repeating that we are not passing upon the truth or fairness of the charges but only upon the question of the accuracy of the defendant\u2019s summary of the report, we hold that there was no error in directing a verdict for defendant. Our conclusions are supported by Cresson v. North American Co. (Pa.) 124 Atl. 495, Cresson v. Wortham-Carter Co. (Tex. Civ. App.) 248 S. W. 1077, and Cresson v. Dispatch Printing Co. (D. C.) 291 Fed. 632, involving virtually the same facts as <em>the </em>in-r stant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-4\"> Page 1 of Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Whereas, one Grover Cleveland, Bergdoll, recently convicted \u2022 * * as a draft deserter * * * has escaped from confinement; and</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Whereas, charges are made, and there is reason to believe, that a plot and conspiracy existed among and between divers and sundry persons unknown to consummate the escape of the said Bergdoll from confinement: * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Resolved, that a select committee * ~ * be appointed to investigate and procure all facts relevant to fixing responsibility for said escape and for the failure 'to recapture the said Bergdoll, and particularly to determine whether relatives, friends, counsel, or attorneys of the said Bergdoll participated in a plot or conspiracy to effect or give aid to said escape or to prevent recapture; or whether officers, noncommissioned officers, or privates of the army or other persons connected with the army or with the administration of the said disciplinary barracks or any other person participated in a plot or conspiracy to effect or give aid to said escape of to prevent recapture or were derelict in the performance of any duty devolved or devolving upon them which contributed to making said escape possible or prevented or hindered recapture or made it more easy for the said Bergdoll to elude recapture.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">**********</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Page 22 of Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">As the conduct and trial of Col. Hunt are in such close intimacy with Col. C. C. Cresson, the judge advocate who prosecuted \u2014 or rather who was selected or detailed to prosecute Col. Hunt \u2014 it is deemed best that his acts and omissions should be considered at this point in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">As ugly as are many phases of this whole matter, none is more defenseless than the conduct of Col. Cresson in his pretended prosecution of Col. Hunt,</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">To turn those loose who turned Bergdoll loose but adds insult to injury, and Col.

Hunt in this matter, or that any money was used, the only charge in the matter being simply neglect of duty and failure to take due precautions in the matter. (P. 7, Hunt\u2019s court-martial trial record.)\u201d o By that declaration Col. Cresson gave notice that he would not, if he could, prove that he did not furnish a sufficient guard if he was bribed not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-19\">. In the same way this prosecuting attorney served notice that he would not prove, even if he could do so, that Col. Hunt had failed to send a commissioned officer along with the guard if he had been paid not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-20\">The inevitable conclusion is that Bergdoll bought his way out; yet' Col. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Cresson, the prosecutor, boldly announced that he would not prove that to.be the case even if he could.</p>\n<p id=\"AIL\">That statement by Col.
