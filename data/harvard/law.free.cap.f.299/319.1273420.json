The Pennsylvania, 19 Wall. 125, 22 L. Ed. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Thus far we agree with the court below, but think it was inadvertently further held that the Franks, although going-at a rate of speed which rendered it impossible for her to stop within the distance objects could be seen, was not liable because the anchored barge was not ringing a lawful bell. The contrary was held in The Raleigh (C. C.) 44 Fed. 781, The Etruria, 147 Fed. 216, 77 C. C. A. 442, and The Haven (C. C. A.) 277 Fed. 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Decree modified, to award libelant half damages; costs of this court to libelant, and costs here to the Potter also.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b339-21\">\u00a3ss&gt;JTor other cases see same topic &amp;.
