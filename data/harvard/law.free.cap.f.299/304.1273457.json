Regardless, however, of the exact effect to be given either to this patent or to this A chair, we concur in the conclusion that there is no invention involved in the patent in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">What plaintiff in effect did was merely to put a supporting leg under the projecting portion' of a movable desk frame school chair \u2014 a common expedient with any desk \u2014 and then to omit the unnecessary adjacent leg; in other words, he moved one corner leg forward, the better to give support and to prevent tipping. There was no invention involved in placing this fourth leg where it would be most effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
