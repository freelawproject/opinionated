We affirm both the conviction and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Defendant was charged in Gloucester Township with driving while intoxicated, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50; refusal to submit a breath sample, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2 (refusal statute); failure to maintain a lane, <em>N.J.SA </em>39:4-88b; and reckless driving, <em>N.J.SA </em>39:4-96.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He entered a plea to refusal to submit a breath sample and the municipal court judge entered a finding of not guilty to the driving while intoxicated charge based upon the prosecutor\u2019s representation that the State could not prove a case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based upon a March 10, 1999, conviction of the refusal statute, the judge suspended defendant\u2019s driving privileges for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Defendant appealed and on trial de novo the Law Division judge vacated the plea because defendant had not given a factual basis for his plea in the municipal court. On remand, following a trial in municipal court, defendant was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of refusal to submit a breath sample and sentenced again as a second offender to a two-year suspension of his driving privileges. Defendant appealed, contending that the arresting officers did not have probable cause to stop him and request that he submit to a breath test. Following a de novo hearing in the Law Division, the judge found defendant guilty of violating the refusal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Relying on the decision in <em>State v. Cummings, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>84, 875 A.2d 906 (2005), which raised the burden of proof for violation of the refusal statute to beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant argued in the Law Division that because his 1999 conviction was based upon the preponderance of the evidence standard, he should not be sentenced as a second offender to a two-year driving suspension. Noting that <em>Cummings </em>provided for pipeline retroactivity, and defendant\u2019s conviction under the lesser standard of proof in 1999 was not pending appeal at the time <em>Cummings </em>was decided, the judge concluded that <em>Cummings </em>did not \u201creach back\u201d to disqualify defendant\u2019s prior conviction from being considered in assessing the sentence. Consequently, the judge imposed a two-year suspension, twelve hours of Intoxicated Driver\u2019s Resource Center training, and $433 in fines and costs. However, he stayed the implementation of the suspension, pending appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">On appeal, defendant raises the following points:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">DEFENDANT BRESLIN SHOULD BE ACQUITTED OF HIS REFUSAL TO TAKE THE BREATHALYZER TEST BECAUSE THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT PROBABLE CAUSE TO PERMIT THE CHARGING OFFICER TO REQUEST THAT DEFENDANT TAKE A BREATHALYZER TEST.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">DEFENDANT BRESLIN SHOULD BE SENTENCED AS A FIRST OFFENDER FOR VIOLATION OF <em>N.J.S.A. </em>[39:4-50.2] REFUSAL TO TAKE A BREATHALYZER TEST\u2014BECAUSE HIS PRIOR REFUSAL CONVICTION WAS OBTAINED WHEN THE BURDEN OF PROOF REQUIRED FOR CON<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>VICTION WAS PURSUANT TO THE CIVIL STANDARD, i.e. PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Defendant\u2019s first contention that the trooper did not have probable cause to believe defendant was operating his vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor is devoid of factual and legal merit. To secure a conviction under the refusal statute, the State is required to prove \u201cthat (1) the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that defendant had been operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol; (2) defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated; and (3) defendant refused to submit to a breathalyzer test.\u201d <em>State v. Wright, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>488, 490, 527 A.2d 379 (1987). On appeal, defendant does not contest that the proofs established that he was arrested for driving while under the influence and refusing to give a breath sample. We, therefore, focus on the proofs concerning probable cause for the stop and the belief that defendant was driving while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In reaching his conclusion that there was sufficient proof in the municipal court record to support his finding of probable cause, the Law Division judge found credible the following testimony by Trooper Steven Cristenzio at the municipal court trial. While traveling behind defendant\u2019s vehicle, Cristenzio observed defendant fail to maintain his lane, drive over the dotted white line and drive onto the shoulder several times. Although Cristenzio had his overhead lights on and sounded his audible siren, defendant failed to pull over and traveled another three-tenths of a mile. The trooper indicated, from his experience and training, it should take only one-tenth of a mile for a vehicle to pull over.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Cristenzio detected an odor of alcohol as he spoke to defendant while defendant remained in the ear. Cristenzio directed defendant to go to the front of defendant\u2019s vehicle to perform field sobriety tests. Defendant failed the one-leg stand test and the counting test. When asked to raise his leg a second time, defendant attempted the maneuver, however, he fell on the hood of the car. Defendant also refused to do the walk-and-turn test as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>instructed, claiming that his back was hurting. Cristenzio stated that defendant swayed as he escorted him to the patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Cristenzio\u2019s patrol unit was equipped with a video recorder. The Law Division judge noted that the video showed defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXN\">driving ... at a high rate of speed weaving and drifting back and forth from one lane to another. He just missed hitting a barrier at the side of the roadway. He drove on the shoulder, and he applied his brakes for no apparent reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">He drove with his right rear turn signal on but he was not turning. He drove so dangerously that he looked like an accident waiting to happen. It took him an inordinate distance to finally stop after Trooper Cristenzio\u2019s continuous signal to do so. After the trooper escorted him to the front of his Lincoln ... [tjhree times, the trooper asked him where he was coming from. Each time, [defendant] did not answer. He was staggering and appeared to be disoriented. His speech sounded very slurred, and at times, incomprehensible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">When the trooper told [defendant] \u201cI stopped you because you were weaving all over the road,\u201d [defendant] made no audible intelligible response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The judge credited the trooper\u2019s testimony and found defendant\u2019s testimony that he did not drink because he suffers from vertigo not credible. He concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, based upon defendant\u2019s erratic driving, the odor of alcohol, failure to perform the field sobriety tests, and swaying while walking to the trooper\u2019s vehicle, that Trooper Cristenzio had a well-grounded suspicion to believe that defendant was driving his vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Our review of the record convinces us that the judge was entirely correct in finding that there was sufficient credible evidence in the record to conclude that, under the circumstances, Cristenzio had probable cause to both stop defendant and to believe that he was operating his motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. We have no warrant to reverse determinations of credibility or other findings of a trial court where they could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">In his second point, defendant asserts that he should not be subject to a two-year suspension as a second offender under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a because his first conviction under the refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>statute was subject to the civil burden of proof. He relies in part on the decision in <em>State v. DiSomma, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>375, 621 A.2d 55 (App.Div.1993). <em>DiSomma </em>held that \u201ca prior refusal conviction cannot serve as the basis for imposing second offender status upon sentencing a defendant for a subsequent driving while intoxicated [(DWI)] conviction\u201d because the burden of proof for the former conviction was based upon the civil standard and not the criminal standard required for the second conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 621 A.2d 55. Defendant asserts he should not be subject to the enhanced two-year second offender penalty, claiming that, like the defendant in <em>DiSomma, </em>his second conviction under the present refusal statute was based upon the newly imposed criminal burden of proof under <em>Cummings, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 89, 875 A.2d 906, while his first conviction was based on a lower proof standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In <em>Cummings, </em>the Court held, for the first time, that \u201cdespite the clear legislative election as well as prior acceptance of the [civil] preponderance of the evidence standard,\u201d prosecutions under the refusal statute are to be based upon the criminal beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 95, 875 A.2d 906. In reaching its decision, the Court relied in part on its decision in <em>State v. Widmaier, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>475, 500, 724 A.2d 241 (1999), which held that, for double jeopardy purposes, the refusal statute must be treated as quasi-criminal, thus barring appeals by the State of acquittals, even though the burden of proof remained the civil standard. Having announced a \u201cnew rule of law,\u201d the Court then applied \u201cpipeline retroactivity\u201d and determined that the new criminal standard of proof is to apply \u201cto future cases and to all cases still on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Cummings, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 99, 875 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Defendant argues that because prosecution under the refusal statute today requires the stricter criminal burden of proof and his prior refusal was subject to the lesser civil burden, the State should be precluded, as it was in <em>DiSomma, </em>from seeking the elevated two-year penalty under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>a. Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, the municipal court shall revoke the right to operate a motor vehicle of any operator who, after being arrested for a violation of R.S. 39:4-50, shall refuse to submit to a test provided for in section 2 of P.L. 1966, e. 142 (C. 39:4-50.2) when requested to do so, for not less than seven months or more than one year unless the refusal was in connection with <em>a second offense under this section, </em>in which case the revocation period shall be for two years or unless the refusal was in connection with a third or subsequent offense under this section in which ease the revocation shall be for ten years, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The refusal statute was enacted by the Legislature to combat the \u201chigh rate of refusals] [which] made enforcement of the drunk driving laws very difficult.\u201d <em>State v. Tekel, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 505, 658 A.2d 1281 (App.Div.1995). The plain wording of the statute, specifically, \u201ca second offense under this section\u201d evinces the legislative intent to elevate the penalty for a second conviction under the refusal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The circumstances before us are different from the facts in <em>DiSomma. </em>Unlike <em>DiSomma, </em>here, defendant\u2019s prior conviction was the same refusal offense as his subsequent conviction. Indeed, in reaching its decision, the panel in <em>DiSomma </em>recognized the distinction between convictions of similar as opposed to dissimilar offenses, noting: \u201clogically, if a person was not convicted of driving under the influence, he should not be punished as if he had been so convicted.\u201d <em>DiSomma, supra, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 380, 621 A.2d 55. It also pointed out that \u201cDWI and refusal to take a breathalyzer test are not the same or interchangeable violations\u201d and noted that \u201c[u]nlike the DWI statute, the refusal statute makes no provision for a term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382-83 n. 6, 621 A.2d 55. Thus, the panel\u2019s conclusion that \u201ca prior refusal conviction cannot serve as the basis for imposing second offender status upon sentencing a defendant for a subsequent driving while intoxicated conviction\u201d was based, in part, on two different offenses with different potential penalties. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 621 A.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">At the time of defendant\u2019s first conviction, the decision in <em>Widmaier </em>establishing the quasi-criminal nature of the violation of the refusal statute, albeit for double jeopardy purposes, had been decided. Whereas at the time <em>DiSomma </em>was decided, a refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>violation was still deemed civil in character and driving while intoxicated was deemed quasi-criminal. Thus, defendant was well aware of the quasi-criminal nature of the refusal violation at the time of his 1999 conviction. Moreover, the rationale behind the decision in <em>DiSomma </em>was subsequently called into question. In <em>Tekel, supra, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 503, 658 A.2d 1281, the defendant pled guilty to refusal and was sentenced as a second offender based upon a prior conviction for DWI. On appeal, the defendant relied \u201calmost exclusively\u201d on <em>DiSomma </em>to support his argument that imposition of the two-year penalty was error. <em>Id. </em>at 509, 658 A.2d 1281. After noting that <em>DiSomma </em>\u201cdoes not serve as precedent ... because the factual circumstances were plainly different,\u201d the panel in <em>Tekel </em>criticized as \u201cdicta\u201d the holding in <em>DiSomma, </em>noting that it \u201cundermines the sound legislative policy on which drunk driving statutes are grounded.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We are convinced that, were we to accept defendant\u2019s argument, everyone convicted of refusing to give a breath sample prior to the holding in <em>Cummings </em>who is subsequently arrested for DWI would again refuse to submit a breath sample simply to avoid the elevated second offender penalty. As pointed out in <em>Tekel, </em>\u201c[s]uch an outcome would do nothing to curb the \u2018senseless havoc and destruction caused by intoxicated drivers.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509-10, 658 A.2d 1281 (quoting <em>Wright, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 497, 527 A.2d 379).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">On appeal, defendant contends that <em>Cummings </em>represents a \u201crecognition that the consequences of a refusal conviction are so significant that decisions made by a preponderance of the evidence should not be used to enhance acknowledged statutory convictions that have quasi-criminal consequences.\u201d We disagree. The defendant in <em>Cummings </em>was a first-time offender. <em>Cummings </em>did not address the questions related to second-offender status. Defendant\u2019s 1999 refusal conviction was not pending or under appeal at the time <em>Cummings </em>was decided. The Law Division judge correctly found <em>Cummings </em>did not \u201creach back\u201d to negate that conviction. More importantly, in deciding to apply pipeline retro-activity, the Court recognized \u201cthe potentially enormous degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>chaos that may result from the unlimited retroactive application of a rule that increases the burden of proof in what can only be estimated to be thousands of settled Motor Vehicle Act convictions.\u201d <em>Cummings, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 99, 875 A.2d 906. As we have previously noted, the same rationale applies here. Simply stated, there is no just reason to nullify a prior refusal conviction based upon a lesser burden of proof from being considered in determining a defendant\u2019s status under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a as a second offender after a second conviction of the same offense based upon the criminal standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\"> The State dismissed the charge of failure to maintain a lane.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-13\"> Based upon the State\u2019s representation that it could not meet its burden of proof, the judge also entered a not guilty verdict to the charge of reckless driving.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
