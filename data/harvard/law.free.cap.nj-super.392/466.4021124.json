Since these provisions were first adopted, the Director of the Division of Taxation has construed the term \u201cactive service\u201d to exclude service solely for training in the National Guard or Reserves. We conclude that the Director\u2019s long-standing construction of the veterans\u2019 tax deduction and exemption is not plainly unreasonable, and therefore, the courts should defer to this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The homeowners who seek the deduction and exemption from real estate taxation available to veterans who have rendered \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d both went through military training during the Vietnam War but were not called for active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Defendant Winfield Buchanan enlisted in the Air Force Reserve on October 18, 1972. Buchanan engaged in basic training from October 20,1972 to February 16,1973. He subsequently engaged in additional training from August 4 to August 18, 1973, and August 10 to August 24, 1974, but he was never called for active duty. Buchanan was honorably discharged on October 17, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Buchanan and his wife own a home in Lambertville that they occupy as their primary residence. Lambertville granted the Buchanans\u2019 application for a veteran\u2019s tax deduction, and they received the benefit of this deduction for the 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">As a result of an audit by the Director of the Division of Taxation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it was determined that the Buchanans are not eligible for the deduction because Mr. Buchanan\u2019s only military service was for training purposes. Accordingly, Lambertville disallowed the deduction for the 2004 tax year and demanded reimbursement for the deductions erroneously allowed in the preceding four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\"><em>NJ.S.A. </em>54:4-8.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The Buchanans appealed to the Hunterdon County Board of Taxation, which determined that the Buchanans are entitled to the veterans\u2019 deduction. The Director subsequently filed a complaint in the Tax Court challenging this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Defendant Frank Seuorzo enlisted in the Army National Guard in July 1969 and was ordered to report for twenty-five weeks of training beginning in November 1969. Seuorzo sustained several injuries during training, including hearing loss, which resulted in hospitalization and an interruption in the training period. Based on his injuries, Seuorzo received an honorable discharge without being called for active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Seuorzo and his wife own a home in Dover Township that they occupy as their primary residence. In 2004, after his hearing loss was certified by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to be a 100% permanent and total service-connected disability, Seuorzo applied to Dover for the exemption from real estate taxation available to veterans disabled during \u201cactive service in time of war.\u201d The municipal tax assessor denied this exemption on the ground that \u201cactive duty for training\u201d does not qualify as \u201cactive service in time of war.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The Scuorzos appealed to the Ocean County Board of Taxation, which reversed the tax assessor and determined that the Scuorzos are entitled to the disabled veterans\u2019 exemption from real estate taxation. Dover subsequently filed a complaint in the Tax Court challenging this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The Buchanan case was brought before the Tax Court by the Director\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Seuorzo case was the subject of a one-day trial. Although the Tax Court did not consolidate the cases, it decided them by a single opinion reported at 22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>568.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The Tax Court concluded that the meaning of the term \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d was \u201cplain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580-81. Consequently, the court refused to extend any deference to the Director of Taxation\u2019s long-standing construction of \u201cactive service\u201d as exclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ing service in the Reserves or National Guard solely for training purposes. <em>Ibid. </em>Rejecting this administrative construction, the court concluded that \u201cactive service for training is included within the term \u2018active service in time of war[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The Director appealed from the judgment determining the Buchanans\u2019 entitlement to the veterans\u2019 deduction, and Dover Township appealed from the judgment determining the Scuorzos\u2019 entitlement to the disabled veterans\u2019 exemption. We now consolidate the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The 1947 New Jersey Constitution provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsA\">Any citizen and resident of this State now or hereafter honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances from <em>active service in time of war </em>in any branch of the armed forces of the United States, shall be exempt from taxation on real and personal property to an aggregate assessed valuation not exceeding five hundred dollars____Any person hereinabove described who has been or shall be declared by the United States Veterans Administration, or its successor, to have a service-connected disability, shall be entitled to such further exemption from taxation as from time to time may be provided by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\"><em>[N.J. Const, </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 1,113 (emphasis added).] <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">The Legislature implemented this constitutional provision by the enactment in 1948 of a statute establishing an exemption from real estate taxation for veterans who suffered a service-connected total disability during wartime, <em>L. </em>1948, c. 259, \u00a7 1, and by the enactment in 1951 of a statute establishing an exemption from real estate taxation on the first $500 of aggregate assessed valuation of property for other veterans serving in time of war, <em>L. </em>1951, c. 184, \u00a7 2. Both statutes contained the same operative language, \u201cactive service in time of war,\u201d as the constitutional provision authorizing these veterans\u2019 benefits. The statute authorizing the disabled veterans\u2019 exemption from real estate taxation now provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The dwelling house and the lot or curtilage whereon the same is erected, of any citizen and resident of this State, now or hereafter honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances, from <em>active service, in time of war, </em>in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, who has ... [a] service-connected disability declared by the United States Veterans Administration or its successor to be a total or 100% permanent disability, ... sustained through enemy action, or accident, or resulting from disease contracted while in such active service, shall be exempt from taxation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>54:4-3.30(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The statute authorizing the deduction from real estate taxation for other veterans serving in time of war now provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">Every person a citizen and resident of this State now or hereafter honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances from <em>active service in time of war </em>in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States ... shall be entitled, annually, on proper claim being made therefor, to a deduction from the amount of any tax bill for taxes on real or personal property or both in the sum of $100 in tax year 2000, $150 in tax year 2001, $200 in tax year 2002, and $250 in each subsequent tax year</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">[N.J.S.A. 54:4-8.11 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The Legislature has delegated responsibility for administration of tax exemptions, including the deduction and exemption from real estate taxation provided to veterans who have served in time of war, to the Director of the Division of Taxation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-8.19. Pursuant to this authority, the Director adopted regulations on October 1, 1948 and August 1, 1951, which provided that the National Guard and Reserves \u201care not to be considered branches of the armed forces,\u201d but that the members of these organizations would \u201ccome within the intendment\u201d of the veterans\u2019 exemptions \u201cwhen detailed for and while on active duty\u201d in time of war with the Army, Air Force, Navy or other regular branch of the armed forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">This limitation on the availability of the veterans\u2019 exemption was reiterated in another regulation the Director adopted on October 1,1952, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">[T]here have been several instances where it has been found that personnel of the National Guard were not entitled to exemption because they were either members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>of a unit which was not mustered into the federal service or they were permitted to withdraw from the unit before it was mustered into the federal service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Consequently, the regulation instructed tax assessors to \u201ccarefully examine the service-record portion of the discharge\u201d of a former member of the National Guard claiming the exemption to determine whether it states: \u201cIn the service of the United States, under call of the President from_to__\u201d Similarly, the regulation instructed the assessors that if a former member of the Reserves applied for the exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">The service or enlistment record appearing as a part of the discharge or release of the claimant from service in such organizations must be examined to determine whether the claimant was detailed for and actually had active duty in a branch of the armed forces. If such record fails to disclose \u201cperiods of active duty,\u201d active service \u201cfor longevity pay\u201d or shows that the claimant was discharged or released without \u201ctravel pay\u201d and without \u201cmustering-out pay,\u201d etc., the claim for exemption should not be approved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">In 1973, the Director asked the Attorney General for an opinion as to whether a veteran who had served in a Reserve component of the Armed Forces or as a member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps during the Vietnam War is eligible for the veterans\u2019 tax deduction. In his inquiry, the Director referred to the previously quoted August 1, 1951 regulation, and indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>under this regulation, \u201c \u2018[a]ctive duty for training\u2019 in [the National Guard and the Reserves] have not been made subject ... to the veterans tax deduction provisions of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The Attorney General issued an unpublished letter opinion, dated February 23,1973, which concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">[Veterans] who have served periods of \u201cactive duty for training\u201d as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces or the Reserve Officers Training Corps during the pendency of the Viet Nam conflict as established by law, shall not be deemed eligible for the veterans tax deduction; provided, however, that [veterans] who shall have served for a period of full time active duty, pursuant to the activation of a reserve component into the federal military service by a Presidential order, shall be eligible for the veterans tax deduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">In reaching this conclusion, the Attorney General relied upon other federal and state statutes that exclude \u201cactive duty for training\u201d from the definition of \u201cactive duty\u201d in military service. The Attorney General also relied upon the Director\u2019s \u201clong standing and contemporaneous administrative interpretation and construction of the Veterans Tax Deduction Law\u201d as further support for his conclusion that \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d does not include service in the National Guard or Reserves solely for training.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">In 1974, the Director issued a revised Handbook for New Jersey Assessors (\u201cAssessors\u2019 Handbook\u201d), which reflected his longstanding construction of the term \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d that the Attorney General\u2019s opinion had concluded was a correct construction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Division of Taxation issues the Assessors\u2019 Handbook \u201cto assist tax assessors in carrying out their duties[.]\u201d <em>Essex County Bd. of Taxation v. Twp. of Caldwell, </em>21 <em>N.J.Tax </em>188, 197 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>426, 824 A.2d 156 (2003). The Assessors\u2019 Handbook reflects the Division\u2019s construction of the statutes and regulations it is charged with administering and, as such, it is \u201cowed considerable deference[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The pertinent section of the 1974 Assessors\u2019 Handbook stated, consistent with the 1951 regulation and the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, that \u201cactive service\u201d includes service by members of the National Guard and Reserves \u201cwhen detailed for and on active duty\u201d with one of the regular branches of the Armed Services, but that \u201cactive duty for training\u201d does not constitute \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">Citizens and residents of this State who have served periods of \u201cactive duty for training\u201d or \u201cfield training\u201d as a member of a Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States during the pendency of the Vietnam conflict shall not be deemed to have had \u201cactive duty\u201d or \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d, and such military service shall not be construed as being eligible military service for purposes of the Veterans Tax Deduction Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\"><em>[Handbook for New Jersey Assessors, </em>N.J. State Div. of Taxation (1974), \u00a7 304.23.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT6\">Similar language has been included in subsequent versions of the Assessors\u2019 Handbook, and the current version of the Handbook, which was issued in 1998, expressly states that the exclusion of \u201cactive duty for training\u201d in the National Guard and Reserves from \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d applies not only to the veterans\u2019 deduction but also to the exemption for disabled veterans. <em>Handbook for New Jersey Assessors, </em>N.J. State Div. of Taxation (1998), \u00a7 403.24.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The Director\u2019s construction of the term \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d was also reflected in the forms that applicants for a veteran\u2019s deduction or exemption, such as the Scuorzos and Buchanans, had to complete. These forms stated that \u201c[a]ctive duty for training or field training purposes as a member of a reserve component <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>does <em>NOT </em>constitute active service [in] time of war unless activated into Federal military service by Presidential or Congressional order.\u201d Thus, any applicant for the veterans\u2019 deduction or exemption was put on clear notice that \u201cactive duty for training\u201d in the National Guard or Reserves is not qualifying service for the deduction or exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Our courts extend \u201csubstantial deference to the interpretation an agency gives to a statute that the agency is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>St. Peter\u2019s Univ. Hosp. v. Lacy, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>1, 15, 878 A.2d 829 (2005) (quoting <em>Smith v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 25, 527 A.2d 843 (1987)). Thus, \u201c[t]o uphold an agency\u2019s construction of a statute that is silent or ambiguous with respect to the question at issue, a reviewing court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted, or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Matturri v. Bd. of Trs. of the Judicial Ret. Sys., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>368, 382, 802 A.2d 496 (2002) (quoting <em>Kasper v.

A court will \u201cdefer to \u2018the agency\u2019s interpretation [of the statute] provided it is not plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>In re Pub. Serv.

Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 327, 478 A.2d 742 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">A court will extend particularly strong deference to an administrative construction of a statute that is long-standing. <em>Body-Rite Repair Co. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, 89 N.J. 540, 545, 446 </em>A.2d 515 (1982). Such a \u201cpractical administrative construction of a statute over a period of years without interference by the legislature is evidence of its conformity with legislative intent[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 446 A.2d 515 (quoting <em>Automatic Merck Council v. Glaser, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>413, 420, 317 A.2d 734 (App.Div.1974)). However, a court will not follow an agency\u2019s construction of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>statute if that construction is plainly \u201cinconsistent with the statutory language and intent.\u201d <em>In re M.F., </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>45, 56, 776 A.2d 780 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">We are satisfied that the term \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d is not self-defining and unambiguous. Consequently, the Director properly undertook to define this term first by administrative regulation and later by the Assessors\u2019 Handbook. We are also satisfied that the Director\u2019s construction of this term, as excluding service solely for training in the National Guard or Reserves, is not plainly unreasonable, and therefore, the courts should defer to this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">When the provision of the New Jersey Constitution authorizing a real estate tax deduction for veterans who have been in \u201cactive service in time of war\u201d was adopted in 1947 and the implementing statutes were enacted in 1948 and 1951, the primary federal legislation providing benefits to World War II veterans limited such benefits to persons \u201cwho served in the active military or naval forces.\u201d Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944, ch. 268, \u00a7\u00a7 400, 500, 607, 58 Stat. 284, 287, 291, 295. Although the statute did not define this term, prior veterans\u2019 benefits statutes limited eligibility to veterans who had served in the Army, Navy or Marine Corps, <em>see, e.g., </em>Act of May 1, 1926, ch. 209, 44 Stat. 382, which would have excluded persons whose sole service was for training in the Reserves or National Guard. The Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act\u2019s limitation of benefits to persons \u201cwho served in the active military or naval forces\u201d apparently contemplated the same exclusion. This exclusion was made explicit in Public Law No. 85-857, 72 Stat. 1105 (codified as amended at 38 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>101), enacted in 1958, one purpose of which was \u201c[t]o consolidate all laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This legislation provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">For the purposes of this title ...:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">(21) The term \u201cactive duty\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">(A) full-time duty in the Armed Forces, other than active duty for training;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">(22) The term \u201cactive duty for training\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>(A) full-time duty in the Armed Forces performed by Reserves for training purposes;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In accordance with these definitions, eligibility for most federal veterans\u2019 benefits requires completion of active service other than active duty for training in the National Guard or Reserves. <em>See also Wilson v. United States, </em>917 A.2d 529 (Fed.Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>1217, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2825, 115 L.Ed.2d 995 (1991) (holding that the phrase \u201con active duty\u201d in 10 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1163(d), which protects certain members of the Reserves from involuntary release prior to qualifying for retirement, does not include \u201cactive duty for training\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">There also are New Jersey statutes that reflect the fact that active duty or service in the military is construed for some purposes as excluding service in the National Guard or Reserves for training only. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:5-I(b)(5) excludes \u201cservice performed pursuant to enlistment in the National Guard or the Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve or Coast Guard Reserve\u201d from the definition of \u201cactive service\u201d during the Vietnam war for the purpose of determining eligibility for the civil service preferences provided for disabled and other veterans. <em>See McHale v. Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>371, 378-80, 429 A.2d 373 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>402, 434 A.2d 1081 (1981). Such service is also excluded for the purpose of determining eligibility under the Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System to purchase additional service credit for time spent in the military. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-2(r)(13); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-13; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-6(p)(13); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-73.1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-11.7(13); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-11.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In light of these statutory enactments, there is a reasonable basis for concluding that the delegates to the 1947 constitutional convention who drafted Article 8, section 1, paragraph 3 of the New Jersey Constitution, and the legislators who enacted the 1948 and 1951 statutes implementing the veterans\u2019 exemption and deduction, would have understood \u201cactive service\u201d to be a term of art that excluded service in the National Guard and Reserves for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>training purposes only. Therefore, the Director\u2019s construction of this term, as reflected in the 1951 regulation and, more recently, in the Assessors\u2019 Handbook, is not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Matturri, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 382, 802 A.2d 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Furthermore, the Director\u2019s construction of these statutes is long-standing. It seems likely that the Director\u2019s regulations reflecting this construction, which were adopted in the late 1940s and early 1950s, would have been distributed to municipal tax assessors, since they are responsible for administering the veterans\u2019 deduction and exemption at the municipal level, and it is clear that the Director\u2019s construction was specifically set forth in the 1974 Assessors\u2019 Handbook and all subsequent Handbooks distributed to the assessors. Consequently, it must be assumed that at least since 1974, and probably since the original enactment of these provisions, most assessors have denied the deduction and exemption to veterans of the National Guard and Reserves whose only service during war was for training purposes. If the Legislature disagreed with the Director\u2019s construction of the statutes establishing the deduction and exemption, it could have amended them to extend these benefits to such veterans of the National Guard and Reserves on one of the numerous occasions these statutes were amended in other respects. <em>See L. </em>1952, c. 233, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1954, c. 148, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1965, c. 214, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1971, c. 398, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1977, c. 107, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1977, c. 377, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1981, c. 171, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1985, c. 515, \u00a7 2. Therefore, the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend these statutes over the long period of time during which the Director has construed the term \u201cactive service\u201d to exclude service in the National Guard and Reserves solely for training reflects legislative acquiescence in this construction. <em>See Body-Rite Repair Co., supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 545\u201446, 446 A.2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that the Tax Court erred in rejecting the Director\u2019s construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.30(a) and <em>N.J.SA </em>54:4-8.11 as excluding active service for training in the National Guard or Reserves in time of war from \u201cactive service in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>time of war.\u201d Accordingly, the judgments of the Tax Court are reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-10\"> The Director conducts such audits because the State is required to reimburse a municipality 102% of the amount of the veterans' deductions it grants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\"> Subsequent amendments, adopted in 1953, 1963, 1988 and 1999, substituted a flat $50 deduction from property taxes, which was increased to $100 for 2000, $150 for 2001, $200 for 2002 and $250 thereafter, for the original exemption from taxes of property with an aggregate assessed valuation up to $500 and made other changes not relevant to the issue presented by this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-10\"> These regulations were not published in the Administrative Code or New Jersey Register. However, they are on file in the Office of Administrative Law. Although the regulations were adopted before enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 to -25, the APA did not require the re-adoption of previously adopted regulations. Consequently, these regulations remained in effect after enactment of the APA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">However, the Legislature amended the APA in 2001 to add a sunset provision, now codified as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-5.1, which provides: \u201cEvery rule in effect on the enactment date of <em>P.L. </em>2001, <em>c. </em>5 shall expire five years following the effective date of this act [July 1, 2001]....\u201d Therefore, the regulations relating to the veterans' tax deduction and exemption adopted in the late 1940s and early 1950s would have expired at the latest in 2006. A summary of the proposed new regulations adopted by the Division of Taxation in 2006, <em>NJ.A.C. </em>18:27-1.1 to -3.11; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:28-1.1 to -3.8, stated that they were \u201cintended to fill the existing void with respect to uniform rules governing the administration of the veteran\u2019s property tax deduction,\u201d 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>2099, and \u201care needed for compliance with the [APA] and also reflect more recent legislative enactments and court rulings,\u201d 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>2105.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\"> Although the Assessors' Handbook was not introduced into evidence before the Tax Court, we take judicial notice of this government publication. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>202(b); <em>Twp. of W.
