The first count of the complaint alleges that Vizcaino, who was a patron, \u201cintentionally, willfully and wantonly assaulted and struck\u201d the plaintiff, Jeffrey Lunsford, another patron, causing him personal injuries. The second count alleges that Vizcaino \u201ccarelessly, recklessly and negligently assaulted and struck\u201d Lunsford. The complaint also asserts negligence claims against Basile\u2019s Italian Bistro and a per quod claim on behalf of Lunsford\u2019s wife, Michelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>Vizcaino </em>requested NJM to provide him with a defense in the personal injury action. NJM agreed to provide a defense to the negligence claim, but denied coverage with respect to the intentional assault claim. NJM\u2019s counsel sent Vizcaino a letter, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">NJM does not provide coverage to anyone who intentionally causes bodily injury or property damage. NJM specifically reserves the right to disclaim coverage at a later date if it is determined that your conduct was intentional in nature. Additionally, if it is determined that your actions were intentional, NJM has no duty to indemnify you or pay any judgment rendered against you for your intentional acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The letter \u201cstrongly advised\u201d Vizcaino to retain his own attorney to provide representation regarding \u201cany non-covered claims.\u201d Thereafter, NJM filed an action against Vizcaino for a declaratory judgment that it is not obligated to provide him with a defense against Lunsford\u2019s intentional assault claim. This declaratory judgment action was subsequently consolidated, \u201cfor discovery purposes only,\u201d with Lunsford\u2019s personal injury action.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">NJM\u2019s obligation for Vizcaino\u2019s defense in the Lunsford action was brought before the trial court by cross-motions for summary judgment. The court ruled in an oral opinion that NJM has an obligation to provide Vizcaino with a defense to all claims asserted by Lunsford, including the intentional assault claim, until such time as the negligence claim is eliminated from the case. Accordingly, the court entered an amended order for partial summary judgment requiring NJM to provide a complete defense to Vizcaino in Lunsford\u2019s pending personal injury action. The order further provides that NJM\u2019s obligation to reimburse Vizcaino for the attorney\u2019s fees he previously had incurred in defending Lunsford\u2019s personal injury action and in the declaratory judgment action is to be determined after the trial of the Lunsford action.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We granted NJM\u2019s motion for leave to appeal from the part of the order that requires it to provide a defense to Vizcaino and subsequently granted Vizcaino\u2019s motion for leave to cross-appeal from the part of the order that defers any decision on his application for attorney\u2019s fees until after the trial of Lunsford\u2019s personal injury action.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The homeowner\u2019s policy that NJM issued to Vizcaino contained an exclusion from liability coverage for bodily injury \u201cwhich is expected or intended\u201d by the insured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, it is clear that if Lunsford\u2019s sole claim against Vizcaino was for intentional assault, NJM would have no obligation to provide Vizcaino with a defense. The question is whether the inclusion in Lunsford\u2019s complaint of a negligence claim obligates NJM to provide him with a defense, and if so, the nature of that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The leading case dealing with an insurance company\u2019s obligation to provide a defense to an insured against whom both intentional tort and negligence claims are asserted is <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 267 A.2d 7 (1970). <em>Burd </em>involved a shooting incident. The victim filed an action against the shooter, one count of which alleged that he had \u201cmaliciously and intentionally\u201d fired the gun, and the other count of which alleged that he had negligently discharged the gun. The shooter requested his insurer to defend the action. The insurer refused on the ground that its policy excluded coverage for bodily injury \u201cintentionally caused\u201d by the insured. As a result, the insured defended the action through his own counsel. A jury returned a general verdict against the insured that did not include a finding as to whether the shooting had been intentional or negligent. The insured then brought an action against the insurer for reimbursement of both the costs of defending the action and the judgment. The trial court held that because the insurer had refused to provide a defense in the underlying personal injury action, it was precluded from defending the coverage action on the ground that the shooting was intentional. <em>Id. </em>at 386-87, 267 A.2d 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Supreme Court reversed and remanded for a determination whether the shooting was intentional, in which event the insurer would have no obligation to pay either the costs of defense or the judgment, or negligent, in which event the insurer would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>required to pay all costs of the defense as well as the judgment. In reaching this conclusion, the Court\u2019s opinion by Chief Justice Weintraub stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">The sense of the covenant is to defend suits involving claims which the carrier would have to pay if the claimant prevailed in the action. The covenant to defend is thus identified with the covenant to pay. That is the basis of the rule that ordinarily a carrier who defends unsuccessfully may not later deny coverage, absent an express agreement with the insured reserving a right to deny coverage. The obligation to defend \u201cgroundless, false or fraudulent\u201d claims does not mean that the carrier will defend claims which would be beyond the covenant to pay if the claimant prevailed. It means only that a carrier may not refuse to defend a suit on the ground that the claim asserted against the insured cannot possibly succeed because either in law or in fact there is no basis for a plaintiffs judgment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">Here the obligation to pay a judgment obtained by the injured party depended upon whether the injuries were intentionally inflicted within the meaning of the exclusionary clause. There may be cases in which the interests of the carrier and the insured coincide so that the carrier can defend such an action with complete devotion to the insured\u2019s interest. But if the trial will leave the question of coverage unresolved so that the insured may later be called upon to pay, or if the case may be so defended by a carrier as to prejudice the insured thereafter upon the issue of coverage, the carrier should not be permitted to control the defense. That was the situation in the case at hand. Although both the insurer and the insured would want D\u2019Agostino to fail, yet if D\u2019Agostino should succeed, as it was likely he would, the insured would want the basis to be negligence whereas the carrier would profit if the basis was an intentional injury within the policy exclusion. If plaintiff pressed his claim of negligence, the coverage issue would remain open, for the carrier could hardly insist the injuries were intentionally inflicted. Willfulness is not a defense to a charge of negligence. And if plaintiff sought a judgment for intentional hurt, the carrier could not be expected to resist that basis of liability with the fervor or fidelity of an advocate selected by the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">In such circumstances the carrier should not be estopped from disputing coverage because it refused to defend. On the contrary the carrier should not be permitted to assume the defense if it intends to dispute its obligation to pay a plaintiff\u2019s judgment, unless of course the insured expressly agrees to that reservation. This is not to free the carrier from its covenant to defend, but rather to translate its obligation into one to reimburse the insured if it is later adjudged that the claim was one within the policy covenant to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 388-90, 267 A.2d 7 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">As noted in <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Insurance Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>18, 24 n. 3, 483 A.2d 402 (1984), if there is a factual question as to whether a policy provides coverage which cannot be decided before trial, \u201c[t]he practical effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>Burd </em>is that an insured must initially assume the costs of defense ... subject to reimbursement by the insurer if [the insured] prevails on the coverage question.\u201d <em>See also Rutgers v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 577-81, 649 A.2d 1362 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">However, the Court in <em>Burd </em>recognized that there are some eases in which it may be appropriate to determine the coverage question, and thus the insurer\u2019s duty to defend, in advance of the trial of the underlying personal injury action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">Whenever the carrier\u2019s position so diverges from the insured\u2019s that the carrier cannot defend the action with complete fidelity to the insured, there must be a proceeding in which the carrier and the insured, represented by counsel of their own choice, may fight out their differences. That action may, as here, follow the trial of the third party\u2019s suit against the insured. Or, unless for special reasons it would be unfair to do so, a declaratory judgment proceeding may be brought in advance of that trial by the carrier or the insured, to the end that the third-party suit may be defended by the party ultimately liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">[56 <em>N.J. </em>at 391, 267 A.2d 7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">This case is directly controlled by <em>Burd. </em>Lunsford\u2019s complaint against Vizcaino asserts a claim for intentional assault, for which the NJM policy concededly does not provide coverage. Under <em>Burd, </em>NJM was entitled to refuse to provide Vizcaino with a defense unless there was a determination in a declaratory judgment in advance of trial that the policy exclusion for intentional torts does not apply to Lunsford\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">NJM followed a somewhat different course. It offered to provide a defense to Vizcaino for Lunsford\u2019s negligence claim, but refused to provide a defense for his intentional assault claim. NJM\u2019s counsel indicated at oral argument before us that the defense it offered Vizcaino would include bearing any costs common to the defense of both the intentional tort and negligence claims, such as the costs of a defense medical examination and plaintiffs deposition. However, NJM\u2019s counsel indicated that there were other parts of Vizcaino\u2019s defense which it could not undertake for the reasons discussed in <em>Burd, </em>including the actual trial in the event the case does not settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>It appears from the comments of NJM\u2019s counsel that NJM does not seek a declaratory judgment in advance of trial of the sort discussed in <em>Burd </em>that its policy does not provide coverage for Lunsford\u2019s claim. In any event, Vizcaino filed a counterclaim that sought an order requiring NJM to provide a complete defense to all aspects of Lunsford\u2019s personal injury action. The trial court granted this relief, and NJM\u2019s interlocutory appeal is from the order memorializing that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The trial court\u2019s imposition of an obligation upon NJM to provide a defense to Vizcaino for all of Lunsford\u2019s claims, including the intentional assault claim, is inconsistent with <em>Burd. </em>As in <em>Burd, </em>NJM and Vizcaino have a common interest in defeating Lunsford\u2019s claim, or if Lunsford establishes liability, minimizing the jury\u2019s award of damages. However, if Lunsford succeeds in establishing Vizcaino\u2019s liability, \u201c[Vizcaino] would want the basis to be negligence whereas [NJM] would profit if the basis was an intentional injury within the policy exclusion.\u201d <em>Burd, supra, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 390,267 A.2d 7. <em>Burd </em>holds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">In such circumstances the carrier should not be estopped from disputing coverage because it refused to <em>defend____This is not to free the carrier from its covenant to defend, but rather to translate its obligation into one to reimburse the insured if it is later adjudged that the claim was one within the policy covenant to pay.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A94\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Thus, the trial court order requiring NJM to assume responsibility for Vizcaino\u2019s defense even though NJM disputes coverage on the ground that Vizcaino\u2019s liability to Lunsford, if any, is for an intentional tort, is contrary to <em>Burd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">In support of his argument that NJM is obligated to provide him with a defense to all of Lunsford\u2019s claims, Vizcaino relies upon <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mutual Insurance Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992). One major issue in <em>Voorhees </em>was whether a homeowner\u2019s policy providing coverage for bodily injuries covers liability for emotional distress accompanied by physical manifestation. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 607 A.2d 1255. The other major issue was whether an event causing emotional distress can be deemed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201caccidental\u201d occurrence entitling the insured to coverage when his or her actions, although intentional, were not intentionally injurious. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court answered both of these questions in the affirmative. <em>Id. </em>at 175-83, 607 A.2d 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Obviously, neither of these major holdings in <em>Voorhees </em>involved the existence, or nature, of an insurer\u2019s duty to provide a defense to an insured in an action in which both intentional tort and negligence claims are asserted. Nevertheless, Vizcaino relies upon a sentence in an introductory section of the opinion, which states that \u201c[w]hen multiple alternativef] causes of action are stated, the duty to defend will continue until every covered claim is eliminated[,]\u201d id. at 174, 607 A.2d 1255, and is followed by a quotation to an opinion by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">To hold otherwise would be to place upon the insured the burden of demonstrating in advance of the underlying litigation which of the competing theories of recovery against it was applicable for purposes of insurance, thereby frustrating one of the basic purposes of such a clause in the insurance contract-protection of the insured from the expenses of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">[Ibid, (quoting Solo <em>Cup Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>619 F.2d 1178, 1185 (7th Cir.1980)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADz\">However, <em>Voorhees </em>did not involve an insurer\u2019s duty to defend a pending action; the only issue was whether the insurer had an obligation to reimburse its insured for costs she had incurred in defending an action concluded by a settlement. Once the Court held that the homeowner\u2019s policy involved in <em>Voorhees </em>provided coverage for a claim of emotional distress accompanied by physical manifestation and that an event causing emotional distress could be deemed an \u201caccidental\u201d occurrence even though the insured\u2019s actions were intentional, it followed that the insurer was obligated to reimburse its insured\u2019s defense costs because some of the claims asserted against her were covered by the policy and the settlement of the case for the nominal amount of $760 constituted in effect a decision in the insured\u2019s favor. As explained in Judge Baime\u2019s opinion for this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">Based on the small amount of the settlement, [the insured] can fairly argue that [the claims asserted against her in the underlying action], which encompassed both intentional and reckless or negligent conduct, were \u201cwholly defeated.\u201d <em>[Burd, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>supra, </em>56 <em>N.J.] </em>at 393, 267 A.2d 7. In that situation the insurer \u201cmay fairly be required to reimburse the insured for the cost of the successful defense even though the [insurer] would not have had to pay the judgment if the case had gone against the insured on a finding of intentional injury.\u201d <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><em>[Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>564, 578, 588 A.2d 417 (App.Div.1991).]</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Thus, the part of <em>Voorhees </em>upon which Vizcaino relies was dictum because it was not essential to the Court\u2019s decision. <em>See Jamouneau v. Div. of Tax Appeals, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>325, 332, 66 A.2d 534 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Furthermore, the Court has reaffirmed <em>Burd </em>since <em>Voorhees. </em>In <em>Morton International, Inc. v. General Accident Insurance Co. of America, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>300, 340-45, 629 A.2d 895 (App.Div.1991), we rejected an argument by a defendant in environmental litigation that its insurance carrier had a duty to provide a defense because some of the allegations of the complaint were arguably within the policy\u2019s coverage. Our opinion quoted the same parts of <em>Burd </em>and <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity </em>previously quoted in this opinion, and we concluded that the defendant was obligated to assume the costs of the defense itself, subject to later reimbursement if it prevailed on the coverage question. <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 629 A.2d 895. The Supreme Court affirmed this part of our opinion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">Finally, we reject Morton\u2019s contention that certain of its insurers breached their duty to defend its predecessors in the <em>[DEP v.]Ventron, </em>[182 <em>N.J.Super </em>210, 440 A.2d 455 (1981)] litigation, asserting that the duty to defend is broader than the duty of indemnification, and observing that at least some of the allegations set forth in the <em>Ventr\u00f3n </em>complaint were within the policies\u2019 coverage obligations. The Appellate Division addressed those contentions, concluding that this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem., supra, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 24-25, 483 A.2d 402 and <em>Burd, supra, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 388-90, 267 A.2d 7, were controlling and dispositive of Morton\u2019s contentions. We are fully in accord with the Appellate Division\u2019s determination of the duty-to-defend issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\"><em>[Morton Int'l, Inc. v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co. of Am., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>1, 95, 629 A.2d 831 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>512 <em>U.S. </em>1245, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2764, 129 L.Ed.2d 878 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Therefore, <em>Burd </em>continues to be the controlling authority with respect to an insurer\u2019s duty to defend an insured against whom both covered and non-covered claims are asserted. <em>See also Trs. of Princeton Univ. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. </em>Co., 293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 301-07, 680 A.2d 783 (App.Div.1996); <em>Muralo Co. v. Employers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Ins. of Wausau, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>282, 289-90, 759 A.2d 348 (App.Div.2000), <em>certif. denied, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>632, 772 A.2d 934 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Vizcaino also relies upon <em>L.C.S., t/a D\u2019Jais Bar, Inc. v. Lexington Insurance Co., </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>482, 853 A.2d 974 (App.Div.2004), which arose out of an alleged assault upon a patron by a bouncer in a bar. The patron filed a complaint against the bar and bouncer for his personal injuries, which asserted both intentional assault claims against the bouncer and negligence claims against the bouncer and bar. The bar\u2019s insurance carrier refused to defend the action on the ground that the injured patron\u2019s claims all arose out of the alleged assault. As a result, the bar provided for its own defense and eventually settled the case for $25,000. The bar then brought an action against its insurance carrier for reimbursement of its defense costs and indemnification of the $25,000 it had paid to settle the case. <em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 853 A.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">This court concluded that the patron\u2019s negligence claims against the bar were covered by the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 491-95, 853 A.2d 974. The panel also concluded, in the part of the opinion Vizcaino relies upon, that the insurance carrier had an obligation to defend the action even though it asserted both covered and non-covered claims, and that because the insurance carrier had refused to provide a defense, it was not entitled to a trial to determine whether plaintiffs claim was covered by the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 495-97, 853 A.2d 974. In reaching this conclusion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3H\">Following <em>Voorhees, </em>it is our holding in the instant case that if a claim is stated in two conflicting theories in a complaint for damages, one which requires coverage and the other which does not, the carrier must defend and may do so under reservation of rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">As in <em>Voorhees, </em>the [personal injury action] was settled. While [the insurer! may deem the amount excessive, it can hardly be heard on the issue since it declined to defend. Similarly, all of the proofs presented-the testimony of [plaintiff in the personal injury action] both at deposition and trial, the certification from trial counsel and the [personal injury action] settlement as reported on the reeordindieate that settlement was based upon a negligence theory. While [the insurer] obviously disputes the issue, we state once again that it had its opportunity to participate in the defense of the action under reservation of rights but chose instead to disclaim and leave its insured to fend for itself. Accordingly, [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>insurer] is not entitled to a hearing to re-litigate on the issue of whether [the plaintiff\u2019s] injuries were the proximate result of a negligent or intentional act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 497, 863 A.2d 974.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>L.C.S. </em>because NJM has offered to provide a defense to the covered negligence claim. More broadly, however, we are unable to reconcile <em>L.C.S.\u2019s </em>apparent holding that an insurer which refuses to defend an action presenting both covered and non-covered claims is foreclosed in a subsequent action by the insured for reimbursement of defense costs and the amount of the settlement from showing that the claim was not covered. Both <em>Burd </em>and <em>Morton </em>recognize that an insurer\u2019s right to a trial on the coverage issue is preserved if it refuses to defend a complaint asserting both covered and non-covered claims. <em>Burd </em>expressly holds that \u201c[i]n such circumstances the carrier should not be estopped from disputing coverage because it refused to defend!,]\u201d 56 <em>N.J. </em>at 390, 267 A.2d 7, and that \u201cif the carrier does not defend the tort claim because a plaintiffs verdict will not resolve the coverage problem in the insured\u2019s favor or because the carrier cannot defend with complete fidelity to the insured\u2019s sole interest, then the carrier may be heard upon the coverage issue in a proceeding upon the policy!,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 394, 267 A.2d 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Vizcaino alleged in answers to interrogatories that he was assaulted by Lunsford and acted solely in self-defense. If the jury accepts this version of the incident, it presumably would return a verdict in Vizcaino\u2019s favor and NJM would then be obligated to reimburse him for all costs of his defense because the complaint asserts both covered and uncovered claims. <em>Burd, supra, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 393, 267 A.2d 7. But if the jury rejects Vizcaino\u2019s version of the incident and finds that he intentionally assaulted Lunsford, NJM would have no obligation to reimburse Vizcaino for any of his defense costs. And if the jury returns a verdict in Lunsford\u2019s favor on the basis of negligence, NJM would have an obligation to reimburse Vizcaino for defense costs and the amount of the judgment. <em>See id. </em>at 394-96, 267 A.2d 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Accordingly, the order requiring NJM to provide Vizcaino with a defense to all the claims asserted by Lunsford is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. This disposition of NJM\u2019s appeal moots Vizcaino\u2019s cross-appeal, which is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\"> Although the NJM policy is not included in the record before us, Vizcaino acknowledges that his homeowner's policy contained this exclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
