The district court affirmed. Finding neither error nor abuse of discretion we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-29\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-30\">This case arises out of a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding involving Dierschke\u2019s parents. The trustee and a creditor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>menced an adversarial proceeding against Dierschke exactly one year after a reorganization plan had been confirmed by the bankruptcy court. This proceeding involved an alleged series of fraudulent transfers between Dierschke and his parents prior to the filing of their bankruptcy proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both Dierschke and his lawyer were served with a copy of the complaint and the summons. No responsive pleadings were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">More than two months later, plaintiffs filed a request for entry of default and moved for a default judgment. The clerk entered the default on January 9, 1991. Thereafter, a notice of hearing on damages and attorney\u2019s fees was issued. Dierschke responded with an array of motions, including a motion to set aside the default. After a hearing the bankruptcy court found \u201cthat the failure to answer was willful\u201d and denied the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following a second hearing the bankruptcy court entered judgment by default for $98,000 in damages and awarded $5000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Upon appeal to the district court Dierschke presented multiple issues which distill to complaints about (1) the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to set aside the default, (2) the entry of the judgment by default, (3) the denial of trial by jury, and (4) the award of attorney\u2019s fees. The district court affirmed in all respects. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Initially we note that the entry of the default was proper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sole issue is whether the court erred in not allowing Dierschke relief therefrom. On appeal we review that decision for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Bankruptcy Rule 7055 provides that Federal Rule 55 applies to adversary proceedings. Rule 55 provides that \u201c[f]or good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default,\u201d and the judgment subsequently rendered thereon. We are mindful that \u201cgood cause\u201d is not susceptible of precise definition, and no fixed, rigid standard can anticipate all of the situations that may occasion the failure of a party to answer a complaint timely. At the outset it is important, however, to recall that courts \u201c \u2018universally favor trial on the merits\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the decision to set aside a default is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, a discretion that obviously is not unlimited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">As have other courts, we have found it useful to consider three factors in assessing good cause in this default setting. In <em>United States v. One Parcel of Real </em>Property,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">In determining whether to set aside a default decree, the district court should consider whether the default was willful, whether setting it aside would prejudice the adversary, and whether a meritorious defense is presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">The bankruptcy court found that Dierschke\u2019s failure to answer was intentional, noting that \u201c[t]he plain and simple fact is that Mr. Dierschke chose to play games with this court.\u201d The court did not make any finding on the record as to the remaining factors identified in <em>One Parcel of Real Property, </em>although the court entertained argument on these.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">We perceive a variance among our circuit colleagues as to whether the court must consider and note its disposition of all three factors on the record. Decisions of three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>circuits may be read to require such consideration by the trial court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Others have treated the factors in the disjunctive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We find the latter course more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The three factors identified in <em>One Parcel of Real Property </em>are not talismanic. Courts have been careful to avoid treating them as though they were exclusive,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> relying on such other factors including whether: (1) the public interest was implicated,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (2) there was a significant financial loss to the defendant,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (3) the defendant acted expeditiously to correct the default.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Whatever factors are employed, the imperative is that they be regarded simply as a means of identifying circumstances which warrant the finding of \u201cgood cause\u201d to set aside a default. That decision necessarily is informed by equitable principles.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that when the court finds an intentional failure of responsive pleadings there need be no other finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We review the record to determine if the bankruptcy court\u2019s acting on Dierschke\u2019s culpable conduct suffices. The factual determination \u2014 that the failure to answer was intentional \u2014 is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Dierschke explained his failure to answer by stating that he was involved in a second suit when served and, as a result, he did not understand that he had been served with a summons in this case. Dierschke\u2019s lawyer was also served. Counsel testified that he had discussed the complaint with Dierschke and had mailed a copy of same to his client well before an answer was due. We find no reason to disturb the court\u2019s finding that Dierschke \u201cchose to make a decision that he hadn\u2019t been served when, in fact, he had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">The determination that the default should not be set aside is reviewed for abuse of discretion. A motion to set aside a default usually arises at a point when final judgment has not been rendered. Thus, while courts apply essentially the same standard to motions to set aside a default and a judgment by default,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the former is more readily granted than a motion to set aside a default judgment. The willful failure to answer, the lack of any meritorious defense, and the existence of resulting prejudice to the plaintiff, depending on the circumstances, typically can provide adequate cause for the court to deny a motion to set aside a default. Assuming no prejudice to the plaintiffs and that Dierschke had meritorious defenses does not automatically overcome the willful failure to answer. Willful failure alone may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>constitute sufficient cause for the court to deny this motion. Although Dierschke\u2019s counsel acted promptly after being notified of the hearing on attorney\u2019s fees, considering his client\u2019s conduct, the court\u2019s refusal to set aside the default was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Having determined that the courts <em>a quo </em>did not abuse their discretion by refusing to set aside the default, we address the remaining issues. Dierschke claims that the court erred by entering a final judgment. Specifically, he claims that the pleadings do not support the entry of judgment on default because the complaint failed to allege that there was an unsecured creditor in existence at the time of the challenged transfers. The applicable law provides a cause of action to any creditor whose claim \u201carose within a reasonable time before or after the transfer was made....\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that the transfers were made \u201cwith the actual intent to hinder, delay, and defraud their creditors.\u201d We find that this sufficiently alleged that the transfers were made while creditors held unsecured claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Dierschke also complains that he was denied the right to a jury trial. It is universally understood that a default operates as a deemed admission of liability.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is also \u201cclear ... that in a default case neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has a constitutional right to a jury trial on the issue of damages.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Assuming that Dierschke had the right to a jury trial he waived that right when he purposefully chose not to answer the suit and timely request such a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Finally, Dierschke complains of the award of attorney\u2019s fees. The complaint did not request such relief. As an initial matter we note that there is no general authority for the award of attorney\u2019s fees in bankruptcy litigation. In <em>Cates v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we recently held that federal rules usually govern the procedure employed in the taxation of fees in federal proceedings. This rule has particular application in bankruptcy proceedings which are uniquely federal. We look, then, to the federal rules. They do not support Dierschke\u2019s contention. It is true, of course, that Rule 8(a) requires a specification of the relief requested by the plaintiff and that Rule 54(c), and for that matter fundamental fairness, dictate that a judgment by default operates as a deemed admission only as to the relief requested in the complaint.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But the attorney\u2019s fees objected to were not awarded by virtue of the entry of a default judgment alone. A default was entered on the issue of liability, but before judgment was entered for the attorney\u2019s fees Dierschke had notice, appeared, and opposed that award. Rule 54(d) provides authority for the judgment rendered herein; it provides that \u201cevery final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party\u2019s pleading.\u201d The plaintiffs were entitled to the attorney\u2019s fees awarded by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-17\">.
