The insurer moved to dismiss on the basis that no direct action lies against it for the asserted claim. The district court granted the motion to dismiss and directed the entry of final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). Plaintiff appeals and asks that we certify to the Louisiana Supreme Court the question whether it may sue the insurer directly under the Louisiana direct action statute, La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 22:655. For the following reasons, we deny the motion to certify and affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">Plaintiff-Appellant First National Bank of Louisville (FNBL) sued the insured alleging losses from a deal gone sour: FNBL lost money on a project it financed in reliance on misrepresentations of an S &amp; L employee. (In related proceedings, FNBL sued the employee.) FNBL also sued Defendant-Appellee Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland (F &amp; D), who provided coverage for employee dishonesty through a Savings and Loan Blanket Bond in favor of the S &amp; L. The district court granted F &amp; D\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. After the Louisiana Supreme Court handed down <em>Quinlan v. Liberty Bank &amp; Trust Co.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>discussing the Louisiana direct action statute, FNBL moved for reconsideration of the dismissal. The district court denied reconsideration on the basis that F &amp; D did not provide \u201cliability\u201d insurance as required for application of the direct action statute. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-13\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-14\">The issue before us is whether insurance provided to the insured S &amp; L under a standard-form Savings and Loan Blanket Bond covering fraudulent and dishonest acts of the S &amp; L\u2019s employees provides \u201cliability\u201d insurance or \u201cindemnity\u201d insurance as these terms have been defined in Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-15\">The Louisiana direct action statute gives a tort victim a right of action directly against the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company. By its own terms the direct action statute applies only to \u201cliability\u201d insurance. Nevertheless, the Louisiana Supreme Court has opined that the statute \u201cis a mandate for a tort victim to bring a direct suit to recover damages for personal injury or corporeal property damage from the tortfea-sor\u2019s insurer, regardless of whether the insurer has framed the policy as a liability or an indemnity contract.\u201d <em>Quinlan, </em>575 So.2d at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-16\">In a suit to recover loss to incorporeal property, however, such as the loss claimed in FNBL\u2019s complaint, the way the insurer has framed the policy is determinative. According to <em>Quinlan, </em>a tort victim seeking recovery of an incorporeal loss has a direct action only if the tortfeasor\u2019s policy provides \u201cliability\u201d coverage as opposed to \u201cindemnity\u201d coverage. A tort victim suffering only incorporeal loss or damage does not have the benefit of a direct action if \u201cthe parties to the insurance contract have agreed unambiguously that the contract shall be an indemnity contract only.\u201d <em>Quinlan, </em>575 So.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-17\">Our inquiry, then, is whether F &amp; D\u2019s contract unambiguously provides indemnity coverage only. The \u201cchief distinction\u201d between the two types of policies is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>\u201cunder a liability policy a cause of action accrues when liability attaches, whereas under an indemnification policy there is no cause of action until the liability has been discharged, as by payment of the judgment by the insured.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\">The <em>Quinlan </em>court specifically considered the arguments regarding an insurance policy provisions on \u201cLoss,\u201d \u201cLoss Payable,\u201d and \u201cAction Against Company\u201d to determine whether a cause accrues when liability attaches (a liability policy) or when a liability has been discharged (an indemnity policy). <em>See id. </em>at 354-55. Considering comparable provisions of the bond disputed here, we find that this policy unambiguously provides indemnity rather than liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">The policy does not indicate that a cause of action against F &amp; D accrues when liability attaches. The policy obligates Fidelity to \u201cindemnify the Insured for ... Loss resulting directly from dishonest or fraudulent acts of an Employee committed alone or in collusion with others.\u201d Bond at 2, Insuring Agreement A (appended to Def.\u2019s Mot. Dismiss filed Jan. 19, 1988). The use of the phrase \u201cindemnify for Loss\u201d in this provision manifests the intent that the policy indemnify against loss rather insure against liability. Moreover, the provision continues, \u201cDishonest or fraudulent acts ... shall mean [such acts] committed ... with the manifest intent to cause <em>the Insured to sustain such loss.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). This definition signifies that the losses indemnified are <em>the insured\u2019s </em>losses from employee dishonesty. The requirement that a loss be \u201csustained\u201d further denotes an indemnity agreement. <em>See Meloy v. Conoco, Inc., </em>504 So.2d 833, 839 (La.1987) (noting the characteristic of an indemnity agreement to provide that the indemnitor is not liable \u201cuntil the indemni-tee actually makes payment or sustains loss\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">FNBL contends that certain provisions of the policy suggest liability coverage or at least produce an ambiguity in the type of coverage intended. Contrary to arguments of FNBL, we do not find that exclusion (u),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the \u201cDiscovery\u201d section (describing which losses are within the period of coverage),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or the costs-of-defense provision (providing for indemnification against court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> instructive in determining the nature of the fidelity coverage. Nor do these provisions create an ambiguity in the policy suggesting liability coverage. Exclusion (u) and the \u201cDiscovery\u201d section mention \u201closs covered under this bond,\u201d \u201closs covered by the bond,\u201d or \u201closs under this bond\u201d; but these provisions do not define \u201closs\u201d to include third-party claims. The cost-of-defense provision sheds no light on the meaning of the employee dishonesty provision or the scope of its coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-11\">This policy contains no ambiguity as did the policy in <em>Quinlan </em>requiring as a condition precedent to a claim that the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>pay \u201cits full liability.\u201d (The court found the condition precedent ambiguous because it could plausibly be interpreted as requiring payment of the full limit of its retention rather than the full payment of the judgment.) We do not find this policy susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. Guided by <em>Quinlan, </em>we hold that the policy in question is solely. and unambiguously an indemnification policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">The F &amp; D policy provides that \u201cThis bond affords coverage only in favor of the Insured. No suit, action or legal proceedings shall be brought hereunder by any one other than the named Insured.\u201d Bond at 5, \u00a7 5(f). This no-action clause need not be ignored under <em>Quinlan </em>since the policy is unambiguously an indemnity policy. The Louisiana high court has not extended the direct action statute\u2019s prohibition of no-action clauses to indemnity contracts in situations where a plaintiff is claiming only incorporeal injuries. <em>See Quinlan </em>at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">Because <em>Quinlan </em>provides us sufficient guidance regarding application of the Louisiana direct action statute, we deny the motion to certify. <em>See </em>La.Sup.Ct.R. 12; La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13:72.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">The bond conclusively demonstrates the intent to indemnify losses and not the intent to insure against liability. The direct action statute has no application to such a policy. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the Plaintiffs suit against F &amp; D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">Judgment AFFIRMED; motion to certify DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">. <em>Quinlan v.
