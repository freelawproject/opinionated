He presents three claims of error. We reject the first two \u2014 dealing with the district court\u2019s calculation of the loss caused by appellant\u2019s criminal activity and its treatment of appellant\u2019s possession of two stolen vehicles (not cited as part of the offense of conviction) as relevant conduct \u2014 because the findings of fact on which the district court based its decision are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">Appellant\u2019s third claim, however, has merit. In its order requiring appellant to make restitution, the district court made provision for the two vehicles not included in the offense of conviction. The court was authorized to do that, under the 1990 amendment of the Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663-3664, \u201cto the extent agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>953 F.2d 1288, 1289 (11th Cir.1992); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a). In this case, the parties\u2019 plea agreement only provided that \u201c[t]he court must/may consider ordering restitution.\u201d The agreement did not <em>require </em>restitution; nor did it specify the amount of any restitution that might be ordered. Accordingly, the court was authorized only to order restitution for the vehicle involved in the offense of conviction, to-wit: a 1993 Toyota 4-Runner.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">In sum, we reject appellant\u2019s first two challenges to his sentence; given the clear merit of his third challenge, however, we vacate the district court\u2019s restitution order and remand the case for reconsideration of the amount of restitution appellant should be required to make for the loss of the 1993 Toyota 4-Runner.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">AFFIRMED, in part; VACATED, in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
