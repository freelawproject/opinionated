Judgment having been rendered for the plaintiffs for less than twenty dollars damages, <em>Men </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Starrett </em>moved for full costs, and cited <em>Stat. 1821, ch. </em>59, <em>sec. </em>30; <em>Bickford v. Page, 2 Mass. </em>462; <em>Crocker v. Black, </em>16 <em>Mass. </em>448 ; <em>Bean v. Mayo, </em>5 <em>Greenl. 94.</em></p><p id=\"AJo\">resisted the motion ; contending that the title to real estate was not necessarily and directly involved in the suit, and that it therefore was not within the exception in the statute. The plaintiffs might have had a right to the water, without any title to the soil.</p><p id=\"b107-6\">The Court, however, considered the case as nearly similar in principle to that of <em>Crocker y. Black, </em>cited for the <em>plaintiffs; </em>and observed that here the plaintiffs, must necessarily have shown a title io the real estate, as the foundation of their right to recover. And they granted the <em>motion.</em></p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
