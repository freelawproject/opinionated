Richard Osborne was the husband of the defendant-appellee, Pamela Osborne, and the son of the plaintiffs-appellants, Virginia and Glenn Osborne.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">At the time of his death, Richard Osborne was hospitalized at Miami Valley Hospital. His parents, wife, and other family members had kept a steady vigil at the hospital. They were advised by the physicians attending Richard Osborne that there was no chance he would survive, and that death was imminent. His wife then told his parents that she had no money to pay for the expense of Richard\u2019s funeral and burial, and that she would have to \u201cturn him over\u201d to them. Upon hearing this information, plaintiffs agreed to pay the funeral and burial expenses for their son.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Later that day, plaintiffs went to Tobias Funeral Home with defendant to make the necessary arrangements. Defendant signed the contract for funeral services with Tobias Funeral Home. The plaintiffs agreed to pay for a few extras that defendant desired, but which plaintiffs believed were not necessary. A burial site was selected, and plaintiffs signed the contract purchasing a cemetery lot and internment services. Altogether, plaintiffs paid $6,184.35 for their son\u2019s funeral and burial expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">After defendant was appointed executor of the estate of Richard Osborne, plaintiffs timely presented their written claim to her in that capacity, seeking reimbursement from his estate for the amounts they paid for Richard\u2019s funeral and burial expenses. Subsequently, defendant rejected that claim. Plaintiffs then commenced this action in common pleas court against defendant in her capacity as executor of Richard Osborne\u2019s estate, seeking to recover from the estate the money they expended for Richard\u2019s funeral and burial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">The case was referred by the trial court to a magistrate. Trial was held on November 6, 1995. Plaintiff Virginia Osborne was the only witness to testify. On December 7, 1995, the magistrate issued her decision for defendant. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>tiffs timely filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On February 7, 1996, the trial court overruled plaintiffs\u2019 objections and approved the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Plaintiffs have now timely appealed to this court, presenting two related assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">First Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision finding judgment for the defendant-appellee and denying the plaintiffs-appellants claim was in error as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">Second Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in its application of contract law to the facts of this particular case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Obligations incurred by a deceased during his or her lifetime become debts of his or her estate after death by operation of law. Obligations incurred after death for the benefit of the decedent\u2019s estate are likewise debts of the estate. Both kinds of debts must be presented in claims to the deceased\u2019s personal representative. R.C. 2117.06(A). A person whose claim has been presented and not rejected is a creditor of the estate. R.C. 2117.06(H). A creditor may bring an action on a rejected claim. R.C. 2117.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">The bill of a funeral director is a claim against the estate which is given a high priority for payment. R.C. 2117.25. When that bill is paid by another, the same priority does not apply. Any claim for reimbursement is a claim against the estate to be considered with other creditor\u2019s claims. The question, then, is (1) whether the claim is an obligation of the estate which it must pay, and (2) whether the estate has the resources to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">R.C. 3103.03(A) states: \u201cEach married person must support himself or herself and his or her spouse out of his or her property or by his or her labor.\u201d This obligation is fundamental to the marriage, and has long been held to require a husband to pay for his wife\u2019s funeral expenses. <em>McClellan v. Filson </em>(1886), 44 Ohio St. 184, 5 N.E. 861; <em>Phillips v. Tolerton </em>(1908), 9 Ohio N.P.(N.S.) 565, 20 Ohio Dec. 249, affirmed (1910), 82 Ohio St. 403, 92 N.E. 1121. See, also, <em>Hunter v. McKinney </em>(C.P.1951), 69 Ohio Law Abs. 237, 46 O.O. 17, 101 N.E.2d 810; <em>Davis-Turner Funeral Home v. Chaney </em>(1991), 61 Ohio Misc.2d 82, 573 N.E.2d 1242; <em>J.C. Battle &amp; Sons Funeral Home v. Chambers </em>(1993), 63 Ohio Misc.2d 441, 631 N.E.2d 203. The obligation is now imposed on wives as well as husbands by the reciprocal provisions of R.C. 3103.03(A). See 33 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1982), Decedents\u2019 Estates, Section 1461. Division (E) of R.C. 3103.03 implies that a surviving spouse\u2019s duty of support includes payment of the deceased spouse\u2019s funeral expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Defendant had an obligation in law to pay her deceased husband\u2019s funeral expenses. That obligation was personal to her. The magistrate reasoned that plaintiffs had no claim against the estate for reimbursement because they failed to demonstrate that the payments they made were not a loan or gift to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">If the payments that plaintiffs made were a loan or gift to defendant, that may, if properly pleaded, be a defense available to her in any claim made or action for reimbursement brought against her personally by plaintiffs. However, this claim was against the estate, which has a separate obligation of reimbursement, because payment of Richard Osborne\u2019s funeral and burial expenses benefited his estate. Therefore, any defenses available to defendant personally have no application to the claim or action brought against her as personal representative of the estate, absent evidence that those defenses are available to the estate, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The dealings between these parties prior to Richard Osborne\u2019s death are insufficient to support a conclusion that the payments that plaintiffs made were a loan or gift to his estate. They merely acted in reliance on the representations of defendant that they must pay the costs incurred for their son\u2019s burial because <em>she </em>had no money to pay those costs. The gift and loan defenses may apply to her, personally, but on this record they create no basis in law to excuse the estate from its duty of reimbursement, which is independent of defendant\u2019s duty in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">It has long been the law of Ohio that a person other than a surviving spouse who pays the deceased\u2019s funeral expenses, not as an officious volunteer or meddler but out of the necessity of the occasion, is entitled to reimbursement from the estate of the deceased, provided the bill is reasonable. <em>Texler v. Marquard </em>(M.C. 1939), 29 Ohio Law Abs. 186, 14 O.O. 381, 3 Ohio Supp. 226; <em>Markland v. Younker </em>(1957), 106 Ohio App. 224, 6 O.O.2d 468, 154 N.E.2d 22; 33 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1982), Decedents\u2019 Estates, Section 1455. If plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the estate arose from meddlesome or officious conduct, the estate may be excused from reimbursement. That is not demonstrated by this record, however, and it is unreasonable to classify parents who are told that their son is about to die and that no money is available to bury him as either meddlesome or officious when they agree to pay their son\u2019s funeral and burial expenses at the suggestion and request of the person legally responsible to pay them. Their agreement to pay those expenses was sought by the defendant, and their action is a natural response by grieving parents who are entitled to reimbursement from the deceased\u2019s estate, if monies are available.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for reimbursement made from the estate of Richard Osborne.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-6\">Brogan, P.J., and Fain, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
