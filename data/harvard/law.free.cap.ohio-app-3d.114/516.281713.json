We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">On the night of July 29,1995, three masked men dressed in dark, hooded sweat clothes rushed into Taco\u2019s Avenue Cafe in Akron. The first man jumped across the bar and took money from the cash register while the second man held a shotgun on the bartender and the customers. The third man stood lookout at the door. The robbery was over in a matter of minutes, and the three men fled the bar. McElrath and another suspect were arrested shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">McElrath was originally tried in November 1995, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict, and a mistrial was declared. He was retried thirty-one days later. Following his second trial, McElrath was found guilty of aggravated robbery and complicity to commit aggravated robbery, each with a firearm specification, and grand theft with a prior theft offense specification. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>aggravated robbery and grand theft counts were merged with the complicity count, and McElrath was convicted accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">McElrath appeals, and raises four assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The first assignment of error is that the trial court violated McElrath\u2019s right to a speedy trial. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2) provides that a defendant facing a felony charge must be brought to trial \u201cwithin two hundred seventy days after his arrest.\u201d Pursuant to the triple-count provision, each day the accused is incarcerated in lieu of bail counts as three days for speedy trial purposes. R.C. 2945.71(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">McElrath does not dispute that he waived his right to a speedy trial prior to his first trial. He contends, however, that this waiver did not extend to his reindictment and retrial. Whether his prior waiver was still in effect is irrelevant because, at that point, McElrath no longer had a statutory right to a speedy trial. The speedy trial protections of R.C. 2945.71 pertain only to the original trial and have no application to a retrial following a mistrial because of a hung jury. <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 20-21, 1 OBR 57, 58, 437 N.E.2d 583, 585. The standard to be applied in this situation is one of reasonableness under the United States and Ohio Constitutions. <em>Id. </em>at 21, 1 OBR at 58, 437 N.E.2d at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">McElrath was retried thirty-one days after the trial court declared the mistrial. For at least fourteen of the thirty-one days, the trial court proceedings were stayed because McElrath had prematurely appealed the speedy trial issue. He dismissed his appeal shortly thereafter. Given that the delay between the first and second trial was only thirty-one days and that nearly half of this period was necessitated by McElrath\u2019s own action, McElrath has failed to convince us that he was not tried within a reasonable period of time. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">As his second assignment of error, McElrath contends that his three-year sentence on the firearm specification must be reversed because the state failed to prove that the crime was committed with a firearm. McElrath\u2019s third assignment of error is closely related to his second. McElrath argues that, because there was no proof that he used a firearm, he could not be convicted of armed robbery pursuant to R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). Both assignments of error hinge on whether the state presented sufficient evidence that the alleged shotgun used during the robbery was in fact a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, an appellate court must examine the evidence admitted at trial, in a light most favorable to the prosecution, and determine whether the evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u201cFirearm\u201d is defined in R.C. 2923.11(B) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c(1) * * * any deadly weapon capable of expelling or propelling one or more projectiles by the action of an explosive or combustible propellant. \u2018Firearm\u2019 includes an unloaded firearm, and any firearm which is inoperable but which can readily be rendered operable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201c(2) When determining whether a firearm is capable of expelling or propelling one or more projectiles by the action of an explosive or combustible propellant, the trier of fact may rely upon circumstantial evidence, including, but not limited to, the representations and actions of the individual exercising control over the firearm.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 206, 551 N.E.2d 932, syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">We evaluate the evidence of a firearm\u2019s operability by examining the totality of the circumstances. <em>Murphy, supra, </em>at 208, 551 N.E.2d at 934-935. In cases such as this where no shots were fired and the firearm was never recovered, circumstantial evidence such as the \u201crepresentations and actions of the individual exercising control over the firearm\u201d are of crucial importance. The Ohio Supreme Court has found sufficient circumstantial evidence of operability where the defendant brandishes the firearm, points it at his victims, who later describe the firearm, and threatens to kill them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In <em>State v. Nelson </em>(Aug. 18, 1995), Montgomery App. No. 14775, unreported, 1995 WL 491084, the Second District Court of Appeals explained that it had previously determined that implicit threats were insufficient to establish operability. See <em>State v. Dixon </em>(Nov. 1, 1993), Greene App. No. 93-CA-18, unreported, 1993 WL 452012. The court in <em>Dixon </em>had certified the following question to the Ohio Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">\u201cWhere a defendant brandishes a gun and implicitly but not expressly threatens to use the gun as a gun, are those implicit threats sufficient to establish the operability of the gun so that the defendant can be found guilty of a firearm specification?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">The Ohio Supreme Court, in <em>State v. Dixon </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 608, 609, 646 N.E.2d 453, had answered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">\u201cThe judgment of the court of appeals is reversed as to the certified issue only, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated on the authority of <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 206, 551 N.E.2d 932.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">Therefore, in <em>Nelson, supra, </em>the Second District Court of Appeals concluded, upon the authority of <em>Dixon, supra, </em>that the implicit threat of brandishing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>firearm and pointing it at an intended victim supports an inference that the firearm was operable. At least one other appellate court has likewise interpreted <em>Dixon </em>to expand the <em>Murphy </em>operability criteria to include brandishing the firearm so as to threaten the victim. <em>State v. Gest </em>(1995), 108 Ohio App.3d 248, 670 N.E.2d 536; but, see <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(Nov. 22, 1995), Hamilton App. No. C-940513, unreported, 1995 WL 688789, (refusing to follow <em>Nelson </em>absent further guidance from the Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">With this additional consideration in mind, we now examine the totality of the circumstances during the robbery at Taco\u2019s Avenue Cafe. Three masked men rushed into Taco\u2019s, one of them wielding a shotgun. The gunman pointed the shotgun directly at the customers and bartender while another man took cash from the register. According to the bartender, the implicit threat of the shotgun \u201cpetrified\u201d her. \u201cI thought I was going to die.\u201d She described the firearm as a sawed-off shotgun because the barrel was \u201cvery round\u201d and the opening was \u201cbigger than a quarter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The owner of the bar, who was also present during the robbery, corroborated the bartender\u2019s testimony. He further testified that a piece of the stock of the gun fell off during the robbery. This piece of metal was admitted into evidence. One of the investigating police officers testified that this piece of shotgun stock had been sawed off into a pistol grip. He explained that shotguns are sawed off to make them shorter for purposes of appearance and concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">This evidence, taken as a whole, was sufficient to convince the average mind that the robbery was committed with an operable firearm. MeElrath\u2019s second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">McElrath\u2019s fourth assignment of error is that the trial court violated several of his constitutional rights by allowing the state to use its peremptory challenges to exclude African Americans from the venire. The state exercised five peremptory challenges in this case, three of which were used to exclude African-American jurors. McElrath raised an objection under <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69, to the exclusion of each of these jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Traditionally, peremptory challenges have enabled parties to remove from the venire any person they believed would be more likely to find for the opponent, regardless of their reasons for thinking so. In <em>Batson, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized an exception to this general rule. <em>Batson </em>established that the state may not use peremptory challenges against veniremen solely on the basis of their race.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">In analyzing the merits of a <em>Batson </em>challenge, a court follows the three-part test. \u201cFirst, the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of race. Second, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>requisite showing has been made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the jurors in question. Finally, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Hernandez v. New York </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 352, 358-359, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d 395, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The state\u2019s first peremptory challenge was used to exclude a Caucasian from the venire. The second challenge was used to exclude an African American. McElrath raised a <em>Batson </em>objection to this peremptory challenge, and demanded a race-neutral explanation for the exclusion of this juror. The prosecutor did not give a race-neutral explanation, because he believed that McElrath had failed to establish a prima facie showing that the juror had been excluded because of his race. The trial court overruled McElrath\u2019s objection, apparently agreeing that he had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">To make a prima facie case of such purposeful discrimination, a defendant must demonstrate (a) that members of a recognized racial group were peremptorily challenged and (b) that the \u201c \u2018facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor\u2019 \u201d used the peremptory challenges to exclude jurors \u201c \u2018on account of their race.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hernandez </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 577, 582, 589 N.E.2d 1310, 1313, quoting <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1723, 90 L.Ed.2d at 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">McElrath points to no surrounding circumstances, but relies solely on the peremptory challenge itself. The mere fact that the state exercised its second peremptory challenge to exclude an African American does not, in and of itself, raise an inference that the state used the challenge to impermissibly exclude an African-American juror. Therefore, McElrath failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The state\u2019s third and fifth peremptory challenges excluded two more African Americans, Ms. Barker and Ms. Long. Following each of McElrath\u2019s objections, the state offered an explanation for the exclusion of the juror in question. McElrath contends that the state\u2019s explanations were not race-neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The race-neutral explanation offered by the state need not rise to the level of a challenge for cause. It need not be compelling, nor need it be \u201cpersuasive, or even plausible. \u2018At this * * * step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\u2019\u201d <em>Purkett v. Elem </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 765, 766, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 1770, 131 L.Ed.2d 834, 839-40, quoting <em>Hernandez v. New York, supra, </em>500 U.S. at 360, 111 S.Ct. at 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The state explained that its reason for excluding Barker was that her son had been convicted of drug trafficking. The state\u2019s explanation for excluding Long was based on her prior experience with the Summit County Child Support Enforcement Agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201cWhen I asked her whether or not she was satisfied with her service there, she had a long pause and she had a very disgruntled look on her face, and as a result, because it is one of the divisions of the prosecutor\u2019s office, Your Honor, the State would indicate that\u2019s the reason, race-neutral reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We find no racially discriminatory intent inherent in either of the state\u2019s explanations. Each reason demonstrates a concern by the state that the person may have had a negative experience with the prosecutor\u2019s office, and might therefore have a bias against the prosecution. The explanations for the exclusion of these jurors were therefore race neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The trial court overruled each of McElrath\u2019s <em>Batson </em>objections, apparently concluding that the state did not exercise its peremptory challenges with a racially discriminatory intent. The trial court\u2019s finding on this third prong of the test \u201clargely * * * turn[s] on evaluation of credibility.\u201d <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1724, 90 L.Ed.2d at 89, fn. 21. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s determination must be granted great deference, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a demonstration that it is clearly erroneous. <em>Hernandez v. New York, supra, </em>500 U.S. at 364-365, 111 S.Ct. at 1868-1869, 114 L.Ed.2d at 409. McElrath has failed to convince us that the trial court\u2019s determination was clearly erroneous. The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-9\">Slaby, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b564-10\">Baird, P.J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b564-11\">Baird, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A7U\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">Though I agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning as to the weapon\u2019s characteristics as a firearm, I write separately only to make the point that the resolution of the third assignment of error is not dependent on that analysis. As to the aggravated robbery charge, the item carried need not necessarily be a firearm, but could be a deadly weapon. See <em>State v. Powers </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 696, 667 N.E.2d 32.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
