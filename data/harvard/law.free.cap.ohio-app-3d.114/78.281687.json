Boehman, appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals from his conviction in Xenia Municipal Court for speeding, in violation of Xenia Codified Ordinances 335.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">App.R. 16(A) requires an appellant to present a statement of assignments of error for review. Boehman has failed to do that. However, a reading of his brief prompts us to conclude that Boehman has assigned error in the following respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">\u201cBoehman\u2019s conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">In reviewing either the weight or sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction, the same test is applied. Our function is to examine the evidence admitted at trial and to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>On the trial of a case, either civil or criminal, the weight to be given the evidence and credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trial court. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212. An appellate court abuses its discretion by substituting its judgment for that of the trier of fact as to the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Walker </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 208, 9 O.O.3d 152, 378 N.E.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Xenia Police Patrolman Fred Meadows testified that he clocked Boehman\u2019s speed on the K-55 radar unit in his police cruiser as seventy-three miles per hour. Meadows further testified that Boehman was traveling at that speed in a zone in which the maximum posted speed is fifty-five miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Boehman contends that Officer Meadows lied concerning the lane in which Boehman was traveling, the speed at which he traveled, Meadows\u2019s use of the radar to determine Boehman\u2019s speed, and the effect of broadcasting towers on the operation of his radar unit. These arguments raise issues concerning Meadows\u2019s credibility, and are primarily for the trial court. <em>State v. DeHass, supra. </em>That court presumably chose to believe Officer Meadows, implicitly rejecting Boehman\u2019s attacks on his credibility. We may not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court in that respect. <em>State v. Walker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Boehman sought to impeach Officer Meadows\u2019s credibility through questions calculated to demonstrate that his vehicle was incapable of traveling at seventy-three miles per hour and that Officer Meadows had misrepresented Boehman\u2019s speed. The following in the trial transcript.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201c[BY MR. BOEHMAN]: Was my engine running when you pulled me over and when you approached my vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201cA. I,don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">\u201cQ. Did you observe whether or not my vehicle was diesel powered or gasoline powered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">\u201cMS. GOLDIE: Objection, I don\u2019t see what that relevance is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained. It doesn\u2019t make any difference. Let\u2019s go on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">\u201cQ. Now, I think your testimony was that when you saw me I was in the righthand lane, you saw me east of Xenia, or east of Home Avenue, is that correct, at the Xenia corporation limit? Is that \u2014 I think that is where you testified you first saw my vehicle, is it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201cA. Somewhere just inside the corporation limits, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cQ. How long is the corporation limits in that section?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\u201cA. I\u2019m going to estimate it to be about a half mile, 3 quarters of a mile, maybe. I\u2019ve never measured it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201cQ. Would it surprise you if I had told you that I had measured it and it\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeh\">\u201cA. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: That is not a question, sir, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">\u201cMr. Boehman: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">\u201cQ. So you said you saw me change from the right-hand lane to the left-hand lane and speed up to two miles per hour, from 71 to 73.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">\u201cQ. What was the speed at which you ticketed the previous driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">\u201cMS. GOLDIE: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-14\">\u201cMR. BOEHMAN: And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: It\u2019s irrelevant. Let\u2019s go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-16\">\u201cQ. What time did you ticket the previous driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-17\">\u201cMS. GOLDIE: Objection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtO\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-18\">\u201cMR. BOEHMAN: Your Honor, I think it\u2019s very important for my case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t. So go on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-19\">\u201cQ. Where exactly was your car parked when you were running stationary radar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-20\">\u201cA. I was north of the turn around that is located in the medial strip there on 35.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-21\">\u201cQ. Would you want to estimate how far north?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-22\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t really remember exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-23\">\"Q. Do you know where there are signs in the median at the turn around saying, \u2018No U-turn Permitted,\u2019 or something of that sort?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-24\">\u201cA. I believe there is, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-25\">\u201cQ. Were there two signs, one for traffic heading in your orientation northbound, one for heading southbound?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-26\">\u201cA. I believe there is but I couldn\u2019t swear to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-27\">\u201cQ. Was there anybody with me in my automobile at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, there was a female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201cQ. You also said that you offered to let me look at the radar, your radar screen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201cQ. Your radar output. Is it not true that I demanded to look at it and you then said I could, is that not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">\u201cA. That is also correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">\u201cQ. Which one is accurate, that you offered or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">\u201cA. I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sir, It really doesn\u2019t make any difference, so let\u2019s go on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">Each of the foregoing lines of questioning, while not artfully presented, sought responses that could impeach Officer Meadows\u2019s credibility with respect to his testimony that Boehman was traveling at seventy-three miles per hour. Boehman had a right to seek to impeach Officer Meadows\u2019s credibility. Evid.R. 607. The evidence he sought was relevant to that purpose. Evid.R. 401. All relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402. As the issue involved was critical to Boehman\u2019s guilt or innocence, the court\u2019s rulings affected his substantial rights. Therefore, Boehman was not required to make an offer of proof in order to demonstrate an abuse of discretion as the evidence was excluded during cross-examination. Evid.R. 103(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Boehman\u2019s conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence that was presented at trial. However, Boehman\u2019s ability to contest the weight of that evidence, at trial and on appeal, was prejudiced by the court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">\u201cOfficer Meadows was not competent to testify concerning use of the K-55 radar unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-17\">Boehman contends that the trial court erred when it permitted Officer Meadows to testify concerning Boehman\u2019s speed as determined by the reading obtained from Meadows\u2019s K-55 radar unit because Meadows was not sufficiently familiar with its operation. More specifically, Boehman contends that Meadows did not know what the frequency of the unit was and how it might produce false readings.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">Officer Meadows testified that he\u2019d received eight hours training in use of the K-55 radar unit. Whether that training was a sufficient foundation for his testimony concerning his use of the K-55 radar unit to determine Boehman\u2019s speed is a question reserved for the sound discretion of the trial court. Evid.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>702. Courts have taken judicial notice of the reliability of radar units of this kind. <em>Cleveland v. Ferell </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 298, 7 O.O.2d 6, 154 N.E.2d 630. Therefore, the question for the trial court was whether Meadows\u2019s training was sufficient to demonstrate him to be competent to testify concerning his use of the K-55 unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Boehman contends that the trial court unreasonably prevented him from asking Officer Meadows questions that would demonstrate his lack of competence to use the K-55 radar unit. The following colloquies from Boehman\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Meadows support that contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201c[BY MR. BOEHMAN]: Are you aware of what circumstances can lead to false readings on the type of radar you were using? In other words, what were you taught in radar school about what can cause false readings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201cMS. GOLDIE: I\u2019m going to object to the relevance of this, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t see any relevance in it. Let\u2019s go on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">\u201cQ. What conditions have to exist for Doppler shift police radar to give accurate vehicles speed measurements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">\u201cMS. GOLDIE: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">\u201cA. I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I sustained the objection. Let\u2019s go on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">Each of the foregoing were questions that Boehman was entitled to ask in order to rebut evidence that Officer Meadows was competent to use the K-55 radar unit to determine the speed at which he was traveling. The trial court abused its discretion when it prohibited them, resulting in prejudice to Boehman for the reasons discussed before.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-16\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">\u201cThe acting municipal court judge was not qualified and/or was biased against defendant Boehman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">The qualifications of municipal court judges are set out in R.C. 1901.06:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-19\">\u201cA municipal judge during his term of office shall be a qualified elector and a resident of the territory of the court to which he is elected or appointed. A municipal judge shall have been admitted to the practice of law in this state and shall have been, for a total of at least six years preceding his appointment or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>commencement of his term, engaged in the practice of law in this state or served as a judge of a court of record in any jurisdiction in the United States, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">R.C. 1901.10(A)(2) provides that the elected judge of a single-judge municipal court may appoint a substitute who is otherwise qualified pursuant to R.C. 1901.06 to hold the position of acting judge during the temporary absence of the municipal judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The Xenia Municipal Court is a single-judge municipal court. On the date of Boehman\u2019s trial, attorney David Cox of Xenia was apparently appointed acting judge of- that court. Boehman has not demonstrated how attorney Cox was not qualified for that position. Even if he was not, that issue is not open to collateral attack in this proceeding. <em>Leach v. Dixon </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 757, 586 N.E.2d 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Finally, as to the impartiality of the acting judge, Boehman has failed to demonstrate how his rulings were motived by that form of defect. Perhaps Boehman\u2019s unfamiliarity with trial procedure produced exasperated reactions from the court in the course of the trial. However, we cannot find that the verdict against Boehman resulted from a lack of impartiality on the part of the acting judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Having sustained the first and second assignments of error, we will reverse Boehman\u2019s conviction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-11\">Brogan, P.J., and Fain, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
