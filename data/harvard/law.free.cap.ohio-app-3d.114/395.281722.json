Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\">On November 22, 1995, defendant was charged with committing domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A), a first degree misdemeanor. The matter came for trial before a jury on April 2,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">By entry filed April 4, 1996, the trial court dismissed the case. The trial court\u2019s entry of dismissal provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-16\">\u201cThis cause was commenced on 4-2-96 and ended on 4-3-96, a mistrial being declared due to misconduct of primary prosecution witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>a # ;(: ;j&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cThe court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cThat the prosecution witness, despite repeated warnings, irrevocably tainted these proceedings and destroyed the defendant\u2019s right to a fair jury trial by making nonresponsive highly prejudicial and inflammatory remarks, the accumulated effect of which could no longer be cured by instructions to the jury. Such conduct occurred during the witness\u2019 direct examination by the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\u201cFurther, then, the defendant having been placed in jeopardy, the Court ordered the case dismissed since it could not proceed on its merits any further.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">On appeal, the city sets forth the following assignment of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law when it dismissed the domestic violence charge as being barred by double jeopardy after the defense successfully sought a mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Under its single assignment of error, the city contends that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the case on double jeopardy grounds was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 70, 641 N.E.2d 1082, 1097, the Ohio Supreme Court addressed the rule regarding the applicability of the doctrine of double jeopardy where a criminal defendant successfully moves for a mistrial, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">\u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects a criminal defendant from repeated prosecutions for the same offense. <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 667, 671, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2087, 72 L.Ed.2d 416, 422. When a trial court grants a criminal defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a retrial. <em>Id. </em>at 673, 102 S.Ct. at 2088, 72 L.Ed.2d at 423. A narrow exception lies where the request for a mistrial is precipitated by prosecutorial misconduct that was intentionally calculated to cause or invite a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 678-679, 102 S.Ct. at 2091, 72 L.Ed.2d at 427. See, also, <em>State v. Doherty </em>(1984), 20 Ohio App.3d 275, 20 OBR 338, 485 N.E.2d 783. Only where the prosecutorial conduct in question is intended to \u2018goad\u2019 the defendant into moving for a mistrial may defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion. <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. at 676, 102 S.Ct. at 2089, 72 L.Ed.2d at 425.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">In the present case, defense counsel made a motion for mistrial during the prosecution\u2019s direct examination of the city\u2019s first witness, Cynthia G. Wood, the wife of defendant. Specifically, during direct examination, the prosecutor questioned the witness about the events of November 21, 1995, which gave rise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>domestic violence charge. Wood testified that, at approximately 9:30 p.m., she was at home with the defendant and the couple\u2019s two children. Wood was watching television when she and the defendant got into an argument. In describing the argument, Wood interjected comments about previous alleged incidents of violence by the defendant. The first remark prompting an objection by defense counsel came during the following portion of direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201cQ. [THE PROSECUTOR]: How did that argument progress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">\u201cA. We were both arguing initially, and Donald \u2014 I had said I had a headache, and I didn\u2019t really want to talk about things. He had hit me in the head numerous times that morning after another \u2014 during another incident before this had all happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor. Move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Objection noted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">\u201cMa\u2019am, would you please answer the question directly. You were asked to answer what had happened during the course of this argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">\u201cThe jurors are instructed to disregard the other remarks made by the witness about the alleged incident from the morning at this particular time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Following this admonition by the trial court, Wood resumed her account of the argument. Wood testified that the defendant told Ryan, the couple\u2019s son, to get him some Tylenol. Wood stated that when Ryan brought his father the wrong bottle, the defendant started yelling at Ryan. Wood told the defendant to stop yelling at their son, prompting the defendant to throw the medicine bottle at her. The testimony then proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">\u201cQ. What happened after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">\u201cA. After that, Ryan went back over to his table to do his homework and to finish up his homework, and the argument continued between us along the same lines, as far as unemployment. And he felt I was nagging at him. And it continued, but really didn\u2019t go anywhere until Donald jumped out of his chair, stood up. His fists were clenched. His eyes were bulging, and he said, \u2018Go to bed. Go to bed. Go to bed.\u2019 He screamed it. He screamed it out loud, just in general and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\">\u201cQ. Was it time for the children to go to bed, or was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-15\">\u201cA. It was getting near bedtime, but this was what he normally did when he was about ready to hurt me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-16\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor. Move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Motion to strike is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-18\">\u201cMa\u2019am, answer the question, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u201cAgain, the jurors are instructed to disregard the portion of the response that was not responsive to the question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Following this second admonition by the trial court, Wood continued with her account of the incident. Wood testified that Ryan jumped up from the table and stood, looking perplexed; he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what he was supposed to do, because he didn\u2019t know why he was being screamed at.\u201d The prosecutor then asked Wood the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201cQ. What was Ryan doing? He was doing his homework?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201cA. He was doing his homework at the table. I could see him from where I was at in the great room. And I looked over at him when he was * * * doing this. He stood up and kind of looked around, kind of not knowing \u2014 he said, What?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection as to what anybody else said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Objection noted, overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">\u201cA. And he kind of looked around, and Don just \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t move fast enough or what, but Don barreled right after him -with his hands out. And Ryan went into the dining area, which is adjacent to our kitchen, ran around the table * * *. And Ryan ran around the table. Don caught him on the other side, grabbed Ryan with his right hand, grabbed Ryan right here, like here, and kind of threw him, like this. (Indicating.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\u201cRyan stumbled, caught himself, didn\u2019t actually fall. I stood up at that time, and I started yelling at Don that he wasn\u2019t going to hurt my son like this. He has hurt me for 11 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Counsel approach the bench, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-14\">U ^ # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-15\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May I make a motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-17\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m moving for a mistrial, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-19\">\u201cYour witness has been instructed three times to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-20\">\u201cMa\u2019am, your own testimony has tainted this particular trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-21\">\u201cThe case is dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-22\">As previously noted, when a trial court grants a criminal defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a retrial except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>where the request for mistrial \u201cis precipitated by prosecutorial misconduct that was intentionally calculated to cause or invite a mistrial.\u201d <em>Loza, supra, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 70, 641 N.E.2d at 1097. In the present case, defendant contends that the trial court properly held that retrial of the defendant was barred on double jeopardy grounds because the prosecutor intentionally engaged in conduct intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The record in this case provides no evidence to support a contention that the prosecutor had a motive for seeking to provoke defense counsel into moving for a mistrial; the evidence \u201cdoes not reflect the state\u2019s desire for a continuance, the unavailability of a particular witness, or the state\u2019s lack of preparation for trial.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(Feb. 23, 1995), Franklin App. No. 94APA04-542, unreported, 1995 WL 78912. Further, the questions posed by the prosecutor were directed to the events giving rise to the domestic violence charge at issue and such questions \u201cdid not request an answer which would necessitate defendant\u2019s moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also note that there is no indication from the trial court\u2019s entry of dismissal that the court found intentional misconduct on the part of the prosecutor; rather, the entry only refers to the unresponsive remarks of the witness. There is no evidence to suggest that the responses by the witness were anticipated by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Defendant argues that, even if the questions posed by the prosecutor were not intended to elicit prejudicial comments, it was incumbent upon the prosecutor to ask for a recess in order to get the witness under control. We would agree that the better practice would have been for the prosecutor to request a brief recess; however, while the prosecutor may have exercised poor judgment in failing to make such a request, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct amounted to no more than negligence as opposed to intentional conduct. A retrial is not barred on double jeopardy grounds \u201cwhere negligence on the part of the government, rather than intentional misconduct, requires the court to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.\u201d <em>State v. Van Sickle </em>(Sept. 18, 1986), Franklin App. No. 86AP-98, unreported, 1986 WL 10415. See, also, <em>United States v. Dinitz </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 600, 607, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 1079-1080, 47 L.Ed.2d 267, 274 (where circumstances develop not attributable to prosecutorial overreaching, a motion for mistrial by the defendant is \u201cordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defendant\u2019s motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Accordingly, we agree with the city\u2019s contention that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, in dismissing the case on the grounds that double jeopardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>prevented the action from \u201cproceed[ing] on its merits any further.\u201d The facts of this case indicate no constitutional impediment to a retrial following the court\u2019s declaration of mistrial on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Based upon the foregoing, the city\u2019s single assignment of error is sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b443-7\">Bowman and John C. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\">. We note that there is no contention by either the city or defendant that the trial court abused its discretion in declaring a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
