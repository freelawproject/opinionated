Sisler appeals from his conviction for a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), which prohibits operation of a motor vehicle by a person who \u201chas a concentration of ten hundredths of one per cent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood.\u201d The conviction was entered on a plea of no contest, which Sisler voluntarily made after the state agreed to dismiss other charges. On appeal, Sisler argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence and his motion to dismiss the charges against him on grounds of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">On September 9, 1994, at approximately 4:00 p.m., officers of the Springfield Police Division stopped defendant Sisler for operating his vehicle left of center. The officers subsequently arrested Sisler on an OMVI charge, impounded his vehicle, and seized the tags from it. Sisler was transported to the Clark County Jail for a breath-alcohol test.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">At the jail, Sisler fell to the floor and injured his head. Smelling salts were administered. Sisler claims that this caused an attack of asthma. That is not corroborated; however, it is undisputed that officers transported Sisler to the emergency room of Mercy Medical Center in Springfield for examination and any treatment that might be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">At the hospital, Officer Rick L. Blackburn presented Sisler with a written form prescribed by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, which explains the consequences of a driver\u2019s refusal to provide a sample of his blood, breath, or urine on the request of an officer after being arrested for OMVI. Officer Blackburn also read those provisions to Sisler, who was handcuffed to the bed on which he lay.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">When Officer Blackburn told Sisler that he wished to have a sample of Sisler\u2019s blood withdrawn to test its alcohol content and asked Sisler if he had any objection, Sisler responded, \u201cI don\u2019t care what the f* * * you do,\u201d repeating the statement several times. However, when a hospital technician approached Sisler to withdraw blood from his arm, Sisler began to struggle violently. The assistance of Officer Blackburn and another police officer, two hospital security officers, a physician, and a nurse was required to hold Sisler down while the technician drew blood from his arm. Several efforts to insert a needle into his veins were unsuccessful, but blood was finally drawn. The blood sample withdrawn later tested twenty-two hundredths of one per cent of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Sisler filed a motion to suppress evidence of the blood test results, arguing that it had been withdrawn without his consent in violation of his R.C. 4511.191(D) right of refusal and in violation of his right to due process of law guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The trial court heard evidence on Sisler\u2019s motion. The court found that Sisler\u2019s struggles \u201cduring the blood drawing was not due to a lack of consent or to withdrawal of consent; rather, such behavior was consistent with that displayed throughout the arrest process.\u201d Accordingly, the court overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Sisler also moved to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that his prosecution for OMVT was barred as double jeopardy by reason of the prior administrative suspension of his license. That motion was also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">After changing his plea to one of no contest, Sisler was convicted of a single violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2). He has timely appealed, and now presents two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress as no consent to draw blood from the appellant was established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">R.C. 4511.191(D), the \u201cimplied consent\u201d statute, does not create a right of refusal or expand on the constitutional guarantees afforded a criminal accused. <em>State v. Runnels </em>(1989), 56 Ohio App.3d 120, 565 N.E.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">\u201cRather, R.C. 4511.191(D) is a civil remedy enacted by the legislature to facilitate the administrative revocation of a driver\u2019s license where a driver arrested for driving while intoxicated refuses to submit to a blood-alcohol test. <em>See Hoban v. Rice </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 111, 54 O.O.2d 254, 267 N.E.2d 311. Compliance with the procedures outlined in R.C. 4522.292(D) is not a prerequisite to establish the admissibility of blood test results in a criminal case involving drunken driving. <em>State v. Stinson </em>(1984), 21 Ohio App.3d 14, 21 OBR 15, 486 N.E.2d 831, paragraph one of the syllabus. A blood test that does not comply with R.C. 4511.191 may still be admitted into evidence so long as a proper foundation for admission is established. <em>Id.; </em>see, also, <em>State v. Dress </em>(1982), 10 Ohio App.3d 258, 10 OBR 372, 461 N.E.2d 1312.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 565 N.E.2d at 616-617.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Withdrawal of a sample of blood from the body of a criminal accused in order to determine its alcohol or drug content for the purpose of proving a criminal charge is a search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Schmerber v. California </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908. In the absence of a judicial warrant, the withdrawal of blood is <em>per se </em>unreasonable and illegal unless the state demonstrates an exception to the warrant requirement that renders the search reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has frequently recognized that a warrantless search is constitutionally permissible where a valid consent to the search has been obtained. See Annotation(1974), 36 L.Ed.2d 1143. The consent operates as a waiver of the constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures, provided that it is voluntary. Whether the evidence on which the state relies is sufficient to demonstrate consent is a mixed question of the law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The trial court found that Sisler\u2019s statement that was given in response to Officer Blackburn\u2019s request to withdraw a sample of his blood, \u201cI don\u2019t care what the f* * * you do,\u201d demonstrated Sisler\u2019s consent to the search and seizure involved. We agree. While Sisler\u2019s subsequent struggles could manifest withdrawal of the consent he had given, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s finding that his struggles were, instead, further examples of Sisler\u2019s disruptive conduct, and not a change of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Whether Sisler gave his consent to withdraw his blood or he did not, however, the officers were nevertheless authorized to proceed to obtain a sample of Sisler\u2019s blood, given the rapid elimination of alcohol from the blood stream, the time since his arrest, and the difficulty and delay in procuring a warrant before they did so. <em>Schmerber v. California, supra. </em>In that circumstance, the only further requirements imposed on them are that the procedure be conducted in a medically acceptable manner and without the use of excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Sisler\u2019s blood was withdrawn in a medically acceptable manner. Though he testified at the hearing that his arm suffered extensive bruising in the process, the procedure was performed by a qualified medical technician in a hospital setting. Indeed, Sisler offered no evidence demonstrating that his blood was not withdrawn in a medically acceptable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Sisler\u2019s motion to suppress presented not only Fourth Amendment arguments concerning the alleged lack of consent but, in addition, arguments based on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The two grounds are related, yet distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\u201cThe due process guarantee protects citizens from the arbitrary or fundamentally unfair use of government power, while the search and seizure clause requires that the government engage only in reasonable searches and seizures. Obviously, a government intrusion that violates the due process guarantee (because it is arbitrary or inconsistent with fundamental notions of justice) will also violated the search and seizure clause (because it will be unreasonable). The reverse, however, is not always true.\u201d <em>Anchorage v. Ray </em>(Alaska App. 1993), 854 P.2d 740, 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The two constitutional provisions join to require that in any search and seizure the \u201cmeans and procedures employed [must respect] relevant Fourth Amendment standards of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Schmerber v. California, supra, </em>384 U.S. at 768, 86 S.Ct. at 1834, 16 L.Ed.2d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In <em>Rochin v. California </em>(1951), 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183, two officers broke into the apartment of a suspected drug dealer and after seeing him swallow two capsules attempted to extract them by force. When their efforts failed, the officers handcuffed Rochin and took him to a hospital. At the officers\u2019 direction, a physician forced an emetic solution through a feeding tube into Rochin\u2019s stomach, causing him to vomit out the capsules. Rochin moved to suppress that evidence. His motion was denied and he was convicted. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201c[W]e are compelled to conclude that the proceedings by which this conviction was obtained do more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism about combatting crime too energetically. This is conduct that shocks the conscience. Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there, the forcible extraction of his stomach\u2019s contents \u2014 this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. They are methods too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation.\u201d 342 U.S. at 172, 72 S.Ct. at 209-210, 96 L.Ed. at 190.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The court held that Rochin\u2019s conviction was obtained by methods that offend the Due Process Clause and ordered it reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">In <em>Breithaupt v. Abram </em>(1957), 352 U.S. 432, 77 S.Ct. 408, 1 L.Ed.2d 448, a driver who was injured in an accident was taken to a hospital for treatment. Beheving him to be intoxicated, police officers directed a physician to withdraw a sample of his blood while he was unconscious. On appeal, the Supreme Court rejected the driver\u2019s due process claim, finding that under the circumstances the withdrawal did not offend the sense of justice on which Rochin was decided. The court observed, however, \u201c[T]his is not to say that the * * * taking of blood under different conditions * * * may not amount to such \u2018brutality\u2019 as would come under the <em>Rochin </em>rule.\u201d <em>Id., </em>352 U.S. at 438, 77 S.Ct. at 411-412, 1 L.Ed.2d at 452. The same result was reached in <em>Schmerber v. California, supra, </em>in which the defendant had objected to the withdrawal, but in which no force was used to perform the procedure. Relying on <em>Breithaupt </em>and distinguishing <em>Rochin, </em>the court rejected the due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">In <em>People v. Kraft </em>(1970), 3 Cal.App.3d 890, 84 Cal.Rptr. 280, the defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, handcuffed, and transported by two officers to a hospital for a blood test. He refused to consent to the test. Two officers then grabbed the defendant\u2019s arms, and they fell to the floor. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the defendant was immobilized by their weight, the officers held the defendant\u2019s left arm while a physician drew a blood sample from it with a syringe. The defendant\u2019s conviction was reversed on appeal. Acknowledging the role of the Due Process Clause laid down in <em>Rochin, supra, </em>the appellate court found that neither the Fourth Amendment nor the state\u2019s implied consent statute authorized the officers to employ the amount of force they used to conduct a search and seizure authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Bodily intrusions to obtain evidence of crime implicate privacy considerations of the highest order. <em>Schmerber v. California, supra; Winston v. Lee </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 753, 105 S.Ct. 1611, 84 L.Ed.2d 662. A consent that is sufficient as a matter of law to waive an accused\u2019s expectations of privacy in such circumstances implies consent to the methods to be used as well. However, where the method actually employed to perform the search offends a fundamental sense of justice, the resulting due process violation is not waived by the consent that was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The state had a need to obtain a sample of defendant Sisler\u2019s blood to prove the charges against him. Pursuant to the implied consent statute, the state had a right to have a sample of his blood to serve that purpose. The consent which Sisler gave authorized the state to proceed to enforce its right. However, the methods the state employed to do so offend a fundamental sense of justice, notwithstanding the fact that they were also prompted by Sisler\u2019s violent resistance to the efforts of the state\u2019s officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The courts are frequently referred to the \u201ccarnage\u201d resulting from driving under the influence of alcohol, and the terrible infliction of injury and loss of innocent life caused by that unthinking and reckless practice supports the characterization. However, reality is a factor in any assessment of conduct and the legal issues it presents. Here, reality indicates that Sisler\u2019s drunken state was readily evident, as the trial court\u2019s findings of fact demonstrate. A conviction for OMVI pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) could readily be obtained without a sample of his blood. Furthermore, Sisler\u2019s violent resistance to the state\u2019s efforts to obtain the sample so frustrated the purpose of the consent he gave that it amounted to a denial for purposes of the implied consent law, which would trigger an automatic suspension of his driving privileges. Combined with the fact that Sisler\u2019s offense was complete and that he was not capable at that moment of going anywhere, particularly after the state impounded his vehicle and seized its tags, the state\u2019s need to have a sample of Sisler\u2019s blood provides scant justification for acting as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">It offends a fundamental sense of justice, at least as this court views that concept, that an accused who has been shackled to a hospital bed is held down by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>six </em>persons while a seventh jabs at his arm with a needle in order to withdraw his blood at the direction of the state\u2019s officers. Such conduct is beyond that supportable as a measure necessary for effective law enforcement. It is a product of a dangerous zealotry and is \u201ctoo close to the rack and the screw,\u201d <em>Rochin v. California, supra, </em>342 U.S. at 172, 72 S.Ct. at 210, 96 L.Ed. at 190, to comport with due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We find that the actions of the officers undertaken to withdraw Sisler\u2019s blood violate his right to due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred when it denied Sisler\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained. Sisler\u2019s first assignment of error is, therefore, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"Ajn\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Sisler presents two arguments in support of this assignment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201c1. The imposition of punishment pursuant to R.C. 4511.191 (Administrative License Suspension) bars further prosecution as to do so would violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 10 of Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">\u201c2. R.C. 4511.19 is unconstitutional as a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution proportionality provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The first argument is rejected on the authority of <em>State v. Gustafson </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 425, 668 N.E.2d 435. The second argument was rejected by this court in <em>State v. Sanders </em>(Sept. 29, 1995), Miami App. Nos. 95 CA 11 and 95 CA 12, unreported, 1995 WL 634371. We reject it here on the same basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Having found that the trial court erred when it overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the results of the tests performed on the sample of his blood that was obtained through an illegal search and seizure, we reverse his conviction and remand to the trial court for further proceedings on the OMVI charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-15\">Fain and Frederick N.
