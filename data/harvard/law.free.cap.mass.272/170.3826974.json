The bill of exceptions states that \u201cThe accident happened on September 23, 1920, and the writ is dated December 20, 1922. No notice of the time, place and cause of the injury was given by the plaintiff to the defendant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>and more than two years elapsed between the date of the accident and the time of bringing suit.\u201d The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was allowed \u201con the grounds that no notice was given and that suit was not commenced within two years after the accident,\u201d and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show the following facts: The defendant was engaged in repairing its tracks on a street in South Boston. It had a permit from the commissioner of public works of the city, issued in accordance with the city ordinances, to \u201copen, occupy and use eighteen hundred feet in length by fifteen feet in width\u201d of the street \u201cfor the purpose of repairing tracks.\u201d In the course of its work it placed upon the sidewalk several piles of railway ties which \u201cprotruded over the curbstone a little.\u201d One pile of ties \u201c was arranged with some of the ties at the top of the pile leaning over towards the street.\u201d The plaintiff alighted from one of the defendant\u2019s cars and crossed the street to the sidewalk. While he was standing between two piles of railway ties he was knocked down, the ties fell upon him and he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">It could have been found that a motor truck, which was being driven along the street, struck the ties piled upon the sidewalk, thereby causing the plaintiff\u2019s injury. There was evidence that the body of the truck \u201cextended seven inches out beyond the line of the right front and right rear wheel rims,\u201d and other evidence as to the measurements of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">There was no error in directing a verdict for the defendant on the grounds stated by the trial judge. The case is governed by <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>249 Mass. 181. The accident there considered occurred on July 15, 1920. There was no change in the law between that date and September 23, 1920, when the accident here under consideration took place. It was held in that case that the provision of St. 1898, c. 578, \u00a7 11, reenacted in R. L. c. 112, \u00a7 44, and again in St. 1906, c. 463, Part III, \u00a7 79, with respect to notice of injury and limitation upon time for commencing action, became applicable to the defendant \u201cby force of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>St. 1916, c. 302, and was applicable when the accident . . . took place.\u201d Page 183. The statute which then became applicable to the defendant provided that a street railway company should be liable for injuries resulting \u201cfrom the carelessness, neglect or misconduct of its agents or servants\u201d engaged in \u201cthe construction, alteration, extension, repair or renewal of its railway, ... if notice of such . . . injury is given to the company and an action therefor is commenced in the manner provided by section twenty of chapter fifty-one of the Revised Laws.\u201d See St. 1906, c. 463, Part III, \u00a7 79, as amended by St. 1916, c. 302, \u00a7 1. R. L. c. 51, \u00a7 20, required a person injured \u201cwithin thirty days thereafter\u201d to give \u201cnotice of the time, place and cause of the said injury\u201d and limited the time for action to two years after the date of the injury. The plaintiff seeks to recover for injuries resulting from the \u201ccarelessness, neglect or misconduct\u201d of the defendant\u2019s agents or servants engaged in repairing its railway. Since no notice of such injuries was given and the action was not commenced within two years after the accident, under the decision of the <em>Reynolds </em>case, the plaintiff cannot recover. We see no adequate reason why that case should not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">As what we have said disposes of the case it is unnecessary to determine whether a verdict for the defendant could have been directed on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
