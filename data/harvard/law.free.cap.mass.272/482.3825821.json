The master to whom the case was referred found subsidiary facts and found further that \"the transactions of Eatough with . . . [the respondent] did not constitute a valid gift <em>inter vivas.\u201d </em>The respondent filed objections. The judge filed a so called \"Memorandum of Decision\u201d (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>233 Mass. 535, 543) as follows: \"Upon the master\u2019s report of facts found, I rule that there was a valid gift <em>inter vivas. </em>The objections were treated as exceptions under the rule. An order confirming the master\u2019s report may be entered except as above modified, and a decree dismissing the petition may be entered.\u201d The exceptions were not dealt with specifically, but an order, in the nature of an interlocutory decree, confirming the report as modified, and a final decree dismissing the petition were entered. See <em>Druker </em>v. <em>Druker, </em>268 Mass. 334, 342. The petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The conclusion of the' judge that \"Upon the . . . facts found . . . there was a valid gift <em>inter vivas\u201d </em>was not merely a ruling upon the legal effect of the facts found, but involved inferences of fact. See <em>Simpkins </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>254 Mass. 576, 581; <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>261 Mass. 381, 384. It \"was open to him to decide that' what the report set out required a different finding of fact.\u201d <em>Robert </em>v. <em>Perron, </em>269 Mass. 537, 540, 541. As we construe the master\u2019s finding that there was not a valid gift <em>inter vivas, </em>it was inferred from other facts found. He states, in substance, that his subsidiary findings, set out in the report, \"furnish a basis on which to rest . . . [his] conclusions.\u201d Consequently, it was the duty of the judge to draw proper inferences from the findings unaffected by the conclusions of the master, and it is our duty to draw such inferences unaffected by the conclusions of the master or those of the judge. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Atherton, </em>250 Mass. 215, 217. <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>253 Mass. 79, 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We think that there was a valid gift <em>inter vivas. </em>The deceased in the \u201clast part of November, or first of December 1927,\u201d handed some of the bonds in question to the respondent and \"in the latter part of December 1927,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>others, and thereafter the respondent retained possession of them. Transfer of title to the bonds was thereby effected if they were delivered to the respondent by the deceased with the intention on his part of making a present gift of them. <em>Bone </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>195 Mass. 495. <em>Mangan </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>238 Mass. 1. The master found, by inference from other facts found by him, that there was no such intention. He found, however, that on the occasion of the first delivery of bonds the deceased said to the respondent, \u201cI want to make you this gift, I have been thinking over this some time and I want to make you a present, this will help you out if you have trouble with the Randolph house, this is between you and me and nobody need know anything about it, say nothing,\u201d and that on the occasion of the second delivery the deceased said, \u201cThese bonds are all I can turn over now without making trouble, I want to give you what I can, better keep these bonds yourself and don\u2019t tell anybody, I have taken off the coupons for a year.\u201d The natural inference from these statements is that a present gift was intended in each instance and this inference is not overcome by the other findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The inference that a present gift was intended is sound even if the conclusion of the master is correct, that when the deceased handed the bonds to the respondent he \u201ccut off and retained\u201d not only \u201cthe coupons then due, but also those becoming due in the immediate future,\u201d that \u201che intended to apply to his own use the coupons on the bonds as they became due, and that to this extent the handing over . . . was not, and was not intended by . . . [the deceased] to be, an absolute gift to take immediate effect.\u201d A reservation of a life estate by a donor, though to be considered in determining his intention, is not inconsistent with a present gift of the corpus of the property. <em>Bone </em>v. <em>Holmes, supra. Chippendale </em>v. <em>North Adams Savings Bank, </em>222 Mass. 499, 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">According to the master\u2019s findings, the deceased was \u201ca man of close and grasping disposition, who loved his money and was not disposed to part with it,\u201d and there were findings to the effect that he left surviving him a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>widow and also three sisters, one of them the mother of the respondent; that for a period of eleven years, when the deceased carried on the business which had been his father\u2019s, he made no accounting to the other persons interested in his father\u2019s estate; that the respondent had \u201cborne the brunt of expense of the care of his mother\u201d and aunts, and the deceased \u201cnever contributed to any extent for this purpose, although expressing his appreciation of what' . . . [the respondent] was doing in this regard\u201d; that in 1925 the deceased had conveyed to the respondent the premises in Randolph, upon which the respondent lived with his mother and one of his aunts, with an arrangement whereby the respondent was to continue making monthly payments of rental to the deceased, and that the deceased never told his wife that he had made this conveyance or had delivered the bonds in question to the respondent. There were also findings that the deceased had made statements to his wife and to others, after the delivery of the bonds, as to the size of his estate and, directly or by implication, that the respondent was not \u201cgoing to tell\u201d him \u201cwhat to do\u201d with his money, and had told his wife that he \u201chad a will drawn up but not executed for the reason that she would be better off without one,\u201d and that in fact a will had been prepared according to the directions of the deceased, but never executed by him, by which a trust was created for his sisters and gifts made to the respondent, with the recital that the deceased had been \u201cgenerous\u201d to the respondent \u201cbecause of his loving care for my sisters, and because I have faith that he will help my relatives in time of distress or need.\u201d Other findings need not be recited. The master concluded from his subsidiary findings that, although nothing was said by the deceased when he delivered the bonds to the respondent, which \u201cwould indicate the establishing by him of a formal trust,\u201d it was \u201capparent that he expected . . . [the respondent] to take care of his mother and two aunts, all sisters of . . . [the deceased], in substantially the same way he had in the past without any substantial aid from him,\u201d and that the deceased\u2019s intention.was \u201cto deceive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>his wife in the understanding that he still held possession of his full estate.\u201d Whether or not we accept these conclusions we think that the subsidiary findings as a whole are in accord with the natural inference, from the deceased\u2019s statements to the respondent on the occasions when the bonds were delivered, that present gifts were intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">It follows that the order confirming the master\u2019s report, as modified, and the final decree dismissing the petition must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
