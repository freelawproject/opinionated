The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The case is before this court on exceptions to the refusal of the trial judge to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, and to the refusal to give certain requests for instructions. It is plain that the issues of the due care of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate and the negligence of the defendant were questions of fact for the jury. It follows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>motion for a directed verdict could not properly have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">It is the contention of the defendant that to entitle the plaintiff to recover it must appear affirmatively that his intestate \u201cwas actively looking out for her personal safety.\u201d That contention cannot be sustained. In <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>268 Mass. 454, recently decided by this court, the same contention was made. It was there held that \u201cThe presumption of due care created by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, in any event is coextensive with the requirement as to due care expounded in the Hudson case. . . . <em>[Hudson </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>185 Mass. 510, 521.] That presumption was not inapplicable as matter of law to the case at bar. <em>Mercier </em>v. <em>Union Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 397, 403, 404. The case on this point is covered by the authority of <em>King </em>v. <em>Weitzman, </em>267 Mass. 447, 450.\u201d It could not have been ruled that the decedent was not in the exercise of due care. <em>Pawloski </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>253 Mass. 478. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>H. B. Church Truck Service Co. </em>259 Mass. 272, 277. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>263 Mass. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">There was evidence that negligence of the defendant in the operation of his automobile caused injury to and the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. It could have been found that she alighted from a street car at a regular stopping place, and was struck by the automobile while she was crossing the street with other persons and had almost reached the sidewalk; that when she was struck the automobile was travelling about thirty or thirty-five miles an hour and, after colliding with the decedent, went seventy-five or eighty feet with the brakes set before it came to a stop. If, as could have been found, the defendant was approaching an intersecting street at a speed of thirty or thirty-five miles an hour he was guilty of a violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 17. Such a violation of the statute was evidence of negligence. <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Deziel, </em>223 Mass. 505. <em>Davicki </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>250 Mass. 379, 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The defendant\u2019s requests for instructions need not be considered in detail; there was no error in refusing to give them. The charge of the trial judge, to which no exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>was taken, so far as reported was adequate and accurate upon the issues involved. The case presents no new questions of law. The rulings of the trial judge were in accord with well settled principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
