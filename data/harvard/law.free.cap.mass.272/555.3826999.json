The case was referred to an auditor whose findings of fact were to be final. The trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to recommit the report to the auditor and ordered judgment for the plaintiff for $4,900, with interest from the date of the writ, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The auditor found that the defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff to build a dwelling house for the plaintiff to be completed in October, 1926, for $13,400, payable in instalments, that the plaintiff fully performed his part of the contract except the payment of the last instalment of $900, which amount he contends he is not required to pay because of nonperformance by the defendant, that because of the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to build according to the plans and specifications serious defects resulted in the finished house,\u201d that \u201cif the house had been constructed according to the contract, plans and specifications, it would have been of the fair market value of $13,400 at the time fixed for completion in October 1926,\u201d that \u201cthe fair market value of the house at the time fixed for completion . . . was $8,700,\u201d that, if material, \u201cit would have cost in October, 1926, at least $4,000 to tear down parts of the structure and rebuild it to accord with the terms of the contract, specifications and plans,\u201d but \u201cit would not be practicable and economical to make all alterations necessary to make the house conform\u201d thereto, that the plaintiff actually expended $299.41, the reasonable cost of remedying certain minor defects, that he \u201cmade his last payment on October 23, 1926, then telling . . . [the defendant] that the house was in an unsatisfactory condition,\u201d and the defendant then gave the plaintiff \u201ca receipt . . . which indicated that . . . [the plaintiff] paid with reservations,\u201d and that the plaintiff \u201cmoved into the house about October 28, 1926,\u201d \u201cabout the time the house was completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The contract provided that payments should be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>by the owner, the plaintiff here, \u201conly upon certificates of the Architects\u201d and should be \u201cdue when certificates for the same are issued,\u201d but that \u201cno certificate given or payment made . . . , except the final certificate or final payment, shall be conclusive evidence of the performance of this contract, either wholly or in part, and ... no payment shall be construed to be an acceptance of defective work or improper materials.\u201d There was also a section in the contract like that considered in <em>Loftus </em>v. <em>Jorjorian, </em>194 Mass. 165, 168 (see also <em>White </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>188 Mass. 99, 100, 101, <em>Norcross Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>199 Mass. 81, 84, 85), authorizing the plaintiff upon default of the defendant; certified by the architect, to furnish labor or materials required by the contract or terminate the employment of the defendant and complete the work included in the contract, and providing that the \u201cexpense incurred by the Owner . . . , either for furnishing materials or for finishing the work, and any damage incurred through such default, shall be audited and certified by the Architects, whose certificate thereof shall be conclusive upon the parties,\u201d and a section providing for arbitration if the \u201cOwner and Contractor fail to agree in relation to matters of payment\u201d or other matters not here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The auditor found that the \u201carchitect did not supervise construction or issue certificates,\u201d that he \u201chad not supervised the work in its progress nor had he followed it in its progress, although he saw the house a few times while it was being built,\u201d and that there was no evidence that the plaintiff \u201casked the architect to supervise\u201d or that the defendant \u201ctook any action about supervision by the architect.\u201d It was not found that any matter was submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">1. There was no error in the denial of the motion to recommit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">No ground for recommitting the report is shown by the record outside the report itself. It was within the judicial discretion to refuse to recommit the report on the ground of its form. In this aspect the refusal to recommit did not amount to a ruling of law. See <em>Koch, petitioner, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>225 Mass. 148, 150. <em>W. R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>National Wholesale Grocery Co. Inc. </em>251 Mass. 251, 253. The defendant\u2019s contention that the report is incomplete because it does not set forth the contract as to which a question of interpretation is raised, is without foundation. A copy of a contract is attached to the declaration. This is sufficiently identified in the report as a copy of the contract made by the parties and is embodied in the report by reference. Nor can we say that the report does not set forth the provisions of the plans and specifications sufficiently to present the questions of law in issue. Recommittal because of the refusal of the auditor to reopen the case \u201cfor the purpose of hearing new and additional testimony\u201d was discretionary with the trial judge (see <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>209 Mass. 282, 291, <em>W. R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>National Wholesale Grocery Co. Inc. supra) </em>and no abuse of discretion is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Rulings by the auditor as to the admission and exclusion of evidence are reviewable by us on the exception to the denial of the motion to recommit. <em>Lunn &amp; Sweet Co. </em>v. <em>Wolfman, </em>268 Mass. 345, 348 and cases cited. In these respects, however, no error appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The defendant\u2019s offer to show a statement by the architect of the amount which, in his opinion, should be allowed by the defendant to the plaintiff for defects and the amount which should be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant for extras, was excluded rightly. The statement did not purport to be an architect\u2019s certificate within the meaning of the contract. See <em>Hennebique Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Cold Storage &amp; Terminal Co. </em>230 Mass. 456, 462. This evidence was merely hearsay as to the architect\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">An engineer, called by the plaintiff, was permitted to testify as an expert. Some of his testimony, according to the report, was disregarded by the auditor. The question, therefore, whether, if this testimony was admitted wrongly, the report should be permitted to stand was not a matter of law reviewable here, but a matter solely within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Chelmsford Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>206 Mass. 102, 108. The other testimony of this witness that \u201che thought the house was then worth $9,000\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>and \u201cit would, in his opinion, cost $4,000 to make the house conform to plans and specifications, made up in part of $500 to correct the roof and $1,500 to cure the paint and plaster trouble,\u201d was admitted properly. We cannot say, on the findings as to his qualifications, that he was not qualified to give this testimony. His opinion as to the value of the house was material on the issue of its value as left by the builder, an element in the measure of damages. <em>Pelatowski </em>v. <em>Black, </em>213 Mass. 428, 430, 431. See <em>infra. </em>The defendant did not object to the testimony of this witness as to the cost of making the house conform to the plans and specifications, except on the ground that he was not qualified to testify, or to the admission of any of his testimony as immaterial because of the provisions of the contract as to an architect\u2019s certificate. Similar considerations apply to the admission by the auditor, over the defendant\u2019s objection, of other \u201cevidence of the fair market value of the house as a structure on the date set for completion in October, 1926.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">2. There was no error in ordering judgment for the plaintiff, but judgment should have been ordered for $3,800 with interest instead of for $4,900 with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The auditor\u2019s findings of fact stand upon the same footing as the verdict of a jury <em>(Lunn &amp; Sweet Co. </em>v. <em>Wolfman, supra), </em>and no \u201ccause appears or is shown to the contrary\u201d why judgment should not be entered thereon, under Common Law Rule 30 (1923) of the Superior Court. See <em>Marden </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>242 Mass. 350, 353, 355. The auditor found, a breach of the contract by the defendant and the elements of the plaintiff\u2019s damages resulting therefrom. The defendant contends, however, that an architect\u2019s certificate of the damages incurred by the plaintiff by reason of the defendant\u2019s defaults, was a condition precedent to recovery by the plaintiff and that excuse for its absence was not pleaded or proved. Under the contract such defaults were to be considered by the architect in preparing his certificates for payments by the owner, but no such certificate except a final one was to be conclusive evidence of performance of the contract, wholly or in part. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>Norcross Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>199 Mass. 81, 95, explained in <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>215 Mass. 212, 218. The only provision, however, for a certificate of damages incurred by reason of the defendant\u2019s defaults, as such, is that above set forth, applicable only where the plaintiff upon default of the defendant, certified by the architect, furnishes labor or materials required by the contract or terminates the employment of the defendant and completes the work included in the contract. The plaintiff, unlike the owners in <em>White </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>188 Mass. 99, and <em>Loftus </em>v. <em>Jorjorian, </em>194 Mass. 165, has not resorted to this remedy, and this provision for a certificate, therefore, is not applicable to this case. The defendant purports to have completed the house, though no certificate for payment, final or otherwise, has been issued, and the plaintiff contends that the defendant did not build it according to the terms of the contract. In these circumstances an architect\u2019s certificate of damages due to the defendant\u2019s defaults is not a condition precedent to recovery by the plaintiff and need not be pleaded or proved. <em>Norcross Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>199 Mass. 81. Nor is submission to arbitration made by the contract a condition precedent to the right to sue. Consequently such submission need not be shown, even if it is assumed that the question at issue is one of those covered by the provision for arbitration. <em>Norcross Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>199 Mass. 81, 94. <em>Brocklehurst &amp; Potter Co. </em>v. <em>Marsch, </em>225 Mass. 3, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The case does not appear to have been tried, and was not argued, on the theory that there was any \u201cintentional departure from the contract in a material matter.\u201d <em>Divito </em>v. <em>Uto, </em>253 Mass. 239, 243. See also <em>Smedley </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>246 Mass. 393, 400. Hence, the sum to be recovered as damages, if the full contract price had been paid, would be \u201cthe amount by which the value of the house as left by the . . . [builder] fell short of what that value would have been if the contract had been exactly performed.\u201d <em>Pelatowski </em>v. <em>Black, </em>213 Mass. 428, 430, 431. See also <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>McOwen, </em>103 Mass. 587, 591, 598; <em>Norway Plains Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Moors, </em>134 Mass. 129, 135; <em>White </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>v. <em>McLaren, </em>151 Mass. 553, 557, 558. Compare <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Cobe, </em>177 Mass. 584. Williston, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 1480-1483, 1485. It has been suggested that this rule of damages is applicable when the defects are \u201cof such a character as to diminish the value of the house but little, while to make the work conform literally to the contract would involve reconstruction at unreasonable and disproportionate expense.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>McLaren, </em>151 Mass. 553, 558. See also <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Cush. 484, 486, 487. This rule, however, is equally applicable where, as the auditor found in this case, though the value of the house is materially diminished by the defects it is so built that \u201cit would not be practicable and economical\u201d to alter it so as to conform to the contract. This conclusion by the auditor is not necessarily inconsistent with his findings, that the value of the house was diminished by the defects to the extent of $4,700 and that it would have cost \u201cat least $4,000\u201d to alter it so as to conform to the contract. The auditor does not purport to determine precisely the cost of such alterations, but merely fixes the minimum limit thereto. The measure of damages urged upon us by the defendant, namely, that the amount to be deducted from the contract price is the \u201creasonable cost of completing the work,\u201d is not applicable to the situation disclosed by the findings. It was pointed out in <em>Pelatowski </em>v. <em>Black, </em>213 Mass. 428, 431, that this \u201cwell might be\u201d the measure in a case \u201cwhere a contractor has abandoned his work while yet unfinished, or has left undone some details merely which he ought to have supplied.\u201d See also <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Cush. 484, 487. This, however, is not such a case. Here the house was substantially completed and could not be made to conform to the contract without tearing down a considerable part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">According to the rule of damages applicable 'here the amount to be deducted from the contract price was $4,700, the amount by which $8,700, the value of the house as left by the defendant in October, 1926, fell short of $13,400, the value (as found by the auditor, and not unsupported, as the defendant contends, see <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>15 Pick. 198, 209, <em>Westport </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>246 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>556, 563) which the house would have had if the contract had been exactly performed. As the sum of the plaintiff\u2019s payments on the contract was $900 less than the contract price, the amount otherwise to be recovered by him should have been reduced accordingly, that is, judgment should have been entered for $3,800 and interest from- the date of the writ. No further adjustment was required on account of expenditures by the plaintiff, as found by the auditor, aggregating $299.41, for remedying minor defects. These defects were remedied, so far as shown by the report, after the date as of which the value of the house as built was found to be $8,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">It follows that the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of his motion to recommit the report must be overruled, but his exception to the order of judgment for the plaintiff for $4,900 with interest from the date of the writ must be sustained. As, however, \u201call the facts necessary for determining the question in dispute\u201d are before us, and from them it appears that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for $3,800 with interest from the date of the writ, under authority of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 124, such judgment is to be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
