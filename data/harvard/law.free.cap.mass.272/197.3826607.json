This bill of complaint was a substitute for the bill (filed May 1,1924, and later amended,) considered on demurrer in <em>Hermanson </em>v. <em>Seppala, </em>255 Mass. 607. The case was referred to a master who made a report to which objections were filed. The objections, which by force of Equity Rule 26 (1926) became exceptions, were overruled, and the report was confirmed by an interlocutory decree. Thereafter a final decree was entered, whereby it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>adjudged that the plaintiff, when she executed the deed, \u201cwas not of sound mind and did not have sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature or effect of her act and . . . is entitled to avoid said deed,\u201d and that \u201csaid deed is null and void and the defendant took no title thereunder\u201d; and it was ordered that \u201cthe defendant forthwith deliver up said deed to the plaintiff for cancellation\u201d and \u201cbe perpetually enjoined from interfering in any manner with the plaintiff or with any person or persons claiming under her in the exercise of her or their right, title or interest in said premises or in the free use and enjoyment thereof,\u201d and that the deiendant pay the costs of suit. The defendant appealed from the final decree only.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The plaintiff filed a motion in this court to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal \u201cfor the reasons that the appeal does not claim that the defendant was aggrieved by the decree, ruling, opinion or judgment therein made or entered.\u201d The appeal recites that the defendant \u201cappeals to the Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth from the final decree.\u201d This is sufficient. Obviously 'such an appeal implies a claim that the appellant is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by the decree appealed from. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 19, amended by St. 1929, c. 265, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">No appeal was taken from the interlocutory decree overruling the exceptions and confirming the report, and it is not contended by the defendant that the final decree was erroneously affected thereby so as to require revision under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 27. See <em>Centebar </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Watertown, </em>268 Mass. 121, and cases cited. The question is, therefore, \u201cwhether the final decree was within the scope of the bill and supported by the facts found.\u201d <em>Ledoux </em>v. <em>Lariviere, </em>261 Mass. 242, 244 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The master found, among others, the following facts: In August, 1919, the plaintiff entered into an oral arrangement or agreement with the defendant \u201cwhereby the former was to convey to the latter all her land and the two tenement houses and the eight out-buildings thereon,\u201d being the premises in question, \u201cand all the personal property upon the premises except her household furniture and her two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>cows, upon the following terms and conditions: The plaintiff was to reserve and collect for her own use, the rents from tenants up to October 1, 1919, and to assume and pay the taxes on the property, real and personal, for the year 1919, which amounted to $78, and the defendant was (a) to assume and pay the outstanding mortgages (aggregating $1,850) on the real estate held by the Granite Savings Bank of Rock-port, (b) to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $150, by permitting her to use and occupy, for a period of fifty months at the rental of $3 per month, the tenement then occupied by her in the westerly house, consisting of three attic rooms and one room on the second floor, and (c) to give to the plaintiff an agreement in writing to reconvey the property to her whenever she requested, the terms of the reconveyance not being expressly stated.\u201d On August 16, 1919, the plaintiff executed a deed of the premises to the defendant. No \u201cagreement to reconvey was made or tendered by the defendant, and no mention of such an agreement was made\u201d when the deed was executed. The \u201cfair market value of the property conveyed to the defendant at the time of the conveyance was $6,000 at least.\u201d \u201cImmediately after receiving the deed, the defendant took possession of the property. . . . The plaintiff continued to occupy the same small tenement she had previously occupied, receiving from the defendant each month, a receipt or voucher . . . for $3, on account of the rent. ...\u201d After October 1, 1919, \u201cthe defendant collected all the rents from the other tenants of the premises.\u201d He made repairs and improvements. By some time in November, 1923, the period of fifty months having expired, the defendant had requested the 'plaintiff to vacate the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The master found specifically that \u201cthe plaintiff when she made the conveyance in question was not of sound mind and did not understand nor have the mental capacity to understand the nature or effect of her act.\u201d This finding must stand. The evidence is not reported and the finding is not inconsistent with other findings or plainly wrong. See <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Waltham Laundry Co. </em>235 Mass. 330, 334. The deed of an insane person conveying land is voidable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>Allis </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>6 Met. 415. <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>235 Mass. 14, 16. It \u201cis, ineffectual to convey a title to land, good against the grantor, or against his \u25a0 heirs and devisees, unless it is confirmed by the grantor himself when of sound mind, or by his legally constituted guardian, or by his heirs or devisees. . . . And such deed may be dis-affirmed without returning the consideration money, or placing the other party <em>in statu quo\u201d (Brigham </em>v. <em>Bayer-weather, </em>144 Mass. 48, 51), if, in the meantime, the privilege to disaffirm has not been terminated by ratification. <em>Allis </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>6 Met. 415, 421. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Soper, </em>6 Gray, 279. \u201cA bill in equity may be maintained to set aside a conveyance from an insane person.\u201d <em>Hermanson </em>v. <em>Seppala, </em>255 Mass. 607, 610. The bringing of such a bill is an election to \u201cdisaffirm\u201d or \u201cavoid\u201d the conveyance. It follows that the decree was right unless the plaintiff, when of sound mind, had ratified the deed in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On the facts found by the master the plaintiff did not ratify the deed. As she was of unsound mind on August 16, 1919, when the deed was executed, her \u201cinsanity was presumed to continue, unless there was evidence to control that presumption,\u201d <em>(Wright </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>139 Mass. 177, 182, see also <em>Little </em>v. <em>Little, </em>13 Gray, 264, 266), though the presumption of continuing insanity does not arise when the insanity is shown to be the result of a \u201cviolent disease\u201d <em>(Hix </em>v. <em>Whittemore, </em>4 Met. 545, 546, 547, <em>Wright </em>v. Wright, <em>supra), </em>or \u201caccidental or temporary in its nature.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Little, supra. </em>The facts found do not bring this case within the exception to the general rule, nor do they control the presumption. These facts were, in substance, as follows: In October, 1918, she \u201chad an attack of influenza, then generally prevalent,\u201d and \u201cwas confined to her bed not more than a week.\u201d Her \u201cillness left her in a state of mental depression, and with her strength and general health impaired. Although in a short time she regained sufficient strength to enable her to do her daily tasks about her home, she was for a long period thereafter depressed, morose and seclusive and at times in an absentminded condition, and frequently complained of pains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in her head.\u201d After the conveyance her \u201cphysical and mental condition . . . slowly improved.\u201d The master was \u201cunable to determine upon the evidence the date of her recovery.\u201d He found, however, that \u201cseveral months later\u201d than November, 1923, her mental condition had \u201cso much improved that she was able to comprehend the nature and effect of her deed to the defendant.\u201d The plaintiff, therefore, was not capable of ratifying the deed until a time several months after November, 1923. Consequently, it need not be determined whether her acts prior thereto would have amounted to ratification if she had been of sound mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Nothing in the conduct of the plaintiff after the time \u201cseveral months later\u201d than November, 1923, when she had become \u201cable to comprehend the nature and effect of her deed,\u201d amounted to ratification of it, though acts \u201cinconsistent with any just purpose to disaffirm the conveyance\u201d would have had that result. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Richmond Iron Works, </em>1 Gray, 434, 439-440. The master found that she then \u201coffered to pay the defendant $2,100 for a reconveyance of the real estate to her, \u2014 $250 in addition to the amount ($1,850) of the mortgages still held by the Granite Savings Bank,\u201d that this offer was refused by the defendant who \u201cstated that he was unwilling to make any reconveyance to her and soon after again gave her notice to vacate,\u201d and that \u201cat the time of this refusal to reconvey, the fair rental value of the real estate, other than the tenement occupied by the plaintiff, during the period of the defendant\u2019s possession had exceeded the amount of the interest, taxes, water rates and insurance premiums which had been paid by him, and the actual costs of all repairs and improvements which he made upon the property.\u201d This offer of the plaintiff was at most equivocal. It did not necessarily imply recognition of the validity of the deed. Nor was it necessarily referable to the oral, agreement to reconvey. It was consistent with an intention on the part of the plaintiff to disaffirm, and to obtain a restoration of the <em>status quo </em>by securing for herself possession of the premises and removing the cloud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>cast by the deed upon her title thereto, without litigation, and by restoring to the defendant the consideration paid by him and making adjustments for his expenditures upon the premises. This is a more reasonable explanation of the offer than that the plaintiff was seeking to buy for $2,100 property which had a fair market value of more than $6,000. Her offer unaccepted, though it went beyond her legal obligation if she intended to disaffirm <em>(Brigham </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, supra), </em>was not decisive of an election to affirm. It did not go so far as the acts held to constitute such elections in <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hildreth, </em>5 Met. 49 and <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Richmond Iron Works, supra. </em>Nor under the circumstances of the case did the lapse of time before bringing suit for cancellation preclude the plaintiff from disaffirming the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
