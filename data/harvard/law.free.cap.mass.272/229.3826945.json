By the terms of his employment he was required to have and to use an automobile in the business which he was to do and was to receive a salary and commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">On September 28, 1928, in New Haven, Connecticut, at about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, he met his wife at the railroad station and in her company drove his car toward Boston in anticipation of attending there a sales meeting of his employer at 9 :30 p.m., which he had been ordered to attend. In Massachusetts, while driving \u201con Framingham- ' Milford Road, Washington Street, Holliston,\u201d his car collided with a truck; as a result his arm was broken and he other- \u2022 wise received bruises, cuts and lacerations. The State roadway at the place of the collision was wide with room for three cars to pass abreast. The truck, without rear lights, was stalled on the extreme right edge and probably off the road. The claimant\u2019s car was lighted, and when he first noticed the truck he was \u201cprobably twenty feet\u201d away and going \u2018 \u2018 between forty and forty-five miles an hour. He tried to stop his car,\u201d was not able to do so, and \u201cstruck the rear-end of the truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The claimant testified, in substance, that it was between 8 and 8:30 p.m. when he struck the truck; that his car was lighted and he was looking ahead; that he was quite sure he could have seen the truck if its rear light had been on; that he noticed there was a truck on the left side of the road; that he always thought one truck was parked on the right-hand side as he was going and the other truck on the left, although he had learned since the accident that they were about two hundred feet apart; that there was room to pass between them and the reason why he did not do so was that a car came head-on toward him and he thought he hit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>truck to avoid hitting the car; that as he came along he thought he had a clear road straight ahead, thought he was the man who should go through there, \u201cbut the other car came between him and evidently thought they were entitled \u201d to precedence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On the facts shown by the record the insurer raised the question, \u201cWhether Mr. Schofield was an employee within the meaning of the workmen\u2019s compensation act at the time of this accident.\u201d On the issue thus raised for the decision of the member, and the Industrial Accident Board on appeal, the question presented was one of law and not of fact because all the material evidence as to the terms of the employment came from the claimant himself, upon whom is the burden of proof, and was not and is not disputed by the insurer. Other than that the claimant was required to \u201cuse his own car\u201d while engaged in his employment within the territory allotted to him, there is nothing in the record to prove or to warrant an inference that the claimant, while actively engaged in his employment, was not master over the operation of his car, or that any right, by the terms of his employment, was granted to the employer to restrict the claimant in the control of his own car whenever it should elect to direct him as to the manner and mode by which at any time or at any place it should be operated. We are of opinion that Schofield as matter of law was an independent contractor as respects the operation and control of his own car, and as such was not entitled to compensation for injuries received as a consequence of such operation, under G. L. c. 152. <em>Comerford\u2019s Case, </em>224 Mass. 571. <em>Pyyny </em>v. <em>Loose-Wiles Biscuit Co. </em>253 Mass. 574. <em>Towne\u2019s Case, </em>254 Mass. 280. <em>Khoury </em>v. <em>Edison Electric Illuminating Co. </em>265 Mass. 236. <em>Bradley\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 399. There is nothing inconsistent with this conclusion in the decisions in <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Beraldi, </em>260 Mass. 225, <em>Mannix\u2019s Case, </em>264 Mass. 584, or in <em>Pelletier\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 490. The decree must be reversed and a decree entered for the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
