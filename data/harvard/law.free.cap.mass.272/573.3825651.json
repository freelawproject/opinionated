The master\u2019s report was confirmed by an interlocutory decree; a final decree was entered directing the defendants to remove from their premises \u201cany obstruction to said drainage flow of water existing on defendants\u2019 premises\u201d and ordering them to pay the plaintiffs damages. The defendants appealed from the final decree. There was no appeal from the interlocutory decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">The master found that the land of the plaintiffs and of the defendants formerly belonged to one Booth. The plaintiffs\u2019 tract was conveyed to them on August 13, 1925. It is north of and adjoins the defendants\u2019 land. To the north of the plaintiffs\u2019 land is the land of one Ploss. When the defendants acquired title there was an open ditch across the plaintiffs\u2019 land \u201cwhich connected with and discharged its waters into a similar ditch across the Carr property and . . . such ditch had been there for at least twenty years.\u201d It was found that in the year 1900, Booth deepened \u201cthe Channel\u201d; that it was \u201ca well defined channel\u201d; that \u201cthere were at least two springs on the McGowen land or the Ploss land . . . One of these springs was piped to a farm barn on the south, just south of this spring was another spring which used to catch the - overflow of the first\u201d; that \u201cThe overflow from these springs passed down through the ditch over the McGowen and Carr land to the river some distance south\u201d; that at some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>time Ploss filled in the ditch on his land making a blind ditch; that water flows from it into the open ditch on the plaintiffs\u2019 land; that when the defendants purchased their lot an iron pipe was placed in the open ditch on their land; that previous to this the \u201cditch had cut across the Carr property connecting a like ditch which runs through the McGowen property from its northern to its southern boundaries.\u201d It was further found that the land of the plaintiffs was flooded for the first time in April, 1927, \u201cfollowing the removal of a certain iron pipe which ran north to south in the r\u00e9ar of the Carr house\u201d; that this pipe was removed in March, 1927, and \u201cThereafter the water flowing down through the ditch from the McG\u00f3wen land found no outlet where the pipe had been, this in spite of the fact that the Carrs when they removed the iron pipe had dug a new ditch\u201d connecting with the McGowen ditch; that the new ditch \u201cwas apparently not deep enough,\u201d and the water which would flow through the pipe was blocked \u201cand backed up on the McGowen lawn.\u201d It was agreed that the deeds to the parties make no reference to any easements or water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">As we interpret the master\u2019s report the so called ditch was a natural watercourse that \"was in existence when the defendants became the owners of their land. It was small but well defined, and had been there for at least twenty years. It carried the water from the overflow of one of the springs on the north through the lands of the parties to the river on the south. See <em>Luther </em>v. <em>Winnisimmet Co. </em>9 Cush. 171. As the ditch was a natural watercourse the defendants could not obstruct it. They could be restrained. As damage resulted they could be called upon to make good the loss suffered by the plaintiffs. <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Livermore, </em>7 Gray, 194. S. <em>C. </em>15 Gray, 10. <em>Jackman </em>v. <em>Arlington Mills, </em>137 Mass. 277. <em>Stimson </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>197 Mass. 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">It was not essential that reference should have been made to the watercourse in the conveyance to the plaintiffs. \u201c. . . <em>prima facie, </em>the right to a free flow of the water of a natural watercourse remains attached to the land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>and any one who would call it in question must prove his right to make such obstruction.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fairhaven, </em>5 Gray, 110, 115. See <em>Carbrey </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>7 Allen, 364, and cases cited, and <em>Washburn &amp; Moen Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>152 Mass. 346, 351. In our opinion it cannot be said that this ditch was an artificial one designed to carry surface drainage. It was, as we interpret the master\u2019s report, a natural watercourse carrying the water which came from the springs on the north, or at least from one of these springs. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>7 Allen, 19, and <em>Stanchfield </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>142 Mass. 110 are not in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We have examined the decisions cited by the defendants; they are not contrary to what is here decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
