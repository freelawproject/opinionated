The premises leased to the plaintiff consisted of the first floor of the building, the basement and a part of the second story. The alterations included, among others, changing the rear of the building from a two-story to a four-story building. None of this work involved any invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s premises. The plaintiff introduced evidence of damages suffered from March to October, 1923, (1) by the fall of plaster, (2) rain water, (3) soot from the ventilator, (4) water damage by mortar bed overflow, (5) breaking through the ceiling by a workman, and (6) plugging chimney with debris. The judge charged the jury that there was no sufficient evidence to warrant a verdict for the plaintiff for the first three named causes, but did allow them to consider the damages caused by the mortar bed overflow, the breaking through the ceiling by a workman, and the plugging of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the chimney with debris. There was a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,000. He excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">There was evidence tending to show that in March, 1923, the defendant \u201cthrough his agent Thomas J. Gass and about fifteen workmen, began extensive alterations on this block.\u201d The plaintiff testified as follows: \u201cThe first damage was the plaster coming down in the millinery department on the second floor rear.\u201d In March, 1923, he \u201cheard a noise, went upstairs, saw a lot of plaster, dust, clouds of it.\u201d A section of the plaster the full length of the millinery department in the rear had fallen on the merchandise; this happened about eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon. Plaster fell many times; the defendant was shown the damage done, and \u201cwas going to make that good . . . [the plaintiff] used to call Mr. Gass whenever there was trouble, called him many times\u201d and he had \u201chis men to pick up the plaster.\u201d Before the plaster fell the plaintiff \u201cheard noises. They were hammering all the time,\u201d but he did not remember that he heard hammering on the thirteenth of March. \u201cFinally Burnham\u2019s men put up a cloth to hold the plaster up.\u201d On April 28 it rained all night and \u201cthe water came through on the underwear\u201d in the department in the rear of the second floor. The day before the men had been working in the building and \u201cno precautions that . . . [the plaintiff knew] of were taken by them to protect [the plaintiff\u2019s] goods from the elements.\u201d \u201cThey were raising the building over this hosiery department two floors. . . . [He] saw the rain coming through on the side of the walls.\u201d On August 10 the men were working at or near the chimney; on that day \u201cdust and soot came in through the ventilator opening entering the chimney and covered things.\u201d There was other evidence that while work was going on near the chimney \u201cthe soot carried into the millinery department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">It appeared that on March 7 there was a fire in a room over the plaintiff\u2019s store and that \u201cSome chemicals and water were used by the fire department to extinguish this fire.\u201d There was evidence that the ceiling where the plaster fell was not \u201cin any way affected by that fire or by water then used.\u201d There was no affirmative evidence \u201cthat the fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>or water then used in any way contributed to the fall of plaster or other damage complained of by this plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A34\">The defendant could not lawfully interfere with the possession and quiet enjoyment of the plaintiff\u2019s premises and he was liable to the plaintiff if by reason of negligence he failed to protect the plaintiff\u2019s property from damage. See <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>168 Mass. 45; <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>266 Mass. 33. It could be inferred from all the evidence that the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s stock of goods resulted from the acts of the defendant\u2019s agent; and it could also be found that the defendant did nothing to protect the property of the plaintiff or to guard against damage; that the plaintiff \u201cheard noises,\u201d \u201cThey were hammering all the time\u201d and when the defendant saw the damage he said \u201che was going to make that good.\u201d If the jury believed this testimony they could deal with it as an admission of liability. <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Rome, </em>250 Mass. 505. <em>Dennison </em>v. <em>Swerdlove, </em>250 Mass. 507. <em>Bernasconi </em>v. <em>Bassi, </em>261 Mass. 26. Considering all the evidence it was for the jury to say whether the plaintiff suffered damage from the fall of plaster, the rain water, and the \u201csoot entering through the ventilator,\u201d and also whether this damage was caused by the negligence of the defendant\u2019s agents. A fire occurred on March 7 in the third story above the leased premises, but there was evidence that none of the plaster fell in consequence of this fire, and there was no affirmative evidence that the fire or water then used contributed to any of the damage suffered by the plaintiff. On several occasions subsequent to the fire the rain came \u201cthrough on the side of the walls and even in the center,\u201d the plaster fell and soot and dust came through the ventilator entering the chimney when the men were working \u201con the roof and on or near this chimney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The case is to be distinguished from <em>Wadleigh </em>v. <em>Bumf or d, </em>229 Mass. 122, where there was no evidence of fault on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
