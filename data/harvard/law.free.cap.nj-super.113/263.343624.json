J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AQD\">Defendant Anthony Barckett appeals from those parts of the final judgment entered in the Law Division on March 24, 1970 whereby it was adjudged that the appointment of plaintiff Alexander Chabora as a member of the board of education of the City of Garfield was valid and that the appointment of defendant Anthony Barckett as a member of said board was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">The facts are not in dispute. On December 16, 1969 Theodore Vagell resigned as a member of the board of education. On December 22, 1969 the then Mayor Gotthold Rose, whose term of office as mayor was expiring at noon on January 1, 1970, appointed defendant Barckett to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Vagell. Garfield is a \u201cType <em>I\u201d </em>school district, pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:9-1 and 2(b), having previously been governed by Title 18, <em>chapter </em>6, of the <em>Revised Statutes. </em>As such, the mayor has the sole power of appointment of members of the local board of education. Barckett subscribed to an oath of office on December 31, 1969 before a notary public, which was presumably filed on December 31, 1969, with the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Clerk according io an unsigned verification in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">On January 5, 1970 the new mayor, Eichard Visotcky, who had assumed office at noon on January 1, 1970, appointed plaintiff Chabora to the board of education to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Vageil. Chabora took his oath of office the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Plaintiffs challenged the validity of Barckett\u2019s appointment by the outgoing mayor to the board of education, claiming that it was \u201cillegal\u201d in that (1) it was contrary to the provisions of N. <em>J. S. A. </em>18A:12-2, because Barckett, at the time of his appointment as a member of the board, was a teacher in the Garfield school system and under contract with the board to teach in the local schools, and (2) the resignation of Vageil had never been accepted or otherwise acted upon by the board of education or other proper authorities at the time of Barckett\u2019s appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Barckett was employed as a teacher by the board of education at the time of his appointment and was under a written contract with the board to teach in the local system for the then current year. He continued to teach in Garfield until June 30, 1970, and was paid and accepted his salary for his services under the teaching contract. His attorney wrote a letter dated February 4, 1970 to Judge Trautwein, who heard the matter in the Law Division, expressing his client\u2019s willingness to \u201cgive up the teaching job,\u201d but this was conditioned upon its being \u201cdetermined that he is disqualified unless he gives up the teaching job.\u201d He continued to teach in Garfield, as noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Judge Trautwein decided that Barckett\u2019s appointment to the board of education, by whom he was employed under contract, was invalid from its inception, <em>\u201cnunc pro iunc.\u201d </em>He found that there was \u201csuch a patent inconsistency and danger built into a person serving as a teacher in a school system in a town and also serving on a Board of Education, who is his employer, and I believe this statute [N. <em>J. S. A. </em>18A:12-2] was violated in this instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Common sense dictates the conclusion that being a school teacher and a member of a hoard of education in the same school district is patently incompatible. \u201cThe members of the board of education of a municipality are public officers holding positions of public trust. They stand in a fiduciary relationship to the people whom they have been appointed or elected to serve.\u201d <em>Cullum v. Board of Education, North Bergen Tp., </em>27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>243, 248 (App. Div. 1953). A teacher\u2019s position is also one of public service, hut the teacher is an employee whereas the board of education is the employer. There are many potential conflicts of interest between the two. \u201cIt is no answer to say that the conflict in duties outlined above may never in fact arise. It is enough that it may * * <em>Jones v. MacDonald, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>132, 138 (1960). The widespread differences throughout our State in matters of salary negotiations, with resultant \u201cjob actions\u201d by teachers and injunctions obtained by boards of education against teacher activities, remind us vividly of the conflicts between teachers and hoards of education. A teacher\u2019s self-interest can readily run counter to a board member\u2019s loyalty to the public. We entertain no doubt that an individual may not properly act contemporaneously as a teacher and a member of the board of education in the same school district. The positions are incompatible and represent intolerable potential conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:12, Article I, entitled \u201cQualifications,\u201d lends support to the conclusion that one may not qualify as a member of a board of education, if he is at the same time bound by a contract with the board. Section 1 of this Article sets forth the qualifications of citizenship: two years at least of residence preceding appointment or election, and ability to read and write. Section 2 of the same statutory Article dealing with \u201cQualifications\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">No member of any board of education shall be interested directly or indirectly in any contract with or claim against the board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The heading of this section reads: \u201cInconsistent interests prohibited.\u201d Certainly, defendant teacher was directly interested in his contract with the board of education.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">It is noteworthy that <em>L. </em>1960, c. 93, \u00a7 1 is listed as a source of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:12-1 and 2. The 1960 statute combined sections 1 and 2 in one paragraph, thus indicating the several qualifications required. The separation into sections under the same Article indicate an attempt at clarity. We read into N. <em>J. S. A. </em>18A :12-1 and 2 the need for all the qualifications expressed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Defendant argues that his acceptance of board membership vacated his teacher\u2019s position rather than prevented his appointment to the board. Reliance is placed upon <em>De Feo v. </em>Smith, 17 <em>N. J. </em>183, 190 (1955), where it was held that, \u201cThe acceptance of the second office <em>ipso facto </em>vacates the first.\u201d In that case the issue was whether defendant\u2019s appointment as chosen freeholder vacated his office as member of the county board of taxation. The Supreme Court held that the duties of the offices were such that the public interest might be disserved by the common holding of both offices. Accordingly, acceptance of the second and incompatible office was deemed to vacate the first office.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The instant case is distinguishable from <em>De Feo v. Smith. </em>Here, defendant teacher was bound by his teaching contract for the school term and was not legally free to abandon one public job for another. Secondly, he kept his former position as a teacher and enjoyed the emoluments flowing therefrom. While he offered to resign as a teacher, the offer was conditioned upon an adverse determination and never effectively carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We find no substantial merit in the contention that judicial determination of disqualification was necessary before plaintiff Chabora could be duly appointed to the board of education. Barckett\u2019s appointment was invalid from its inception. The subsequent judicial declaration was expressly made <em>\"nunc pro tunc.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The judgment is, in respect to the issues involved herein, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
