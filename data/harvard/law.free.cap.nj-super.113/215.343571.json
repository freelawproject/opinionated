J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Apg\">Defendant was found guilty of careless driving <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-97) in the municipal court and fined $15 and $5 costs. The County Court heard his appeal <em>de novo </em>on the municipal court transcript, found him guilty and imposed the same penalty. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">Trooper Vanya was the State\u2019s only witness. He testified that on May 8, 1969 defendant, driving a tractor-trailer, entered a construction area on Route 78 and jackknifed. The tractor and trailer became disengaged; the tractor crossed into the opposite lane, striking another tractor-trailer broadside. There was an explosion and the driver of the struck tractor was fatally injured. The trooper testified that before defendant entered the construction area there were 12 signs warning of the potential hazards ahead, and that the roadway area where the accident took place was \"very narrow,\u201d limited to single-lane traffic each way. The road was slippery, but he found no skid or tire marks. The trooper did not see the accident but said that two persons who did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>had told him the tractor-trailer had jackknifed. He added that the area was dangerous when wet.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Defendant moved for judgment of acquittal. The municipal judge denied the motion and found defendant guilty, noting that an \u201cotherwise unexplained jackknifing\u201d in a construction area with warning signs and reduced speed limit \u201cis an indication of failure of the defendant to use due caution and circumspection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The County Court judge, after making findings of fact, concluded that the State had proved violation of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt. In doing so he relied on the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>citing <em>Mockler v. Russman, </em>102 <em>N. J. Super. 582 </em>(App. Div. 1968), and <em>Bevilacqua v. Sutter, </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>394 (App. Div. 1953) \u2014 civil negligence actions \u2014 and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">Having the benefit of only the trooper\u2019s testimony, the court holds that the circumstances herein, particularly the unexplained unusual occurrence of the jackknifing of the tractor-trailer, and crossing of the highway, permit this court to apply the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>as set forth in <em>Bevilacqua. </em>See also 79 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Prosecution for a motor vehicle violation is a <em>quasi-</em>criminal proceeding and the State has the burden of establishing all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cestone, </em>38 <em>N. J. Super. </em>139, 147-148 (App. Div. 1955); <em>State v. Ring, </em>85 <em>N. J. Super. </em>341, 343 (App. Div. 1964), certif. den. 44 A. <em>J. </em>407 (1965). Taking the evidence in a light most favorable to the State \u2014 see <em>State v. Reyes, 50 </em>A. <em>J. </em>454, 458-459 (1967) \u2014 it appears that, on a wet roadway in a construction area marked by a dozen signs warning of danger, defendant\u2019s vehicle (according to the trooper\u2019s hearsay testimony) jackknifed, crossed into the opposite lane and struck another vehicle. There is no evidence that defendant was speeding or, indeed, that he drove \u201ccarelessly, or without due caution and circumspection, in a manner so as to endanger, or be likely to endanger, a person or property.\u201d N. <em>J. S. A. </em>39:4-97. <em>State v. Tuccillo, </em>76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>N. J. Super. </em>584 (App. Div. 1963), on which the State relies, is critically distinguishable; that case involved an appeal from the Director of Motor Vehicles\u2019 revocation of defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and was not a qwasi-criminal proceeding. Cf. <em>Cestone, </em>above.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><em>Res ipsa </em>is properly invoked in negligence actions where the proofs disclose that the offending instrumentality was in defendant\u2019s sole control, that the occurrence bespeaks negligence, and there is no indication of contributory negligence. In such circumstances there arises a permissible presumption of negligence from plaintiff\u2019s proof, and defendant is required to come forward with an explanation that will refute the presumption and show that the accident did not occur by reason of his lack of care. The foundation of the rule is the policy of placing the onus of producing evidence on the party \"possessed of superior knowledge or opportunity for explanation of the causative circumstances.\u201d <em>Kahalili v. Roseclif Realty, Inc., </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>595, 605-606 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Employment of the <em>res ipsa </em>doctrine obviously places a burden squarely on a defendant to explain why he was not negligent. The doctrine has no place in criminal or <em>quasi-criminal </em>proceedings, where the burden is totally on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant violated a penal (or grosi-penal) statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Eliminating any benefit the State may have had from the improper invocation of the <em>res ipsa </em>doctrine, we find that the evidence adduced by the State did not support the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
