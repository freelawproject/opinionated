Both Johnson and Kelleybrew died as a result of the collision. An autopsy revealed a .12 percent concentration of alcohol in Johnson\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Attorney Kenneth L. Turowski, as administrator of Kelleybrew\u2019s estate, filed wrongful death claims against, <em>inter alia, </em>appellant Ohio Edison, alleging willful, wanton, reckless, and malicious conduct in erecting the utility pole at the site of the accident, some thirty-one inches away from the curb. Ohio Edison filed for summary judgment, citing numerous cases in support of its contention that there was no theory supportable in the law by which it could be held liable for Kelleybrew\u2019s death. See <em>Hetrick v. Marion-Reserve Power Co. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 347, 25 O.O. 467, 48 N.E.2d 103; <em>Mattucci v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1946), 79 Ohio App. 367, 35 O.O.131, 73 N.E.2d 809; <em>Ohio Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Yant </em>(1940), 64 Ohio App. 189, 18 O.O. 57, 28 N.E.2d 646. In his response to the summary judgment motion and at the hearing on the matter, Turowski failed to cite any facts or law, or make any colorable argument, to support his claim against Ohio Edison beyond his own contention that the utility pole was dangerously placed and was therefore the cause of Kelleybrew\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">After the trial court granted summary judgment for Ohio Edison, it moved for an award of attorney fees against Turowski for frivolous conduct pursuant to R.C. 2323.51, which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201c(A) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">\u201c(1) \u2018Conduct\u2019 means filing a civil action, asserting a claim, defense, or other position in connection with a civil action, or taking any other action in connection with a civil action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">\u201c(2) \u2018Frivolous conduct\u2019 means conduct of a party to a civil action or of his counsel of record that satisfies either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">\u201c(a) It obviously serves merely to harass or maliciously injure another party to the civil action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-11\">\u201c(b) It is not warranted under existing law and cannot be supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">The trial court denied Ohio Edison\u2019s motion, finding without elaboration that the action had been \u201cwarranted under existing law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding that plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s conduct in asserting this claim against Ohio Edison Company and continuing thereafter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>maintain the position that plaintiff had a meritorious claim, without any basis in existing law, was not frivolous under Ohio Revised Code Section 2323.51.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Turowski argues that he joined Ohio Edison in this lawsuit under the compulsory joinder provision of Civ.R. 19.1, and that therefore the trial court properly found the claim to be warranted under existing law. This contention is without merit, however, as Civ.R. 19.1 was intended as a means for <em>defendants </em>in civil suits to compel joinder of all parties who may have a claim against them arising out of the same controversy, so that they can avoid multiple lawsuits and potentially inconsistent adjudications. See Ohio Rules Advisory Committee Staff Notes to Civ.R. 19.1; <em>Layne v. Huffman </em>(1974), 43 Ohio App.2d 53, 72 O.O.2d 202, 333 N.E.2d 147, affirmed (1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 287, 71 O.O.2d 260, 327 N.E.2d 767. Even if Civ.R. 19.1 were applicable here, it would not justify maintaining an action that has no basis in law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the trial court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\u201c * * * [I]t disturbs me sometimes when people bring cases into this court and just name people because they feel that those people ought to be made a party to this lawsuit because they have a deep pocket or just because they happen to be there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">\u201cAnd I just cannot, I just cannot by any stretch of the imagination in any manner whatsoever see how in the world * * * Ohio Edison can be brought into this action by what you told me so far. It just boggles my mind to understand that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Yet, upon motion for attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 2323.51, the court came to a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Upon review of the record, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in arbitrarily ruling that appellee\u2019s action against Ohio Edison was warranted under existing law. Appellee asserts that such a holding will set a dangerous precedent, in that it would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on zealous representation by attorneys of their clients\u2019 interests. But R.C. 2323.51 was enacted precisely to have a chilling effect \u2014 not on zealous representation, but on overzealous, unjustifiable, and frivolous actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b738-13\">Quillin, P.J., and Cirigliano, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
