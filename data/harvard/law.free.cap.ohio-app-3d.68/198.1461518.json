(\u201cMidwest\u201d) and R.E. Harrington, Inc. (\u201cHarrington\u201d). Longpr\u00e9 argues that the trial court erred in finding that his application for coverage of penile implant surgery was properly denied under an exclusion in his health benefit plan for procedures \u201c[rjelated to sex transformations or sexual dysfunctions or inadequacies.\u201d Upon the record in this case, we conclude that the trial court did not err in rendering summary judgment in favor of Midwest and Harrington. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">Longpr\u00e9 is employed as general manager of Midwest. Part of the benefit package afforded to Longpr\u00e9 by Midwest is membership in its employee health plan. The plan is currently supervised and administered by Harrington; however, prior to Harrington, the plan was administered by 'Brunswick Administrative Services, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">Over the past few years, Longpr\u00e9 has experienced instances of impotency. In order to engage in sexual intercourse with his spouse, Longpr\u00e9 sought the surgical insertion of a penile prosthetic device. Given the cost of such a procedure, Longpr\u00e9 contacted Brunswick to determine whether penile implant surgery was covered under the provisions of his employee health plan. Brunswick informed Longpr\u00e9 that his request was denied because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>exclusion from coverage of procedures \u201c[r]elated to sex transformations or sexual dysfunctions or inadequacies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Longpr\u00e9, being dissatisfied with the denial of his request for coverage, filed suit in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaratory judgment \u201csetting forth a construction of the [employee health plan] as it relate[d] to [his medical condition].\u201d Longpr\u00e9 subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment. Midwest and Harrington, Brunswick\u2019s successor, answered Longpr\u00e9\u2019s complaint, and also filed their own motion for summary judgment. After reviewing the pleadings, motions, and depositions, the trial court .granted summary judgment in favor of Midwest and Harrington, and overruled Longpr\u00e9\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It is from this judgment that Longpr\u00e9 appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Longpr\u00e9\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting motions for summary judgment filed by appellees Midwest Optical Supply, Inc., and R.E. Harrington, Inc., and overruling a motion for summary judgment filed by appellants Donald Longpr\u00e9 and Virginia Longpr\u00e9.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Longpr\u00e9 contends that the language in his health benefit plan excluding procedures \u201c[r]elated to sex transformations or sexual dysfunctions or inadequacies\u201d is ambiguous and should be construed in his favor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Although Longpr\u00e9\u2019s employee health plan is not a contract of insurance, principles used in the interpretation of insurance contracts are analogous. One such principle is that words and phrases used in an insurance policy must be given their natural and commonly accepted meaning. See 57 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1985) 332, Insurance, Section 275. If the language employed is unambiguous and clear, there is no occasion for construction, and courts may not indulge themselves in enlarging the contract. <em>Id. </em>This principle of construction is equally applicable in the construction of contracts, generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">In the case before us, the pertinent language of Longpr\u00e9\u2019s health plan provides unambiguously that procedures relating to \u201csexual dysfunctions\u201d are excluded from coverage. A \u201cdysfunction,\u201d as defined by Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (1975) 356, is an impaired or abnormal functioning. We conclude that Longpr\u00e9\u2019s impotency is clearly a sexual dysfunction or an impaired functioning of his sexual organs. Consequently, it was not improper for Harrington to have denied coverage for Longpr\u00e9\u2019s request for penile implant surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Since reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, that conclusion being in favor of Midwest and Harrington, it was not error for the trial court to have granted Midwest\u2019s and Harrington\u2019s motion for summary judgment, nor was it error for the trial court to have overruled Longpr\u00e9\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Longpr\u00e9\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-7\">Wilson and Brogan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
