McHenry, plaintiff-appellant, from a decision of the Industrial Commission of Ohio denying his request to reactivate a prior claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-18\">Appellant assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201cI. The trial court erred in dismissing claimant-appellant\u2019s appeal as the issue to be tried was an issue \u2018other than a decision as to the extent of disability\u2019 and therefore properly appealable to the Court of Common Pleas under Ohio Revised Code Sec. 4123.519.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in granting a motion to dismiss where the motion was based upon facts outside the pleadings and which were genuine issues of fact under Rule 56 of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The pleadings, affidavits, and exhibits in the case at bar reveal the following pertinent facts. In 1963, during appellant\u2019s childhood, he had an operation on his left hip which required placement of a surgical pin. On or about June 21, 1979, while employed for appellee Southern Ohio Coal Company, appellee sustained an injury to his left hip. Shortly thereafter, appellant filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, with this claim being designated as claim No. 685926-22. This claim was allowed for \u201ccontusion left hip\u201d and appellant received temporary total disability benefits until he returned to work on or about July 17, 1979. Appellant continued to work until May 8, 1980, when he again injured himself at the work site by falling on his left hip. Following appellant\u2019s injury of May 8, 1980, appellant filed a second claim for benefits, said claim being designated as claim No. 781946-22. The Industrial Commission found appellant\u2019s second claim to be a \u201creoccurrence of that condition\u201d in claim No. 685926-22 and construed appellant\u2019s C-50 claim as a C-85-A application to reactivate claim number 685926-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">On October 21, 1980, appellant had surgery performed on his hip and he returned to work on January 6, 1981. Appellant then worked for appellee Southern Ohio Coal Company until July 3, 1981 and did not work thereafter. In October 1981, appellant reinjured his hip by falling down steps when he was neither employed nor on the work premises. On February 12, 1982, appellant filed a C-85-A application to reactivate claim No. 685926-22. Appellant\u2019s C-85-A application requested compensation for medical services rendered, authorization for further medical services, and authorization for further compensation benefits, <em>i.e., </em>temporary total disability benefits, from October 23, 1981 through February 4, 1982. On April 20, 1983, a district hearing officer denied appellant\u2019s application to reactivate claim No. 685926-22 on the basis that appellant\u2019s \u201ccurrent condition is not related to the accident of 6-21-79.\u201d The district hearing officer\u2019s decision stated that it was \u201cbased on the reports of Dr. Koppenhoefer and Dr. Soto.\u201d Dr. Koppenhoefer\u2019s April 3, 1982 medical report provided, in pertinent part, as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>contusion which occurred from the trauma in 1981 instead of the trauma from June 21, 1979.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201cThe alleged incident in October, 1981 could probably again re-aggravate the existing osteoarthritis secondary to slipped femoral capital epiphysis. Therefore, it is my opinion that the recent pain is probably a result of the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>On July 3, 1983, the Columbus Regional Board of Review affirmed the April 20, 1983 decision of the district hearing officer. On February 8, 1985, the Industrial Commission (\u201ccommission\u201d) affirmed the decision of the Columbus Regional Board of Review \u201cfor the reason that it is supported by proof of record and is not contrary to law.\u201d On April 18, 1985, appellant filed a notice of appeal from the commission\u2019s decision, and on May 17, 1985, appellant filed a complaint in the Meigs County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant\u2019s complaint averred that the court below had jurisdiction concerning his appeal pursuant to R.C. 4123.519 and further demanded that he be found entitled to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund under claim No. 685926-22 for his June 21, 1979 injury. Appellees filed answers to appellant\u2019s complaint denying appellant\u2019s entitlement to further workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">On October 10, 1986, appellee Southern Ohio Coal Company filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1). On August 25, 1989, the court below granted the motion and dismissed the appeal, determining that the appeal pertained to appellant\u2019s extent of disability rather than his right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in dismissing his appeal from the decision of the commission since the issue to be tried was an issue \u201cother than a decision as to the extent of disability\u201d and was therefore properly appealable to the Meigs County Court of Common Pleas. R.C. 4123.519 provides that the claimant or the employer may&gt; appeal a decision of the commission \u201cin any injury or occupational disease case, <em>other than a decision as to the extent of disability.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">If the commission\u2019s decision is one going to the claimant\u2019s extent of disability, neither the claimant nor the employer may appeal; however, if the commission\u2019s decision is one going to the claimant\u2019s right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund, then it is appealable. <em>Cook v. Mayfield </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 200, 201, 543 N.E.2d 787, 789. The decision of the commission as to \u201cextent of disability\u201d presupposes that the claimant has been allowed the \u201cright to participate\u201d in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for injury to a specific part or parts of the body involving the loss or impairment of bodily functions. <em>State, ex rel. Kroger, v. Stover </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 229, 31 OBR 436, 510 N.E.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Appellant initially argues that the April 20, 1983 decision of the district hearing officer which was affirmed by both the Columbus Regional Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Review and the commission was phrased in causation language and therefore involved appellant\u2019s right to participate in the fund rather than the extent of his disability. However, merely uttering the incantation \u201ccausal relationship\u201d upon the grant or denial of any claim for benefits subsequent to the original award should not be used to circumvent the operation of R.C. 4123.519. <em>Hospitality Motor Inns v. Gillespie </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 206, 212, 20 O.O.3d 209, 212, 421 N.E.2d 134, 137. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s argument in this regard is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Appellant\u2019s main contention in his first assignment of error is that this case is controlled by the holding of the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Gilbert v. Midland-Ross Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 267, 21 O.O.3d 168, 423 N.E.2d 847. In <em>Gilbert, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio held, at paragraph two of the syllabus, that \u201c[a] decision to reactivate a previously allowed claim now dormant, when there has been an intervening trauma, is, in effect, a decision going to the claimant\u2019s right to participate in the fund for an injury or impairment not previously claimed or passed upon and is appealable.\u201d The Supreme Court in <em>Cook, supra, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 205, 543 N.E.2d at 792, described the <em>Gilbert </em>decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cOur decision in <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>also focused on the causal relationship between injury and disability. There, a claimant, an employee of Midland-Ross Corporation, suffered an industrial accident in 1975 for which he was awarded temporary total disability benefits. During claimant\u2019s disability, Midland-Ross sold the plant at which claimant worked to Midland Steel Products. Eleven days after returning to work at Midland Steel Products, the claimant was again injured. The claimant filed both a new claim against Midland Steel Products for the later injury as well as an application to reactivate the earlier claim against Midland-Ross. The Industrial Commission refused an appeal from the regional board\u2019s denial of the claim against Midland Steel Products but ordered reactivation of the earlier claim. On appeal, this court decided that the commission\u2019s decision was appealable because it \u2018 * * * determined a causal relationship between an injury and the claimant\u2019s disability and that it was therefore a decision other than as to the extent of disability.\u2019 <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>[67 Ohio St.2d] at 270, 21 O.O.3d at 170, 423 N.E.2d at 849.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\u201cIn <em>Gilbert, </em>we emphasized that the claimant\u2019s right to participate for the original accident essentially had ceased when he returned to work. His request for compensation for the second injury after he returned to work in effect \u2018 * * * began a new period of disability and therefore a renewed right to participate. This is not the same as merely extending an existing period of disability. It is the temporal separateness of the periods of disability, coupled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>with the intervening trauma, which makes this case different from those in which an additional award of benefits was held to implicate only the extent of disability.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 271-272, 21 O.O.3d at 171, 423 N.E.2d at 850.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Appellant herein, much like the claimant in <em>Gilbert, </em>arguably had two separate periods of disability, <em>i.e., </em>those periods following appellant\u2019s two work injuries of June 21, 1979 and May 8, 1980. However, unlike the claimant in <em>Gilbert, </em>appellant returned to work after both of these injuries and, accordingly, did not begin a new period of disability tantamount to a renewed right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Moreover, the intervening trauma in <em>Gilbert </em>was suffered at work, whereas here the intervening injury occurred in October 1981 when appellant fell down steps, several months following appellant\u2019s last day of work with appellee Southern Ohio Coal Company. A decision of the Industrial Commission to grant or deny additional compensation for a previously allowed claim, when there is no intervening trauma occurring at work, but merely an aggravation of a previously existing condition occurring away from work, is a decision which goes to the claimant\u2019s extent of disability and is not appealable. <em>State, ex rel. Roope, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 97, 2 OBR 649, 443 N.E.2d 157. Consequently, the holding in <em>Gilbert </em>is inapposite to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">If appellee were merely requesting additional compensation for a previously allowed condition, the commission\u2019s decision on this request would be as to the extent of disability; however, if appellee requested compensation for a new injury which would trigger a new period of disability, this, as in <em>Gilbert, </em>would be appealable because it would determine appellee\u2019s right to participate in the fund. <em>Cook, supra, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 205-206, 543 N.E.2d at 792-793; see, also, <em>State, ex rel. Bosch, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 94, 1 OBR 130, 438 N.E.2d 415. In the case at bar, the record manifestly shows that appellee was merely requesting additional compensation for a previously allowed condition in that his February 12, 1982 C-85-A application to reactivate his original June 21, 1979 claim requested \u201cauthorization for further compensation benefits\u201d pursuant to his original claim rather than asserting any new claim. Indeed, appellant\u2019s counsel effectively concedes this in his appellate brief by stating \u201cthat the Appellant\u2019s absence from work after July 3, 1981, was not precipitated by an intervening injury but was due to his complaints of hip pain <em>which were directly attributable to his work related injuries of June 21, 1979, and May 8, 1980 </em>\u201d and that the commission denied appellant\u2019s <em>\u201cclaim for additional </em>benefits.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, in that the decision of the commission denied appellant\u2019s request for additional benefits, the decision addressed the extent of his disability and was thus not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>appealable pursuant to R.C. 4123.519.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in granting appellee Southern Ohio Coal Company\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(1) motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where the motion was based upon facts outside the pleadings and which were genuine issues of material fact under Civ.R. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Appellant contends that the lower court improperly considered matters outside the averments of his complaint, <em>i.e., </em>affidavits and attached exhibits, in ruling on appellee\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The standard to apply for a dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1), lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, is whether the plaintiff has alleged any cause of action which the court has authority to decide. <em>Avco Financial Services Loan, Inc. v. Hale </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 65, 520 N.E.2d 1378; <em>Steffen v. Gen. Tele. Co. </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App.2d 144, 14 O.O.3d 111, 395 N.E.2d 1346. However, in determining whether the plaintiff has alleged a cause of action sufficient to withstand a Civ.R. 12(B)(1) motion to dismiss, the trial court is not confined to the allegations of the complaint and it may consider material pertinent to such inquiry without converting the motion into one for summary judgment. <em>Southgate Dev. Corp. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 211, 2 O.O.3d 393, 358 N.E.2d 526, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Pacific Chem. Products Co. v. Teletronics Services, Inc. </em>(1985), 29 Ohio App.3d 45, 47, 29 OBR 47, 49, 502 N.E.2d 669, 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In the case at bar, for the reasons stated in our disposition of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, the affidavits and exhibits indicated that appellant had not alleged any cause of action cognizable by the court of common pleas. R.C. 4123.519. Moreover, appellant arguably waived any error in this regard by failing to object below and, further, by filing his own affidavit and exhibits for the lower court\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(1) determination. See, <em>e.g., Williams v. Jerry L. Kaltenbach Ent., Inc. </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 113, 2 OBR 126, 440 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>N.E.2d 1219. Accordingly, the lower court did not err in granting appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(1) motion to dismiss. For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-6\">Abele, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b95-7\">Grey, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">. In <em>Cook, supra, </em>at syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court held that in decisions involving intervening incidents, district hearing officers, regional boards of review and the commission must clearly and fully state the exact nature of the intervening incident, including whether it was work related and whether there was a causal nexus between the intervening trauma and the claimed disability. In <em>Cook, </em>a remand was ordered because the record on appeal was unclear as to the exact nature of the intervening cause. Conversely, in the case at bar, as appellee Southern Ohio Coal Company notes, a remand is not required since the record herein discloses that it is uncontroverted that appellant's October 1981 injury occurred following his last day of work. However, in light of <em>Cook, </em>it would appear that future agency decisions regarding intervening incidents in workers\u2019 compensation cases should preferably contain the information specified by the Ohio Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b95-8\">Grey, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">I respectfully dissent. The issue in this case is one of the so-called flow-through injury claims, which sometimes are compensable claims. As such, the complaint here facially creates an issue which cannot be resolved by a Civ.R. 12(B) motion. At best, this case is susceptible to a motion for summary judgment supported by adequate documentation. It is clearly not a Civ.R. 12(B) case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">I would reverse and remand for further proceedings, and thus I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
