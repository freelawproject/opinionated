(\u201cPicker\u201d), plaintiffs\u2019 ex-employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">The complaint alleged plaintiffs, now of retirement age, who had been provided for in the employer-funded, noncontributory Trust Plan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> during their employment had accumulated the following vested benefits, <em>viz.:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">(1) David Barrett $25,057</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">(2) Donald Thorburn 18,000</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">(3) Gunter Wilkins 15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">The plaintiffs admitted all three of them went to work for competitors of Picker within two years of leaving Picker\u2019s employment. In so doing, they violated Article VII, Section 8.12 of the Trust Plan, which provided an employee forfeited any accrued benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">On August 1, 1988, defendants filed with the trial court a joint motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12 stating the grounds for dismissal as follows: (1) improper venue pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(3) since the profit sharing Trust Plan contained a forum selection clause obligating plaintiffs to bring the action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>the state of New York; and (2) lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(2) over Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, a New York corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">In the memorandum in support of defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss, defendants argue Ohio is not a proper forum, since Article XI, Section 11.09, of the profit sharing Trust Plan attached to defendants\u2019 memorandum provides plaintiffs were required to bring the action in New York state. Defendants contend Section 11.09 provides the \u201cTrust Plan\u201d must be \u201cconstrued according to the laws of the state of New York, where it is made and where it shall be enforced.\u201d Defendants additionally argue that Ohio lacks personal jurisdiction over Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, which is a New York corporation with no minimum contacts in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Plaintiffs filed a memorandum opposing defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss. On February 27, 1989, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion to \u201cEnforce Forum Selection Clause and Motion to Dismiss Without Prejudice.\u201d Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">\u201cI. The trial court committed prejudicial error by enforcing the forum selection clause in Picker\u2019s retirement plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by (1) enforcing the forum selection clause in Picker\u2019s Trust Plan, and (2) dismissing the present action. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">The Trust Plan was entered into by Picker and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, trustee. Plaintiffs are, therefore, third-party beneficiaries pursuant to the Trust Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Article XI, Section 11.09, of the plan states in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-12\">\u201cThis Trust Plan shall be construed according to the laws of the State of New York, where it is made and where it shall be enforced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">Historically, a forum selection clause in a contract was held <em>per se </em>invalid on the ground it attempted to \u201coust one court of its jurisdiction.\u201d See <em>Clinton v. Janger </em>(N.D.Ill.1984), 583 F.Supp. 284, 288, citing <em>Nute v. Hamilton Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1856), 72 Mass. (6 Gray) 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">However, since the landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>The Bremen v. Zapata OffShore Co. </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 1, 9-12, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 1912-1914, 32 L.Ed.2d 513, 519-521 a forum selection clause is generally valid unless construed to be unreasonable. The court held in <em>Bremen </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>\u201c * * * [A] forum selection clause that is fairly bargained for and not the result of fraud will be enforced so long as to do so is reasonable at the time of litigation and does not deprive a litigant of his day in court.\u201d See <em>United Std. Mgt. Corp. v. Mahoning Valley Solar Resources, Inc. </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 476, 477-478, 16 OBR 559, 559-560, 476 N.E.2d 724, 725-726.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The burden of so showing falls upon the party challenging the validity of the clause; in the case <em>sub judice, </em>this showing is the plaintiffs\u2019 burden. <em>Id.; Bremen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\"><em>Bremen </em>announced a general rule that a forum selection clause is presumptively valid and will be enforced by the forum unless the party who challenges it establishes their heavy burden of proof, <em>viz.: </em>(1) that the contract was the result of fraud or overreaching; (2) that enforcement would violate the strong public policy of the forum state, <em>i.e., </em>in this case, Ohio; and (3) that enforcement under the particular circumstances of the case would result in litigation in a jurisdiction so unreasonable, difficult and inconvenient that plaintiff would for all \u201cpractical purposes be deprived of his day in court.\u201d \u2018 <em>Bremen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">To fairly analyze whether the forum selection clause included in the Trust Plan that the employees were to benefit from was enforceable under the test in <em>Bremen, </em>it is incumbent upon this court to apply the test to the facts of the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Since plaintiffs do not claim the Trust Plan was \u25a0 the result of fraud or overreaching it is unnecessary to consider the first prong of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The second prong of the test in <em>Bremen </em>necessarily requires an analysis inquiring whether the enforcement of said clause would violate any strong public policy of the state of Ohio. This prong must fail for the reason that Ohio has virtually <em>no interest </em>in the contract or parties in question. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the contract was negotiated between two New York corporations. The choice of laws provision included in the contract provided New York law was to apply. Undeniably, the state of Ohio has an interest in providing a local forum for its residents, however, none of the plaintiffs resides in Ohio. <em>Rini Wine Co. v. Guild Wineries &amp; Distilleries </em>(N.D.Ohio 1985), 604 F.Supp. 1055, 1057. Assume, <em>arguendo, </em>Ohio had an interest in providing their residents with a friendly forum, the plaintiffs must prove Ohio\u2019s interest was <em>so substantial </em>as to defeat a valid contractual clause. <em>Rini Wine, supra; Bill Swad Leasing Co. v. General Elec. Credit Corp. </em>(Oct. 3, 1985), Franklin App. No. 85 AP-208, unreported, 1985 WL 10452. Since plaintiffs are nonresidents, this proof would be difficult if not impossible to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>The third prong of the test in <em>Bremen </em>mandates an inquiry into reasonability in the specific factual situation of applying the forum selection clause to these particular plaintiffs. To decide the reasonability issue we are persuaded by the factors set forth in <em>Clinton, supra, </em>as guidelines which follow: (1) which law controls the contractual dispute; (2) what residency do the parties maintain; (3) where will the contract be executed; (4) where are the witnesses and parties to the litigation located; and (5) whether the forum\u2019s designated location is inconvenient to the parties. <em>Clinton, supra, </em>citing <em>Furbee v. Vantage Press, Inc. </em>(C.A.D.C.1972), 464 F.2d 835, 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">The first factor analyzed reveals New York law controls the Trust Plan pursuant to a choice of laws clause. These choices of laws clauses have been held valid by the Ohio Supreme Court if reasonable and fair. See <em>Jarvis v. Ashland Oil, Inc. </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 189, 17 OBR 427, 478 N.E.2d 786; <em>Schulke v. Radio Productions, Ltd. v. Midwestern Broadcasting Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 436, 6 OBR 480, 453 N.E.2d 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The second and fourth relevant factors, which inquire into the residency and location of the parties and witnesses, find all three plaintiffs now reside outside Ohio and have done so since 1969.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, as their complaint indicates, all reside outside Ohio as of the filing date, 1988; Barrett resided in Wisconsin, Thorburn in Florida and Wilkins in West Germany. The witnesses to be called besides plaintiffs necessarily would be either Picker or Manufacturers Hanover representatives. Since both corporations are incorporated in New York, the choice of this jurisdiction seems to offer an advantage to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Pursuant to the third relevant factor, the contract or Trust Plan was executed in the state of New York and the Trust Plan would be administered and all obligations performed in New York with trust funds dispersed to recipients from the New York offices of the trustee, Manufacturers Hanover.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Lastly, the most striking factor to be applied is the fifth prong of the test which assesses the convenience or inconvenience for the plaintiffs of litigating in the New York forum. Considering the diverse location of plaintiffs\u2019 residences, all outside Ohio and one even in a foreign country, it seems the New York state forum is certainly reasonable and not fraught with any measure of disadvantage for plaintiffs in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Therefore, applying the above criteria, the forum selection clause in the Trust Plan was reasonable under all five prongs of the test and did not violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>either substantial Ohio public policy concerns or deprive plaintiffs of their day in court. The trial court properly held enforcement of the forum selection clause was valid and, hence, New York is the proper forum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Plaintiffs argue that since they did not \u201cfairly bargain for\u201d the terms of the Trust Plan, they should not be bound by the forum selection clause. See <em>Bremen, supra. </em>Plaintiffs, as third-party beneficiaries, do however seek to benefit from all the other trust terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">It is axiomatic that choice of law and choice of forum clauses in contracts promote stable and dependable contractual and trade relations. <em>Bremen, supra. </em>Furthermore, in relation to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that as third-party beneficiaries they should not be bound by the forum selection clause, the holding in <em>Coastal Steel v. Tilghman Wheelabrator Ltd. </em>(C.A.3 1983), 709 F.2d 190, 203, is highly persuasive when stating its reluctance to introduce any exception to enforcement of forum selection clauses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agn\">\u201cIntroducing into the common law of enforceability of forum selection clauses a third-party beneficiary exception would be inconsistent with that rationale. It would, moreover, be inconsistent with the law of contracts, which has long recognized that third-party beneficiary status does not permit the avoidance of contractual provisions otherwise enforceable.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 status as third-party beneficiaries cannot be used as both a sword to reap the benefits of the Trust Plan and a shield to protect them from enforcement of the forum selection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Lastly, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the Eighth District Court of Appeals case of <em>Green v. Picker Corp. </em>(Mar. 29, 1979), Cuyahoga App. No. 38621, unreported, is entirely inapposite and distinguishable from the facts in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The court in <em>Green </em>determined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">\u201cIn the instant case, it is unreasonable to require appellant, whose financial resources are far less than those of Picker Corporation, to bring this action in New York when he worked for the corporation in Ohio, and the parties to the lawsuit, appellant, the corporation, and the five members of the Retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Income Plan Committee, are all Ohio residents, subject to the jurisdiction of Ohio courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">In light of the above analysis, since plaintiffs all reside outside Ohio and are unable to indicate any unreasonableness or hardship whatsoever in litigating the Trust Plan in the New York forum as designated by the Trust Plan, and since plaintiffs will not be deprived of their day in court, the venue selection clause controls and plaintiffs must litigate their cause of action in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Accordingly, plaintiffs first assignment of error is not well taken and overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">\u201cII. Not only did the trial court commit prejudicial error by enforcing the forum selection clause, it also committed prejudicial error by dismissing the present action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred in dismissing the action since the defense of improper venue is never a ground for the dismissal of a lawsuit. Plaintiffs contend the trial court should have stayed the proceedings pending refiling in the proper forum. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Civ.R. 3(D) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-10\">\u201cWhen a court, upon motion of any party or upon its own motion, determines: (1) that the county in which the action is brought is not a proper forum; (2) that there is no other proper forum for trial within this state; and (3) that there exists a proper forum for trial in another jurisdiction outside this state, the court shall stay the action upon condition that all defendants consent to the jurisdiction, waive venue, and agree that the date of commencement of the action in Ohio shall be the date of commencement for the application of the statute of limitations to the action in that forum in another jurisdiction which the court deems to be the proper forum. If all defendants agree to the conditions, the court shall not dismiss the action, but the action shall be stayed until the court receives notice by affidavit that plaintiff has recommenced the action in the out-of-state forum within sixty days after the effective date of the order staying the original action. If the plaintiff fails to recommence the action in the out-of-state forum within the sixty day period, the court shall dismiss the action without prejudice. If all defendants do not agree to or comply with the conditions, the court shall hear the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">The trial court, thus, with the agreement of all defendants, had the option of staying the instant action to give plaintiffs time within which to recommence in a proper forum. Hence, pursuant to Civ.R. 3(D), the trial court erred in dismissing the case <em>sub judice. </em>Accord <em>Romanchik v. Lucak </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 215, 542 N.E.2d 699; <em>Price v. Wheeling Dollar Savings </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 315, 9 OBR 581, 460 N.E.2d 264. This cause will be remanded with instructions to the trial court to institute a sixty-day stay pursuant to Civ.R. 3(D), in order that plaintiffs may refile this action in the proper forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 second assignment of error is well taken and sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-6\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by dismissing the present action because Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company is not an indispensable party and the trial court has personal jurisdiction over Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third assignment of error is worthy of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Plaintiffs argue the trial court has personal jurisdiction over defendant Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and even if the court did not, defendant is not an indispensable party to the present action. Although our resolution of the first assignment of error negates the need for determining jurisdiction of the Ohio court over Manufacturers Hanover, the Ohio forum, nevertheless, has personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is persuasive but does not affect the resolution of the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The Ohio Supreme Court stated in <em>Anilas, Inc. v. Kern </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 165, 166, 28 OBR 257, 258, 502 N.E.2d 1025, 1027, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">\u201cIn determining whether a state court may properly exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, the primary question is whether the defendant purposefully established \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 with the forum state, <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington </em>(1945), 326 U.S. 310, at 316 [66 S.Ct. 154, at 158, 90 L.Ed. 95, at 101-102], and \u2018purposefully availed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state.\u2019 <em>Hanson v. Denckla </em>(1958), 357 U.S. 235, 253, [78 S.Ct. 1228, 1239, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283, 1297-1298]. \u2018This \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of \u201crandom,\u201d \u201cfortuitous,\u201d or \u201cattenuated\u201d contacts, * * * or of the \u201cunilateral activity of another party or a third person[.]\u201d \u2019 <em>Burger King Corp. [v. Rudzewicz </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 462], at 475 [105 S.Ct. 2174, 2183, 85 L.Ed.2d 528, 542] (citations omitted.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Plaintiffs established Manufacturers Hanover Trust the trustee for the Picker retirement plan. As trustee it was required to perform numerous functions over many decades associated with servicing the retirement plan and disbursing benefit money to Ohio employees from the trust: for all these services defendant Manufacturers Hanover would, no doubt, be paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>defendant Picker. Plaintiffs attached to their memorandum in opposition to defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction a letter from the Ohio Superintendent of Banks certifying Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company is licensed to exercise trust powers in Ohio for the year from March 20, 1988 to 1989 pursuant to R.C. 1109.18. Moreover, Manufacturers Hanover had maintained a long-term trusteeship since 1961 with Picker and its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">A license to do business in Ohio is <em>per se </em>sufficient evidence upon which to conclude defendant had the necessary minimum contacts and purposeful availment of our Ohio forum to subject it to personal jurisdiction in Ohio. See <em>Price, supra; </em>R.C. 1109.17 to 1109.19. Concomitantly, R.C. 1109.18, which deals with foreign corporations seeking to do trust business in Ohio, requires such corporation appoint a statutory agent upon which process may be served. A corporation expressly consents to an Ohio court\u2019s exercise of in personam jurisdiction if pursuant to statute such agent is appointed on its behalf. Klein, Browne, Murtaugh, Baldwin\u2019s Ohio Civil Practice (1988) 37, Section 3.03. Furthermore, it is logical to assume any trust company seeking administrative business in Ohio reasonably is on notice it may be open to judicial scrutiny within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Pursuant to Civ.R. 19(A), Manufacturers Hanover Trust is a necessary party. It is unnecessary to undertake an analysis of their indispensability for dismissal purposes under Civ.R. 19(B) since joinder is feasible and Ohio has personal jurisdiction over Manufacturers Hanover.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 third assignment of error is mooted by our holding in assignment of error number one.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the trial court decision enforcing the forum selection clause in the Trust Plan is affirmed. The trial court\u2019s action dismissing the within cause without prejudice is reversed and remanded with instructions for the trial court to stay the action with the agreement of all defendants. The plaintiff may recommence the action in the New York forum and then notify the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas court within sixty days pursuant to Civ.R. 3(D) or face dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part and the cause is remanded for action consistent with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b861-10\">Nahra and Victor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b861-11\">William H. Victor, J., retired, of the Ninth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-17\">. The Trust Plan was established December 26, 1952 and amended from time to time. Effective January 1, 1968, Manufacturers Hanover Trust became the successor trustee employed to administer the Picker Trust Plan to all employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-9\">. The letter from plaintiffs to Steven Zysman attached to the defendants\u2019 joint motion in the trial court to enforce the forum selection clause dated Jan. 23, 1969 indicated Barrett and Wilkins lived in Massachusetts and Thorburn lived in New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b858-10\">. On January 23, 1969 plaintiffs wrote a letter to defendant Picker addressed to Steven Zysman, Treasurer, informing defendant they had retained a New York firm of attorneys to assist them in recovering funds due them from Picker and the Trust Plan. Plaintiffs did not sue in New York in 1969; however, plaintiffs waited until April 5, 1988 to file this action in Ohio via Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Plaintiffs candidly admit to forum shopping in their briefs since they state New York law recognizes the validity of forfeiture and non-competition clauses in profit-sharing and pension plans. Plaintiffs are also acutely aware of <em>Snarr v. Picker Corp. </em>(Aug. 15, 1985), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 48893 and 48925, unreported, 1985 WL 4328, cited in their brief concerning a favorable decision from this court on the Trust Plan forfeiture clause in a distinguishable fact situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
