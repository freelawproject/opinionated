Appellant assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">\u201cI. The Ross County Court of Common Pleas violated appellant\u2019s constitutional due process rights by issuing a protection order against her without notice and opportunity to be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">\u201cII. The Ross County Court Of Common Pleas had no jurisdiction and no authority under R.C. 3113.31 to issue a protection order against appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">\u201cHI. The Ross County Court of Common Pleas erred as a matter of law by issuing a protection order against appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">The facts pertinent to this appeal are as follows. On March 15, 1989, appellant filed, in the court below, her petition in domestic violence supported by affidavit. Therein, appellant alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that she and appellee cohabited, that appellee was abusive to her, and that she was in fear of physical harm. Appellant sought both an <em>ex parte </em>and a permanent protection order under R.C. 3113.31. An <em>ex parte </em>order was granted that day and a full hearing was scheduled for March 23, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">Due to difficulties in obtaining service on appellee, the <em>ex parte </em>order and hearing were continued, several times, until April 20, 1989. At that time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>appellee appeared at the hearing, <em>pro se, </em>and consented to a protection order. Toward the end of the hearing, appellee requested that the court issue a similar protection order against appellant. Without any presentation of evidence, and over objection of counsel, the requested order was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">On April 27, 1989, a judgment granting a one-year protection order against both parties was filed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment further scheduled a subsequent hearing to determine ownership of personal property located in appellant\u2019s residence, but found, with respect to the protective orders, that there was no just reason for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The provisions in R.C. 3113.31 were enacted in 1978 as part of the Ohio \u201cdomestic violence act\u201d to provide specific civil remedies to combat domestic violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Am.Sub.H.B. No. 835 (137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3524). As amended, the statute provides for an <em>ex parte </em>protection order to issue upon the filing of a petition alleging domestic violence. See R.C. 3113.31(C) and (D). The <em>ex parte </em>order may direct respondent to, among other things, refrain from abusing household members <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and grant exclusive possession of the residence to petitioner to the exclusion of respondent. See R.C. 3113.-31(E)(1)(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>In her first two assignments of error, appellant advances dual arguments and, therefore, we will consider them jointly. First, appellant asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court below was obligated, both statutorily and under generally accepted due process standards of notice and hearing, to afford her a proper hearing in which to defend herself before judgment could be entered against her under R.C. 3113.31. Then appellant argues that she was denied such a hearing and, therefore, an entry of judgment against her was in error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Generally, due process of law as guaranteed by the federal and state Constitutions requires some legal procedure in which the person proceeded against, if that person is to be concluded by a judgment, must be afforded an opportunity to defend himself. <em>State, ex rel. Hoel, v. Brown </em>(1922), 105 Ohio St. 479, 486, 138 N.E. 230, 232-233; <em>Grieb v. Dept. of Liquor Control </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 77, 81, 41 O.O. 148, 150, 90 N.E.2d 691, 693. The fundamental requisites of due process of law are notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>Voeller v. Neilston Warehouse Co. </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 427, 434, 17 O.O. 16, 19, 26 N.E.2d 442, 446, reversed on other grounds (1941), 311 U.S. 531, 61 S.Ct. 376, 85 L.Ed. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Furthermore, as appellant asserts, the opportunity to be heard and to defend oneself is required by R.C. 3113.31 before judgment of a protection order can be entered against a party to the action. The statute provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u201c(E)(1) After an ex parte or <em>full hearing, </em>the court may grant any protection order, with or without bond, or approve any consent agreement to bring about a cessation of domestic violence against the family or household members.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Insofar as R.C. 3113.31 is concerned, and to a more general degree with regard to due process, we must determine what is meant by the phrase \u201cfull hearing\u201d and also determine whether appellant was granted such a hearing. Initially, we note that the statute does not define \u201cfull hearing.\u201d We are also unable to find any reported decision in this state which defines the parameters of a \u201cfull hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">However, other jurisdictions have determined that a \u201cfull hearing\u201d embraces not only the right to present evidence, but also a reasonable opportunity to know the claims of an opposing party and to meet them. <em>Morgan v. United States </em>(1937), 304 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. 773, 776, 82 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>1129, 1132. See, also, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.Rev.1979) 605. A \u201cfull hearing\u201d is one in which ample opportunity is afforded to all parties to make, by evidence and argument, a showing fairly adequate to establish the propriety or impropriety of the step asked to be taken. <em>Akron, C. &amp; Y. Ry. Co. v. United States </em>(1923), 261 U.S. 184, 200, 43 S.Ct. 270, 277, 67 L.Ed. 605, 614; <em>Boston &amp; Maine RR. v. United States </em>(D.Mass.1962) 208 F.Supp. 661, 669; <em>Consolidated Freightways v. United States </em>(N.D.Wash.1949), 83 F.Supp. 811, 814; <em>Application of Kauai </em>(1978), 60 Haw. 166, 182, 590 P.2d 524, 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Without attempting to set definitive guidelines for the manner in which to conduct a \u201cfull hearing\u201d under R.C. 3113.31, we hold that where the issuance of a protection order is contested,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court must, at the very least, allow for presentation of evidence, both direct and rebuttal, as well as arguments. In ascertaining whether such opportunity was granted to appellant, we note the following portion of the transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\u201cMR. LANDERS: I would also like for the same protection for me, that she stay away from me. Even after I\u2019ve been served this petition, she\u2019s still gone and found out where I\u2019m at and we\u2019ve had lunch together and things like that. * * * I\u2019d also like for the same protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to have to go back to the statute. I\u2019m not sure that this statute permits that kind of, that kind of order, although I think under the same section of the statute which grants the Court authority to grant other equitable relief, the Court would have the authority to provide for restraint against Ms. Deacon from any harassment or molestation. I don\u2019t say this, Ms. Deacon, by way of pointing a finger or agreeing with Mr. Landers, but so long as you both understand that you\u2019re just not to have any contact. Your\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">\u201cMS. KOWIESKI: Your Honor, I would object at this time to granting Mr. Landers some kind of restraining order without so much as an affidavit on his part indicating evidence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: What\u2019s the problem? You certainly don\u2019t want your client associating with him, and he doesn\u2019t want her associating with him, and I think that the bare statement is sufficient to grant restraint. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be necessary, but I don\u2019t see any reason why it hurts anything. Nobody\u2019s mad at your client, Ms. Kowieski. We\u2019re just trying to be fair about this and saying that neither party should have anything to do with the other. It\u2019s a very simple matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201cMS. KOWIESKI: No, I agree with that, Your Honor. I believe that is, would be accomplished by the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: It will be accomplished by restraining your client from any contact with Mr. Landers and that will also be in the order * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">It is manifestly clear from this exchange that appellant was denied an opportunity to cross-examine appellee and to present rebuttal evidence. Accordingly, we hold that appellant was neither given a \u201cfull hearing\u201d under R.C. 3113.31, nor afforded an opportunity to be heard or defend herself consistent with due process of law. Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are, therefore, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In her final assignment of error, appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence adduced at trial to sustain the issuance of a protection order and, thus, the court erred as a matter of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">In <em>Thomas v. Thomas </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 6, 8, 540 N.E.2d 745, 746, the Franklin County Court of Appeals held that \u201c[t]he statutory criterion to determine whether or not to grant a civil protection order pursuant to R.C. 3113.31 is <em>the existence or threatened existence of domestic violence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The only evidence offered by appellee in support of his request for a protection order was testimony that, after the petition in the action below had been served, appellant sought him out and they had lunch. Such testimony cannot support a finding of the existence, or threatened existence, of domestic violence as defined in R.C. 3113.31(A)(1) (i.e., causing, or attempting to cause bodily injury, placing another person in fear of imminent harm or abusing a child).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The decision to grant a civil protection order is within the discretion of the court. See <em>Thomas, supra, </em>at 8, 540 N.E.2d at 746. An abuse of that discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies an unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable attitude. <em>Cedar Bay Constr., Inc. v. Fremont </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 19, 22, 552 N.E.2d 202, 205; <em>Steiner v. Custer </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 448, 19 O.O. 148, 31 N.E.2d 855, at paragraph two of the syllabus. Arbitrary means without adequate determining principle, or not governed by any fixed rules or standard. <em>Cedar Bay Constr., Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>supra, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 22, 552 N.E.2d at 205. There being no evidence to support a finding of domestic violence or threat of domestic violence by appellant against appellee, we hold that the grant of a protection order against appellant constituted, an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Having sustained appellant\u2019s three assignments of error, we vacate that portion of the judgment herein appealed and, pursuant to App.R. 12(B), enter final judgment in favor of appellant as to such portion of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-6\">Abele, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b64-7\">Grey, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\">. The protection order provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\"(1) By agreement of the parties * * * Robert Landers is enjoined and restrained from assaulting, harassing, threatening, abusing, or otherwise intimidating Ruth Deacon, * * * and that Robert Landers shall refrain from coming around or entering Petitioner\u2019s residence at 547 Plyley\u2019s Lane # 67, Chillicothe, Ohio or any other place where respondent knows or has reason to know that petitioner may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">\u201c(2) Upon the request of the Respondent, Petitioner is similarly restrained from assaulting, harassing, threatening or abusing Respondent * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Such order was made effective for one year pursuant to R.C. 3113.31(E)(3) which provides, in part, that any order issued under the statute shall be valid until a \"date certain, but not later than one year from the date of its issuance.\u201d On June 28, 1989, this court granted a stay of execution on the order pending appeal and, therefore, the issue has not been rendered moot by lapse of time since the order was journalized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-10\">. \"Domestic violence\" is defined by R.C. 3113.31(A)(1) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">\" \u2018Domestic violence\u2019 means the occurrence of one or more of the following acts against a family or household member:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or recklessly causing bodily injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">\u201c(b) Placing another person by the threat of force in fear of imminent serious physical harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-14\">\u201c(c) Committing any act with respect to a child that would result in the child being an abused child, as defined in section 2151.031 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-15\">. \"Household members\" is defined by R.C. 3113.31(A)(3) to include, among others, a spouse or person living as a spouse of the respondent. A person living as a spouse of the respondent is further defined as one who has lived with the respondent in a common-law marital relationship, or one who has otherwise cohabited with respondent within one year prior to the date of the alleged act of domestic violence. R.C. 3113.31(A)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-10\">. We note that in an unrelated context, a mere \u201chearing\u201d has been held to include the introduction of testimony and documents. See <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1971), 29 Ohio App.2d 219, 222, 58 O.O.2d 372, 373, 280 N.E.2d 393, 395.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\">. In that appellee has not appealed the issuance of the protection order against himself, we limit our holding to contested protection orders only. However, it should be noted that R.C. 3113.31(E)(1) provides that <em>\"[a]fter </em>an <em>ex parte </em>or full hearing, the court may * * * approve any consent agreement * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, it can be argued that even in a noncontested case, evidence must be presented to sustain the issuance of a consent protection order. This approach appears to have been taken by at least one jurisdiction. In <em>Ehrhart v. Ehrhart </em>(Mo.App.1989), 776 S.W.2d 450, a Missouri Court of Appeals reversed a protection order issued by a lower court in that state. Although the lower court held a hearing at which it directed questions at both parties and despite both parties having <em>stipulated </em>that a previous <em>ex parte </em>protection order would continue, the court of appeals reversed because there had been no evidence presented in a proper adversarial proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b64-8\">Grey, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">I respectfully dissent. I believe we are elevating form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">I agree with the majority that a court may not impose a protective order against a person without due process, but that is not what happened here. The court, based on the evidence, found that granting the order was warranted and said it would issue it. Respondent then asked, in effect, that a condition of the order be that petitioner leave him alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">R.C. 3113.31(E)(1)(h) says that the court may \u201cgrant other relief that the court considers equitable and fair * * While the order actually entered in this case did not expressly state that petitioner\u2019s obligation to leave respondent alone was a condition precedent to respondent\u2019s obligation to leave petitioner alone, the entry cannot be construed in any other way. I do not regard this as error in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">The majority opinion strikes paragraph two of the entry and affirms the balance. I do not find error, even harmless error, but if I did, I would give the trial court the opportunity, on remand, to correct what is, at most, nothing more than an imprecise use of words.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">Thus, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
