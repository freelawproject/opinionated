On the contrary, resolution is not infrequently accomplished by the party litigants themselves through agreement and settlement before, during or even after litigation. In the achievement of such settlement, the parties are, or should be, encouraged. For a long time it has been a commonplace of those charged with resolving disputes that <em>interest reipubli-cae ut sit finis litium.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">As in most legal undertakings, precision of meaning, which fosters in turn a need for precision of language, has proven essential to the achievement of settlement. Otherwise, a case that has been compromised with the intention that it be permanently interred is apt, following a change of circumstances, to undergo a full-scale resurrection. In large measure, people remain litigious, and many are not averse to seizing any second chance they think may be open to them, if it means an opportunity for better results. The desire to ensure that there will be no disturbance of R.I.P. status for settled cases has led to colorful language in releases and other settlement documents, acknowledging, as they not infrequently do, the abandonment of claims \u201cfrom the beginning of the world until the date hereof,\u201d when a more modest reference back to 1492, 1066 or even 476 would probably ensure sufficient protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Of course, the prospect of a settlement\u2019s coming undone is manifestly less when it has been entered under circumstances that prevent the parties from ever learning what the eventual result of full litigation would have been. Such is the case, for example, in countless vehicle accident suits, for settlement in such instances usually eliminates any basis for determining what the judge or jury would have decided as to the issue of fault, or as to the amount of appropriate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">There are, however, occasions upon which the wish to purchase peace is compelling enough for the parties to compromise claims that are related to other collateral, ongoing disputes that will ultimately, despite any settlement, be resolved one way or the other. Such resolution will disclose which of the settling parties was abstractly right, which would win or lose, and hence which will have gained by settling and which will have lost.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in return for other advantages a party may be willing to give up the fight with respect to a particular collateral, as yet undecided issue, as its resolution would affect the question directly at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">The ease now before us presents such an ongoing, collateral matter and a settlement that the parties mutually agree did finally dispose of a number of contested issues. The question confronting us is whether general language in the settlement documents likewise extended to one crucial, contested issue, or whether the language of settlement only controlled if one of the parties was victorious in the collateral matter. It is earnestly contended before this court that the issue that was apparently settled was actually intended by the parties to await further developments in the way of a decision in a collateral matter which, if favorable to one of the parties, would lead to further specialized negotiations or litigation. In short, we must decide whether the settlement was intended by the parties to be complete or only partial. It is, of course, elementary that an unambiguous document controls, unaffected by contentions of one of the parties that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>he, she or it meant something else. <em>See Skyline Corp. v. NLRB, </em>613 F.2d 1328, 1334 (5th Cir.1980) (as a general rule, \u201ca mistake by one party to an agreement, where it is not induced by acts of the other party, will not constitute grounds for relief\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">After that spate of generalities, we turn to the particular facts of the case before us. Consolidated Gas Supply Corp. (\u201cCGS\u201d), an interstate natural gas pipeline company, has had more than one occasion to lock horns with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d), and no doubt will have other opportunities in the future to do so. Proper rates to be charged by CGS to its customers is the common focus of such disputes, with justness and reasonableness constituting the tests for allowable rates. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717c(a) and 717d(a); and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3314. A consideration in a number of prior disputes has been the applicability of a FERC policy requiring a pipeline company such as CGS to structure resale prices based on the \u201ccost of service method\u201d for \u201cold\u201d gas, <em>i.e., </em>the gas emanating from wells that have existed for some time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The FERC\u2019s position, up until June 28, 1983, the date a decisive Supreme Court opinion appeared,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has been that computations should be made exclusively with reference to the actual costs associated with the opening and maintenance of wells producing \u201cold\u201d gas. Since the costs associated with producing gas from more recently developed wells are higher, the efforts of CGS (and doubtless of others in a similar position) have been directed at having a uniform area or nationwide approach to pricing gas,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> regardless of whether in any particular case the gas is \u201cold\u201d or \u201cnew.\u201d The resulting mix of \u201cnew\u201d gas costs with those of \u201cold\u201d gas would in general produce higher gas prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The passage into law of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (\u201cNGPA\u201d) (enacted November 9, 1978 and effective December 1, 1978), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301 <em>et seq., </em>presented a complicating factor. Prices under the NGPA were to be calculated on the basis of costs associated with all gas production, including both \u201cold\u201d gas and \u201cnew.\u201d <em>See Public Service Commission of New York v. Mid-Louisiana Gas Co., </em>463 U.S. 319, 103 S.Ct. 3024, 77 L.Ed.2d 668 (5-4 decision) (1983). In respects here significant, the Supreme Court affirmed the substance of a decision of the Fifth Circuit rendered on December 23, 1981, which addressed this facet of NGPA pricing. In <em>Mid-Louisiana, vacating and remanding Mid-Louisiana Gas Co. v. FERC, </em>664 F.2d 530 (5th Cir.1981), the Supreme Court held that the NGPA \u201cmaximum rates pricing\u201d approach did apply to \u201cold\u201d gas produced by interstate pipelines. CGS was a party to the <em>Mid-Louisiana </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">During the interval between November 9, 1978 and June 28, 1983, however, the FERC maintained the position that a \u201ccost of service\u201d approach, measured by the actual costs of producing the \u201cold\u201d gas, should continue to be used in the case of most sales by interstate pipelines despite the enactment of NGPA. <em>See </em>FERC Orders No. 58, 44 Fed.Reg. 66,577 (issued Nov. 14, 1979); No. 98, 45 Fed.Reg. 53,091 (issued Aug. 4, 1980), and No. 102, 45 Fed. Reg. 67,083 (issued Oct. 3, 1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>administrative dream was not finally shattered until the Supreme Court rendered its decision on June 28, 1983. Under the circumstances, however, as to <em>open </em>matters, the FERC had already regarded itself as \u201cobligated to implement the mandate\u201d of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and had commenced prospective application of the <em>Mid-Louisiana </em>decision even while review in the Supreme Court was pending.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Against that background, we must divine the parties\u2019 intent when they entered two settlements, one developed under Docket No. RP79-22 (consolidated with other docket items) and addressing pricing for the period December 1, 1978 through June 30, 1980, and the other Docket No. RP80-61 dealing with pricing for the period from July 1, 1980 through December 31, 1981. We note that CGS applied on December 29, 1978 for general rate increases, seeking application of the NGPA pricing approach ultimately validated in <em>Mid-Louisiana. </em>Anticipating FERC rejection, however, CGS also submitted an alternate tariff sheet figured on the basis of the \u201ccost of service\u201d method, <em>i.e., </em>the one that used \u201cold\u201d costs in pricing production. The FERC rejected the new approach, and opted instead for the tariff sheet reflecting the \u201ccost of service\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">A settlement of seven pending rate cases and one certificate case was proposed by CGS on June 22, 1979. It suggested that the proceedings regarding pricing for pipeline production be terminated without prejudice to the right of any party to seek rehearing and court review of the applicability of the NGPA approach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The tariff sheet employing the \u201call production\u201d approach based on the NGPA was rejected by the FERC in its letter order of August 2, 1979, and instead the alternate tariff sheet with pricing on the \u201ccost of service\u201d basis was accepted. The settlement agreement was certified to the FERC by CGS on August 16, 1979 and was approved by the FERC on November 16, 1979.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> CGS\u2019 application for rehearing on the NGPA pricing issue was formally denied on November 19, 1980, after the FERC had promulgated formal regulations excluding much of \u201cold\u201d pipeline production from NGPA pricing. Following the August 2, 1979 letter order rejecting NGPA pricing, CGS had exercised its explicitly reserved right to take the matter to court, thereby raising, as Docket No. 79-1546, one of the controversies we here undertake to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">The next relevant step in litigation was CGS\u2019 filing on July 30, 1982 of a proposed tariff change related to the purchased gas cost adjustment permitted in its tariff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The objective was to obtain <em>Mid-Louisiana </em>treatment retroactively, for purposes of determining maximum lawful prices. On August 31, 1982, <em>i.e., </em>after the Fifth Circuit decision in <em>Mid-Louisiana </em>but prior to the Supreme Court ruling, the FERC did order the filing of CGS proposed tariff sheets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>permitting them to become effective September 1, 1982, but subject to refund. A surcharge over a three-year period was proposed by CGS, to permit it to recover the differences that accrued during the December 1, 1978 through December 31, 1981 period, between what NGPA pricing would have yielded and what the \u201ccost of service\u201d method had actually produced. The FERC\u2019s acceptance of the proposed surcharge was made subject to the outcome of another proceeding (Docket No. RP82-64000) in which CGS initially sought and, again subject to possible refund, obtained prospective application of NGPA pricing for \u201cold\u201d pipeline production. <em>See generally Consolidated Gas Supply Corp., </em>22 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,120 at 61,179 (Feb. 4, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Despite these multiple filings and carefully constructed proposals, however, on February 4, 1983 the FERC acted on its own accord to modify the order of August 31, 1982.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It directed that the impact of settlement agreements entered between CGS and the FERC for the periods a) July 1, 1978 through June 30, 1980 and b) July I, 1980 through December 31, 1981 be taken into account.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The settlement agreement for December 1, 1978 through June 30, 1980 was recognized by the FERC as having preserved the right of CGS \u201cto make retroactive collection of [NGPA] costs____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,181. Hence, subject to further proceedings in <em>Mid-Louisiana </em>designed to ascertain the trigger-point for NGPA pricing along the gas marketing system, the decision by the FERC with respect to the period December 1, 1978 through June 30, 1980 was favorable to CGS and is affirmed by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">By contrast, there were substantial differences in the language appearing in the settlement agreement covering the period July 1, 1980 through December 31, 1981, which differences led the FERC to conclude that no reservation of \u201cany right to assert NGPA treatment for pipeline production\u201d had been made in that settlement. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the FERC\u2019s modifying order of February 4, 1983 denied to CGS the right retroactively to use NGPA pricing for the time span between July 1,1980 and December 31, 1981.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">The practice has not been uncommon for a pipeline company and the FERC to negotiate a settlement once a rate increase request has been set for hearing. When such a settlement has been reached between the company and the FERC staff, it must still win the approval of the Commission itself, which approval is granted only after an opportunity for comment has been afforded to interested persons. To gain final approval, the Commission must be satisfied that it is \u201cfair and reasonable and in the public interest.\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.-602(g)(3) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">As noted above, the document embodying the settlement covering the period between December 1, 1978 and June 30, 1980, RP79-22, was forwarded to the FERC by counsel for CGS by letter dated June 22, 1979, and became effective with formal FERC approval on November 16, 1979. The significance of the earlier RP79-22 settlement agreement lies in the clear specificity with which CGS reserved its right to seek relief, at a future time (no doubt dependent on the ultimate outcome of Mid-Louisiana), through application of the NGPA \u201call cost\u201d approach to transactions occurring between December 1, 1978 and June 30, 1980.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Before this court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>FERC has relied on language differences in the second settlement agreement covering July 1, 1980 through December 31, 1981 (Docket No. RP80-61), which it contends dictate the application of a general principle that broad changes in phraseology signify differences in meaning.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While as a generality that may be true, the possibility also exists that alterations in the circumstances that are addressed, or a simple desire to demonstrate versatility in expressing the same idea \u2014 not a variation in intent \u2014 may underlie changes in the words employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On January 30, 1980 the FERC ordered that \u201ccosts of old pipeline production should be based on cost of service____\u201d <em>See generally Consolidated Gas Supply Corp., </em>22 F.E.R.C. \u00b661, 120 at 61,181 (Feb. 4, 1983). The order rejected the tariff sheet submitted by CGS that sought to apply NGPA pricing for pipeline production. A settlement agreement in RP80-61, governing the period between July 1, 1980 and December 31,1981, was filed on February 6, 1981, certified to the FERC on March 5, 1981, and approved by the Commission on April 3, 1981.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Consolidated Gas Supply Corp., </em>15 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,006 (Apr. 3, 1981). The FERC later specifically determined that the rejection of NGPA pricing had not been appealed by CGS, nor had the issue been reserved by the settlement agreement. <em>See Consolidated Gas Supply Corp., </em>22 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,120 at 61,181 (Feb. 4, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Formal approval of the settlement agreement accordingly was after the <em>Mid-Louisiana </em>case had first been instituted in the Fourth Circuit on October 6, 1980, and transferred to the Fifth Circuit on December 2, 1980, but prior to the December 23, 1981 decision by the Fifth Circuit and <em>a fortiori </em>before the Supreme Court spoke on June 28, 1983. The RP80-61 settlement agreement, therefore, was negotiated while the applicability of the NGPA pricing method to \u201cold\u201d gas was very much in dispute and hotly contested by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">A direct comparison of specific sections of the settlement agreements in Docket Nos. RP79-22 and 80-61 serves to illuminate the meaning of both. The \u201cStipulation and Agreement\u201d covering Docket No. RP79-22 and associated docket items for the period December 1, 1978 through June 30, 1980 commenced with the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>that the intent was to resolve \u201call of the issues now pending\u201d in the rate proceedings in certain of the docket items other than RP79-22 (all of which antedated the enactment of the NGPA), as well as \u201ccertain limited issues\u201d in RP79-22. On the other' hand, the RP80-61 \u201cStipulation and Agreement Resolving Cost of Service and PGA Issues\u201d was not similarly restricted. It expressed the intent as \u201cresolution of all of the cost of service issues and the PGA issues ... in Docket No. RP80-61____\u201d Thus, at the outset, the earlier agreement spoke in terms of resolution of only \u201ccertain limited issues,\u201d while the later one, the interpretation of which has fallen to our lot, described its mission as resolution of <em>\u201call </em>of the cost of service issues.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Subsequently, however, in the section headed \u201cProcedural Background,\u201d RP80-61 states that \u201cthe participants have reached this unanimous Stipulation and Agreement which resolves cost of service and purchased gas adjustment clause issues, except for certain reserved issues <em>as specified in this agreement.\" </em><footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied). We must, perforce, address the question whether the reservations \u201cspecified\u201d or \u201ccontained\u201d in the RP80-61 settlement agreement include the right retroactively to seek NGPA maximum pricing after <em>Mid-Louisiana </em>had been finally decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">We find that the pricing technique employed in the RP80-61 settlement agreement is the \u201ccost of service\u201d approach favored by the FERC. Nowhere in the RP80-61 settlement agreement does reservation language specific to NGPA pricing appear. As the FERC in its \u201cOrder Modifying Prior Commission Order\u201d of February 4, 1983 has observed, the pipeline production pricing issue is not addressed at all in the body of the settlement agreement. In fact, it appears that \u201cthe rates in the settlement agreement were supported by various costs, including costs associated with the valuation of Consolidated\u2019s old production on a cost-of-service basis.\u201d <em>Consolidated Gas Supply Corp., </em>23 F.E.R.C. \u00b661,018 at 61,047 (Apr. 6, 1983). Since the proper pricing of \u201cold\u201d gas was a crucial issue in RP80-61, any reservation of rights should have been specifically enunciated in the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">In this regard, CGS freely admits in its Reply Brief that \u201c[djuring the term covered by the 1980 rate case settlement, however, Consolidated did value its pipeline production on a cost of service basis, but only because the Commission required it to do so.\u201d Also, in light of the developed positions taken at the time by the FERC on the one hand and by pipeline companies on the other, the FERC could hardly have operated on any other assumption. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>pricing under the settlement agreement must have proceeded on the \u201ccost of service\u201d basis, or else there would have been no occasion for the lawsuit to have been instituted. It follows rather inexorably that such a \u201ccost of service\u201d issue was pending before the FERC and was intended to be resolved by the very introductory language of the RP80-61 settlement agreement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Out of \u201call of the cost of service issues\u201d the settlement purported to cover, NGPA pricing unmistakably was one.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The text of the settlement in RP80-61 itself reveals that CGS well knew how to make explicit reservations regarding selected issues, but that the subject of NGPA prices was not one of the issues so selected. Article III of the agreement, captioned \u201cRate of Return,\u201d called for application of a rate of return on common equity to be determined in <em>Consolidated Gas Supply Corp. v. FERC, </em>4th Cir. No. 80-1219, then pending with respect to the rate of return decided by the FERC to be effective with respect to the tariffs at issue in RP79-22. <em>See Consolidated Gas Supply Corp. v. FERC, </em>653 F.2d 129 (4th Cir.1981). Article IV, titled \u201cHIOS Separation Charges,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> speaks of components of the HIOS transportation rates and explicitly stipulates that the \u201cissue be reserved and tied to the outcome of a similar issue in ... Docket No. RP78-94</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">In addition, Article VI of the RP80-61 agreement speaks of a cost allocation agreement as having been unanimously settled, and simultaneously filed, which, upon approval, would resolve GSS and SSO<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> cost allocation issues in RP80-61. Upon subsequent \u201capprov[al] in its entirety by the Commission,\u201d the matter was finally disposed of and settled, with no reservation \u201cspecified\u201d or \u201ccontained.\u201d The RP79-22 settlement agreement, on the other hand, demonstrated an appreciation of how to deal with an unresolved issue, for it had specifically \u201creserved for later settlement or decision\u201d the GSS and SSO rate schedules of CGS. By way of emphasis, the RP79-22 settlement agreement continues, \u201cNothing in this Stipulation and Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ment will dispose of any of the issues in Docket No. 79-22 related to the GSS and SSO rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u201cPGA Clause Modification\u201d was a topic afforded a separate article designation in both agreements. In RP79-22, after a provision for separate treatment of demand and commodity costs of pipeline supplier gas purchases, there is an explicit reservation to the effect that the proper accounting for the cost of gas withdrawn from storage in determining unrecovered purchase gas costs should \u201cbe reserved for later determination.\u201d In RP80-61, on the other hand, the \u201cunit of sales\u201d approach is adopted for ascertaining the recovery of purchased gas costs. Nothing is reserved for subsequent determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">By the same token, \u201cStorage Accounting,\u201d a subject addressed in Article VIII of the RP80-61 settlement agreement, explicitly reserved certain cost issues for subsequent disposition by settlement or additional hearings in Docket RP80-61. Specifically, subsequent settlement or hearings would dictate the proper value of gas in storage inventory to be used in determining the working capital allowance underlying the costs of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">An article entitled \u201cReservations,\u201d though differing in some apparently immaterial respects, was common both to the RP79-22 and the RP80-61 settlement agreements. Each emphasized that it confined itself to the specific issues in each case, and that the agreement did not, for any party, represent acceptance for other purposes (especially for other time periods) of any theory, principle or data underlying the settlement agreement. Both settlement agreements stated that \u201cneither [CGS] nor [the FERC], its Staff, or any other party to these proceedings shall be deemed to have waived any claim or right which it may otherwise have with respect to any matters not expressly provided for herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Thus, having compared the two agreements, it is impossible to conclude that they mean the same thing and have the same effect insofar as a) allowing retroactive gas pricing at the NGPA level and b) permitting surcharges to effect collection. CGS clearly exhibited its awareness of how to put a matter finally to rest and, equally, of how to reserve issues. It made explicit and effective reservations in the RP80-61 settlement agreement <em>{e.g., </em>insofar as \u201cRate of Return\u201d and \u201cHIOS Separation Charges\u201d are concerned). It did not, however, include any language in RP80-61 to reserve the issue of NGPA \u201call production\u201d pricing, even though it had done so in the earlier settlement. While in the RP8061 settlement agreement CGS made generalized reference to reservations \u201cspecified\u201d or \u201ccontained\u201d therein, one searches in vain for the reservation concerning NGPA pricing that CGS suggests is there \u201cby implication.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Indeed, the opposite conclusion must be drawn. As noted above, the agreement describes as its function the resolution of <em>\u201call </em>of the cost of service issues.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). In stark contrast, the RP79-22 settlement agreement first explicitly reserves the pricing issue, then makes clear that only \u201ccertain limited issues\u201d are settled. As outlined above, a detailed comparison of the subsequent provisions of the two documents further bolsters the conclusion that NGPA pricing was not an issue reserved by the settlement in RP80-61. The generalized reservation to the specific issues in the case and the non-disposition for other purposes of any \u201ctheory, principle or data\u201d simply do not stand up against the particularized statement that the parties contemplated resolution of \u201call of the cost of service issues.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> NGPA pricing versus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the cost of service approach was an issue, and a hotly contested one.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Settlement of disputes involves mutual agreement, binding on both parties. CGS seeks to have things both ways, abiding by RP80-61 when the provisions are satisfactory to it, but seeking to shed a provision of importance to the FERC although the agreement contained no reservation. It is precisely a reservation that would be required if CGS were successfully to follow such a course.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Although the contrast between the RP79-22 and the RP80-61 settlement agreements makes our conclusion all the more inescapable, it is worth noting that the language of the RP80-61 agreement standing alone was probably enough to support that result. It is a reasonable interpretation device to conclude that what someone has not said, someone has not meant. In the succinct words of Judge John R. Brown in <em>Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>306 F.2d 345, 348 (5th Cir.1962), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Manufacturer\u2019s Light &amp; Heat Co. v. Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., </em>375 U.S. 941, 84 S.Ct. 347, 11 L.Ed.2d 273 (1963), \u201c[0]ne sure way to discourage voluntary settlements is ... to read into contracts things which are simply not expressed or not there____ [The contract] should stand for what it says.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Moreover, and quite significantly, the FERC similarly interpreted the agreement, and interpretation by the federal agency concerned is entitled to deference.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We do not mean to infer that a court need accept an agency interpretation that black means white.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, if the choice lies between dark grey and light grey, the conclusion of the agency, unmistakably possessed as it is of special expertise, in favor of one or the other will have great weight. Furthermore, independently of agency expertise in the present case, and purely as a matter of contract interpretation common to many areas of legal endeavor,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we reach the same conclusion as has the FERC as to the meaning of the RP80-61 agreement. Hence we have no occasion to retreat behind agency deference, though, were we to do so, it would only reinforce the result reached on a more direct and lawyerlike basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">The FERC has read the RP79-22 settlement agreement as preserving to CGS the right to secure NGPA \u201call cost\u201d pricing for the period December 1, 1978 through June 30, 1980. As to that decision CGS has no complaint. As for the RP80-61 settlement agreement, when it is placed side by side with the RP79-22 document, the reservation in one and the lack of reservation in the other spring forth and compel the conclusion that the hope of NGPA pricing for the July 1, 1980 through December 31, 1981 period had been discarded by CGS, presumably in return for another benefit or other benefits. CGS would hardly have entered the RP80-61 settlement agreement unless it were perceived as benefitting CGS in one or more respects. Moreover, it hardly would have entered an agreement in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tending to reserve the NGPA pricing issue without saying so. Accordingly, having reviewed the FERC orders under attack, we are of the definite opinion that both should be</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">. This conclusion does not suggest that the party who gave up something by settling, when he might have done better by fighting to the bitter end, is necessarily a loser.

In Article V of the RP79-22 settlement, termed \"Pipeline Production,\u201d it was provided that all pre-1978 dockets were declared terminated, and CGS\u2019 request for relief as to them was withdrawn. However, for RP79-22, it was made clear that treatment of pipeline production:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>shall be an issue reserved for hearing and Commission decision which decision shall be made on the basis of the hearing record or any subsequent settlement agreement____ This agreement to reserve the pipeline production issue in Docket Nos.

It is not to be ignored that careful, explicit language of reservation is to be found throughout RP79-22, the earlier-prepared and submitted settlement agreement. The absence of similar language in the later RP80-61 settlement is more damaging to the position of CGS than if the two agreements had been chronologically reversed. Such is particularly the case when it is realized that, in two other subsequent settlement agreements, RP81-80 and RP82-115, CGS went to considerable pains to make explicit the reservation of its right to claim NGPA pricing for the periods there involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\">. It is enough to suggest massive failure of communication on the part of several different lawyers for CGS to learn that on January 30, 1981, seven days before the filing of the RP80-61 settlement agreement, a PGA rate change filing was made in Docket No. TA81-1-22-002, with a transmittal letter that included the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-17\">The filing in this [PGA] proceeding on the basis of the inclusion of old pipeline production on a cost-of-service basis is without prejudice to Consolidated\u2019s position that old pipeline production is entitled to NGPA treatment and the outcome of the court proceedings. Consolidated has omitted [an] alternate filing to avoid the burden of Commission rejection of a tariff sheet, to be followed by another application for rehearing and petition for court review. Consolidated reserves the right to make collections based on NGPA treatment for old pipeline production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-18\">It cannot be disputed, however, that the language we are construing in RP80-61 is that of a subsequently filed, integrated agreement, not that appearing in an earlier document filed in a different connection. If a lawyer\u2019s lapse has placed CGS in its present position, that does not justify our departure from established tenets of contract construction, tenets with which the lawyer must have been familiar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\">. CGS makes an argument based on acknowledgments by the FERC in two documents issued in 1979 that CGS could, should it ultimately prevail in <em>Mid-Louisiana, </em>collect through surcharges differentials in past pricing between \"cost of service\" and NGPA pipeline production techniques. The latter of those two acknowledgments occurred on June 29, 1979. Over a year and one-half later came the RP80-61 settlement agreement. It resolved \"all of the cost of service issues,\u201d and whether \u201cold\u201d gas should be priced on a \"cost of service\u201d basis certainly was a continuing, unresolved issue between the parties. By representing in 1979 that the issue was still generally open, and by agreeing in 1981 that, as to a fixed segment of the time frame involved, it was resolved, the FERC was filling a classic role in dispute resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">In like vein, CGS points to language in its December 28, 1979 rate filing in RP80-61, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">Consolidated is filing the proposed tariff sheets consistent with its position that all pipeline production qualifies for pricing at NGPA rates and the alternative tariff sheets consistent with Consolidated\u2019s understanding of Commission policy that only pipeline production previously priced the same as independent producer production qualifies for pricing at NGPA rates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Again, that language constitutes only a preliminary to the integrated contract that came into being with final Commission approval on April 3, 1981. The making of the point earlier, only to exclude it later from the agreement itself, cuts against the position of CGS rather than supports it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b378-13\">. Subsequently, under the heading \"Cost of Service\u201d (Article II), there is reference to rates set forth in the settlement agreement to be effective July 1, 1980 through March 31, 1981, \"subject to the reservations contained herein____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">. As an \"aid\" to interpretation of the mutually negotiated settlement agreement, CGS points to its treatment of PGA applications. One submitted on February 4, 1980 (effective by Commission approval on March 1, 1980) had contained no reservation of the right to claim any entitlement to NGPA pricing. However, the settlement already long since approved in RP79-22 did reserve the right to claim NGPA prices for the period March 1,1980 through June 30, 1980. CGS naturally has no quarrel with that result, and is satisfied to accept the operation of the explicit language of reservation in the RP79-22 settlement governing the period.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Two subsequent PGA applications on August 1, 1980 (effective September 1, 1980) and January 30, 1981 (effective March 1, 1981) related to a period after that covered by the settlement in RP79-22. CGS then did assert in its transmittal letters that the use of the \"cost of service\" approach was without prejudice to its right to claim NGPA pricing. The applications do not, however, dictate the agreement. Otherwise, there would simply be no negotiations, and the gas pipeline companies would have it all their own way. Unlike the <em>settlement </em>in RP79-22, the settlement ultimately approved in <em>RP80-61 </em>\u2014 i.e., the operative <em>agreement </em>\u2014 plainly did not include language of reservation on the cost of service issue. While CGS is no doubt dissatisfied at this point to accept the operation of the terms of settlement finally adopted in RP80-61, such must be the result. CGS may not claim that the earlier, unilateral statements made in letters of transmittal control the language ultimately adopted in the RP80-61 settlement document itself. Indeed, it seems questionable how CGS is helped by these examples, for the settlement approved on April 3, 1981 in RP80-61 did not contain a reservation that CGS twice previously (within the past eight months) had demonstrated that it knew how to articulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">In short, unilateral statements of position uttered before an integrated contract is entered do not become part of a contract when the party arguing for their inclusion was unable to secure the adoption of the statements in the language of the contract. <em>See G.J.
