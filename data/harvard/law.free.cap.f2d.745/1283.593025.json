Intern. Business Machines, </em>673 F.2d 1045 (9th Cir. 1982) (hereinafter <em>\u201cForro </em>I\u201d). Following our order remanding this case for a new trial, the district court granted summary judgment for defendant, and plaintiff For-ro appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-16\">I. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-17\">The events underlying this case were fully described in <em>Forro </em>I, and need not be recounted here at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-18\">Forro Precision, Inc. (Forro) brought this action against International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) as a result of IBM\u2019s role in a highly-publicized, 12-hour police search of Forro\u2019s business premises. The search by Santa Clara police officers in 1973 resulted from IBM\u2019s request for police assistance in the company\u2019s efforts to locate the source of confidential IBM engineering documents that might have found their way into the hands of IBM competitors. Forro\u2019s lawsuit alleged that IBM orchestrated the search of its premises in order to create a \u201cthunderclap\u201d of adverse publicity, and that it thereby tortiously interfered with Forro\u2019s contractual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-19\">A jury found for Forro on its claim of intentional interference with contract, and awarded $2,739,010 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-20\">On appeal, we reversed, holding that IBM\u2019s communications with authorities were absolutely privileged under California Civil Code \u00a7 47(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Forro </em>I, p. 1055. We remanded the case for a new trial, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABCU\">Accordingly, we find that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that IBM\u2019s communications with the authorities and its participation in the search were privileged under California law. The evidence relating to these activities was such a major part of the proof adduced by Forro in support of its claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>intentional interference that its admission at all and certainly its admission without proper instruction was prejudicial to IBM\u2019s cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-4\"><em>Forro </em>I, p. 1056. On remand, IBM moved for summary judgment. The district court concluded that apart from evidence of conduct held privileged by our opinion, \u201cthere is no case,\u201d and granted the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">Our standard of review on summary judgment focuses on the same issue which was before the district court: whether, viewing all factual issues in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Forro, there existed no genuine issue of material fact upon which IBM could have been found liable for intentional interference with Forro\u2019s contractual relations. Since our prior opinion held that IBM\u2019s communications with police officials and its instigation and cooperation in the search of For-ro\u2019s premises were absolutely privileged, the single issue here is whether IBM\u2019s non-privileged conduct could support a finding of liability. We agree with the district court that it could not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">A. <em>Fraudulent silence. </em>Forro argues that the privilege of California Civil Code \u00a7 47(2) extends only to affirmative disclosures and not to selective failures to disclose information. We disagree. Forro alleged, and for purposes of summary judgment we may accept, that IBM deliberately withheld from the Santa Clara police information which, if revealed, might have dissuaded them from searching Forro\u2019s premises. Forro argues, in particular, that the police would not have authorized the search had they known that, more than a year earlier during discovery for another lawsuit, IBM had already obtained from Forro the allegedly secret IBM documents in Forro\u2019s possession and had voluntarily returned them to Forro without restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">Forro\u2019s \u201cfraudulent silence\u201d doctrine, however, is incompatible with the \u00a7 47(2) privilege and with our prior opinion. In <em>Forro </em>I, we explicitly noted that IBM\u2019s alleged deception was accomplished by its failure to present certain information to police officials. 673 F.2d at 1055. Nevertheless, we made no exception from the privilege for such deception by inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">Nor could we logically make such an exception. We see no reason why the absolute privilege of \u00a7 47(2) should protect the speaker who baldly and maliciously lies to the authorities, yet exclude one who speaks a half-truth. Whatever the policy justifying \u00a7 47(2), it could not be advanced by such a fine distinction. Accepting Forro\u2019s argument would tend to undermine and destroy the \u00a7 47(2) privilege, contrary to California\u2019s manifest policy of resolving doubts in favor of extending that privilege. <em>Twyford v. Twyford, </em>63 Cal.App.3d 916, 134 Cal.Rptr. 145 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-12\">B. <em>Non-Privileged conduct. </em>Forro failed to show any proximate causal connection between its injury and any non-privileged conduct by IBM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-13\">Forro points to \u201cOperation Artichoke,\u201d an IBM industrial espionage project. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>\u201cOperation Artichoke,\u201d IBM paid agents to attempt surreptitiously to purchase plans for IBM\u2019s own \u201cWinchester\u201d disk drive, in hopes of finding the ultimate source of the documents in IBM. But \u201cOperation Artichoke\u201d discovered no connection between Forro and the theft of the \u201cWinchester\u201d plans; regardless whether the project was otherwise objectionable, it caused no harm to Forro. The only possible connection between \u201cOperation Artichoke\u201d and Forro\u2019s injury is through the police search, which we have already held to be privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">IBM\u2019s return of documents to Forro following depositions in an earlier action had no effect on Forro except through the police search. This conduct does not form an independent ground for liability. Similarly, there was no showing that IBM\u2019s alleged agreements with Honeywell, 3M and Control Data Corporation for their cooperation in the \u201cthunderclap\u201d of publicity were connected with Forro\u2019s injury except through the police search. Neither forms an independent ground for liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">Forro argues for the first time on appeal that, following the search, IBM inflamed publicity against Forro and that IBM officials visited a Forro customer, Nashua, to dissuade it from doing business with Forro. However, since this argument was never made to the district court, we need not consider it. <em>Inland Cities Express v. Diamond Nat. Corp., </em>524 F.2d 753, 755 (9th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">Moreover, even if it were properly before us, this argument would not support For-ro\u2019s case. The most egregious IBM-generated publicity cited by Forro was an article in which an IBM spokesman stated that IBM had \u201ccooperated with the police\u201d and that the company was \u201csaddened\u201d by the possibility that IBM personnel might be linked with theft of trade secrets. The statement was not directed specifically at Forro, and it is inconceivable that it caused Forro any injury. As for the alleged visit to Forro customer Nashua, it is undisputed that Nashua had decided to reduce its existing requirements contract with Forro <em>before </em>the post-search visit by IBM officials. There is no causal link between these events and injury to Forro.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">III. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">The district court correctly concluded that there was no triable issue of material fact. Our prior opinion held that IBM could not be held liable for its participation in the search of Forro\u2019s facilities, and there was no showing of any other, non-privileged basis of liability. The summary judgment for IBM is</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1374-13\">. California Civil Code \u00a7 47(2) states in relevant part: \"A privileged publication or broadcast is one made * * * 2. In any (1) legislative or (2) judicial proceeding, or (3) in any other official proceeding authorized by law * * California courts have held that the privilege applies to communications made to prompt law enforcement officials to initiate proceedings. <em>Brody v. Montalbano, </em>87 Cal.App.3d 725, 87 Cal.Rptr. 725 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 844, 100 S.Ct. 87, 62 L.Ed.2d 57 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1375-8\">. Forro's reliance on <em>Gruenberg v. Aetna Insurance Company, 9 </em>Cal.3d 566, 108 Cal.Rptr. 480, 510 P.2d 1032 (1973) is misplaced. In <em>Gruen-berg, </em>the cause of action against the insurance company \"transcended\u201d the privileged acts because those acts were separate and independent of the essential wrongful conduct alleged: unjustified failure to pay amounts owed under the contract of insurance. Here, by contrast, all Forro\u2019s injury arose directly from the police search, for which we have held IBM protected by the Civil Code \u00a7 47(2) privilege. [In <em>Gruen-berg, </em>an insurance company encouraged arson charges against its insured, then denied liability on its policy when the insured refused to give a statement concerning the fire while arson charges were still pending. Though statements made by company officials to fire department arson investigators were protected by the Civil Code \u00a7 47(2) privilege, the California Supreme Court reversed a judgment dismissing an action against the insurance company. The court stated that \"even if * * * privileges apply to the separate acts of the insurer's alleged agents, the defendant insurers may not benefit from them because their alleged scheme to avoid liability under the policies, in breach of an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, transcends the individual acts of their agents.\u201d 9 Cal.3d at 576, n. 5, 108 Cal.Rptr. 480, 510 P.2d 1032.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
