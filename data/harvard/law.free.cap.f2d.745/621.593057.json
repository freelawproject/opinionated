SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">In this patent infringement case, appellant/cross-appellee Shelcore, Inc. (Shel-core), appeals from a judgment of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, holding invalid claims 1-12 of Strauss, U.S. patent No. 4,208,831 (the \u2019831 utility patent) and finding the claim of Strauss, U.S. Des. patent No. 257,-780 (the \u2019780 design patent) to be not infringed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">Shelcore is the assignee of the \u2019831 utility and \u2019780 design patents in suit. Both related to a driving simulator toy. The child\u2019s legs fit in a \u201ctunnel\u201d under the toy to provide a more realistic driving environment and, thus, maintain the child\u2019s interest. Appellee/cross-appellant Durham Industries, Inc. (Durham), manufactures a competing driving simulator toy called \u201cBuckle Up \u2019N Drive.\u201d The \u201cdashboard\u201d surface is supported by legs in the Durham device, rather than by a \u201ctunnel\u201d structure, as in the patented Shelcore toy.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">On October 1, 1982, Shelcore sued Durham in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for infringement of claims 1-13 of the \u2019831 utility patent and of the \u2019780 design patent. Durham answered with affirmative defenses of invalidity, unenforceability, and non-infringement. Durham also counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of invalidity of both patents and for unfair competition. The case was tried before Judge Broderick, sitting without a jury. During trial, Shelcore\u2019s claim of infringement of claim 13 was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">Judge Broderick, in an opinion dated January 6, 1984, held claims 1-12 of the \u2019831 utility patent invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 (1982) and found that, if valid, those claims would be infringed by Durham\u2019s \u201cBuckle Up \u2019N Drive\u201d toy. The district court also held that the \u2019780 design patent, while not invalid, was not infringed by Durham\u2019s \u201cBuckle Up \u2019N Drive\u201d toy. Shelcore contends that the trial court erred in holding claims 1-12 of the \u2019831 utility patent invalid and that the trial court\u2019s failure to find infringement of the \u2019780 design patent is clearly erroneous. Durham, the prevailing party, argues in its cross-appeal that the trial court\u2019s finding, that, if valid, claims 1-12 of the \u2019831 utility patent would be infringed, is clearly erroneous and that the trial court erred in failing to hold the \u2019780 design patent invalid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-19\">Four questions are presented in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>(1) whether claims 1-13 of the \u2019831 utility patent are invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">(2) whether the \u2019780 design patent is invalid for double patenting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">(3) whether the \u2019780 design patent is infringed by Durham\u2019s \u201cBuckle Up \u2019N Drive\u201d device; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">(4) whether Shelcore committed unfair competition in securing an ex parte, permanent injunction against Durham at a time when the \u2019831 patent was allegedly unenforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">\n<em>Claims in Suit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Durham asserts that <em>all </em>of the claims of the \u2019831 utility patent are invalid under section 103. We disagree. The district court held only claims 1-12 invalid. By voluntarily dismissing with prejudice claim 13 of the \u2019831 utility patent, Shelcore removed the issue of infringement of claim 13 from the trial court\u2019s consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But Shelcore could not unilaterally remove the validity issue because Durham\u2019s counterclaim put validity of all the claims in issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Durham\u2019s counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity as to claim 13 is not supported by the record and therefore we conclude that the trial court did not err by holding invalid only claims 1-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">\n<em>Presumption of Validity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">The district court held that, since Shelcore \u201chas not argued the patentability of the dependent claims [2-12] separately from the independent claim [1], the dependent claims stand or fall with the independent claim. <em>In re Mlot-Fijalkowski, </em>676 F.2d 666, 667 n. 4 [213 USPQ 713, 714 n. 4] (C.C.P.A.1982).\u201d The district court erred as a matter of law in applying that otherwise valid rule in the context of determining validity of the claims of an issued patent. It was not Shelcore\u2019s burden to argue patentability. The claims were presumptively valid. It was Durham\u2019s burden, not only to argue, but to submit evidence establishing the invalidity <em>of </em>each claim it asserted to be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-20\">Rather, the above rule of procedure is applicable to claims pending before, or on appeal from, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), where those claims have not yet issued in a patent and where the applicant bears the burden of overcoming the rejection of each claim. Once claims 1-12 issued in the \u2019831 patent, however, the situation is covered by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282 (1982) which provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ale-dedup-0\">[e]ach claim of a patent (whether in independent, dependent, or multiple dependent form) shall be presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims; dependent or multiple dependent claims shall be presumed valid even though dependent upon an invalid claim. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfI\">The rule applied by the trial court flies in the face of the presumption of validity. While the rule \u2014 that where the patentability of dependent claims is not argued separately from the independent claims from which they depend, the former stand or fall with the latter \u2014 has vitality prior to the issuance of a patent embodying those claims,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that rule has no application in a district court proceeding to determine whether the claims of an issued patent are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-21\">While the above rule is not applicable as a rule of procedure in a district court, it has been applied on appeal from a district court judgment with respect to the claims of an issued patent as a matter of convenience.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The presumption of validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>does not guide our analysis on appeal. Rather, we review the findings and conclusions of a district court under the appropriate standards of review. That circumstance bears no relation, however, to the requirement at trial that a party challenging the validity of a claim, absent a pretrial agreement or stipulation, must submit evidence supporting a conclusion of invalidity of <em>each </em>claim the challenger seeks to destroy.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>Validity of \u2019831 Utility Patent Under Section 103</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The trial court relied primarily on three prior art references in holding invalid claims 1-12 of the \u2019831 utility patent: Kam-lay, U.S. patent No. 4,143,915; Wells, U.S. patent No. 2,429,498; and Stubbmann, U.S. patent No. 3,659,375. Shelcore contends that the Kamlay and Wells patents are nonanalogous art and, therefore, the trial court erred in combining those references with the Stubbmann patent in determining whether the subject matter of the \u2019831 utility patent would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. Shelcore also argues that the trial court improperly relied on the testimony of Durham\u2019s allegedly unqualified expert witness, Mr. Margo-lies. Further, Shelcore argues that the trial court erred in applying the <em>Graham, v. John Deere </em>Co.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> criteria and that, since the trial court analyzed only claim 1 and failed to consider separately claims 2-12, it erred in holding claims 2-12 invalid. We conclude that these contentions do not require reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\n<em>Nonanalogous Art.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The Kamlay patent discloses a \u201cTable for a Child Safety Seat,\u201d having a flat padded play surface and legs to support the table over the child\u2019s legs. The invention is used primarily in cooperation with a child\u2019s automobile safety seat. Wells discloses a similar appliance for use in an adult chair to provide a flat play surface. Even were we to adopt Shelcore\u2019s argument, that these references are not within the field of the inventor\u2019s endeavor, which we do not, the problem presented and overcome by the invention is basically the same: to permit the child to position his or her body in the same general orientation relative to the play surface or toy with his or her legs extending under the toy. Thus, the solutions disclosed in Kamlay and Wells are \u201creasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor was involved.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">\n<em>Expert Testimony.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">With respect to the testimony of Mr. Margolies, Shelcore has not established that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the testimony into evidence. While Mr. Margolies was not a toy designer, the trial judge was satisfied that he was qualified as an expert in plastics manufacturing and that his testimony was relevant and material. We are aware of no evidence of record to the contrary. Further, we cannot agree with Shelcore that the trial court placed undue reliance on Mr. Margo-lies\u2019 testimony. Rather, the court below in its opinion appears to base its conclusion of invalidity squarely on the three prior art references mentioned above. No mention is made by the trial court of Mr. Margolies\u2019 testimony in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">\n<em>Obviousness.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">Shelcore alleges that the district court committed error with respect to each of the <em>Graham </em>factual criteria: scope and content of the prior art, differences between the prior art and the claimed subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>matter, and level of ordinary skill in the art. We review the factual findings of a district court to determine whether they are clearly erroneous, not merely whether the district court erred.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"apk-dedup-0\">Claim 1 is set forth below:</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">A driving simulator toy comprising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">(a) a driving console having</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">(i) a base for supporting the console on a generally horizontal support surface,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">(ii) a top dashboard-like panel juxtaposed above the base and having a front, a rear, and a pair of side edge portions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">(iii) a pair of side panels each extending upwardly from and connecting the base to the respective side edge portions of the top panel,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">(iv) a front end panel extending upwardly from and connecting the base to the front edge portion of the top panel,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">(v) a rear end panel extending upwardly from and connecting the base to the rear edge portion of the top panel, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">(vi) all of said side and end panels maintaining said top panel at an elevated position above the support surface;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">(b) a plurality of amusement-type driving control devices mounted on the console within easy reach of a child seated at the same on the support surface, one of the driving control devices constituting a toy steering wheel mounted on the top dashboard-like panel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-13\">(c) bucket seat environment simulator means on the console for permitting a child to operate all of the driving control devices while being seated at the console with legs outstretched so as to simulate the driving environment of an automobile, particularly a sports car, said bucket seat environment simulator means including</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\">(i) means at the rear of the console for defining a rear cutout which extends forwardly along a central portion of the top panel for a distance sufficient to accomodate [sic] the lower torso of the seated child, at least one of said control devices being mounted on said top panel laterally of said rear cutout and rearwardly of said top panel central portion, said rear cutout also extending upwardly along a central portion of the rear panel for a distance sufficient to accomodate [sic] the upper thigh region of the seated child,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-16\">(ii) means at the front of the console for defining a front cutout which extends upwardly along a central portion of the front panel for a distance sufficient to accomodate [sic] the legs of the seated child, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-17\">(iii) said front and rear cutouts being aligned with one another and together forming a tunnel-like structure which accomodates [sic] the outstretched legs of the seated child to thereby simulate the bucket seat environment of a sports car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-18\">We have already resolved against Shelcore the issue whether Kamlay and Wells were properly considered to be pertinent prior art. Further, the \u201cbucket seat environment simulator\u201d limitation of claim 1 presents only minor differences between the subject matter of the claimed invention and the prior art. That limitation, (c) of the above claim, defines a \u201ctunnel\u201d under the toy. We are in agreement with the district court\u2019s finding that, while the \u201cwrap around\u201d and \u201csit under\u201d features of the claimed invention are not present in the prior art driving simulators, they are present in the Kamlay and Wells references. The claimed \u201ctunnel\u201d is similar in structure and substantially similar in function to the legs of both Kamlay and Wells. Finally, Shelcore has failed to establish that the trial court\u2019s finding of the level of ordinary skill in the art \u2014 a person with a college or art school background and several years\u2019 experience designing toys \u2014 is clearly erroneous. The trial court properly determined obviousness against the level of ordinary skill in the art. We cannot agree with Shelcore that the evidence was insufficient in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The trial court also considered \u201csecondary\u201d considerations. It found, however, that Shelcore had failed to establish either the requisite nexus between the commercial success of the patented device and the merits of the claimed invention or that the commercially successful device fulfilled a long-felt need. The trial court also found that Shelcore had not established that the alleged deficiencies of the prior art simulators, in particular Stubbmann, gave rise to long-felt but unresolved needs. Rather, the evidence establishes that, as found by the trial court, Shelcore\u2019s sales were proportional to its advertising efforts. Shel-core has not established that the findings with respect to secondary considerations are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Shelcore argues the holding of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey in <em>Shelcore, Inc. v. CBS, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in the absence of persuasive new evidence, required the court below to hold the \u2019831 patent \u201cvalid\u201d under the doctrine of stare decisis. We cannot agree. The presumption of validity is a clear statutory procedural device. It is not augmented by an earlier adjudication of patent \u201cvalidity.\u201d A patent is not held valid for all purposes but, rather, not invalid on the record before the court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">We reject this line of reasoning urged by Shelcore. Even were the record in this case substantially identical to the record in the <em>CBS </em>case, the doctrine of stare decisis would be inappropriate in this case. The <em>CBS </em>jury verdict of validity had not yet matured into a final judgment of validity; nor did it ever so mature. We conclude that the district court did not err in declining to consider the <em>CBS </em>jury verdict binding on it, even though that verdict was based on the same art held below to invalidate the \u2019831 utility patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">We also reject Shelcore\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s error, in failing to set out in its memorandum of opinion its analysis of claims 2-12, requires reversal. We are aware of no evidence of record supporting Shelcore\u2019s assumption that the district court was unaware that claims 2-12 recite only features common to driving simulator toys<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or details of construction. The differences between the subject matter of claims 2-12 and the prior art, asserted by Shelcore, do not adequately distinguish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>claimed invention from the prior art relied on by the trial court in holding claim 1 invalid. Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that the invention claimed in claims 1-12 of the \u2019831 utility patent \u201cwould have been obvious to a toy designer of ordinary skill at the time it was made, in light of the teachings of the relevant prior art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">\n<em>Infringement of Claims 1-12 of the \u2019831 Utility Patent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In view of our disposition of the validity issue, we need not, and do not, reach the issue raised by Durham\u2019s cross-appeal whether the trial court\u2019s finding of infringement of the asserted claims of the \u2019831 utility patent is clearly erroneous. The district court properly resolved both the issues of validity and infringement. However, the issue of infringement is now moot.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Durham can incur no liability for \u201cinfringement\u201d of invalid claims.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\n<em>Validity of \u2019780 Design Patent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Durham also cross-appeals from the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the \u2019780 design patent is not invalid for double patenting. As we noted in <em>Carman Industries, Inc. v. Wahl,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and as the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals noted in <em>In re </em>Thorington,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> there are two types of double patenting: same invention-type and obviousness-type.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The \u2019780 design patent issued after the '831 utility patent. Shelcore filed with the PTO a terminal disclaimer with respect to the \u2019780 design patent. Durham concedes that the terminal disclaimer eliminates any obviousness-type double patenting problem. Rather, Durham contends that the trial court erred in failing to conclude that the \u2019780 design patent is invalid for same invention-type double patenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">We hold that the trial court did not err in applying the \u201ccross-reading\u201d test of same invention-type double patenting. While a device made according to the \u2019780 design patent may well infringe the \u2019831 utility patent, the trial court recognized that \u201cno specific design is implied or necessitated by [the '831 utility patent] claims.\u201d A device could readily be constructed that would infringe the claims of the \u2019831 utility patent but not the claim of the '780 design patent. The trial court\u2019s finding, that a device made in accordance with the \u2019831 utility patent would not necessarily infringe the \u2019780 design patent, is not clearly erroneous. The claims do not cross-read. Thus, on the basis of the record before us, the \u2019780 design patent is not invalid for double patenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">\n<em>Infringement of \u2019780 Design Patent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-16\">Shelcore argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to find the \u2019780 design patent infringed by Durham is clearly erroneous. We disagree. The district court applied the standard for infringement of a design patent set out in <em>Gorham Manufacturing Co. v. White:</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-17\">if, in the eye of an ordinary observer, giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives, two designs are substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the same, if the resemblance is such as to deceive such an observer, inducing him to purchase one supposing it to be the other, the first one patented is infringed by the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">'We conclude that the district court did not commit clear error either in finding differences between the two designs or in failing to find that the two designs are substantially similar in overall appearance. The differences found by the trial court are fully supported by the record. Thus, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding, that the \u2019780 design patent is not infringed by Durham\u2019s \u201cBuckle Up \u2019N Drive\u201d device, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\n<em>Unfair Competition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Finally, Durham alleges that the trial court erred in failing to conclude that Shelcore was guilty of unfair competition in obtaining an allegedly improper injunction against Durham. The district court entered no findings on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">On February 28, 1983, approximately 4 months after the commencement of this suit, Shelcore filed a request for default and a default judgment was entered on that date for failure of Durham to appear, plead, or otherwise defend. Simultaneously, the <em>CBS </em>case was being tried before a jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In early March 1983, the <em>CBS </em>jury returned a partial verdict on special interrogatories, that, while the \u2019831 utility patent was valid, Shelcore had failed to name one of its employees, Joseph Marino, as an inventor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In January 1983, Shelcore had filed a motion under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256 (1982) to correct the inven-torship of the \u2019831 patent when Marino\u2019s role in the development of the invention claimed in the \u2019831 patent became apparent. On March 14, 1983, however, prior to the actual correction of inventorship by the PTO, Shelcore filed a motion for partial summary judgment on default in this case. An injunction was granted by Judge Bro-derick and remained in effect against Durham from March 18, 1983, to April 15, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">In spite of the uncertain nature of Shel-core\u2019s rights on March 14, 1983, we decline to grant Durham the relief it requests. It is not necessary for us, in this case, to determine whether Shelcore\u2019s right to an injunction on that date was impaired by the problems of inventorship associated with the \u2019831 utility patent. We do not determine whether those problems were merely technical or rendered the \u2019831 patent unenforceable. Even were it unenforceable, Durham failed to defend this action initially and, accordingly, a default judgment was entered against it. While we in no way condone either Shelcore\u2019s deplorable lack of candor toward the district court or its chutzpah in seeking an injunction given the problems associated with the \u2019831 patent on that date, an injunction was properly entered on the basis of the default judgment. When its interest in this litigation was finally aroused, Durham had no difficulty in dissolving that injunction. We cannot conclude that the trial court erred in failing to impose upon Shelcore liability to Durham for Shelcore\u2019s conduct in securing an allegedly improper injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">\n<em>Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">Lastly, Durham requests, under Fed.R.App.P. 38, costs and attorney fees arising from this appeal, citing <em>Asberry v. United States Postal Service.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Durham, however, misreads our opinion in <em>As-berry, </em>in which we held that, after November 12, 1982, \u201ca frivolous appeal filed or proceeded with in this court, will result in imposition of <em>damages </em>and costs upon appellant and counsel in accordance with Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>38.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied; footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">While the court recognized in <em>Asberry </em>that rule 38 has been held to justify the award of damages and <em>attorney fees </em>in favor of the United States,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it did not hold that \u201cdamages and costs\u201d typically include attorney fees nor did it hold that damages must necessarily equal attorney fees, even in a suit involving the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Attorney fees on appeal are recoverable, however, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 (1982) in an exceptional case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, we consider Durham\u2019s request for attorney fees as a request under section 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Based on our review of the record, we find that Shelcore\u2019s appeal was not frivolous, nor is this appeal exceptional under section 285. Shelcore\u2019s arguments on appeal appear to be reasonable and to have been presented in good faith. Durham fails to detail any circumstances of record such as would justify the award of either damages and costs under <em>Asberry </em>or attorney fees under section 285. While Shel-core\u2019s conduct in securing the injunction may well have made this an exceptional case below, Durham did not pursue that argument either below or on appeal. Accordingly, Durham\u2019s request for costs and attorney fees on appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">In summary, the district court did not err in holding claims 1-12 of the \u2019831 patent invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. Nor did it err in holding that the \u2019780 design patent is not invalid for double patenting. Further, the trial court\u2019s finding that the \u2019780 design patent is not infringed by Durham\u2019s \u201cBuckle Up \u2019N Drive\u201d toy is not clearly erroneous.

In <em>Stevenson v.

As stated earlier, patents cannot be held 'valid' under all circumstances. Rather, a court merely decides in a particular case that the one attacking validity has not overcome the statutory presumption of validity. Thus, even if our function here were to determine the 'validity' or invalidity of Stevenson\u2019s patent (which we do not believe it is), we would not necessarily be bound by the CCPA\u2019s prior decision in <em>Stevenson v. International Trade Commission </em>[612 F.2d 546, 67 CCPA 109, 204 USPQ 276 (1979) ]. To be sure, a prior holding of 'validity1 should be given weight in a subsequent suit on the issue of 'validity.' But the prior holding does not necessarily have stare decisis effect.5 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">\"5- The weight given a prior holding of 'validity\u2019 will vary depending on the additional prior art or other evidence on patentability that is produced in the subsequent suit. <em>See 4 </em>D.
