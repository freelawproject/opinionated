United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886), held that the fifth amendment prevented the government from subpoenaing incriminating personal documents, notwithstanding the fact that appellee was given immunity for the implicit \u201ctestimony\u201d involved in the act of producing the documents. On this appeal, the government argues that the judgment of the district court should be reversed because, it contends, the fifth amendment does not protect an individual against the compelled disclosure of the <em>contents </em>of incriminatory documents or papers, no matter how personal or private they may be. Because we believe that the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Boyd </em>is contrary to the position urged by the government, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b925-21\">In March 1984, on application of the assistant United States Attorney, the federal grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia issued a subpoena duces tecum to appellee, who is a target of the grand jury\u2019s investigation into certain alleged narcotics, tax and currency violations. The subpoena required appellee to produce specified \u201cpersonal records\u201d for the period extending from January 1,1975 to the date of the subpoena\u2019s issuance. Included within the scope of the subpoena were \u201crecords of purchases, trades, sales, receipts, gifts and distributions of controlled substances.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>On April 10,1984, appellee filed a motion to quash that portion of the subpoena requiring him to produce documents held by him in an individual capacity. He argued, first, that the subpoena was overbroad, and irrelevant to the grand jury\u2019s investigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>and, second, that the compelled production of personal records violated his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Following a hearing on April 13, 1984, the district court granted the motion to quash \u201cto the extent that the subpoena calls for the production of personal records of appellee.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court directed counsel for appellee to submit for the court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>inspection a list of the documents that were asserted to be \u201cpersonal.\u201d At the same time, at the government\u2019s request, the court granted appellee immunity for the act of producing the documents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">After reviewing the submitted description, the district court concluded that the documents were \u201cclearly personal,\u201d and therefore were protected by the fifth amendment. The court ordered the <em>in camera </em>submission sealed until further order of the court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the United States noticed an appeal from this order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The government contends that the district court should be reversed because the fifth amendment does not protect appellee from the subpoena of his personal documents. Specifically, the United States argues that no fifth amendment privilege attaches to the <em>contents </em>of pre-existing documents of any kind. Although the government admits that subpoenaed documents constitute \u201ctestimonial evidence,\u201d it contends that the fifth amendment does not come into play because the individual\u2019s voluntary choice, not governmental compulsion, results in the incriminating documentary \u201ctestimony.\u201d Since the incriminating testimony is not <em>itself </em>compelled, so the argument goes, there is no constitutional right that prevents its disclosure to the government, even though the disclosure is unquestionably the result of government compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">In line with this view, the government contends that the fifth amendment places no limits on governmental intrusion into an individual\u2019s private affairs, other than a narrow proscription against the extortion of testimony. <em>Cf. </em>8 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2263 (McNaughton rev. 1961) (privilege \u201cdirected at the employment of legal process to extract from the person\u2019s own lips an admission of guilt\u201d). An individual\u2019s \u201cright to privacy\u201d is thus left protected in a constitutional sense only by the conditional limits set by the fourth amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Because we believe that the government\u2019s argument is inconsistent with the longstanding holding of the Supreme Court, first enunciated in <em>Boyd, </em>we affirm the order of the district court quashing the subpoena on fifth amendment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\"><em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886), involved a forfeiture action brought by the United States against thirty-five cases of plate glass, allegedly imported without the payment of import duties. In the course of the action, the district court entered an order<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> requiring the claimants of the glass to produce an invoice from the exporter. The Supreme Court held that the district court\u2019s order, and the statute pursuant to which it was entered, violated both the fourth and fifth amendments. Noting that the district court\u2019s order went even further than \u201cthe Act under which the obnoxious writs of assistance were issued,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 623, 6 S.Ct. at 528, the Court first held that \u201ca compulsory production of a man\u2019s private papers to establish a criminal charge against him\u201d <em>id. </em>at 622, 6 S.Ct. at 528, violates the fourth amendment\u2019s proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Observing that both the fourth and fifth amendments protect an individual\u2019s right to privacy, the Court declared that the prohibition against the forced production of private papers involves \u201cthe very essence of constitutional liberty and security.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-5\">It is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property, where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offense; it is the invasion of this sacred right which underlies and constitutes the essence of <em>Lord </em>Camden\u2019s judgment. Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man\u2019s own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime ... is within the condemnation of that judgment. In this regard the Fourth and Fifth Amendments run almost into each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 630, 6 S.Ct. at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">A contrary reading of the Constitution, <em>Boyd </em>noted, might \u201csuit the purposes of despotic power,\u201d but it conflicted with \u201cthe pure atmosphere of political liberty and personal freedom\u201d enjoyed in this country. <em>Id. </em>at 632, 6 S.Ct. at 533. The Court was \u201cunable to perceive that the seizure of a man\u2019s private books and papers to be used in evidence against him is substantially different from compelling him to be a witness against himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 6 S.Ct. at 534. As a consequence, <em>Boyd </em>explicitly held that \u201ca compulsory production of the private books and papers of the owner of the goods sought to be forfeited in such a suit is compelling him to be a witness against himself, within the meaning of the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Amendment to the Constitution.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 634-35, 6 S.Ct. at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">Later Supreme Court decisions have reaffirmed Boyd\u2019s essential holding. <em>See, e.g., Bellis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 85, 87, 94 S.Ct. 2179, 2182, 40 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) (\u201cthe Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination protects an individual from compelled production of his personal papers and effects as well as compelled oral testimony\u201d); <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 346, 94 S.Ct. 613, 619, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974) (\u201cgrand jury may not compel a person to produce books and papers that would incriminate him\u201d); <em>United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 11, 93 S.Ct. 764, 770, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973) (grand jury \u201ccannot require the production by a person of private books and records that would incriminate him\u201d);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 763-64, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1831-32, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966) (fifth amendment reaches \u201ccompulsion of responses which are also communications, for example, compliance with a subpoena to produce one\u2019s papers\u201d); <em>United States v. White, </em>322 U.S. 694, 699, 64 S.Ct. 1248, 1251, 88 L.Ed. 1542 (1944) (privilege \u201cprotects the individual from any disclosure, in the form of ... documents, sought by legal process against him as a witness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">No later decision of the Supreme Court has held to the contrary on the point directly in issue. The government here relies on dicta in several recent decisions of the Court to support its view. The dicta are assuredly there, but none of these decisions has overruled <em>Boyd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976), which the government contends resulted in the \u201cpeaceful interment\u201d of <em>Boyd, </em>involved a subpoena issued to a third party for the production of business records which were not written by the proponent of the privilege. The <em>Fisher </em>Court took pains to distinguish <em>Boyd, </em>and explicitly reserved judgment on the question presented here\u2014 whether the compelled production of the proponent\u2019s own papers would violate the Constitution. <em>See </em>425 U.S. at 414, 96 S.Ct. at 1582. Other cases relied upon by the government merely reiterate the well-established premise that an individual holding the documents of an artificial entity, whether a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship, cannot assert a fifth amendment privilege. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1237, 79 L.Ed.2d 552 (1984) (sole proprietorship); <em>United States v. Fishman, </em>726 F.2d 125 (4th Cir. 1983) (sole proprietorship). <em>See also Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976) (search for business records of law office does not violate fifth amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">Among other things, the fifth amendment evinces \u201cour respect for the inviolability of the human personality and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>of the right of each individual \u2018to a private enclave where he may lead a private life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, </em>378 U.S. 52, 55, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 1597, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964) (quoting <em>United States v. Grunewald, </em>233 F.2d 556, 581-82 (Frank, J., dissenting), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>353 U.S. 391, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931 (1957)). <em>See also Bellis, </em>417 U.S. at 91-92, 94 S.Ct. at 2184-2185; <em>Couch v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 322 at 327, 93 S.Ct. 611 at 615, 34 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). The fundamental teaching of <em>Boyd </em>is consistent with this purpose:. the forced disclosure of private incriminating information jeopardizes the individual\u2019s right to keep at least that aspect of himself which is reflected in his private papers free from the intrusive hands of the government.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Implicit in the cherished right of the individual to \u201cpursue happiness\u201d is the concomitant right to express one\u2019s own thoughts free from the government\u2019s exaction of those thoughts upon penalty of one\u2019s liberty. We therefore hold, in line with <em>Boyd, </em>that the fifth amendment prevents the government from subpoenaing an individual\u2019s incriminating papers that are in his possession and are held by him in an individual, as opposed to representative capacity. <em>Accord United States v. Davis, </em>636 F.2d 1028, 1043 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>454 U.S. 862, 102 S.Ct. 320, 70 L.Ed.2d 162 (1981); <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>632 F.2d 1033, 1044 (3d Cir.1980). <em>See also United States v. Helina, </em>549 F.2d 713 (9th Cir.1977). <em>But see In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>626 F.2d 1051 (1st Cir.1980) (no protection for personal business records); <em>United States v. Schlansky, </em>709 F.2d 1079, 1083 (6th Cir.1983) (no fifth amendment protection against disclosure of contents of documents \u201cless private\u201d than personal diary), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1591, 80 L.Ed.2d 123 (1984). Since the documents at issue in this case were held by appellee in his individual capacity, the district court\u2019s order quashing the subpoena in part is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-14\">. Our jurisdiction is based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b925-22\">. Item J of the grand jury subpoena required appellee to produce records of sole proprietor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>ships. Appellee did not assert a fifth amendment privilege as to these documents and fully complied with Item J. <em>Cf. United States v. Doe, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1237, 79 L.Ed.2d 552 (1984) (records of sole proprietorship not protected by fifth amendment).

The district court rejected appellee\u2019s contentions concerning the relevance and overbreadth of the subpoena. That finding is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b927-10\">. The application of the United States was submitted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6002 &amp; 6003. The immunity order stated that \u201cthe fact of [appellee\u2019s] compliance with the aforedescribed subpoena may not be used against [appellee] in any criminal case, except in a prosecution for perjury, false statements or failing to comply with this Court\u2019s ORDER OF IMMUNITY.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b927-11\">. The district court noted that \"many of the documents consist of checks, vouchers or documents, the original or copies of which are in the hands of third parties.\u201d The court thought it \u201cironic\u201d that the government could subpoena these documents from the relevant third parties, but held that no waiver of appellee\u2019s fifth amendment right occurred when the documents were released to those individuals. We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b927-12\">. Appellee contends that the United States should have appealed from the earlier April 13 order and that its failure to do so resulted in the untimely filing of the notice of appeal. The April 13 order, however, did not determine which documents were \"personal\u201d but merely directed appellee to submit to the court a list of documents that were asserted to be personal. Not until the April 19 order did the government know whether <em>any </em>documents were to be considered privileged. We therefore hold that the April 19 order was the proper final order from which to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b927-17\">. The fourth amendment places few constraints on the government\u2019s subpoena power. Notably, there is no requirement that the government have \"probable cause\u201d before subpoenaing documents or any other items. <em>See Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, </em>327 U.S. 186, 209, 66 S.Ct. 494, 506, 90 L.Ed. 614 (1946). As to subpoenas, the fourth amendment guards primarily against too much indefiniteness or breadth in the subpoena and imposes a requirement that the subpoenaed items be relevant. <em>See id.; United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973). The Supreme Court has also rejected the contention that a subpoena to obtain records should be subject to more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>stringent fourth amendment requirements than other items: \"A subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>issued to obtain records is subject to no more stringent fourth amendment requirements than is the ordinary subpoena.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>425 U.S. 435, 446 n. 8, 96 S.Ct. 1619, 1625 n. 8, 48 L.Ed.2d 71 (1976) (business records of bank).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The substantive limits placed on government by the due process clause also unconditionally protect, in a few instances, the privacy of the individual. <em>See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b928-7\">. The statute pursuant to which the order was entered provided that the failure of the individual to produce the records designated by the government\u2019s motion resulted in the allegations stated in the motion being taken as true. <em>See Boyd, </em>116 U.S. at 619-20, 6 S.Ct. at 526.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b928-12\">. In an effort to distinguish the unreasonable search at issue in <em>Boyd </em>from searches for contraband, which the common law regarded as \u201creasonable,\u201d the Court noted that in the latter situation the government possessed a superior property right in the items searched for. In <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967), the Supreme Court rejected the notion that the reasonableness of a search depended upon whether the items sought were \"mere evidence\u201d of a crime, or constituted \"fruits and instrumentalities\u201d of the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b929-14\">. The \"owner\" of the document subpoenaed in <em>Boyd </em>was a partnership, E.A. Boyd &amp; Sons. In <em>Beilis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 85, 94 S.Ct. 2179, 40 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974), the Supreme Court held that the fifth amendment does not protect the financial records of a partnership. In <em>Beilis, </em>however, the Court distinguished <em>Boyd, </em>noting that \"we do not believe that the Court in <em>Boyd </em>can be said to have decided the issue presented today.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 95 n. 2, 94 S.Ct. at 2186 n. 2. As <em>Beilis </em>noted, <em>Boyd </em>was decided on \"the premise that it involved the 'compulsory production of a man\u2019s private papers.\u201d\u2019 <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Boyd, </em>116 U.S. at 622, 6 S.Ct. at 528).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b929-15\">. The minimal fourth amendment constraints placed on the government\u2019s subpoena power, <em>see supra </em>note 7, have always been assessed in conjunction with the fifth amendment\u2019s traditional protection of the individual\u2019s private papers. In <em>Dionisio, </em>for instance, the Supreme Court rejected a fourth amendment challenge to a grand jury subpoena, but noted that the fifth amendment prevented the government from requiring a person to produce incriminating private books and records. <em>See </em>410 U.S. at 11, 93 S.Ct. at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-17\">Under the view advocated by the government in this case, a grand jury could subpoena an individual\u2019s personal diary on the bare ground that it was in some way \u201crelevant\u201d to a broad-based investigation being conducted by the grand jury. If this were allowed, a grand jury subpoena would indeed have become a \"talisman that dissolves all constitutional protections.\u201d <em>Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. at 11, 93 S.Ct. at 770.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b930-4\">. The government has also argued, in the alternative, that the documents subpoenaed here are not sufficiently \"private\" to merit the protection of the fifth amendment. Private financial and commercial records, it contends, should not be privileged, even if intimate personal papers are found to be.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-5\">We decline, however, to engage in a case-by-case content-based determination of the privacy interest attendant to a given document. The proper line, we feel, has been drawn\u2014whether the documents are held in an individual or representative capacity. Documents held in a representative capacity clearly reflect no privacy expectation on the part of the representative. <em>See Beilis, </em>417 U.S. at 91-92, 94 S.Ct. at 2184-2185 (unlike personal records, \u201ca substantial claim of privacy or confidentiality cannot often be maintained with respect to the financial records of an organized collective entity\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Davis, </em>636 F.2d 1028 at 1043 (5th Cir.1981) (refusing to alter fifth amendment protection depending on whether documents are \u201cbusiness-related or more inherently personal in content\u201d). <em>Cf. Boyd </em>(fifth amendment protects against production of invoice).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
