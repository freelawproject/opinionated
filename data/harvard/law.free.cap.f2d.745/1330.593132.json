Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>723 F.2d 818 (11th Cir.1984). That holding was required by our prior opinion in <em>Wrenn v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>575 F.2d 544 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-22\">Subsequent to our decision in <em>Judkins, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court announced its decision in <em>Baldwin County Welcome Center v. Brown, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1723, 80 L.Ed.2d 196 (1984). In <em>Baldwin County, </em>the Court held that the filing of an EEOC right-to-sue letter<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>not satisfy the 90-day statutory limitation period, \u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1724-25, 80 L.Ed.2d at 201, thus flatly rejecting the legal basis for our decision in <em>Judkins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-6\">Beech argues, and we agree, that this court has the power to recall its mandate if, as here, there has been a supervening change in the law. <em>Page v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., </em>349 F.2d 820 (5th Cir.1965); <em>see also In re Union Nacional de Trabajadores, </em>527 F.2d 602 (1st Cir. 1975); <em>cf. </em>11th Cir.R. 27(b) (\u201cA mandate once issued shall not be recalled <em>except to prevent injustice </em>\u201d) (emphasis added). We recognize that <em>Baldwin County </em>effectively reverses our decision as to the effect of the filing of the right-to-sue letter, and we hereby modify that aspect of our decision in <em>Judkins, supra. </em>However, <em>Baldwin County </em>is ultimately based upon the requirement that a Title VII plaintiff, like any other federal plaintiff, file a proper complaint within the meaning of Fed.R. Civ.P. 8(a)(2). \u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1724, 80 L.Ed.2d at 201. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) states that a complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d A right-to-sue letter, the district court in <em>Baldwin </em>had held, does not qualify as a complaint under Rule 8 because \u201cthere [is] no statement in the letter of the factual basis for the claim of discrimination____\u201d <em>Baldwin County, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1724, 80 L.Ed.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-12\">On the other hand, in conjunction with the filing of his right-to-sue letter in this case, Judkins also filed the EEOC \u201cCharge of Discrimination.\u201d In the \u201ccharge,\u201d Judkins lays out the \u201cfactual basis for the claim of discrimination,\u201d \u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1724, 80 L.Ed.2d at 200, in considerable detail. <em>Compare </em>Form 9, Fed.R.Civ.P. The \u201ccharge\u201d more than adequately complies with the \u201cshort and plain statement\u201d requirement of Rule 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-15\">Therefore, we conclude that Judkins\u2019 initial filings in this case met the requirements of <em>Baldwin County </em>and, thus, satisfied the 90-day statute of limitations. Beech\u2019s extraordinary motion to recall the mandate issued in <em>Judkins v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>723 F.2d 818 (11th Cir.1984), is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-17\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1421-12\">. In <em>Bonner v.
