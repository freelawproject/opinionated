Based presumably on <em>Nebel Towing </em>the District Court granted judgment against the excess P &amp; I Underwriter for nearly $2,000,000 in excess of the owner\u2019s judicially declared limited liability. Faithful as we are and must be to <em>Nebel Towing, </em>the Court, by divided vote holds that the trial court was correct in this judgment and we affirm as to this issue.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As to all other issues the Court unanimously affirms the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-23\">This appeal grows out of an allision between the tow in tow of the tug F.R. BIGE-LOW and Crown Zellerbach\u2019s (CZ) water intake structure on the Mississippi River above Baton Rouge. Involved also was the tug\u2019s (and owners\u2019) maritime limitation of liability proceeding in which CZ brought a Louisiana direct action against the prime and excess P &amp; I Underwriters of the vessel owner/operator. After trial, the District Court held that Ingram, the tug owner/operator, was liable, but was entitled to limit its liability to the value of the vessel and the pending freight. The excess P &amp; I underwriter was held liable for nearly $2,000,000 of the portion of the CZ\u2019s damages that exceeded the limited liability of the vessel owner. We find no error in the court\u2019s holdings (i) of no \u201cprivity or knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>edge\u201d by the tug owner, (ii) the valuation of the vessel, (iii) the computation of CZ\u2019s damages, and (iv) the award of pre-judgment interest from a date later than the accident. However, the Court by divided vote determines that the District Court was free of error in holding the tug owner\u2019s underwriter liable beyond the dollar limits fixed, or ascertainable, in the P &amp; I policy. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AiAe\"><em>a -i ah u </em>,7 <em>How it All Happened</em></p>\n<p id=\"AM7\">On February 3, 1979, the tugboat F.R. BIGELOW owned (or bareboat chartered) by Ingram Industries,' Inc. (Ingram), while pushing 15 loaded barges down the Mississippi River in heavy fog and rain, caused its forward lead barge to come into contact with and damage Crown Zellerbach\u2019s (CZ) water intake structure, on the Mississippi above Baton Rouge. Shortly after this incident, CZ began to repair the structure, but these repairs were interrupted on May 18, 1979, when another tugboat collided with the structure and damaged the remaining portion. The structure was not rebuilt in kind, but was rebuilt in a different form.</p>\n<p id=\"Arj\">Suit was filed by CZ against the tugboat F.R. BIGELOW, and Ingram, her bareboat charterer, in April of 1979. Subsequently, the complaint was amended to include Cherokee Insurance Company, the prime P &amp; I insurer of Ingram, with a policy limit of $1,000,000, and London Steam-Ship Owners\u2019 Mutual Insurance Association, excess P &amp; I insurers of Ingram, with a deductible franchise of $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"ARA\">In its answer to the suit based upon the accident of February 3, 1979, Ingram, the <em>J </em>Dt chartered-owner/operator of the F.R. BIQELOW sought limitation of its liability to the value of the vessel plus freight then pending. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 183. Ingram stipulated liability for striking the structure, and the issues of damages and limitation of liability were tried. Following trial, the District Court entered judgment in favor of CZ in the \u201ctotal sum\u201d of $3,948,210.31, with pre-judgment interest from December 11, 1980. The District Court granted Ingram\u2019s prayer for limitation of liability, valued the vessel at $2,134,918.88 and limited the owner\u2019s liability to that amount. Cherokee\u2019s prime P &amp; I policy was for $1,000,000. In tabular form, the District Court decreed the total sum of CZ\u2019s judgment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOkW\">(a) Total Damages to CZ $3,948,210.31</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aef-dedup-0\">(b) Payable by Owner and Cherokee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvC6\">Prime P &amp; I $1,025,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ati-dedup-0\">(c) Payable by Owner and London Steam</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apy8\">Excess P &amp; I 1,109,918.88</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2vs\">(d) Owner\u2019s Limited Liability 2,134,918.88</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arb-dedup-1\">(e) Balance by London. Steam Excess P &amp; I $1,813,291.44</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKW\">Following the judgment, Ingram and its two P &amp; I underwriters made payments up to the limits of Ingram\u2019s fixed liability ($2,134,918.88).</p>\n<p id=\"A7m\">On appeal, CZ raises several issues as errors in the District Court\u2019s judgment, all of which we affirm. London Steam-Ship Owners\u2019 Mutual Insurance Association challenges that portion of the District Court\u2019s judgment holding that underwriter liable for the amount ($1,813,291.44) of the plaintiff\u2019s claim over and above Ingram\u2019s fixed limited liability ($2,134,918.88). Affirming the District Court by a divided vote on that issue obviously warrants publication of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">\n<em>Limitation of Liability </em>\n<footnotemark>**</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">\n<em>Limitation: Valuation of the Vessel **</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">\n<em>Effect of Stipulation of Damages**</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">\n<em>4.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\"><em>Pre-Judgment Interest \" </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-12\">\n<em>P &amp; I Underwriter Liable in Excess Limited Liability Amount</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AOa\">For its protection against claims for damage to piers and other fixed (non-vessel) structures, Ingram, as chartered owner of the tug BIGELOW had two P &amp; I covers. The prime cover was with Cherokee, the amount of insurance being specified as $1,000,000. London Steam-Ship Owners\u2019 Mutual Insurance Association, Ltd. (London Steam-Ship), through A. Bilbrough and Company, as managers, dove-tailing Cherokee\u2019s cover with a deductible franchise $1,000,000 supplied an excess P &amp; I cover in accordance with the Rules of the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-14\">Without specific articulation of the reasons for its decision, the trial court \u2014 obviously feeling bound by <em>Nebel Towing </em>\u2014 held the P &amp; I underwriter liable for approximately $2,000,000 more than the owner\u2019s limited liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-15\">Despite the dissent to the denial of rehearing en banc in <em>Nebel Towing </em>and criticism of that opinion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we are bound by that decision and to justify a different result in this case the Court would have to demonstrate that this case and the rationale presented here is different from that in <em>Nebel Towing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-16\">Unable to find any valid distinction, and bound by <em>Nebel Towing, </em>we are both bound and persuaded that the District Court was correct in holding the P &amp; I underwriter liable for this excess amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-20\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-21\">The upshot is that the Court affirms the holding of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1086-15\">. <em>Olympic Towing Corp. v.

We further found that \u201cthe Limitation Act was designed to assist the maritime industry and that it was in no way intended to benefit the insurance industry ...; the status of insurer is not covered by the public policy underlying the Limitation Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-26\">In <em>Nebel Towing we </em>found the Limitation Act to be a defense personal to the shipowner <em>because </em>it would be contrary to public policy to allow the insurer to reduce its liability solely on the basis of the ship-owner\u2019s statutory right to limit his liability. In this case London Steam-Ship is attempting to do indirectly, by means of a policy provision (Rule 8(i)), precisely what <em>Nebel Towing </em>held the insurer could not do directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-27\">Because it is contrary to Louisiana public policy for an insurer to reduce its liability to an amount less than the full P &amp; I coverage solely on the basis of the shipowner\u2019s right to limit his liability under the Limitation Act, Rule 8(i) is contrary to pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>lie policy. Therefore, Rule 8(i) is invalid and is <em>no t </em>a valid, effective term and condition of the P &amp; I coverage. The district court did not err.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1089-5\">JOHN R. BROWN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aic-dedup-1\">dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">I concur fully in all of the Court\u2019s opinion except the holding that the P &amp; I underwriter is liable in excess of the shipowner\u2019s limited liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">First, I wish to emphasize that while I dissented with some fervor in <em>Nebel Towing, </em>419 F.2d at 238, for the purposes of our present case (and all others like it) I accept the holding and rationale of <em>Nebel Towing. </em>In a nutshell my present dissent is the simple one: <em>Nebel Towing </em>dealt solely with the contention that the P &amp; I underwriter is entitled to the shipowner\u2019s <em>statutory </em>right to limit liability. Here the claim is quite different: the P &amp; I underwriter is claiming only that, as prescribed by the Louisiana Direct Action statute, the terms of its own insurance policy limits maximum liability to the dollar amount for which the shipowner-assured would be liable on its successfully maintaining the right to limitation of liability. In <em>Nebel Towing </em>the underwriter was claiming the <em>statutory </em>right of the assured; in our present case, it is claiming only the limitation of the insurance policy defense itself. I sum it up as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">In <em>Nebel Towing </em>the P &amp; I policy did not by its terms limit liability to what the vessel owner\u2019s limited liability would be. That meant that the P &amp; I underwriter in its effort to limit its liability had to contend that it, as the insurer, had a right to claim the vessel owner\u2019s <em>statutory </em>right to limitation of liability. My subsequent analysis of the <em>Nebel Towing </em>opinion I think bears this out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-11\">In sharp contrast to that situation, here the London Steam-Ship \u201cexcess\u201d P &amp; I policy by Rule 8(i) does have a policy term which limits its liability to that of the owner\u2019s limited liability. This is a <em>policy, </em>not <em>statutory </em>defense. The P &amp; I insurer is not claiming the owner\u2019s <em>statutory </em>right to a shipowner\u2019s limited liability, but merely the right to assert its <em>policy </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">Such an issue was not the subject of, or involved in, <em>Nebel Towing </em>so we are not constricted by that decision in the independent adjudication by this panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">Without so much as even a genuflect to <em>Nebel Towing, supra, </em>the trial court\u2014in a sort of everyone knows a P &amp; I underwriter cannot obtain the benefit of the assured\u2019s right to shipowner\u2019s limitation of liability\u2014held the P &amp; I underwriter liable for nearly $2,000,000 more than the owners\u2019 limited liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-14\">By the deposition of John Hawkes, director of Bilbrough, it is uncontradicted that London Steam-Ship, the \u201cClub,\u201d is an association composed of a number of members, all of whom are shipowners, who, \u201cseverally and individually, not jointly nor in partnership, nor the one for the other of them, but each only in his own name\u201d agree to protect and indemnify <em>each other </em>in respect of the vessel entered for protection and indemnity risk in accordance with the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-15\">The deposition of Hawkes\u2014a director of Bilbrough\u2014tracing the history of London Steam-Ship rules from those in 1881-82<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>1952-53 and then to those in 1955-56 reflected how the problem of the dollar (pound Sterling) limits of the insurance was recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">On reaching the financial condition in which the Association could extend its liability and without the limitation being and expressed in a specific monetary amount per ton (or tons entered), the Association became faced with the problem of determining what, how and in what manner its total liability exposure could be expressed. Beginning in 1955 \u2014 long before <em>Nebel Towing </em>\u2014 this is handled by Rule 8(i):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-5\">When a Member for whose account a ship is entered in this Class,' is entitled to limit his liability, the liability of this Class shall not exceed the amount of such limitation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">Since there can be no question that this \u2014 Rule 8(i) \u2014 is one of the \u201c... lawful conditions of the policy or contract,\u201d it brings us face to face with the critical provision of the Louisiana Direct Action Statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that \u201cany action brought hereunder shall be subject to ... the <em>defenses which could be urged by the insurer to a direct action brought by the </em>insured____\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-20\">We start with our decisions which today are still very intact. For example, <em>see Degelos v. Fidelity and Cas. Co., </em>313 F.2d 809 (5th Cir.1963)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co. v. Aetna Cas. Co., </em>322 F.2d 113, 1964 A.M.C. 308 (5th Cir.1963).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-21\">Not only is the Louisiana Direct Action Statute so precise, so have been the decisions of her courts: there must be a legal liability on part of the assured for the insurer to have a direct action liability. In <em>Burke v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Co., </em>209 La. 495, 24 So.2d 875 (1946) the question was whether under the law of Mississippi a wife had a right of action against her husband for a tort committed against her in Mississippi for which she can recover against the liability insurer in Louisiana. The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-22\">The statute does not give plaintiff any more rights than she has under the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>of Mississippi. It only furnishes her with a method to enforce in Louisiana-whatever rights she has in Mississippi. Since she has no cause of action'under the law of Mississippi, necessarily Act No. 55 of 1930 confers upon her no cause of action in Louisiana. The mere fact that under the statute plaintiff was able to obtain jurisdiction against her husband\u2019s liability insurer in a direct action in this State does not create, as against her husband, <em>or as against her insurer, </em>a substantive cause of action that does not exist under the law of the State where the wrongful act occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">24 So.2d at 877 (emphasis added). <em>See also, Hebert v. General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp., </em>48 So.2d 107, 108 (La.Ct.App.1950):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-5\">Neither the liability policy on which this suit is based nor Act No. 55 of 1930 makes the insurance company liable merely because of the occurrence of the accident. There is liability in the insurer only if the insured \u2014 plaintiff\u2019s husband\u2014 was guilty of negligence which caused the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Although the trial court, having been <em>Nebel-awed, </em>presumably thought that anything which forbade 100% recovery was somehow outlawed, it is plain that application of any such approach would produce absurd results which even the most potent <em>Nebelizer </em>would protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-14\">For example \u2014 and there are literally hundreds in the some-time esoteric world of marine insurance \u2014 consider this particular P &amp; I cover by the London Steam-Ship Club. By provision 7(b) of the Association Rules liability for damage to any other \u201cship, boat or craft,\u201d is excluded insofar as it is not covered by the usual hull policy with Running Down Clause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-15\">Suppose a Louisiana registered steam vessel of 300 tons entered for P &amp; I risk with the London Steam-Ship Club and also covered by the typical marine Hull policy is in a collision in Louisiana coastal waters (not on the Continental Shelf) and severely damages an ocean-going barge. The barge owner files a joint admiralty suit against the offending ship and the London SteamShip Club under the direct action statute seeking $100,000 in hull damages. Obviously, this being the classic case since at least 1836 of a liability insured under the % Running Down Clause<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the hull policy, the P &amp; I underwriter would have no liability for such hull damages. Under no stretch of the imagination \u2014 or the importation of quaint civil law codal provisions\u2014 would there be any possible basis for holding the P &amp; I underwriter liable for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>damages. Does anyone suppose that any Louisiana court, or one sitting \u00fcWe-bound as a federal court, would somehow conjure up the idea that this collision-liability-exclusion <em>(see supra </em>note 7) is \u201cpersonal\u201d and hence unavailable to the P &amp; I underwriter as an absolute threshold defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">On the other hand, suppose the same vessel, entered in the P &amp; I risks of the Club, but also insured with traditional hull cover with Running Down Clause<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> smashes into a dock. Here the claimant, unaware of the security he can obtain by a suit <em>in rem, </em>under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 740, files his joint suit against the owner and the hull underwriter \u2014 who is, after all, a liability insurer. Would anyone suppose that the usual exclusion of non-vessel damage<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> would be ignored, overruled, or rejected by a Louisiana court or a Louisiana-based federal court?</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Before analyzing the impact which these thoughts should have on whether <em>Nebel Towing </em>drives this Court to rejecting the ascertainable dollar limit to the P &amp; I underwriters commitment, two further cases warrant comment. The first is <em>Alcoa Steamship Co. v. Charles Ferran &amp; Co., </em>383 F.2d 46, 1967 A.M.C. 2578 (5th Cir. 1967), <em>cert, denied, </em>393 U.S. 836, 89 S.Ct. 111, 21 L.Ed.2d 107 (1968).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There this Court expressly limited the direct action insurer\u2019s liability to the shipyard\u2019s $300,000 Red Letter Limitation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">The other case is <em>Ta Chi Navigation (Panama) Corp. S.A. v. United States, </em>728 F.2d 699 (5th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-13\">If \u2014 and the if cannot be a very big one\u2014 both Louisiana and local federal courts would recognize these policy defenses as complete defenses to these supposed Louisiana direct action suits against the insurer, the question arises whether there is anything about the wording of Rule 8(i) (see <em>supra </em>text at p. 1000 and note 3) which limits liability to the liability of the vessel owner in a successful limitation proceeding which would compel a different result. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>the face of the Rule, it is plain and unequivocal. It does not speak in terms of possibilities or even probabilities. It speaks, not in terms of the hypothetical power of a non-vessel owner to claim the benefit of shipowner limitation of liability <em>(see infra </em>note 17, quoting <em>Nebel Towing, </em>419 F.2d at 236 n. 22), rather, it speaks in terms of an insured who is entitled to limit his liability <em>{see supra </em>text at p. 1000 and note 3 (Rule 8(i)). Nothing is left to speculation. The trial court, on a full trial \u2014 and approved by us \u2014 has judicially determined that Ingram is entitled to limitation and has fixed that sum precisely to $2,134,918.88.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">The only thing possibly standing in the way of this sensible result is <em>Nebel Towing. </em>This brings us face to face with our prior celebrated opinion in <em>Olympic Towing Corp. v. Nebel Towing Co., </em>419 F.2d 230, 1969 A.M.C. 1571 rehearing denied, 419 F.2d 238 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc), <em>cert, denied, </em>397 U.S. 989, 90 S.Ct. 1120, 25 L.Ed.2d 396 (1970). The <em>Nebel Towing </em>court precisely prescribed the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-6\">The appellants and the amicus curiae launch a broad scale and many-faceted attack on the district court\u2019s holding that Nebel\u2019s insurer could not take advantage of Nebel\u2019s <em>right </em>to <em>limit </em>its liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4LC\">419 F.2d at 234 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">The Court was not dealing with a condition or provision of the policy which limited insurer\u2019s liability. Rather, it was dealing with the contention that the insurer was entitled to urge the vessel owner\u2019s <em>statutory </em>right to limit its liability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-17\">After first disposing of the question reserved in the <em>Jane Smith, supra, </em>by holding that there was no unconstitutional conflict between the Louisiana Direct Action Statute and the Federal Limitation of Shipowners Liability Act and the likelihood of increase in actual cost to a vessel owner from higher insurance premiums (see part II) 419 F.2d at 234,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Court (part III)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> proceeded to determine the P &amp; I underwriter\u2019s \u201cremaining contentions [which] depend upon the interpretation of Louisiana law.\u201d 419 F.2d at 236. First, the Court on the basis of <em>Coleman v. Jahncke Service, Inc., </em>341 F.2d 956, 1965 A.M.C. 535 (5th Cir.1965), <em>cert, dismissed, </em>382 U.S. 967, 86 S.Ct. 525, 15 L.Ed.2d 463, <em>cert, denied, </em>382 U.S. 974, 86 S.Ct. 538, 15 L.Ed.2d 465 (1966) rejected out of hand the claim that the no-action clause of the P &amp; I policy forbad direct suit on the policy prior to judgment or payment by the assured. 419 F.2d at 236.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-18\">Since London Steam-Ship Rule 8(i) <em>(see supra </em>text at p. 1000 and note 3, and <em>infra </em>note 18) has been the target of CZ\u2019s attack that <em>Nebel Towing </em>requires a like result here, it is important to point out here that the only mention of somewhat similar language in the P &amp; I policy in <em>Nebel Towing </em>was in the Court\u2019s note 22. Note 22 was in response to the P &amp; I underwriter\u2019s contention that the policy did not permit a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>action and the Court mentioned that \u201cthe appellants\u201d refer to several clauses of the policy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">This suppositious condition <em>(see supra </em>[i] note 17) could have had no significance in <em>Nebel Towing </em>since it was uncontradicted that the insured vessel was under bareboat charter to the assured which the Court properly considered as an owner. <em>See </em>419 F.2d 230, 231 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">I have obtained and carefully considered all of the record and briefs in <em>Nebel Towing </em>including the P &amp; I policy. The P &amp; I policy expressly provided (line 9) that the \u201camount hereby insured [is] $175,000 as per schedule [of vessels by name as covered], [and] the underwriter ... hereby undertakes to pay up to the amount hereby insured ... such sums as the assured, as owner of the [vessels covered] shall become legally liable to pay and shall have paid on account of [enumerated liabilities].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">Unlike London Steam-Ship cover which under Rule 8(i) expressly provided that \u201cthe liability\u201d should not exceed the amount of the shipowner\u2019s limitation<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>, the <em>Nebel Towing </em>P &amp; I policy made no reference whatsoever to liability being limited in terms of a shipowner's limitation of liability, but rather expressly provided that the \u201camount hereby insured\u201d is $175,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">The only reference in the policy to liability being stated in terms of shipowner\u2019s limitation of liability was the clause (lines 99-102 of the policy) quoted in <em>Nebel Towing, </em>419 F.2d at 236 n. 22 and set forth in note 17 <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-8\">It is expressly understood and agreed if and <em>when </em>the assured has any interest <em>other than as a shipowner </em>in the vessel named herein, in no event shall this Company be liable hereunder to any greater extent <em>than if the assured were the sole owner and entitled </em>to petition for limitation of liability in accordance with present and future law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-16\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-17\">Thus, in <em>Nebel Towing </em>there was nothing in the P &amp; I policy which by words or implication, would limit the P &amp; I underwriter's liability to the owner\u2019s statutory limitation of liability. Nor was the P &amp; I underwriter making any such claim. In other words, the sole question before the Court and asserted by the P &amp; I underwriter was whether by reason of the Louisiana Direct Action Statute the P &amp; I underwriter had the <em>right </em>to claim the benefit of the owner\u2019s federal <em>statutory </em>right to shipowner\u2019s limited liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-18\">The case, therefore, did not involve a claim that under the terms of the P &amp; I policy there was no liability for amounts in excess of the vessel owner\u2019s limited liability. What, and all, it involved was whether, under the Louisiana Direct Action Statute, this non-policy defense of the owner\u2019s <em>statutory </em>right to limit liability was a defense, and if so, whether it was or was not \u201cpersonal\u201d to the assured. In other words, the P &amp; I underwriter was contending, not that the terms of the P &amp; I policy itself, as a <em>policy </em>defense, limited its liability to that of the owner\u2019s statutory right to limit, rather it was contending that this was a federal, <em>statutory </em>defense which, under general Louisiana law was not personal to the assured and could be availed of by the underwriter.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>Faced with this very precise claim the Court then likened this non-policy, <em>statutory </em>defense\u2014claiming the right to the shipowner\u2019s limitation of liability\u2014to other analogous non-policy defenses held by Louisiana courts to be personal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> These include such non-policy defenses such as infancy, coverture, charitable immunity, governmental immunity, bankruptcy, etc. that are not available to the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Faced with this problem then of importing a non-policy defense\u2014not a defense based upon the terms of the P &amp; I policy\u2014 but rather the Louisiana concept of the <em>statutory </em>defense of a shipowner\u2019s right to limit its liability arising in a direct action, this Court plainly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-6\">We therefore hold that limitation of liability <em>under the federal statute </em>is a personal defense which cannot be availed of by an insurer under Louisiana law<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\"><em>Nebel Towing, </em>419 F.2d at 238 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">The Court made clear that in this holding it was dealing with a <em>statutory, </em>non-policy defense when it stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-9\">There is no question that the Limitation Act was designed to assist the maritime industry and that it was in no way intended to benefit the insurance industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxZf\"><em>Nebel Towing, </em>419 F.2d at 238. The Court continued this emphasis by its further statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-10\">It is patent that <em>statutory limitation of liability </em>is only available to a shipowner; the status of insurer is not covered by the public policy underlying the Limitation <em>Act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">The result is that <em>Nebel Towing </em>dealt solely with an asserted <em>statutory </em>defense which the Court, under Louisiana <em>in solido </em>principles, held to be \u201cone personal\u201d to the shipowner, not the P &amp; I underwriter. Here, on the other hand, for the very first time this Court faces the problem of a defense, based not upon the owner\u2019s (assured\u2019s) <em>statutory </em>right to limit liability, but rather based on the terms and conditions of the P &amp; I coverage itself. This is an issue not previously ruled upon by this Court and as to which this panel ought to be free of restraints to reach its considered judicial decision. To sum it up: this panel for the present case accepts the <em>Nebel Towing </em>holdings of this Court that (i) there is no constitutional conflict between the Federal Statutory Limitation of Liability Act and the Louisiana Direction Action Statute, (ii) the P &amp; I policy no action clause is no defense to a claim under the Louisiana Direct Action Statute, (iii) the application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c) (1964) is not controlling, and (iv) the <em>statutory, </em>non-policy defense of the vessel owner\u2019s right to limit liability is a \u201cpersonal defense,\u201d under the Louisiana Direct Action Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">But <em>Nebel Towing, </em>not being an impediment to unconstricted adjudication, we should be free to, and ought to hold that Rule 8(i) is clear in its meaning and is a valid, effective term and condition of the P &amp; I coverage <em>{see </em>items (b), (c) and (d), Table p. 997. The contrary ruling of the District Court <em>{see </em>item (e) $1,813,291.44, Table p. 997) is wrong and the Court should reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-16\">I therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">. The consequence of the trial court\u2019s non-articulated adoption of <em>Nebel Towing </em>is demonstrated by the fact that under the prime P &amp; I policy, Cherokee\u2019s liability is limited to the SI,000,000. The trial court held P &amp; I underwriter <em>Cherokee </em>(and owner) liable for $1,000,000 only <em>{see </em>item (b) in table on damages p. 997). That would also have been the result in <em>Nebel Towing. </em>There the P &amp; I policy liability limit was $175,-000. Had the victim\u2019s damages (which had not yet been fixed) exceeded $175,000, there is no indication that this Court would have granted recovery against the P &amp; I underwriter in excess of the fixed dollar limit of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-17\">This means that, as in <em>Nebel Towing, </em>the Court accepts the idea that a dollar limitation is acceptable, but one in verbal, ascertainable terms is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1089-18\">.
