Pursuant to the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act (COWPTA), however, these same federal royalties are subject to a federal tax. The question is thus raised whether the United States should impose the windfall profits tax on federal royalties before or after it computes the 50% share of the royalties owed to the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-16\">Donald T. Regan, Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, has taken the position that the states\u2019 shares must be calculated <em>after </em>deducting the windfall profits tax, and has in fact calculated the states\u2019 shares by this method since the passage of COWPTA in 1980. Taking the contrary position, the State of New Mexico brought the present action against Regan in 1981 claiming that the Mineral Act requires payment to the states of 50% of federal royalties undiluted by the windfall profits tax. New Mexico consequently sought to recover 50% of the federal royalties used to pay the windfall profits tax, together with interest, an accounting, declaratory relief, and its attorney fees. The district court granted New Mexico\u2019s motion for summary judgment, awarding completely the state\u2019s requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-17\">Secretary Regan appeals from this decision, asserting that the court\u2019s position is contrary to the intent of Congress in passing COWPTA and the Mineral Act. In addition, he argues that even if the court properly construed the applicable statutes, it erred in awarding the states prejudgment interest on the royalties withheld. Finally, Secretary Regan contends that because this is a suit against the United States to which it has not consented, the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>tain New Mexico\u2019s suit. We will begin with an analysis of the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">\n<em>The District Court\u2019s Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AaD\">It is unclear from the district court\u2019s opinion whether it considered New Mexico\u2019s suit to be an action against the United States. The court did hold, however, that if such were the case the district court nonetheless possessed jurisdiction by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701 <em>et seq. </em>(the Administrative Procedure Act), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (federal mandamus), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (declaratory judgment). According to the court, these statutes granted the United States\u2019 consent to suit in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-5\">As an initial matter, we hold that New Mexico\u2019s suit is indeed an action against the United States. Although Secretary Regan is the nominal defendant in the suit, sovereign immunity is determined not by the party named as the defendant, but by the issues presented and the effect of the judgment. <em>Transwestern Pipeline Co. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., </em>492 F.2d 878, 884 (10th Cir.1974) <em>cert, dismissed </em>419 U.S. 1097, 95 S.Ct. 691, 42 L.Ed.2d 689 (1975). If the relief sought against a federal officer in fact operates against the sovereign, then the action must be deemed as one against the sovereign. <em>Hawaii v. Gordon, </em>373 U.S. 57, 58, 83 S.Ct. 1052, 1052-53, 10 L.Ed.2d 191 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-6\">New Mexico correctly points out that an exception to this general rule is recognized when a suit is brought against a governmental official challenging his or her <em>ultra vires </em>actions. <em>See Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Corp., </em>337 U.S. 682, 689, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 1461, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949). Assuming arguendo that this exception could be properly invoked in the present case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has rejected its application when \u201cthe relief requested cannot be granted by merely ordering the cessation of the conduct complained of but will require affirmative action by the sovereign or the disposition of unquestionably sovereign property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691 n. 11, 69 S.Ct. at 1462 n. 11 (citing <em>North Carolina v. Temple, </em>134 U.S. 22, 10 S.Ct. 509, 33 L.Ed. 849 (1890)). <em>See also Hawaii v. Gordon, supra. </em>The relief sought by New Mexico would, in our view, require affirmative action by the sovereign or the disposition of sovereign property. New Mexico seeks to change in a significant manner the Secretary\u2019s methods of calculating the windfall tax and state royalties; this change would clearly reduce amounts already collected in the Treasury pursuant to the windfall profits tax<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and require the payment of substantial sums to New Mexico. Thus, as a practical matter, the \u201cessential nature and effect of the proceeding\u201d is such \u201cthat the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration.\u201d <em>Land v. Dollar, </em>330 U.S. 731, 738, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 1012, 91 L.Ed. 1209 (1947). <em>See also Du-gan v. Rank, </em>372 U.S. 609, 620, 83 S.Ct. 999, 1006, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963); <em>Mine Safety Co. v. Forrestal, </em>326 U.S. 371, 375, 66 S.Ct. 219, 221, 90 L.Ed. 140 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-9\">Having concluded that New Mexico\u2019s suit is directed against the United States, we must determine whether the United States has consented to such suits in federal district court. <em>See United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 769, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941). The district court, as has been mentioned, based its finding of jurisdiction upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and the waivers of sovereign immunity found in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (the Administrative Procedures Act), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1361, 2201 (federal mandamus and declaratory judgment). While 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 grants to the district court broad subject matter jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, that section does not include a general waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States. <em>See B.K. Instrument, Inc. v. United States, </em>715 F.2d 713, 724 (2d Cir.1983). We must therefore look elsewhere in order to examine the extent to which the United States has consented to suit in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-4\">Section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act contains a limited waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity. That section reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-5\">A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action ... is entitled to judicial review thereof. An action ... <em>seeking relief other than money damages ... </em>shall not be dismissed ... on the ground that it is against the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">Thus, \u00a7 702 has been construed as granting the United States\u2019 consent to suit in cases involving agency action, subject however, to the proviso that the action is not one for \u201cmoney damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-7\">New Mexico contends, and the district court held, that the present action is not one for \u201cmoney damages\u201d and that \u00a7 702 thus provides the necessary consent to suit. In reaching this conclusion, the district court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-12\">The State of New Mexico has requested the specific relief of one-half of those royalties received from crude oil production from federal lands within New Mexico which were used by the United States to pay the windfall profits tax. The fact that the requested relief is for specific monies held by the Treasury does not mean that the requested relief is for money damages. Damages are a sum of money used as substitutionary relief. Such relief is given to the plaintiff to substitute for a suffered loss which may not have been originally a monetary loss. Dobbs, <em>Handbook of the Law of Remedies, </em>135, (1973). Specific relief, on the other hand, is an attempt to give back to the plaintiff that which he actually lost, not a sum measured by the amount of the loss, but the loss itself. Dobbs, at 135____ This action seeks specific, declaratory and mandamus relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1411-14\"><em>New Mexico v. Donald T. Regan, </em>No. 81-452-M Civil, at 6 (D.N.M. June 8, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-15\">We must conclude, however, that the district court failed to ascertain the intent of Congress by engaging in its semantic discussion of the meaning of the word \u201cdamages.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 702 expressly states: \u201cNothing herein ... confers authority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit <em>expressly </em>or <em>impliedly </em>forbids the relief which is sought.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislative history supporting \u00a7 702 states unequivocally that the provision is to be read in conjunction with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>other jurisdictional statutes waiving sovereign immunity, and, as an example, points out that the \u201cTucker Act impliedly forbids relief other than the remedy provided by [that] Act.\u201d H.R. No. 94-1656, 94th Cong. 2d Sess. (1976), 5 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News, 6121, 6133. <em>See also American Science &amp; Engineering, Inc. v. Califano, </em>571 F.2d 58, 63 (1st Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">The Tucker Act (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 1491) grants concurrent jurisdiction to the district court and the Claims Court (formerly the Court of Claims) over money claims against the United States not exceeding $10,000. For claims against the United States involving amounts greater than $10,000 founded upon the Constitution, Acts of Congress, executive regulations, or contracts, the Act vests <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction with the Claims Court. <em>Amalgamated Sugar Co. v. Bergland, </em>664 F.2d 818, 823 (10th Cir.1981); <em>Laguna Hermosa Corp. v. Martin, </em>643 F.2d 1376, 1379 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Chelsea Community Hospital v. Michigan Blue Cross, </em>630 F.2d 1131, 1136 (6th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">Several courts have noted that when the \u201cprime objective\u201d or \u201cessential purpose\u201d of the complaining party is to obtain money from the federal government (in an amount in excess of $10,000), the Claims Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction is triggered. <em>See Alamo Navajo School Board, Inc. v. Andrus </em>664 F.2d 229, 233 (10th Cir.1981) <em>cert, denied, </em>456 U.S. 963, 102 S.Ct. 2041, 72 L.Ed.2d 487 (1982); <em>B.K Instrument, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>715 F.2d at 727; <em>Bakersfield City Sch. Dist. of Kern Cty. v. Boyer, </em>610 F.2d 621, 628 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Hoopa Valley Tribe v. United States, </em>596 F.2d 435-36 (Ct.Cl. 1979). Consequently, the Claims Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction may not be avoided by framing a complaint in the district court as one seeking injunctive, declaratory, or mandatory relief when, in reality, the thrust of the suit is one seeking money from the United States. <em>Amalgamated Sugar Co. v. Bergland, supra </em>at 824; <em>Chelsea Community Hospital v. Michigan Blue Cross, supra </em>at 1136; <em>Laguna Her-mosa Corp. v. Martin, supra </em>at 1379; <em>Hoopa Valley Tribe v. United States, supra </em>at 436. Similarly, a plaintiff may not transform a claim for monetary relief into an equitable action simply by asking for an injunction that orders the payment of money. <em>Jaffee v. United States, </em>592 F.2d 712, 715 (3d Cir.1979) <em>cert, denied, </em>441 U.S. 961, 99 S.Ct. 2406, 60 L.Ed.2d 1066 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-7\">The district court concluded that the Claims Court could not assert jurisdiction over New Mexico\u2019s suit because of the \u201cequitable relief\u201d requested by the state. We disagree. New Mexico\u2019s claim for past royalties and prejudgment interest is clearly founded upon provisions of an \u201cAct of Congress\u201d (the Mineral Act), and exceeds the $10,000 jurisdictional limit of the Tucker Act. New Mexico\u2019s primary purpose is to fix the government\u2019s and not the Secretary\u2019s liability; accordingly, we must conclude that the suit is essentially one designed to reach money which the government owns. <em>See Mine Safety Co. v. Forrestal, supra </em>326 U.S. at 375, 66 S.Ct. at 221. This, then, is a claim for money cognizable under the Act. New Mexico\u2019s additional requests for an accounting and declaratory relief are merely incidental and subordinate to the basic suit for money. Although such has not always been the case, the Claims Court may now grant equitable relief as an incident to the award of money in the interest of affording complete justice to the parties. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(3) (1976) <em>(as amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 25). <em>See Ellis v. United States, </em>610 F.2d 760, 762 (Ct.C1.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-8\">New Mexico argues that the federal mandamus and declaratory judgment statutes (28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1361, 2201) provide the district court with an alternative basis of jurisdiction. While this argument, standing alone, has merit, we believe that allowing the district court to entertain these equitable claims would be improper in the context of this case. Having concluded that New Mexico\u2019s claim is primarily one for money over which the Claims Court possesses exclusive jurisdiction, it would not be in the interest of justice or public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>policy to allow the district court to determine New Mexico\u2019s incidental equitable claims. It is settled that the declaratory judgment statute does not itself confer jurisdiction on a federal court where none otherwise exists. <em>Amalgamated Sugar Co. v. Bergland, supra </em>at 822. In addition, several courts have specifically concluded that mandamus is not available in the district court when relief can be granted in the Claims Court. <em>See, e.g., American Science &amp; Engineering, Inc. v. Califano, supra </em>at 64; <em>Carter v. Seamans, </em>411 F.2d 767, 774 (5th Cir.1969) <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 941, 90 S.Ct. 953, 25 L.Ed.2d 121 (1970). This court has similarly noted the general principle that mandamus should not be invoked if adequate alternative relief is available at law. <em>United States v. West, </em>672 F.2d 796, 799 (10th Cir.1982) <em>cert, denied, </em>457 U.S. 1133, 102 S.Ct. 2959, 73 L.Ed.2d 1350 (1982). Finally, as we have previously noted, the Claims Court does not <em>lose </em>jurisdiction when equitable claims are asserted in conjunction with primary claims for money against the United States. Similarly, the district court should not <em>gain </em>jurisdiction over what is fundamentally a Tucker Act claim simply because the complaint contains requests for equitable relief. <em>See Portsmouth Redevelopment &amp; Housing Authority v. Pierce, </em>706 F.2d 471, 474 (4th Cir.1983) <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 392, 78 L.Ed.2d 336 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">We must conclude, therefore, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter summary judgment in favor of New Mexico. We need not discuss the remaining issues raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">We direct that this case be transferred to the United States Claims Court for adjudication on the merits \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d rather than dismissing the suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Keller v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>679 F.2d 220, 223 (11th Cir.1982). <em>Accord, Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation v. Califano, </em>571 F.2d 328, 332 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 893, 99 S.Ct. 250, 58 L.Ed.2d 238 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-10\">The case is transferred to the United States Claims Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1410-7\">. In our view it is doubtful that Secretary Re-gan's method of computing the states\u2019 royalties could be deemed <em>ultra vires. </em>New Mexico\u2019s challenge does not accurately rest upon the Secretary\u2019s lack of <em>delegated power </em>to determine the state\u2019s royalty, but rather that the Secretary\u2019s decision was <em>incorrect </em>as a matter of law. The Supreme Court has rejected such arguments asserted in the attempt to avoid the shield of sovereign immunity, and has held that actions of an officer within his <em>statutory authority </em>are the actions of the sovereign. <em>Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Corp., </em>337 U.S. 682, 693-95, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 1463-64, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1410-11\">. In its complaint New Mexico noted that the Treasury had collected $3,255,000 in federal royalties from federal lands in New Mexico over a five-month period in 1980. Reducing the taxable royalties derived from public lands located in New Mexico by 50% for this five-month period alone would significantly decrease federal revenues, not to mention the dramatic national impact of such a change when considering its future application to all federal lands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1411-8\">. We note that the legislative history behind \u00a7 702 supports a broader view of the term \"damages\" than that held by the district court. For example, House Report 94-1656 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-9\">The first of the additional sentences provides that claims challenging official action or non-action, and seeking relief other than money damages, should not be barred by sovereign immunity. <em>The explicit exclusion of monetary relief makes it clear that sovereign immunity is abolished only in actions for specific relief </em>(injunctions, declaratory judgment, mandatory relief, etc.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1411-10\">H.R. No. 94-1656, 94th Cong. 2d Sess. (1976), 5 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News, 6121, 6131 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-16\">There is nothing in the legislative history which supports the proposition that the use of the word \"damages\u201d was intended by Congress to exclude certain claims for money not falling within technical common law concepts of \"damages.\u201d Rather, the history supports the view that \u00a7 702 should be read with a practical eye, with the focus upon the effect of the claim\u2014 does it involve a claim for money, or does it seek only to effect action? It is solely the latter class of claims which fall within the consent to suit granted by \u00a7 702. A contrary view would seemingly run counter to the Tucker Act's express scheme for monetary claims against the United States (discussed <em>infra </em>in text at 1322).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1413-7\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-8\">Whenever a civil action is filed in a court as defined in section 610 of this title [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 610] or an appeal, including a petition for review of administrative action, is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed, and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed or noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed or noticed for the court from which it is transferred.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
