RSA 282-A:28, as it then read. The district court ruled in favor of the State. We affirm, on the basis of the recent Fourth Circuit opinion in <em>Watkins v. Cantrell, </em>736 F.2d 933 (4th Cir.1984), in which the court answered fully exactly the same arguments that appellant makes today.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">We add that we are offended by appellant\u2019s concept that because of an at least reasonable statutory interpretation by the State he should receive, if it proved mistaken, in addition to back payments and counsel fees, $100,000 damages for emotional distress and a like sum for punitive damages. A state is obliged to make statutory interpretations for the benefit of its citizens, and it should not have to do so in terrorem. <em>Cf. City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., </em>453 U.S. 247, 259-63, 267-69, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 2755-58, 2759-61, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981) (policies of deterrence and punishment of <em>willful </em>wrongdoing may in appropriate circumstances warrant awards of punitive damages against officials personally, but do not support such awards against municipalities; innocent taxpayers should not bear this burden).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-15\">Affirmed; costs to appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
