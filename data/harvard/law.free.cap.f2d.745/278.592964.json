Cummiskey, </em>728 F.2d 200 (3d Cir.1984), to determine whether or not <em>Miranda </em>warnings had been given to Patrick Cummiskey prior to his assertion of the right to remain silent at the time of his arrest. In <em>Cummiskey </em>we held that the prosecutor could properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>comment at trial on defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence only if the government proved that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given. The district court found that <em>Miranda </em>warnings had not been given at the relevant time, and reinstated the judgment of sentence. That finding is not challenged as clearly erroneous, and our prior decision requires an affirmance of the judgment. Cummiskey contends that this court misconstrued the holding in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), but concedes that our prior ruling is law of the case, which can be corrected only by this court sitting in banc or by the Supreme Court on <em>certiorari. </em>The judgment appealed from will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
