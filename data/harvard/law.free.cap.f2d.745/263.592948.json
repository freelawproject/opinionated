He has siso been convicted of three counts of willfully assisting in the filing of and subscribing to false corporate income tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206 (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> O\u2019Brocta was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment on the conspiracy and the substantive counts; these terms were SUSpendec[ by the trial judge, and concurrent periods of probation were imposed for each count. A fine was also imposed</p>\n<p id=\"AOX\">, , J 0 Bro\" a ar/ues.on a?Peal tha* the evT dence adduced afmst him at tr'al 13 msuf\" ficient to support a conviction for conspir- ........ , ** ^nd that the trial judge s comments du\u2122^ the chf^e so tainted the jury s verdict as to deprive him of an adequate , __ ^ opportunity to defend himself. We cannot agree with O\u2019Brocta\u2019s contentions and the convictions will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ahq-dedup-0\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"A9Q\">O\u2019Brocta is president of a salvage eompa-ny whose business is the buying and selling of scrap metal. Between 1975 and 1978, O\u2019Brocta regularly sold scrap to Penn Iron and Metals Company. Gerald Olgin, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>president of Penn Iron, testified at O\u2019Broc-ta\u2019s trial that, when a seller of scrap asked for payment in cash, the firm would write a check to a fictitious payee, cash the check, and pay the seller. O\u2019Brocta frequently received payment under this scheme, and he frequently personally cashed the checks drawn to the order of fictitious payees. O\u2019Brocta did not include in his corporate records the receipts from sales of scrap to Penn Iron paid by such checks or cash. Although O\u2019Brocta was responsible for the preparation of the corporate tax returns of his salvage company, he did not inform his accountants of the sales to Penn Iron, which were, consequently, not reported on the tax returns filed by the corporation for 1976, 1977, and 1978.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">O\u2019Brocta\u2019s primary defense at trial was that he lacked the <em>mens rea </em>required for a criminal conviction because he believed that the failure to report cash payments was not improper and would not affect the computation of his tax liability. To support the latter contention, O\u2019Brocta attempted to show that he used the cash received from Penn Iron to purchase scrap for his own business. He claimed that he never recorded these purchases and, consequently, that the cost of goods sold, as reported on the allegedly inaccurate returns, was understated by the same amount as the report of gross receipts. Thus, O\u2019Brocta argued, he did not intentionally violate a known legal duty in understating gross receipts because he believed that he had fulfilled his legal obligation by accurately stating gross profits and correctly computing the income tax owed on this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">On appeal O\u2019Brocta argues that the trial judge deprived him of the right to convince the jury that he lacked the intent necessary to conspire or to commit the substantive crimes. He charges that the trial court erred in not allowing him to elicit certain testimony from various witnesses and that this error was compounded by the characterization of his defense as \u201cspurious\u201d in the judge\u2019s remarks to the jury. Finally, O\u2019Brocta maintains that the conspiracy conviction cannot stand because the government has failed to prove that the IRS was actually impeded by the system of cash payments made to him or his corporation by Penn Iron.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The most troubling aspect of this appeal is the claim that the trial judge interfered with O\u2019Brocta\u2019s attempt to persuade the jury of his innocence by characterizing his defense as spurious. That remark was made during the recitation of the jury instructions;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">There is a particular statute or two particular sections of the same statute that make the giving of the false information a violation of the law, regardless of whether there was any income tax to be paid or due, regardless of whether the United States suffered any loss or not. No pecuniary loss, no monetary loss, need be suffered by the United States. The violation of the statute is complete if it is shown that the Defendant deliberately and with knowledge that it was contrary to law gave a false account of any material item on the report. Gross receipts are material. There has been an admission here that gross expenditures were also falsely reported and an argument made that they should cancel each other out, and that is spurious, of course, in that it omits the consideration of inventory. If money is paid out to acquire goods, then those goods go into inventory, and so a false statement of any one of these things throws all the rest of the material on the return out of whack and unable to be understood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">App. at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Immediately after these remarks, the judge explained that the jury must deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>mine whether the defendant had \u201cacted willfully, in the sense that he knew what he was doing was contrary to law, and he knew that the statements were false.\u201d \u201c[N]o one should be convicted,\u201d the judge emphasized, \u201cif he acted by mistake or inadvertence or some other reason. He has to know what he was doing and know that it was contrary to the requirements of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> App. at 548-49. These remarks repeated an earlier and more specific reference to the intent requirement of the statutes under which O\u2019Brocta was being prosecuted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Do the facts which have been drawn before you, are the things which were done, consistent with a certain state of mind, which is the issue in this case? There is no dispute, there is no denial, that the tax return in question for the three years was false. The Defendant admits that it was, when it say [sic], \u201cTotal Receipts,\u201d that the total receipts weren\u2019t there, and that is undisputed. There is no dispute that the Defendant did not record all the receipts that he got. The dispute here is as to his state of mind, because that is an element of the crime for which he is charged, that he knowingly and willfully gave false information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">App. at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The most explicit or at least the most complete explanation of the elements of the crimes with which O\u2019Brocta was charged came later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">If you find beyond a reasonable doubt, from all the evidence in the case, that the Defendant willfully signed the tax returns for 1977 and \u201978, that the return was false as to a material matter, and that he knew that the false return was false, then the offense is completed____ [W]ith respect to the \u201976 return, you must find that the Defendant aided or assisted in or procured or advised the preparation of a return, that the return was false as to a material matter, and that the Defendant did it willfully, that is, knowing that it was contrary to law, knowing that it was false____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-15\">The terminology as used in this statute means that the acts are done voluntarily and purposefully, and not because of a mistake or accident or some other innocent reason____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-16\">So remember that the critical element in this case, and the only one in real dispute, is the mental state of the Defendant, that it must be shown that he willfully did the act, knowingly doing something which he knows the law for-bids____ If the evidence leads you to conclude that the Defendant acted in good faith in order to conform to the law, that would not meet the test of willfulness. The Government must prove the Defendant\u2019s conduct in supplying the allegedly false information to his accountant was willfully done, with the specific intent to violate what he knew his legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>duty to be. He must be shown to have acted voluntarily and intentionally to violate a known duty. The evidence must show that James O\u2019Brocta knew that his conduct was unlawful, that a particular act or failure to act here was a violation of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">You may consider all these matters. You may consider if he acted because he, in truth and honesty, believed that his offsetting of purchases would offset the cash received not reported, made his act without any tax consequences. Then, you may consider that in connection with the willfulness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">Is there evidence here which raises a doubt that he acted willfully about any fact by which is shown in the evidence to excuse that state of mind? Did he, in good faith, believe that the method of offsetting expenses that he has testified to rendered it unnecessary for him to give truthful reports? Then, you may consider that for the purpose of determining whether he acted willfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">So, in summation, a conviction of willful violation of the tax laws must show an intentional violation of a known legal duty, which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">App. at 550-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">We must determine on this appeal whether the trial judge\u2019s use of the word \u201cspurious\u201d in his charge, in light of the circumstances, constitutes reversible error. In order to assist the jury in its deliberations, the trial judge may, within certain limits, comment upon the evidence. <em>See Quercia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S.Ct. 698, 698-99, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933). When doing so, however, the trial judge must not unduly influence the jury\u2019s decision, so as to deny the defendant his right to trial by jury. The Supreme Court has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">In charging the jury, the trial judge is not limited to instructions of an abstract sort. It is within his province, whenever he thinks it necessary, to assist the jury in arriving at a just conclusion by explaining and commenting upon the evidence, by drawing their attention to the parts of it which he thinks important; and he may express his opinion upon the facts, provided he makes it clear to the jury that all matters of fact are submitted to their determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-11\"><em>Quercia, </em>289 U.S. at 469, 53 S.Ct. at 699. The Supreme Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">The privilege of the judge to comment on the facts has its inherent limitations. His discretion is not arbitrary and uncontrolled, but judicial, to be exercised in conformity with the standards governing the judicial office. In commenting upon testimony he may not assume the role of a witness. He may analyze and dissect the evidence, but he may not either distort it or add to it. His privilege of comment in order to give appropriate assistance to the jury is too important to be left without safeguards against abuses. The influence of the trial judge on the jury \u201cis necessarily and properly of great weight\u201d and \u201chis lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\u201d This Court has accordingly emphasized the duty of the trial judge to use great care that an expression of opinion upon the evidence \u201cshould be so given as not to mislead, and especially that it should not be one-sided\u201d; that \u201cdeductions and theories not warranted by the evidence should be studiously avoided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 470, 53 S.Ct. at 699 (quoting <em>Starr v. United States, </em>153 U.S. 614, 626, 14 S.Ct. 919, 923, 38 L.Ed. 841 (1894)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">There is no bright line separating remarks that are appropriate from remarks that may unduly influence a jury. Although not explicitly articulated, this Court has balanced a number of factors and has employed what might be termed a sliding scale approach to assess the propriety of a trial judge\u2019s comments during a charge to the jury. Specifically, this Court has considered four factors: the materiality of the comment, its emphatic or overbearing nature, the efficacy of any curative instruction, and the prejudicial effect of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ment in light of the jury instruction as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On appeal, the materiality of the challenged comment is a preliminary focus of inquiry. The reviewing court should be more concerned with a comment on a matter central to the defense than with a comment on a tangential issue. <em>See United States v. Anton, </em>597 F.2d 371, 374 (3d Cir.1979). The fact that the judge in <em>Anton </em>commented on the defendant\u2019s credibility, an issue \u201ccentral to his defense,\u201d was one factor in this Court\u2019s reversal of the conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">A second consideration for the reviewing court is the strength of the challenged comment. The reviewing court must be concerned with \u201cemphatic or overbearing remarks\u201d that a jury may accept as controlling. <em>United States v. Gaines, </em>450 F.2d 186, 189 (3d Cir.1971). For example in <em>Anton, </em>597 F.2d at 372-73, the trial judge commented that he regarded the defendant <em>\u201cas devoid of credibility\u201d </em>and that he did <em>\u201cnot believe [defendant] absolutely and in all respects.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, in <em>Anton, </em>the emphatic nature of the judge\u2019s statement provided a second ground for the reversal of the jury verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 374. However, a statement that questions the validity of an assertion, but does not flatly or emphatically dismiss the testimony, is of less concern. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Blair, </em>456 F.2d at 514, 519 (3d Cir.1972); <em>Gaines, </em>450 F.2d at 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">The efficacy of any curative instruction must also be considered. In many eases, a trial judge\u2019s comment which potentially could constitute reversible error can be counterbalanced by a curative instruction. <em>See, e.g., Blair, </em>456 F.2d at 519. For such an instruction to be effective, the judge should clearly explain to the jury that it is free to disregard his remarks and must determine the facts and decide the case on its own. Both the number and clarity of such instructions are to be considered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Finally, the reviewing court must assess the prejudicial effect of the comments in light of the jury instruction as a whole. A potentially prejudicial comment cannot be evaluated in isolation, out of context. Rather, the reviewing court must examine the entire jury instruction to assess the true impact of the challenged remark. <em>See Gaines, </em>450 F.2d at 190.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">Under the sliding scale approach the reviewing court must balance the above-mentioned factors. The stronger the potential prejudicial effect of a statement is, the stronger must be the mitigating factors. There may be cases in which the trial judge\u2019s comments are so out of bounds that no cautionary instruction to the jury could remove their prejudicial effect. For example, in <em>Anton </em>this Court held that the judge\u2019s statement of utter disbelief as to the defendant\u2019s credibility constituted reversible error. Despite clear curative statements before and after the comment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the Court stated that \u201c[where] a court has expressed its opinion on a pivitol issue in the case, and has expressed that opinion in a strong, unequivocal and one-sided fashion, abstract instructions regarding the jury\u2019s role as fact finder are not a sufficient remedy.\u201d <em>Anton, </em>597 F.2d at 375; <em>see also Quercia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 469-72, 53 S.Ct. 698, 698-700, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933) (judge\u2019s comment, in reference to defendant, that \u201c \u2018wiping\u2019 one\u2019s hands while testifying was \u2018almost always an indication of lying\u2019 \u201d constituted reversible error). In cases in which the prejudicial effect of a judicial comment is not so egregious as to be uncorrectible, the appellate court must weigh the totality of the factors in determining whether the quantum of harm from a statement amounts to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The test described above must now be applied to the trial judge\u2019s characterization of the defense testimony on parallel underreporting of gross income and gross expenditures as \u201cspurious.\u201d It is important to note that the charge against O\u2019Brocta was not tax evasion, but the willful filing of inaccurate reports. Thus O\u2019Brocta's state of mind, not the actual tax consequences of such a procedure, was at issue. The trial judge\u2019s comment on the effect of the underreporting might well have been intended merely to alert the jury that this line of defense was not particularly relevant to the charge against O\u2019Brocta. Consequently, any prejudicial effect of the judge\u2019s comment was necessarily less than in <em>Gaines </em>in which the judge\u2019s remarks went to the core of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The trial judge\u2019s statement was also not nearly as strong as the statement of utter disbelief in <em>Anton. </em>The judge\u2019s opinion that the evidence was spurious is much closer in tone to the statement in <em>Blair </em>that the judge thought the money orders in dispute had been altered. <em>See </em>456 F.2d at 519.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">In addition to the fact that use of the word \u201cspurious\u201d had limited prejudicial effect, the judge issued a curative instruction to the jury in response to defense counsel\u2019s objection to its use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">I have said, ladies and gentlemen, that the false statements on the returns and the false entries in the books are not in dispute. They have been admitted. The only question left is the question of mental state; that is, the willfulness____ With respect to the court\u2019s comment on whether or not the receipts of money and the expenditures of money and cash \u2014 I may have used the word \u201cspurious.\u201d That is solely a conclusion that the court drew. You have heard the testimony of the Government\u2019s expert witness with respect to what the effect of the misstatement of both of those are on other matters here. The opinion of the court there that there is inventory is solely the opinion of the Court and does not bind the jury in any way as to whether or not that would be a logical contention to make, that these two cancel each other out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">App. at 559-60. This cautionary instruction is similar to one which the Court found to be sufficient in <em>Blair, </em>456 F.2d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">Finally, the judge\u2019s use of the word \u201cspurious\u201d must be evaluated in light of his entire charge. <em>See Gaines, </em>450 F.2d at 190. In the present case, the judge repeatedly, and correctly, told the jury that its task was to determine whether O'Brocta willfully signed tax returns which he knew were false as to a material matter. The use of one ill-advised word within an entire charge to the jury does not, in this context, constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">Thus, whatever the limits of permissible judicial comment may be, the trial judge\u2019s comment in the case at bar did not transcend the boundary. While the Court does not endorse the judge\u2019s use of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u201cspurious,\u201d it also does not find that under the test utilized today the inclusion of this one word amounted to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Additionally, we note that the defense failed to object to the effectiveness of the judge\u2019s curative instruction. According to Fed.R.Crim.P. 30,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it was incumbent upon defense counsel to request a further curative instruction or to register an objection to the efficacy of the one already presented to the jury before the jury retired to consider its verdict. The policy behind rule 30 \u2014 to prevent needless retrying of cases when the defect complained of could have been cured at the first trial \u2014 is an important one. <em>See United States v. Currens, </em>290 F.2d 751, 759 (3d Cir.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Thus counsel\u2019s lack of a timely challenge to the efficacy of the judge\u2019s curative instruction, as required by rule 30, forecloses assigning as error that portion of the charge. Our decision today is in keeping with the spirit of <em>Currens. </em>In <em>Currens, </em>this Court noted the important procedural purpose of rule 30, but warned against employing it \u201cwoodenly\u201d so as not to become a \u201ctrap for the unwary.\u201d <em>Currens, </em>290 F.2d at 759. The defense strategy in <em>Currens </em>was based on the Durham formula for insanity, yet the trial judge refused the defense\u2019s request to utilize this standard in his charge to the jury. The defense\u2019s challenge to the judge\u2019s instructions was somewhat vague. However, because the entire defense was based on the Durham formula, and the trial judge instructed the jury according to the M\u2019Naghten Rule, we held that rule 30 did not bar defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The present case is quite different. Defense counsel did object to the judge\u2019s use of the word \u201cspurious,\u201d but not to the efficacy of his curative instruction. These two points, while related, are different. An appellate court could have ruled for the defendant on either of these grounds separately; thus both points had to be preserved for appeal. As in <em>Anton, </em>we might have found the judge\u2019s comment to be so prejudicial that no cautionary instruction could have removed the taint. Conversely, we could have found that the judge\u2019s remark was sufficiently prejudicial to require a cautionary remark but that the cautionary remark made by the judge was inadequate. In the latter ease, the policy behind rule 30 mandates that defendant raise an objection at trial so that a second trial might be avoided. In light of the totality of the circumstances, the judge\u2019s remark did not amount to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">O\u2019Brocta also argues that he was deprived of an adequate opportunity to persuade the jury of his innocence as a result of the trial judge\u2019s decision not to allow certain questions to be put to government and defense witnesses. In general, the trial court\u2019s rulings precluded extensive inquiry into two matters: 1) the effect on tax liability of equally underreported receipts and purchases, and 2) the results of the government\u2019s efforts to locate the funds O\u2019Brocta had not reported in his tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">On cross-examination, defense counsel sought to question O\u2019Brocta\u2019s accountant and Special Agents Busse and Waldemar-son about the tax consequences of using unreported gross receipts to make unreported purchases of scrap metal. Walde-marson was permitted to testify that equal, unreported receipts and purchases would lead to a correct computation of gross profits on an income tax return. Busse was allowed to testify that O\u2019Brocta had informed him that the Penn Iron payments \u201cwere used for cash purposes and [therefore] netted out.\u201d App. at 272. Nevertheless, it is true that the trial court generally limited inquiry into this area, having con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>eluded that such questioning was irrelevant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">It is well settled that a tax deficiency is not an element of the offenses with which O\u2019Brocta was charged. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cohen, </em>617 F.2d 56, 58 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>449 U.S. 845, 101 S.Ct. 130, 66 L.Ed.2d 55 (1980); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>558 F.2d 744, 746 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert, denied, </em>434 U.S. 1065, 98 S.Ct. 1241, 55 L.Ed.2d 766 (1978). As these cases reveal, evidence of tax liability is generally inadmissible in prosecutions under I.R.C. \u00a7 7206, and a trial judge is certainly correct in taking care that a jury does not misperceive a charge of false reporting as an allegation of tax evasion. Moreover, as the district court repeatedly emphasized, the sole issue at trial was O'Brocta\u2019s state of mind when he helped prepare or signed the incorrect tax returns. If the returns were submitted in good faith, the defendant would be entitled to an acquittal on the charges specified in the indictment, whether or not his tax liability had been correctly computed. Conversely, if the defendant knowingly and willfully filed incorrect returns in violation of a legal duty, he would be guilty of the offenses charged, again regardless of the tax consequences of the inaccurate information. Particularly since defense counsel was permitted to make the somewhat questionable point about the effect of dual underreporting on tax liability,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we can perceive no error in the trial judge\u2019s decision to limit testimony on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">O\u2019Brocta also asserts that he was not allowed to testify fully that he had not converted the unreported gross receipts to his personal use and that he was not permitted to question Agent Busse about the government\u2019s efforts to locate these receipts. During direct examination, O\u2019Broc-ta did testify at length about his spartan lifestyle.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court properly terminated this testimony after the prosecution objected on the grounds of irrelevance and repetitiveness. The questions to Agent Busse as to the government\u2019s failure to locate the unreported funds were likewise irrelevant to O\u2019Brocta\u2019s defense because they only peripherally bore on his state of mind in filing an incorrect tax statement and had the potential of confusing the members of the jury into thinking that the case before them turned on tax evasion. We can find no error in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Count I of the indictment charges O\u2019Brocta with conspiring with several other defendants to defraud the United States by impeding the IRS\u2019 efforts to ascertain and assess revenue through a scheme designed to conceal \u201cthe true nature and correct amounts of monies paid by Penn Iron ... for the purchase of scrapmetals.\u201d O\u2019Brocta claims that the conspiracy conviction must fall because the government has not proven that the IRS was impeded by the cash payment scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">O\u2019Brocta insists that the Internal Revenue agents who prepared the case against him were not impeded by the checks drawn to the order of fictitious payees. By examining those checks and comparing them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>with invoices Penn Iron regularly kept as part of its business records, the agents were indeed able to identify with apparently relative ease those sellers of scrap metal paid by means of the check cashing scheme. But to say that a fruitful investigation absolves those who participated in the scheme is equivalent to saying that a conspiracy must be successful before it becomes illegal. The illegality of a conspiratorial agreement, however, does not depend on the conspirators\u2019 achieving their end; even the objective impossibility of attaining the goals of a conspiracy is irrelevant to the guilt of those who conspire. <em>See United States v. Jannotti, </em>673 F.2d 578, 591 (3d Cir.1982) (en banc), <em>cert, denied, </em>457 U.S. 1106, 102 S.Ct. 2906, 73 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1982).

Majority op. at 266. The court refuses to \u201cendorse the judge\u2019s use of the word \u2018spurious,\u2019 \u201d which it labels \u201cill-advised,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 271, but holds that the use of such word does not constitute reversible error. The majority adds that defendant did not adequately preserve the entire issue for appeal, when he failed to object to the curative instruction given by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 271-272.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">In arriving at the conclusion that the trial judge did not deprive defendant of his right to a trial by jury by describing the sole defense asserted as \u201cspurious,\u201d the majority acknowledges that, while courts may comment on the evidence adduced at trial, their discretion in doing so is not unlimited, especially in light of the great influence they have with the jury. <em>Quer-cia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 470-72, 53 S.Ct. 698, 699-700, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933). The Court recognizes that \u201c[tjhere is no bright line separating remarks that are appropriate from remarks that may unduly influence a jury,\u201d and establishes a four-pronged balancing test, or \u201csliding scale approach\u201d to assess the propriety of such comments. Majority at 268. Thus, the materiality of the judicial comment, its emphatic or overbearing nature, the efficacy of any curative instruction and the prejudicial effect of the comment in light of the jury charge as a whole are to be balanced one against the other: \u201c[t]he stronger the prejudicial effect of a statement is, the stronger must be the mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">For the most part, the test set forth by the majority clearly and accurately restates the law as previously formulated by this Court. Indeed, the first three prongs of the analysis are derived directly from the Court\u2019s recent discussion of this issue in <em>United States v. Anton, </em>597 F.2d 371, 375 (3d Cir.1979), quoting <em>United States v. Gaines, </em>450 F.2d 186, 189 (3d Cir.1971), <em>cert, denied, </em>405 U.S. 927, 92 S.Ct. 978, 30 L.Ed.2d 801 (1972). It is the fourth prong of the test here enunciated that is troubling, not so much in its formulation as in its application by the majority. In the abstract, there is no question but that the reviewing court should assess \u201cthe prejudicial effect of the comments in light of the jury instruction as a whole.\u201d Majority at 269. However, the majority here utilizes this common-sense notion to find that, in light of the correctness of the remainder of the trial judge\u2019s charge, the court\u2019s comments cannot be found to be reversible error. Indeed, both in its rendition of the facts and its legal analysis, the majority gives great weight to the fact that, other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>than the comment here at issue, the district court\u2019s instructions were correct. <em>Id. </em>at 266-268. This is a conclusion with which I agree. However the accuracy of the charge on the law is essentially irrelevant to the issue of the appropriateness of judicial commentary on the evidence. Indeed, were the instructions incorrect, then they would provide an independent basis for reversal and eviscerate the need for this inquiry; it is their very correctness that requires the appellate court to examine the problem created by judicial comment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question that must be asked is not the extent to which the charge as a whole was wrong but whether in commenting upon the evidence the trial court exercised appropriate restraint in light of the materiality of the evidence addressed, and gave an effective curative instruction, assuring the jury that it was not bound by the court\u2019s factual conclusions. That the remainder of the charge was correct should begin, rather than end the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">However, having established a standard of review, the majority then proceeds to misapply it, as to each of the four prongs set forth. First, the majority distinguishes the instant matter from <em>Gaines, </em>in which, it says, \u201cthe judge\u2019s remarks went to the core of the defense.\u201d In so doing, the majority speculates that \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s comment on the effect of the underreport-ing might well have been intended merely to alert the jury that [the argument that there were no actual tax consequences of defendant\u2019s actions] was not particularly relevant to the charge against O\u2019Brocta.\u201d Majority at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The majority\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s comments did not go to the core of the defense is utterly without merit. In fact, the trial court\u2019s charge disparaged defendant\u2019s <em>sole </em>defense, that he believed that the effect of underreporting certain income was, in light of what he claimed to be on equal underreporting of certain expenditures, not illegal, since there was to be no effect on his tax bill. Defendant thus claimed that he lacked the <em>mens rea </em>required for a criminal conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206. <em>See generally United States v. Pomponio, </em>429 U.S. 10, 12, 97 S.Ct. 22, 23-24, 50 L.Ed.2d 12 (1976); <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>412 U.S. 346, 360-61, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 2017-18, 36 L.Ed.2d 941 (1973) (the <em>mens rea </em>requirement \u201cimplements the pervasive intent of Congress to construct penalties that separate the purposeful tax violator from the well-meaning, but easily confused, mass of taxpayers\u201d). The district court, while charging this <em>mens rea </em>requirement properly, then stated in no uncertain terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">There has been an admission here that gross expenditures were also falsely reported and an argument made that they should cancel each other out, and that is spurious of course, in that it omits the consideration of inventory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The effect of this statement on defendant\u2019s case must have been devastating: the trial court judge appeared to be saying to the jury that he regarded defendant\u2019s argument, and with it, his whole defense, as \u201cspurious.\u201d In so doing, he also expressed his opinion as to defendant\u2019s credibility, for such defense had been established primarily by defendant\u2019s own testimony. App. at 408-413. And he did so by injecting into the case an issue not otherwise charged, explained, or presented to the jury by ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ther party, precisely as in <em>Quercia. </em>289 U.S. at 471-72, 53 S.Ct. at 699-700. The court thus demolished defendant\u2019s sole defense, destroyed his credibility and did so in a manner unsusceptible of review by a jury unfamiliar with the basis of the court\u2019s conclusion. While it is true, as the majority suggests, that the charge may have been intended to let the jury know that, in fact, understating both gross receipts and cost of goods sold does not create a correct tax return,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is equally true that the jury may have interpreted the court\u2019s comment to mean that <em>as a matter of law, </em>the sole defense asserted was \u201cspurious.\u201d At the very least, the charge indicated in the clearest of terms the judge\u2019s skepticism of defendant\u2019s case. To say, as the majority does, that it did not involve a material aspect of the case is to cast aside all of what defendant was attempting to prove. Furthermore, to the extent that the court\u2019s comment bore on defendant\u2019s credibility, upon which any good faith defense must rest, it also improperly intruded on the jury\u2019s province. <em>Anton, supra, </em>597 F.2d at 374-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Second, the majority concludes that the court\u2019s statement was not strong enough to warrant reversal. If this is true, it is hard to imagine what would be strong enough. \u201cSpurious\u201d is defined as \u201coutwardly similar or corresponding to something without having its genuine qualities: false, counterfeit,\u201d \u201cfaulty in reasoning or conclusion: illogical, specious,\u201d or \u201cirrelevantly inapplicable: lacking correspondence to reality: vaguely ambiguous: pseudo.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged </em>at 2212 (1976), To label one\u2019s sole defense, or the facts relied upon by defendant which comprised such defense, false, fraudulent, specious or lacking correspondence to reality is a strong statement indeed, not very different in vehemence or, ultimately, in content from the statement that \u201c[t]he court\u2014 that is, the trial judge \u2014 regarding [defendant] as devoid of credibility, and I do not believe [him] absolutely and in all respects\u201d found to constitute reversible error in <em>Anton, </em>597 F.2d at 372-73. Here too the language was strong, attacking the gravamen of the defense asserted, and impugning defendant\u2019s credibility, without such qualifying statement as had followed in <em>Anton</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is a statement which did not question a particular assertion of defendant, as in <em>United States v. Blair, </em>456 F.2d 514, 519 (3d Cir.1972), for defendant here did not assert that, in fact, receipts and costs of goods sold cancel each other out. Rather, the trial court\u2019s statement denigrated defendant\u2019s <em>belief </em>that such cancel-ling out occurs, the sole issue before the jury. Such \u201cemphatic and overbearing\u201d remarks must be viewed as an intrusion upon defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial, and as such, reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Nor was the curative instruction given by the district court adequate to dissipate the taint created by the court\u2019s prior comment. To the contrary, that instruction re-emphasized that the spuriousness of defendant\u2019s defense was the court\u2019s \u201cconclusion\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">With respect to the court\u2019s comment on whether or not the receipts of money and expenditures of money and cash \u2014 I may have used the word \u201cspurious.\u201d That is solely a conclusion that the court drew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa9\">App. at 559. The court went on to re-state such conclusion in the context of re-establishing the jury\u2019s role as factfinder.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">The opinion of the court that there is inventory is solely the opinion of the court and does not bind the jury in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>way as to whether or not that would be a logical contention to make, that those two cancel each other out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">App. at 560. Hence, the judge, while not limiting himself to the \u201cabstract instructions regarding the jury\u2019s role as factfinder\u201d found insufficient in <em>Anton, supra, </em>597 F.2d at 375, gave a curative instruction which re-stated his \u201copinion\u201d that defendant\u2019s good faith belief did not constitute \u201ca logical contention to maks.\u201d In so doing, the court made less than vigorous efforts to remind the jurors that the facts were theirs to find: it state! only that the court\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d and \u201cconclusion\u201d did not \u201cbind the jury in any way,\u201d a far weaker formulation than that itilized in <em>Blair, </em>where the court reminded the jury \u201cyou use your judgment, because yours prevails, not mine ... that is one of the facts you must determine ... no matter what I think, it is what you think that prevails.\u201d 456 F.2d at 519. Added emphasis and repetition in <em>Blair </em>may well have outweighed the district court\u2019s opinion expressed earlier, and reiterated after objection. Here, no such emphasis or repetition drove this point home to the jury, and the majority thus errs in describing the curative instruction given as \u201csimilar to one which the court found to be sufficient in <em>Blair.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Finally, the correctness of the remainder of the charge does not excuse the district court\u2019s single erroneous instruction where, as here, that instruction undermines all that came before and after it. This is especially so where the judge\u2019s reminders to the jury that they were to find facts, both regarding willfulness and otherwise, were both fewer than in a case such as Gaines,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and weaker than in the other cases in which judicial comments have been addressed by this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the Court nonetheless to find that the district court neutralized its highly prejudicial statement by virtue of sparse, lackluster and unenthusiastic admonitions, allows courts greater control over jury verdicts and paves the way for deeper inroads into the right to trial by jury than this Court has ever before allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Moreover, in purporting to examine the judge\u2019s comment in context, the majority fails to account for the larger context out of which the jury charge, as a whole, grew. The record here reveals a trial judge who, throughout the trial, viewed defendant\u2019s case with a jaundiced eye. Originally unaware of the defense being presented, App. at 165-66, the court interpreted the defense narrowly throughout, often in the presence of the jury, <em>(e.g., </em>App. at 275), and as late as the last day of trial, stated that the intent at issue was \u201cto make a false report, knowing the law requires it.\u2019 App. at 461.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While I agree with the majority that the district court\u2019s rulings as to the relevancy of evidence did not constitute an abuse of the broad discretion accorded a trial judge by Federal Rule of Evidence 403, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Clifford, </em>704 F.2d 86, 89 (3d Cir.1983), nor are they commendable in the context of a clear pattern of skepticism toward defendant\u2019s case. Finally, it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>be noted that the district court did not allow counsel an opportunity to review, or object to, much of the charge to be given prior to such instructions, which were to be adaptations of the government\u2019s proposed charges, put in the court\u2019s own language (481a-484a). Of course, no prior mention was made of the court\u2019s intention to label defendant\u2019s defense as \u201cspurious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Court today not only seeks to expand the parameters of permissible judicial behavior, moving away from a sensible trend against the type of judicial commentary here allowed, and thus to contract the constitutional jury trial right guaranteed to all criminal defendants, but it does so, in part, by the needless formalism of holding that defendant did not properly preserve the issue for appeal. This conclusion is also without basis. After the district court had completed its jury instructions, counsel for defendant objected clearly and articulately to the instruction given. App. at 556. This satisfies the requirement imposed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30. The majority, however, states that defendant did not properly preserve his right to object to the curative instruction as well by failing to object to that instruction after it was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">This Court, in seeking to balance the salutary purposes that underlie Rule 30, and the potential for its degeneration into \u201ca trap for the wary, a trap reminiscent of the senseless technicalities that characterized common law procedural systems <em>...\u201d </em>has never before required that a party object to both a jury instruction and to the curative instruction that follows. <em>See United States v. Currens, </em>290 F.2d 751, 758-59 (3d Cir.1961) (failure to object to supplemental charge did not insulate issue from appeal). To so require where, as here, the issues raised by the two sets of instructions are not only inextricably intertwined but, under the majority\u2019s formulation, necessary parts of the same analysis, is to place unnecessary hurdles in the way of the litigant who seeks resolution of what is essentially one problem. Indeed, the majority here proposes a delicate balancing test, in which prejudice is to be weighed against the efficacy of a curative instruction, but then mandates that in order to invoke that test in its entirety, a defendant must object not once by twice. The unfairness of such a result is highlighted here, where the district court failed even to give counsel an opportunity to object to the supplemental charge, <em>see </em>App. at 560, a charge which was the culmination of a series of events to which counsel had unequivocally objected. Had he objected yet one more time, there is little reason to believe that the trial court would have corrected its error, or even had been able to do so. Moreover, it should be noted that the Court here reaches out to bar defendant\u2019s appeal, although the issue was never raised by the government, which briefed and argued this issue as though properly preserved <em>in toto. </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief at 21-22. <em>See Currens, supra, </em>290 F.2d at 760-61. The Court thus goes out of its way to reach a result not only discordant with its previous caselaw, but predicated upon a position never asserted by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">This is, after all, a case in which a trial court judge properly charged the jury as to a perfectly valid defense raised by a defendant, and then undermined that charge by telling the jury that, based upon his own theory of the case, that defense was spurious. That he told the jury a few times that the decision was theirs to make \u2014 once while reiterating that the spuriousness of the defense was his \u201cconclusion\u201d and \u201copinion\u201d \u2014 did not dilute the effect of his earlier statements: that, in effect, he thought defendant was guilty and that defendant\u2019s testimony could not be believed. The majority here ignores reality in suggesting that the jury was nonetheless free to make its own, independent decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">For a court thus to ridicule the sole defense asserted and reiterate its view after appropriate objection is to deny defendant his right to a fair trial by jury. Recognizing that it is not wholly inappropriate for courts to comment on the evidence adduced at trial, the majority here abandons the limiting principles that have previously been imposed on this practice by this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>and goes well beyond its holdings in prior cases regarding the propriety of judicial comment on the evidence in a criminal trial. In so doing, the Court not only fails to recognize the inherent influence that such comments may have on jury deliberations, but also disregards the stringent requirement that a trial judge not have \u201cabandoned his proper role\u201d and \u201creached the point where \u2018it appears clear to the jury that the court believed the accused is guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. </em>Beaty, 722 F.2d 1090, 1093 (3d Cir.1983) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Even those precedents which permit a judge to express his or her views on credibility and suggest that a jury properly instructed can or will ignore such comments from the court border on fantasy. But to conclude that based upon some boilerplate instructions, a jury can ignore the elevated, robed, experienced jurist who has stated that he believes the defense to be without factual or legal basis or both is to close our eyes to reality and transform a courtroom into a land of make believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">. The majority cites <em>United States v. Gaines, supra, </em>450 F.2d at 190, for the proposition that \"the reviewing court must assess the prejudicial effect of the comments in light of the jury instructions as a whole.\" <em>Gaines </em>states simply that a particular comment was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion \"viewed in light of [the] complete charge.\" <em>Id. </em>However, the <em>Gaines </em>Court apparently referred not to the substantive correctness of the legal charge there propounded to the jury, which is never discussed, but to the immediate context of the judge\u2019s remarks, 450 F.2d at 188-89, as well as his repeated instructions to the jury as to their role as sole determiners of credibility and fact. <em>Id. </em>at 190-91 and n. 9. Here, the majority cannot and does not rest its conclusion on such a limited context, but on the charge as a whole, which it finds to be correct, particularly as to willfulness. Such correctness can be, and was, undermined by the trial court\u2019s comments, which were neither properly restrained, nor effectively neutralized, as in <em>Gaines.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">. The judge may have been correct that, under Internal Revenue Service regulations, cost of goods sold, as it is used in arriving at an income amount, must take inventory into account. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. 1.471-1. However, to state that the idea that cost of goods sole and income should cancel each other out is \"spurious\" insults defendant\u2019s belief that they did and thereby undermines his entire defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-12\">. That qualifier, that \"I do not believe [the defendant] absolutely and in all respects\" was found not to constitute reversible error in <em>United States v. Kravitz, </em>281 F.2d 581, 584-85 and n. 4 (3d Cir.1960), cited in <em>Anton, supra, </em>597 F.2d at 373.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\">. In <em>Gaines, </em>the district court \"repeatedly\" told the jury that it was the finder of facts. Such instruction was only given three times in this case, including the curative instruction. App. at 525, 548, 560.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">. Here, immediately following the comment here at issue, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">It is for you, the jury, to determine from all the facts, all of the surrounding circumstances, whether the defendant, with respect to the three charges, acted willfully, in the sense that he knew what he was doing was contrary to law, and he knew that the statements were false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">App. at 548-49. This instruction is far less emphatic than those approved by the court in <em>Gaines, </em>450 F.2d at 188-89, and <em>Blair, </em>456 F.2d at 519, as to the principle that it is the jury\u2019s and not the court's role to find the facts, especially those facts upon which the court had just commented. Indeed, it is not even as effective as that found insufficient in <em>Anton, </em>where the district court had reminded the members of the jury that they were the <em>\u201csole </em>judges of credibility\u201d (emphasis supplied), that his comments were \u201conly the expression of [his] opinion,\u201d and that \u201cat all times ... you, as jurors, are at liberty to disregard all comments of the court in arriving at your own findings as to the facts.\u201d 597 F.2d at 373.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b366-13\">. <em>See also </em>App. at 487 (THE COURT: I really enjoyed [O\u2019Brocta\u2019s] last remark____ We were brought up to be honest.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
