These rods thus became subject to the imposition of an antidumping duty in an amount equal to the difference between the foreign market value and the purchase price for such rods, pursuant to the Anti-dumping Act of 1921, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">The Antidumping Act of 1921 was subsequently replaced, effective January 1,1980, by a new antidumping law enacted as part of Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Title I of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, Pub.L. 96-39, 93 Stat. 144, 146-193. Section 106 of the new Act provided that \u201cfindings in effect on the effective date of this Act ... shall remain in effect, subject to review under [the new] section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930\u201d (providing for periodic reviews). 93 Stat. 193. In addition, the responsibility for administering the antidumping law and acting as the \u201cadministering authority\u201d under section 751 (codified at 19 U.S.C.,\u00a7 1675) was transferred from the Treasury Department to the Secretary of Commerce, effective January 2, 1980. At Commerce, the anti-dumping law\u2019s administration was delegated to the ITA.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\">Final results of the ITA\u2019s first administrative periodic review under section 751(a), 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a), with regard to stainless steel wire rods from France, were published on November 9, 1981, covering January 1974 through June 1980. The final results of this review were not challenged in court, although the domestic manufacturers apparently did raise in a prehearing brief the question now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-18\">Notice of the preliminary results of the second section 751 periodic review with regard to the rods was published on August 23,1982 for the period July 1,1980 through June 30, 1981. 46 Fed.Reg. 55297 (1982). The dispute leading to this appeal began during the administrative review proceeding when the appellees, domestic manufacturers of stainless steel wire rods, contended that the ITA was required under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a), <em>supra </em>note 2, to verify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the information supplied to it during the review by Ugine Glaciers, the foreign manufacturer, and Intsel Corporation, the domestic importer. Counsel for both Ugine Glaciers and Intsel represented that his clients were available for verification. Notice of the final results of this second administrative review were published on January 21, 1983, 48 Fed.Reg. 2808 (1983); in that notice the ITA responded as follows to appellees\u2019 contention concerning verification: <em>\u201cDepartment Position: </em>In Section 751 administrative reviews verification by the Department is discretionary.. \u2022.. [Citation omitted.] We have determined that verification was not required for this review.\u201d 48 Fed.Reg. at 2808-2809 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The domestic manufacturers appealed to the CIT the ITA\u2019s refusal to verify, raising three grounds, only two of which now remain in contention <em>(see </em>note 1, supra): (1) the statute requires verification in all section 751 reviews, and (2) even if verification in section 751 reviews is discretionary, refusal to verify in this case (in which at least eight years had passed since the last verification) was an abuse of discretion. On cross-motions for judgment upon the administrative record, Judge Maletz of the CIT held, as a matter of law, that the ITA is required by statute under section 1677e(a), <em>supra, </em>to verify information upon which assessment of antidumping duties is based (including periodic reassessments), and remanded the case for such verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a), <em>supra, </em>states (with an exception not relevant here) that \u201cthe administering authority shall verify all information relied upon in making a final determination in an investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant contends that the CIT erred in holding that this provision requires such verification in section 751 periodic reviews of outstanding antidumping or countervailing duty orders under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a). It maintains that \u201ca final determination in an investigation\u201d occurs only in what appellant calls \u201cthe investigative phase\u201d of an administrative antidumping or countervailing duty \u201cproceeding,\u201d not in \u201cthe assessment phase\u201d of a proceeding in which section 751 periodic reviews occur. Under this theory, the only required verification is in the investigative phase, and any other verification is discretionary with the administering authority. More particularly, appellant maintains that the CIT (1) misconstrued the statutory language; (2) ignored some parts and misconstrued other parts of the legislative history; and (3) failed to follow the principle that, in the absence of statutorily imposed procedures, courts should defer to the judgment of administrative agencies in deciding how best to carry out their duties. In addition, appellant argues that the ITA committed no abuse of its discretion in this case. Because we agree with the CIT that the statute, informed and supported by the legislative history and purpose, requires verification in periodic reviews, we do not reach appellant\u2019s arguments concerning the deference to be given agencies in the absence of statutory requirements, or the issue of abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">We start with a summary of the statutory requirements for antidumping duty cases under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. As noted above, the 1979 Act added Title VII to the Tariff Act of 1970, as amended. Title VII contains new anti-dumping and countervailing duty provisions (sections 701-778 of the Tariff Act of 1930, codified at 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1671-1677g), including a new section 751, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675. Section 751 or section 1675<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires annual reviews of outstanding anti-dumping and countervailing duty findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Because this case involves the assessment of antidumping duties, we focus on the statutory requirements as they pertain to those duties. However, the review provisions at issue apply to administrative reviews of countervailing duty orders as well as antidumping duty orders. It is understood by all parties, as it was by the CIT, that a holding requiring verification in periodic reviews will cover both kinds of cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Both parties to this action agree that antidumping inquiries, in those cases in which duties are actually assessed, are composed of two phases: (1) an initial investigatory phase, the less-than-fair-value phase in which it is decided whether impermissible dumping occurred, and (2) the assessment phase, in which sales at less than foreign market value are actually assessed special antidumping duties. A less-than-fair-value investigation may be commenced either by the filing of a petition by an interested party on behalf of the domestic industry that alleges injury because of less-than-fair-value sales, or on the initiative of the ITA, the administering authority. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1673a(a), 1673a(b). The authority must then, within strict time limits (usually within 160 days of the petition\u2019s filing), make a preliminary determination concerning less-than-fair-value sales. If the determination is affirmative, liquidation of entries of the imports will be suspended, beginning with the date of publication of the preliminary determination in the <em>Federal Register. </em>(The statute also outlines circumstances in which suspension of liquidation could be made retroactive for 90 days. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673b(e)). In addition to liquidation of entries, an affirmative preliminary determination requires importers to post a cash deposit, bond or other security equal to the <em>estimated </em>amount by which the foreign market value exceeds the United States price. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673b(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The ITA must then (within 75 days of the preliminary determination, in the normal case) make a final determination of whether imports are being sold at less than fair value. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(l). In this case the Government contends that the verification requirement, <em>supra, </em>which states that \u201cthe administering authority [ITA] shall verify all information relied upon in making a final determination in an investigation\u201d, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a), refers only to the making of this final determination just described, and not to any of the later determinations in which the actual amounts of duty \u2014 rather than estimates \u2014 are assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">The procedure for actual assessment of duties is as follows: If the ITA\u2019s determination is affirmative, and a final injury determination is made by the United States International Trade Commission (Commission), the IT\u00c1 must issue an antidumping duty order. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(2). Specifically, within seven days after being notified by the Commission of its injury determination the ITA publishes an antidumping duty order which: (1) includes a description of the class or kind of merchandise to which it applies, (2) requires the <em>deposit </em>of <em>estimated </em>antidumping duties pending liquidation of entries of merchandise, and (3) requires the <em>assessment </em>of antidumping duties within 12 months, the period for which runs from different events depending on whether the merchandise in question was sold prior to importation into the United States. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673e(a). Although this provision does direct the actual assessment of antidumping duties, the time requirements are such that, as we understand them, the first actual assessment usually occurs at the time of the first annual administrative review under section 751 of the 1930 Act, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675 (the periodic review or administrative review) and is conducted in the same way.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">This assessment phase, leading to the determination of the actual amount of anti-dumping duties, takes place at least once annually under section 751 and requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>precise comparison of the United States price for the merchandise with the statutorily defined \u201cforeign market value\u201d. The result of this assessment determination is the first and succeeding determinations of actual liability for antidumping duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The Government maintains, as we have said, that no verification of information is required for the information relied upon in making a determination of antidumping (or countervailing) duty in the assessment phase, or in a periodic review, because \u2014 it claims \u2014 such a determination is not \u201ca final determination in an investigation\u201d under \u00a7 1677e(a). The Government would have us construe the term \u201cinvestigation\u201d in \u00a7 1677e(a) to cover only that portion of the statute which results in a determination of whether dumping has occurred, <em>i.e., </em>the so-called investigative phase. It maintains that the assessment or periodic review of duties involves neither a \u201cfinal determination\u201d nor is it part of \u201can investigation.\u201d As we shall show, this position is not required by the wording of the statute, and is inconsistent with the Act in light of its legislative history and purposes. These show that Congress did <em>not </em>provide, as appellant contends, that verification is only required of information relied upon in making a determination that a duty is to be assessed, but when the actual assessment of duty takes place, in the assessment or a periodic review, verification of information relied upon in making that determination is entirely discretionary with ITA. On the contrary, the statute, properly read, requires verification at both stages.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">First, the bare text of the statute is, at most for the Government\u2019s position, ambiguous in its use of the pertinent terms; in our view nothing in the language of the legislation strictly limits the use of the term \u201cinvestigation\u201d (appearing in \u00a7 1677e(a), <em>supra) </em>to the investigative phase of the inquiry. Rather, the text permits that term, in that provision, to cover both the investigative and the assessment phases of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">There is, to be sure, some uncertainty arising from the statute over the meanings of the terms \u201cinvestigation\u201d, \u201cproceeding\u201d, and \u201cfinal determination.\u201d The Government strongly maintains that \u201cinvestigation\u201d covers only the investigative phase described <em>supra, </em>while a \u201cproceeding\u201d encompasses both the investigative and assessment phases, and that the \u201cfinal determination\u201d occurs only at the end of the investigative phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">Indeed, the Commerce Department has made this proceeding/investigation distinction by so defining the terms in its regulations. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.11.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although this distinction has a certain attractiveness because it seems to do away with an otherwise troubling ambiguity over the meanings of the terms (as well as requires less work of the ITA), we find the distinction\u2014 and the regulations which embody it (insofar as that regulation applies to \u00a7 1677e(a)) \u2014contrary to the statute and Congressional purpose and intent, to the extent that they apply to the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">The truth is that neither term \u2014 \u201cinvestigation\u201d or \u201cproceeding\u201d \u2014 is expressly defined in the statute, and that the varied statutory uses of those terms do not support Commerce\u2019s rigid distinction between an \u201cinvestigation\u201d and a \u201cproceeding\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The first use of the term \u201cinvestigation\u201d in the antidumping duties portion of the statute occurs in section 1673a(a), the first subsection under the section titled \u201cProcedures for initiating an antidumping duty-investigation\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">(a) Initiation by administering authority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akz-dedup-0\">\u2014An <em>antidumping duty investigation </em>shall be commenced whenever the administering authority determines, from information available to it, that a <em>formal investigation </em>is warranted into the question of whether the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1673 of this title exist (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoj\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">This provision immediately confronts us with a possible ambiguity over the meaning of \u201cinvestigation,\u201d even before the term \u201cproceeding\u201d has been introduced. We could, on the one hand, distinguish between \u201can antidumping duty investigation\u201d and a \u201cformal investigation,\u201d the former referring to all activities which under the statute follow the commencement of such an \u201cinvestigation,\u201d including but not limited to a \u201cformal investigation,\u201d and the latter referring to that portion of an investigation that above we have called the investigative phase. This distinction would not be a strained use of the word \u201cinvestigation.\u201d The first phase of \u201can antidumping duty investigation\u201d would be a \u201cformal investigation\u201d into the question whether there was dumping. The second phase of \u201can antidumping duty investigation\u201d would be a formal investigation into the exact amount of duties to be assessed. That interpretation is, of course, consistent with the CIT\u2019s holding. On the other hand, we could, on the basis of this provision alone, say that there is no such distinction between \u201cantidumping duty investigation\u201d and \u201cformal investigation into the question ... \u201d, and that both phrases refer only to the investigative phase, as the Government argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Of course, we are neither aided, nor constrained, in our effort to find the proper meaning of the statutory terms by the fact that the usual description for the first part of an inquiry is \u201cthe investigative phase.\u201d There would be nothing unusual about the use of the bare statutory term \u201cinvestigation\u201d to cover activities involved in either, or both, the investigative and the assessment phases.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Very little help is provided by the next subsection in the statute, which introduces the term \u201cproceeding\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">(b) Initiation by petition.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-11\">(1) Petition requirements.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-12\">An antidumping <em>proceeding </em>shall be commenced whenever an interested party ... files a petition with the administering authority, on behalf of an industry which alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of the duty imposed by section 1673 of this title, and which is accompanied by information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting those allegations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aor-dedup-0\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673a(b)(l). (Emphasis added.) Contrasting this use of the term \u201cproceeding\u201d with \u201cinvestigation\u201d in the preceding subsection, we note that a \u201cproceeding\u201d is commenced by an \u201cinterested party\u201d by filing a petition while an \u201cinvestigation\u201d is commenced (under \u00a7 1673a(a), <em>supra) </em>by the administering authority \u201cfrom information available to it, that a formal investigation is warranted.\u201d However, that does not necessarily mean that an inquiry (for want of a better term) is called a \u201cproceeding\u201d when initiated by a petition and an \u201cinvestigation\u201d when initiated by the ITA itself. Under subsection (a) <em>supra, </em>the ITA commences an antidumping duty investigation whenever it determines \u201cfrom information available to it, that a formal investigation is warranted ____\u201d One source of such \u201cinformation\u201d is, of course, a petition from an \u201cinterested party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">If such a petition is filed, a \u201cproceeding\u201d is commenced, following which, under subsection (c), a determination must be made on the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-16\">(c) Petition determination.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-17\">Within 20 days after the date on which a petition is filed under subsection (b) of this section, the administering authority shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>(1) determine whether the petition alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1673 of this title and contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayq-dedup-1\">(2) if the determination is affirmative, commence an <em>investigation </em>to determine whether the class or kind of merchandise described in the petition is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than its fair value, and provide for the publication of notice of the determination in the Federal Register, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsGP\">(3) if the determination is negative, dismiss the petition, terminate the <em>proceeding, </em>notify the petitioner in writing of the reasons for the determination, and provide for the publication of notice of the determination m the Federal Regiser'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a4v-dedup-0\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673a(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AQP\">Thus, if the petition determination is affirmative, an \u201cinvestigation\u201d is commenced, but the statute has not shed any significant further light on possible limits to the use of that term. If the petition determination is negative, the \u201cproceeding\u201d is terminated under subsection (c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"A57\">Based on these provisions, a \u201cproceeding\u201d could conceivably refer only to that 20-day time period between the filing of a petition and a determination on the petition. If the determination is negative, the proceeding is terminated. If it is affirmative, an \u201cinvestigation\u201d is commenced. In those latter cases, perhaps the \u201cproceeding\u201d is merged into an \u201cinvestigation,\u201d and the terms become interchangeable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ah6W\">However, a \u201cproceeding\u201d is not commenced under the bare terms of the statute in those instances when the administering authority commences an antidumping duty investigation on its own and the statute does not call for the use of the term \u201cproceeding\u201d for the subsequent investigations in those cases. Thus, under the facial text, considered alone, some proceedings result in and perhaps become coterminous with an investigation, but not all investigations re-suit from proceedings. As such, the use of \u201cproceeding\u201d by both parties to cover the investigative and assessment phases is, like the use of \u201cinvestigative and assessment phases,\u201d a conventional and helpful usage not required by the language of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"A9f\">The bottom line is, of course, that the literal words of the statute by no means require the strict proceeding/investigation distinction urged upon us by the Government, nor are the proper meanings of \u201cinvestigation\u201d or \u201cproceeding\u201d always clear from the statutory text. The legislative words are quite ambiguous and certainly permit the CIT\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"A15\">Thg game statut uncertainty exists as to ^ meaning of Kf\u00a1nal determination\u201d in \u00a7 1667e, <em>supra. </em>That provision requires the verification of information relied upon in making a \u201cfinal determination\u201d in an \u201cinvestigation\u201d. As with \u201cinvestigation,\u201d the statute does not define \u201cfinal determination.\u201d The Commerce Department\u2019s regulation states simply that \u201c[a] \u2018determination\u2019 is an official decision in the course of a proceeding.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.11(c). In <em>i-S-et, </em>the administering authority is required to make \u201cdeterminations\u201d of various kinds throughout the statute. Both the ITA and the Commission must make \u201cfinal determinations\u201d concerning the existence of dumping under section 1673d, which, if affirmative, lead to the issuance and publication of an antidumping duty order, However, administrative reviews require the \u201cDetermination of antidumping duties\u201d under section 1675(a)(2) (section 751 of the Act&gt; which- although lacking the adjective \"final\u201d&gt; are in fact n0 less fmal .Wlth re\u00aeard to duties to be paid until the next Perlodlc review-</p>\n<p id=\"ARN\">The verification provision, furthermore, refers to <em>\u201ca </em>final determination in <em>an </em>investigation\u201d (emphasis added), an implication being that there may be more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>of either. Under the Government\u2019s argument, there can be only one investigation in a proceeding, and one final determination. We think that that type of limitation is not apparent from the facial language of the statute. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 1677f, \u201cAccess to information,\u201d note 10, <em>supra, </em>which clearly encompasses several \u201cinvestigations\u201d and several \u201cfinal determinations.\u201d Congress could have specified, but did not, that the final.determination in the verification provision refers only to a final determination in an initial, less-than-fair-value, investigation. Such a limit was placed on the final determination mentioned in' a provision dealing with investigation hearings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">The administering authority and the Commission shall each hold a hearing in the course of an investigation upon the request of any party to the investigation before making a final determination under section 1671d or 1673d of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkrN\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677c(a). A similar restriction was not placed on the \u201cfinal determination\u201d in the verification provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The sum of it is that, on the face of the statute, the Government\u2019s position is not entirely implausible, but neither is it required. The opposing view is at least as tenable. There is therefore no \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute on its face. Although we believe the CIT\u2019s position to be somewhat the better one on the text of the statute alone, we turn to the legislative history and purposes and find there more telling support for the position that Congress intended a verification requirement in periodic review determinations of duty assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The Government maintains that it did not simply devise on its own a distinction between an investigation and a proceeding in Commerce\u2019s regulations, but that it merely implemented Congressional intent, as evidenced by S.Rep. No. 96-249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 62 (1979), <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 381, 448:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">The term \u201cinvestigation\u201d applies to that activity which begins when the authority makes an affirmative determination under section 732(a) or 732(c) [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673b, \u00a7 1673c, or \u00a7 1673d], as the case may be. The term \u201cproceeding\u201d applies to that activity which begins when a petition is filed under section 732(b) [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673a(b) ] and ends upon the final disposition of the case, up to revocation of an antidumping duty order, if 'any, under section 732, 733, 734, 735, or 751 [19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1673a, 1673b, 1673c, 1673d, or 1675], as the case may be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-11\"><em>See also </em>S.Rep.

More specifically, discussions of the verification requirement in both the Senate and House Reports demonstrate that Congress intended the verification requirement to apply to a periodic review determination as well as to a final determination which leads to the issuance of a countervailing or an anti-dumping duty order. Neither house\u2019s discussion of the verification provision indicates any limitation to the investigative phase. The Senate Report\u2019s discussion of the reason for the verification provision refers to verification of information relied upon in <em>proceedings </em>which, under the Government\u2019s own argument, means the entire inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\">Numerous complaints have been made regarding the current practices on verification of information submitted to the Department of the Treasury in antidump-ing and countervailing duty <em>proceedings, </em>particularly information submitted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>foreign governments. Section 776 <em>requires vertification [sic] by the administering authority of all information relied upon, </em>including governmental submissions. If such information cannot be verified, [Commerce] must then use the best information available in making its determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">S.Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 98, <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 381, 484 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Similarly, the House Report fails to limit the verification requirement to only one phase of an inquiry, emphasizing the importance of using current information in making determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">Section 776 requires that <em>all </em>information relied upon by the Authority in making a final determination regarding either subsidized or less-than-fair-value imports must be verified unless, with respect to an antidumping <em>proceeding, </em>verification is waived under the procedure for a rapid preliminary determination .... The Committee intends that the Authority and the ITC should <em>always </em>use the most up-to-date information available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">H.R.Rep. No. 96-317, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 77 (1979) (emphasis added). It is particularly difficult, as the Government would have us do, to restrict the concept of \u201calways\u201d to only one part of the authority\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">In addition, both the Senate and House Reports specify that a section 751 periodic review comprises the duty assessment phase of an antidumping duty <em>investigation, </em>an acknowledgement that an investigation comprises more than just the less-than-fair-value phase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">(1) S.Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 80-81 (1979), <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 381, 466-67:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\"><em>Reason for the provision </em>[section 751]: \u2014This provision expedites the administration of the assessment phase of anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">(2) H.R.Rep. No. 317, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 72 (1979):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\">This provision expedites the administration of the assessment phase of anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations while providing a greater role for domestic interested parties and introducing more procedural safeguards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">Thus the requirement of verification of information relied upon in the periodic review final determination fits directly with the expressed Congressional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">The result is that, regardless of whether some investigation/proceeding distinction was otherwise intended by Congress, a review of the history demonstrates to us that Congress intended no limitation on the verification requirement to the investigative phase of the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">The legislative history also supports a broad definition of \u201cfinal determination\u201d to cover several different kinds of determinations, including periodic review determinations of the specific amount of antidumping and countervailing duties to be imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2M\">Subsection (a)(2) of section 516A would render <em>certain final determinations </em>subject to review in the Customs Court at the instance of any \u201cinterested party\u201d ____ These <em>final determinations </em>would be confined to: (1) final determinations regarding the imposition of a countervailing or antidumping duty; (2) <em>periodic determination of the amount of countervailing or antidumping duties to be imposed; </em>(3) determinations to suspend antidumping or countervailing duty investigations as the result of an agreement eliminating the injurious effects caused by the subsidies or sales at less than fair value; (4) determinations by the International Trade Commission resulting from the review of an agreement to eliminate the injurious effect of subsidized imports of sales at less than fair value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-19\">S.Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 247 (1979), <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 381, 633 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>This is enough to show that the statute does not have to be read to exclude periodic review determinations from the concept of <em>\u201ca </em>final determination\u201d in the verification provision, \u00a7 1677e(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Not only does the legislative history (as we have just spelled out) support the application of the verification provision to assessment and periodic reviews, but also it is unquestioned that need for verification at that periodic review or assessment stage is at least as great as in the prior investigative phase when ITA is merely called upon to decide in general whether dumping occurred, and no more than an <em>estimate </em>of anticipated dumping duties need be made to determine the proper deposit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commerce Department has itself recognized that foreign respondents in section 751 reviews \u201chave incentive to minimize in the submissions the magnitude of their dumping or subsidization.\u201d <em>Michelin </em>X\u2014 <em>Radial Steel Belted Tires from Canada, </em>46 Fed.Reg. 48,737, 48,739 (1981).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Facing the actual payment of duties for the first time in the assessment phase, there is an incentive for foreign respondents to present inaccurate or unreliable data. In holding that Congress intended verification of information submitted in this assessment phase, we agree with the CIT that \u201cit makes little sense to require detailed verification of all information submitted by foreign manufacturers during the less-than-fair-value investigation stage, but not to likewise require such verification when the agency actually assesses antidumping duties.\u201d 575 F.Supp. at 1284. In these circumstances, we believe that Congress chose protection for the domestic industry over administrative convenience for the Commerce Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">The government urges that verification could not have been required in all periodic reviews because the agency lacks the resources for so much verification. The answer is that the requirement of substantial additional resources for enforcement of the new provisions of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, a central part of which is the assessment of duties, was specifically anticipated by the House Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">The Committee feels very strongly that both the countervailing and anti-dumping duty laws have been inadequately enforced in the past, including the lack of resources devoted to this important area of law. The provisions of this bill are intended to remedy this situation ____ It is the Committee\u2019s understanding that the Executive branch will request appropriations for the purpose of making substantial increases in personnel assigned to the administration of the antidumping and countervailing laws. The Committee cannot emphasize too strongly the need for adequate resources and its expectation that they will be provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">H.R.Rep. No. 317, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 49 (1979).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">Analysis of the statute in light of its text, legislative history and purpose leads us to conclude that Commerce has not followed the statutory mandate to verify all information relied upon in periodic review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>determinations. \u201cAlthough an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute under which it operates is entitled to some deference, \u2018this deference is constrained by our obligation to honor the clear meaning of a statute, as revealed by its language, purpose, and history\u2019 \u201d. <em>Southern Community College v.
