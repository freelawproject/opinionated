Petitioner claimed that time-in-grade restrictions had been improperly applied to him, resulting in the Army\u2019s refusal to consider him for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The MSPB dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, citing <em>Hellman v. OPM, </em>9 M.S.P.B. 839 (1982), which held that the validity of time-in-grade restrictions is not an appealable matter because the application of the restrictions does not constitute an \u201cemployment practice\u201d within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.101.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this court, in a split decision of the panel, held that the Board had read the definition of \u201cemployment practices\u201d too narrowly and that \u201can examination of the language and structure of the relevant provisions [of the regulations]\u201d compels an opposite conclusion. The dissent was directed to the question which is resolved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">On remand, the Board held, <em>inter alia, </em>that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.104(a), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">A candidate who believes that an employment practice <em>which was applied to him or her by the Office of Personnel Management </em>violates a basic requirement in \u00a7 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">The Board reasoned that, since OPM played no part in the ineligible rating given to petitioner by the Department of the Army, <em>OPM had not applied </em>any employment practice to petitioner. We agree. In the prior appeal, this issue was not the basis for the MSPB decision, and the circumstances of OPM\u2019s involvement were, thus, not fully presented in the first appeal. It is now known that OPM had simply been brought into the ease by the MSPB as the only possible respondent under the above regulation. The record shows that OPM has, from the beginning, challenged the jurisdiction of the board on this basis, and that the MSPB did not rule on this particular challenge in the first instance, having disposed of the case on other jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">The decision of the MSPB that it lacks jurisdiction over the appeal for the reason discussed above is, therefore, <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-11\">. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.101 provides, in pertinent part: For the purpose of this subpart, the term \u201cemployment practices\u201d includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ae0B\">.
