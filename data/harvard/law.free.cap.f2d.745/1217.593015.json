The district court refused to apply successor liability in cases of partial acquisition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-22\">From 1936 until 1962, Unarco manufactured an asbestos pipe insulation product called \u201cUnibestos.\u201d Unibestos was only one of hundreds of products manufactured by Unarco. In 1962, Unarco sold its entire Unibestos product line, including its know-how, manufacturing facilities, customer lists, and exclusive right to use the trade name \u201cUnibestos,\u201d to the Pittsburg-Corn-ing Corporation (PCC). PCC continued to manufacture Unibestos until 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-23\">The seven plaintiffs involved in these cases filed separate suits against Unarco and PCC in 1981, 1982, and 1983, alleging various injuries sustained as a result of inhaling asbestos fibers during the installation and removal of Unibestos. On July 29, 1982, Unarco filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The filing of the petition imposed an automatic stay of all legal proceedings against Unarco. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-24\">' To sidestep the effect of the automatic stay, the plaintiffs asked the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>to impose liability on PCC for the injuries they suffered from the Unibestos manufactured by Unarco prior to the sale to PCC. PCC responded by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment on the ground that PCC was not subject to successor liability. The district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and granted PCC\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"ArDd\">I. Successor Liability</p>\n<p id=\"AFC_\">As a general matter, California does not impose liability on a successor corporation that purchases the assets of a predecessor in an arm\u2019s length transaction. <em>See Ray v. Alad Corp., </em>19 Cal.3d 22, 28, 560 P.2d 3, 7, 136 Cal.Rptr. 574, 578 (1977); <em>Ortiz v. South Bend Lathe, </em>46 Cal.App.3d 842, 846, 120 Cal.Rptr. 556, 558 (1975); <em>Schwartz v. McGraw-Edison Co., </em>14 Cal. App.3d 767, 780-81, 92 Cal.Rptr. 776, 783-84 (1971). \u201cThe courts have reasoned that to hold the successor liable ... would be to impose liability upon the successor for the totally independent acts of others.\u201d Note, <em>Ray v. Alad Corporation: Imposing Liability on the Successor Corporation for the Defective Products of the Predecessor Corporation, </em>15 Cal.W.L.Rev. 338, 354 (1979). In <em>Ray, </em>however, the California Supreme Court created an exception to that rule, holding that if the predecessor liquidates itself after the sale of its entire assets, plaintiffs subsequently injured by products manufactured by the predecessor can recover against the successor. The holding in <em>Ray </em>was based upon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-6\">(1) the virtual destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s remedies against the original manufacturer caused by the successor\u2019s acquisition of the business, (2) the successor\u2019s ability to assume the original manufacturer\u2019s risk-spreading rule[sic], and (3) the fairness of requiring the successor to assume a responsibility for defective products that was a burden necessarily attached to the original manufacturer\u2019s good will being enjoyed by the successor in the continued operation of the business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">19 Cal.3d at 31, 560 P.2d at 9, 136 Cal.Rptr. at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">The rule announced in <em>Ray </em>is not directly applicable to this case because Unarco did not liquidate. We must decide, however, whether the principles announced in <em>Ray </em>nevertheless extend to this situation and render PCC liable. The plaintiffs argue that all three factors present in <em>Ray </em>are present here. They argue (1) that because of Unarco\u2019s petition for bankruptcy, they have no effective remedy against the predecessor; (2) that PCC can effectively assume a loss-spreading role; and (3) that because PCC benefited from the good will associated with the Unibestos trade name, successor liability would be fair. Accordingly, they urge application of <em>Ray </em>to their cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">The district court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument. It interpreted the first factor relied upon by the California Supreme Court in <em>Ray </em>\u2014 \u201cthe virtual destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s remedies ... caused by the successor\u2019s acquisition\u201d \u2014 as requiring not only that the plaintiff lack an effective remedy against the predecessor, but also that \u201cthe successor corporation actually [have] played some role in curtailing or destroying the plaintiffs\u2019 remedies.\u201d The required causation was present in <em>Ray. </em>The successor\u2019s purchase of all the predecessor\u2019s assets led to the dissolution of the predecessor and the distribution of its assets to the shareholders. Those events in turn eliminated the possibility of recovery by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, however, the district court found that PCC\u2019s purchase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>the Unibestos line did not cause Unarco to dissolve or deprive the plaintiffs of a source of recovery. On the contrary, after PCC\u2019s purchase Unarco remained a viable defendant and continued to do business as a large corporation with hundreds of other product lines. The district court therefore refused to extend <em>Ray </em>to the plaintiffs\u2019 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">The district court correctly interpreted <em>Ray </em>as requiring that the asset sale contribute to the destruction of the plaintiffs\u2019 remedies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If no sale had occurred in <em>Ray, </em>the predecessor would have remained in business and the plaintiff could have sued it for recovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The sale had the effect of eliminating an avenue of recovery which the plaintiff would otherwise have had. Underlying the decision in <em>Ray </em>is the objective of alleviating that particular hardship. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-5\">[The] barriers to plaintiff\u2019s obtaining redress from the dissolved [predecessor] set him and similarly situated victims of defective products apart from persons entitled to recovery against a dissolved corporation on claims that were capable of being known at the time of its dissolution. Application to such victims of the general rule that immunizes [the] successor from the general run of [the predecessor's] debts would create a far greater likelihood of complete denial of redress for a legitimate claim than would the rule\u2019s application to most other types of claimants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 32-33, 560 P.2d at 10, 136 Cal.Rptr. at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">Here, as the district court found, the critical hardship \u2014 the asset sale\u2019s elimination of a remedy that would otherwise exist \u2014 is missing. If there had been no sale of the Unibestos product line to PCC, the plaintiffs would not be in any better position than they are now, for it was not the sale to PCC that caused Unarco to petition for reorganization. Unarco filed its petition twenty years after the sale to PCC, and did so for reasons unrelated to the sale. Absent the sale, therefore, the plaintiffs would have had the same .right they now have: the right to \u2022 file claims against Unarco in the bankruptcy proceedings. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Ray, </em>who sought only to avoid a worsening of his position by reason of the sale of assets, the plaintiffs here seek to better theirs. They desire an additional remedy \u2014 one not accorded to any other creditor of Unarco and one that plaintiffs would not have had in the absence of the sale to PCC \u2014 namely, the right to pursue a third party for satisfaction of their claims against Unarco. Nothing in <em>Ray </em>supports awarding them that preference. The district court was therefore correct in holding that the first factor of the <em>Ray </em>analysis militated against successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-11\">The second consideration set forth in <em>Ray, </em>the successor\u2019s liability to spread the risk of loss, also weighs against successor liability in this case. PCC ceased to manufacture and market Unibestos in 1972, approximately ten years before plaintiffs filed these actions. There is no way now to spread the unforeseen loss among all purchasers and users of that product. In <em>Ray, </em>by contrast, the successor had \u201cthe opportunity formerly enjoyed by Alad I of passing on to purchasers of new \u2018Alad\u2019 products the costs of meeting these risks.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>19 Cal.3d at 33, 560 P.2d at 10, 136 Cal.Rptr. at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-12\">The final <em>Ray </em>factor concerns the fairness of requiring the successor to assume a liability as a burden attached to the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>nal manufacturer\u2019s good will. On balance, this factor, too, militates against liability of PCC. While it is true that PCC enjoyed whatever good will attached to the name \u201cUnibestos,\u201d the product line was unprofitable. PCC did not avail itself of the good will attaching to the Unarco name, and took pains to make clear that Unibestos was being manufactured by PCC. There was no parallel to the situation in <em>Ray, </em>where the successor benefited from the good will attached to the entire business of the predecessor. Finally, as we have already pointed out, imposing' liability on PCC would place plaintiffs in a better position than they would occupy if the sale had never occurred. Fairness consequently does not favor successor liability in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">In light of the three factors set forth in <em>Ray, </em>then, the district court was correct in refusing to extend the rule of <em>Ray </em>to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">II. Contractual Assumption of Successor Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">The plaintiffs argue that there is a material factual dispute that rendered summary judgment improper. They contend that Unarco\u2019s agreement to indemnify PCC for claims arising from pre-sale operations by Unarco somehow raises an issue of fact as to whether PCC assumed liability for such claims. The plaintiffs, however, did not raise this issue before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">\u201cAn appellate court will not review an issue not raised nor objected to below unless necessary to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Komatsu, Ltd. v. States Steamship Co., </em>674 F.2d 806, 812 (9th Cir.1982). In the <em>Komatsu </em>case, there was no \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d because the appellant did not provide a reason for its failure to raise the issue below. <em>Id. </em>The same situation exists here. Therefore, we will not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding PCC\u2019s contractual assumption of successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">. The court in <em>Ray </em>stated that even if the plaintiff could obtain a judgment against the dissolved predecessor, \u201che would face formidable and probably insuperable obstacles in attempting to obtain satisfaction of the judgment from former stockholders or directors.\u201d 19 Cal.3d at 32, 560 P.2d at 9, 136 Cal.Rptr. at 580. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Continuing Corporate Existence for Post-Dissolution Claims: The Defective Products Dilemma, </em>13 Pac.LJ. 1227, 1240-41 (1982) (arguing that Cal.Corp.Code \u00a7 2011(a) prohibits plaintiffs with post-dissolution causes of action from recovering from the shareholders).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">. We review district court interpretations of state law de novo. <em>In re McLinn, </em>739 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">. Similarly, in <em>Rawlings v. D.M. Oliver, Inc., </em>97 Cal.App.3d 890, 159 Cal.Rptr. 119 (1979), relied on by plaintiffs, the predecessor would have remained in business and been clearly subject to suit if it had not been for the sale of the entire business. The sale placed the plaintiff in a worse position. Moreover, the entire business was then operated by the successor, utilizing the good will of the predecessor and acquiring its entire cost-spreading capability. <em>Id. </em>at 901, 159 Cal.Rptr. at 124. <em>Rawlings </em>is therefore comparable to <em>Ray </em>and distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
