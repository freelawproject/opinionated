Swift (Swift) died in September, 1923. His estate is still being administered. In this case we are called upon to decide whether the estate\u2019s claim for the recovery of certain dividends alleged to have been paid to the defendant, Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. (Paine Webber), is barred by Massachusetts\u2019 six-year statute of limitations for contract actions. Mass.Ann.Laws ch. 260, \u00a7 2 (Law. Co-op.1980). The district court held that the estate\u2019s claim for dividends paid before October 3, 1973 is so barred, and the administrator, Brine, appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Because this appeal is from a partial grant of Paine Webber\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the facts and inferences drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to Brine. <em>Emery v. Merrimack Valley Wood Products, Inc., </em>701 F.2d 985, 986 (1st Cir.1983). In this case, the parties stipulated to most of the relevant facts, and the others detailed below are uneontested.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">For some years prior to 1923, Francis Swift had a trading account with the defendant\u2019s predecessor, Jackson &amp; Curtis (J &amp; C). In 1919 Swift, J &amp; C, and several other individuals formed a syndicate to purchase stock in the Covert Gear Co., Inc. To carry out this purchase, the syndicate borrowed money from the First National Bank of Boston (First National). Swift was a guarantor of the syndicate\u2019s obligation to First National, as were the other syndicate members.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">In December of 1922, Swift wrote to J &amp; C and directed it to close his account. He requested that J &amp; C \u201csend a balance che-que to me,\u201d but noted that \u201c[i]t is understood that you will retain what is necessary to cover the Covert Gear Matter.\u201d J &amp; C followed these directions, selling all of Swift\u2019s stock except for 136 shares of common stock in the Flintkote Company and certain shares of stock in the Union Oil Company of Delaware. J &amp; C retained $11,500 in cash and these shares to \u201ccover the Covert Gear Matter\u201d and sent Swift a check for the balance $17,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">Swift died in 1923. Vallie Swift, his widow, was appointed administratrix of his estate. Two years later, First National brought suit in Massachussets\u2019 Suffolk County Superior Court against Swift\u2019s estate and J &amp; C to recover on Swift\u2019s obligation as a guarantor of the loan to the syndicate. First National prevailed in the lawsuit, and J &amp; C was ordered to make good Swift\u2019s obligation to the bank. J &amp; C was able to satisfy this obligation without selling the Flintkote shares (the original shares). Consequently, after paying Swift\u2019s obligation to First National, J &amp; C endorsed the original shares in blank and delivered them to the estate in July 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">The transfer of the original shares, however, was never recorded on the book\u2019s of Flintkote\u2019s transfer agent, and Vallie Swift died in 1932 without completing administration of her husband\u2019s estate. Because J &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>C\u2019s name remained on the books of Flint-kote\u2019s transfer agent as record owner of the shares, J &amp; C continued to receive dividends paid on Swift\u2019s stock after July 1928. Also, in December 1928, Flintkote paid a 100% stock dividend to its shareholders, thereby adding 226 shares (the dividend shares) to Swift\u2019s Flintkote holdings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Not until 1977, for reasons unexplained in the record, was Brine appointed as the new administrator of Swift\u2019s estate. Brine discovered the erroneous payment of dividends on Swift\u2019s stock to J &amp; C, and on October 5, 1979, he filed this diversity action, seeking recovery of dividends and interest on the original and the dividend shares. Because Paine Webber had already delivered all dividends that had accrued on the original shares between 1946 and 1973 to the state of New York pursuant to that state\u2019s abandoned property law, the complaint sought recovery only for dividends that had accrued from 1928 to 1946 and after 1973. The complaint alleged numerous theories of recovery, including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, negligence, and conversion. Paine Webber moved for summary judgment on all counts, arguing that the action was time-barred. Brine then cross-moved for summary judgment on all counts except the negligence and conversion claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The district court agreed with Paine Webber that the negligence and conversion claims were time-barred, and that ruling has not been challenged in this appeal. In addition, the court concluded that Brine\u2019s remaining claims for cash and stock dividends issued prior to October 5, 1973, (for convenience, pre-1973 dividends), were barred by Massachusett\u2019s six-year statute of limitations for implied contract actions. The court accepted <em>arguendo </em>Brine\u2019s theory that, under Massachusetts law, if J &amp; C had held the Flintkote securities for Swift and his estate in a fiduciary capacity, and if J &amp; C had subsequently breached its fiduciary duty, then the statute of limitations would have been tolled until Brine had discovered the breach. The court concluded, however, that there had been no fiduciary relationship \u201c[a]t the time the stock was delivered\u201d to Swift\u2019s estate. As a result, the claims for the pre-1973 dividends were barred and the court granted Paine Web-ber\u2019s motion as to those dividends. As to dividends paid after October 5, 1973, (for convenience, post-1973 dividends), however, the court ruled that Brine\u2019s claim was timely filed within the six-year limit. The Court consequently granted judgment for Brine on those dividends, and Paine Web-ber has not appealed from that ruling. In a subsequent memorandum the court also made it clear that, because Brine\u2019s claim for pre-1973 dividends on the original shares was time-barred, any claim to dividends paid on the dividend shares was also barred, the dividend shares themselves being part of the time-barred claim. Only post-1973 dividends paid on the original shares were recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The parties agree that Massachusetts law governs this diversity action. In Massachusetts, if funds have been paid to the wrong party by mistake, the proper action for recovery is one of quasi-contract based on \u201cmoney had and received.\u201d <em>New Bedford v. Lloyd Investment Assoc., Inc., </em>363 Mass. 112, 118, 292 N.E.2d 688, 691 (1973); <em>Stuart v. Sargent, </em>283 Mass. 536, 540, 186 N.E. 649, 650 (1933). Such an action is normally subject to Massachusetts\u2019 six-year statute of limitations for contract actions, and the six-year period is calculated to run from the date of \u201creceipt of payment without regard to when the mistake is discovered.\u201d <em>New Bedford, supra, </em>363 Mass, at 119, 292 N.E.2d at 692.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Thus, absent some special circumstance, it was entirely proper for the district court to hold that any claims to dividends received by J &amp; C more than six years prior to institution of this lawsuit were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Brine contends that such a special circumstance arose from Swift\u2019s 1922 letter to J &amp; C. He argues that an express trust was created by the letter, and that J &amp; C subsequently held Swift\u2019s Flintkote stock as a fiduciary. Massachusetts\u2019 settled rule in such a case is that a \u201cstatute of limitations does not begin to run in favor of a trustee against a beneficiary until the trustee has repudiated the trust and knowledge of that repudiation has come home to the beneficiary.\u201d <em>Kearney v. Mechanics National Bank of Worcester, </em>343 Mass. 699, 703, 180 N.E.2d 667, 670 (1962). Thus Brine argues that the six-year limitation should have been tolled until 1977 when Brine discovered that Swift\u2019s dividends had been erroneously paid to J &amp; C, which discovery he contends constituted the estate\u2019s first knowledge of repudiation of the alleged trust.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We think it is likely correct, as the district court ruled, that a simple stockbroker-customer relationship is not a fiduciary one in Massachusetts. <em>See Plumer v. Luce, </em>310 Mass. 789, 795-96, 39 N.E.2d 961, 964-65 (1942). But Brine does not rest on that relationship alone. He points to Swift\u2019s 1922 letter directing J &amp; C to retain funds belonging to Swift sufficient \u201cto cover the Covert Gear matter.\u201d J &amp; C subsequently did retain Swift\u2019s funds, and Brine contends that this created an express trust as a matter of law. Brine further argues that the district court held to the contrary, and that this holding should be reversed as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">An express trust may well have been created in this case. <em>See Carpenter v. Suffolk Franklin Savings Bank, </em>362 Mass. 770, 777-78, 291 N.E.2d 609, 614-15 (1973). Based on our ruling below, however, we need not resolve that question here. It is not clear from the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion that it held that an express trust was <em>never </em>created between Swift and J &amp; C. The district court stated only that <em>\u201c[a]t the time the stock was delivered to the estate </em>there were no special circumstances\u201d indicating a fiduciary relationship (emphasis supplied). This statement can be fairly read as a statement of the holding that Paine Web-ber now suggests: \u201c[w]hatever obligations Jackson and Curtis owed the Swift estate, fiduciary or otherwise, were discharged\u201d in July 1928 when J &amp; C endorsed and delivered the original shares to the Swift estate. With this we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">The terms of the 1922 letter are clear: J &amp; C was to apply Swift\u2019s funds, and stock if necessary, to \u201ccover\u201d Swift\u2019s guarantee to First National on the Covert Gear matter. Indeed, Judge Keating of the Suffolk County Superior Court, on whose opinion Brine places great reliance, found as follows on this question in 1925 (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-15\">I find and rule that Jackson &amp; Curtis have so far carried out the understanding between Swift and them as expressed in Swift\u2019s letter of December 27, 1922, [and] that <em>nothing remains to be done except </em>to pay to [First National] what is due to it, and <em>to deliver the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>balance to the defendant Vallie G. Swift, </em>administratrix----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">This contemporary state court ruling as to the terms of the 1922 understanding, in a case in which Swift\u2019s estate was a defending party, carries a strong collateral estoppel effect here. <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153-54, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973-74, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, based upon our independent review of the record, we agree entirely that such terms were all that the parties intended for any trust created by Swift\u2019s letter. And it is clear that the intentions of the settlor are controlling with regard to \u201cthe end to be accomplished\u201d by a trust. <em>Carpenter v. Suffolk Franklin Savings Bank, supra, </em>362 Mass, at 777, 291 N.E.2d at 614; <em>see Claflin v. Claflin, </em>149 Mass. 19, 20 N.E. 454 (1889).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The general rule is that a trust is terminated once its purposes have been accomplished. Bogert &amp; Bogert, <em>The Law of Trusts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 149 &amp; 150, at 536-39 (5th ed. 1973); 4 <em>Scott on Trusts </em>\u00a7 334, at 2642 (3rd ed. 1967); 2 <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 334 &amp; comment b (1959). Once a trust is terminated, the trustee has the continuing power and obligation only to preserve the trust property while winding up the trust and to deliver any remaining trust property to the beneficiary. The trust terminates entirely once conveyance occurs. Bogert, <em>supra, </em>at 536, 538; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 344, 345, at 2735, 2738; 2 <em>Restatement (Second), supra, </em>\u00a7 344 (comments c &amp; h) and \u00a7 345 &amp; comments c &amp; d. Massachusetts appears to follow these general rules. <em>See Rothwell v. Rothwell, </em>283 Mass. 563, 570, 186 N.E. 662, 665 (1933) (trust \u201cterminates upon conveyance\u201d of trust property; \u201cduties and powers of the trustee\u201d related to conservation and conveyance continue until that time); <em>Bartels v. Director of Division of Employment Security, </em>326 Mass. 1, 6, 92 N.E.2d 370, 373 (1950) (trust may terminate \u201cby operation of law ... or ... by distribution of the assets\u201d). <em>See also </em>M. Shattuck, <em>Massachusetts Annotations to the Restatement of the Law of Trusts </em>(1935) at 277-78 (collecting cases in which \u201cthe period of the trust was fixed ... by necessary implication according to the terms of the trust ... and upon the happening of the given contingency the trust was terminated\u201d). Brine has cited no case in Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction that would suggest a different rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">By July 1928, J &amp; C had accomplished all the purposes that Swift intended in his 1922 letter. It had paid Swift\u2019s obligation to First National and had physically delivered the original shares, endorsed in blank, to Swift\u2019s estate. No further action was required of J &amp; C to transfer title to the stock. <em>See Place v. Chaffee, </em>251 Mass. 508, 510, 146 N.E. 722, 723 (1925); Mass. Ann.Laws ch. 155, \u00a7 27 (1914), <em>reprinted in </em>Mass.Ann.Laws ch. 106, Appendix (Uniform Commercial Code), at 335 (Mi-chie/Law. Co-op. 1967).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Swift\u2019s intended purposes having been fulfilled, any trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>that may have been created by Swift's 1922 letter was terminated upon conveyance of the original shares to Swift\u2019s estate. From that time forward, J &amp; C had no fiduciary obligations to Swift or his estate. Thus no breach of such duties, or repudiation of a trust, could have occurred after July 1928 because no relevant trust or duties existed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The only dividends or dividend shares now sought by Brine were delivered to J &amp; C after July 1928. A contract action for recovery of these dividends might have been successful; J &amp; C\u2019s performance in this case was certainly not a model of efficiency or good business practice. But any such action was subject to the six-year statute of limitations imposed by Massachusetts law. Failing timely institution of such an action, Brine\u2019s claims as to those dividends and dividend shares are now time-barred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Thus the district court was essentially correct in its decision. J &amp; C did not receive Swift\u2019s dividends as a result of wrongdoing, but only because Swift\u2019s estate failed to record the transfer of the original shares and then failed to note the mispayment of dividends for almost half a century. Massachusetts law permits \u201creliance on the closed transaction after a considerable amount of time.\u201d <em>New Bed-ford, supra, </em>363 Mass, at 121, 292 N.E.2d at 693. The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">. The parties disagree as to whether J &amp; C ever actually received these dividend shares. Our decision with regard to the statute of limitations makes resolution of this question unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\">. Prior to 1948, Section 2 of chapter 260 of Massachusetts\u2019 General Laws provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\"><em>\u00a7 2. Limitation of Six Years </em>\u2014 The following actions shall, except as otherwise provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ed, be commenced only within six years next after the cause of action accrues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">First, Actions of contract founded upon contracts or liabilities, express or implied, ... Second, Actions of tort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Third, Actions of replevin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">The 1948 amendment did not alter the substance of this limitation. It merely reduced the period of limitation to three years for actions of tort, replevin, and contract to recover for personal injuries. <em>See </em>Mass.Ann.Laws ch. 260, \u00a7\u00a7 2 &amp; 2A, pp. 429-30, 441 (Michie/Law. Co-op. 1980).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-16\">. Brine\u2019s case can succeed, if at all, only on a theory of express trust. We have previously noted that, under Massachusetts law, a statute of limitations is not tolled with regard to court-imposed or created trusts, regardless of \"repudiation\u201d. <em>Bums v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, </em>394 F.2d 416, 419 (1st Cir.1968). Brine\u2019s arguments concerning resulting and constructive trusts, therefore, are ineffective in this case, and we do not further address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. Judge Keating\u2019s Order that J <em>&amp; C </em>\u201cpay over and deliver ... the balance of the securities and funds\" in Swift\u2019s account to Swift\u2019s estate after covering Swift\u2019s obligation to First National was stricken on appeal by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court because no formal counterclaim for such payment had been filed by the estate. <em>First National Bank of Boston v. Swift, </em>258 Mass. 573, 580-81, 155 N.E. 606, 608 (1927). This procedural reversal does not reduce the value of the Superior Court\u2019s finding on the interpretation of Swift\u2019s 1922 letter, nor does it negate the effect of J &amp; C\u2019s subsequent delivery of the original shares to Swift's estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">. Cases such as <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Lewis, </em>317 Mass. 137, 57 N.E.2d 638 (1944), <em>Welch v. Flory, </em>294 Mass. 138, 200 N.E. 900 (1936) and <em>Ball v. Hopkins, </em>268 Mass. 260, 167 N.E. 338 (1929) are inapposite. Unlike this case, all such decisions involved the administration of a trust by an active trustee. In no case was a former trustee held to a fiduciary's standard after the trust had terminated entirely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b194-12\">. Massachusetts repealed Chapter 155 in 1957 when it adopted the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 19 of chapter 765 of the 1957 Act provided, however, that all transactions effected prior to October 1, 1958 (the effective date of the Act), and all \"rights, duties and interests flowing from them remain valid ... as though [the 1957 Act] had not occurred.\u201d Thus, for purposes of evaluating J &amp; C\u2019s actions in 1928, Chapter 155, \u00a7 27, applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b195-10\">. Because we hold that any trust created was terminated in July 1928 and claims for dividends received after that date are consequently time-barred, we need not address Brine\u2019s contentions regarding repudiation of a trust, nor need we decide whether laches or lack of due diligence would now bar an action for breach of trust by Swift\u2019s estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
