The district court\u2019s judgment enjoins action of a private hospital, the Hospital for Sick Children, along with action of the District. As a preliminary matter, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>determine whether the private hospital is answerable at all for a claim of the kind plaintiff-appellee has attempted to state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-5\">The appellee, Pierce Lunceford, is a mul-ti-handicapped young man with profound mental retardation and crippling conditions. Although Pierce is over eighteen years old, his development in many areas has not progressed beyond that of a five-month-old child. Pierce became a ward of the District of Columbia and began living at Forest Haven, the District\u2019s institution for the mentally retarded, in May 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-6\">As required by the EAHCA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(1)(B), Pierce was assigned a surrogate parent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parent requested a hearing, pursuant to the EAHCA, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(2), on the adequacy of Pierce\u2019s educational placement. A hearing was held in December 1980; the hearing officer found Pierce\u2019s educational placement in Forest Haven inappropriate, and ordered the District to provide Pierce a new educational placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-7\">In February 1981, in response to the District\u2019s request, Pierce was admitted to residence at the Hospital for Sick Children (HSC). HSC is a private hospital serving children with chronic illnesses or handicapping conditions. It operates an inpatient hospital and an outpatient special education program for profoundly mentally retarded children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-8\">In HSC\u2019s education program, Pierce received prescribed therapy. HSC, through its inpatient facilities, also treated Pierce for seizures (a problem that first developed after his admission to HSC) and feeding difficulties, and made adjustments in his wheelchair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-9\">In November 1982, HSC informed Forest Haven that Pierce was ready to be discharged. The hospital recommended that Pierce continue in the education program on an outpatient basis \u201csince he is no longer medically appropriate for hospitalization at HSC.\u201d Stipulated Fact No. 16. The surrogate parent was notified and protested that without parental consent, Pierce could not be discharged until completion of an EAHCA hearing procedure. HSC informed the parent that as a private hospital it was not covered by the EAHCA. The District had previously expressed its opinion that the move from HSC back to Forest Haven would not be a change in educational placement; accordingly, in the District\u2019s view, the EAHCA did not require completion of hearing procedures in advance of the proposed transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-12\">Pierce\u2019s discharge was postponed until the District could provide appropriate daily transportation between Forest Haven and HSC. Transportation was made available in July 1983, and Pierce\u2019s discharge was set for July 29, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-13\">On July 26, 1983, however, Pierce Lunce-ford, by his surrogate parent, filed a complaint and motion for' a temporary restraining order in the district court. A temporary restraining order issued on July 29. The parties agreed that the preliminary injunction application would be combined with consideration on the merits and that the merits would be decided on stipulated facts. The district court held that a change in residence from HSC to Forest Haven, with continued education at HSC, would be a change in educational placement; that HSC was a \u201cstate actor\u201d covered by the EAHCA; and, therefore, that Pierce could not be discharged from HSC until his surrogate parent consented or until HSC completed the hearing procedures described in the EAHCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-14\">The District and HSC appealed. For the reasons stated below, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and direct the district court to dismiss the action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>HSC and enter judgment on the merits for the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-4\">II. Hospital for Sick Children</p>\n<p id=\"azf-dedup-1\">The district court\u2019s judgment is cryptic; it appears to hold HSC responsible for retaining Pierce Lunceford as an inpatient pending completion of EAHCA hearing procedures on two bases: either directly and independently under the statute, or under the \u201cstate action\u201d doctrine, or on both grounds in combination. As the surrogate parent concedes, however, Congress addressed the EAHCA\u2019s procedural requirements only to state or local educational agencies or other public authorities established by state law to provide free public education. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1415(a), 1401(7)-(8), (22). HSC is not such an agency or authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-5\">The surrogate parent suggests as an appropriate statutory basis for the action against HSC, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Section 504 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1670-6\">No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1670-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>HSC\u2019s amenability to this measure by reason of its receipt of Medicaid and Medicare funds, and no preclusion of appellee\u2019s resort to the legislation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it remains illogical to argue that HSC discriminated against Pierce <em>because of his handicap.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1670-8\">As stipulated, HSC\u2019s decision to discharge Pierce rested on the staff\u2019s determination that \u201che is no longer medically appropriate for hospitalization at HSC.\u201d Stipulated Fact No. 16. Nor does there appear to be any genuine doubt that HSC\u2019s services \u201care available only to handicapped children.\u201d HSC Brief at 21. Ten children, the hospital\u2019s records showed, were waiting for HSC beds at the time Pierce Lunceford sought the temporary restraining order, Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 8, <em>Lunceford, </em>Civ. No. 83-2132 (D.D.C. Oct. 14, 1983); each of the wait-listed children apparently fit the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s definition of \u201chandicapped individual.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(7)(B). Under the circumstances, the discharge of Pierce to permit the admission of another sorely handicapped child rationally could not amount to disadvantageous treatment \u201csolely by reason of his handicap.\u201d <em>See Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 411, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2369, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979) (\u201c[Njei-ther the language, purpose, nor history of \u00a7 504 reveals an intent to impose an affirmative-action obligation on all recipients of federal funds.\u201d); <em>Monahan v. Nebraska, </em>687 F.2d 1164, 1170 (8th Cir.1982) (\u201cManifestly, in order to show a violation of the Rehabilitation Act, something more than a mere failure to provide the \u2018free appropriate education\u2019 required by EAHCA must be shown.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-12\">The district court\u2019s principal reliance in enjoining HSC, it seems, was on the notion that, as a recipient of public funding, HSC was bound by the same statutory and due process requirements \u201cas government.\u201d <em>Lunceford, </em>slip op. at 4. <em>Blum v. Yaret-sky, </em>457 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982), however, rules out any \u201cstate action\u201d peg for the district court\u2019s judgment against HSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-13\">In <em>Blum, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether state action was implicated in private nursing homes\u2019 decisions to transfer particular Medicaid patients to different facilities providing lower levels of care. The challengers claimed they did not receive adequate notice and hearings before they were transferred. Like HSC, the nursing homes received large federal financial assistance. Federal regulations required a home to establish a committee to determine, <em>inter alia, </em>the appropriateness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>each patient\u2019s continued residence at the facility. The Supreme Court held that the nursing homes\u2019 transfer decisions were not state action. Heavy regulation by government, the High Court restated, \u201cdoes not by itself convert [a private facility\u2019s] action into that of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1004, 102 S.Ct. at 2786 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 350, 95 S.Ct. 449, 453, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974)). Generally, the Court indicated, the action of a nongovernmental entity will not be held to standards limiting official action absent government coercion or significant government encouragement of the measure under inspection. <em>Blum, </em>457 U.S. at 1004, 102 S.Ct. at 2786. In rejecting \u201cstate action\u201d characterization of the transfer decisions in <em>Blum, </em>the Court emphasized that the decisions \u201cultimately turn[ed] on [private actors\u2019] medical judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1008, 102 S.Ct. at 2788.</p>\n<p id=\"b1671-5\">Like the nursing homes\u2019 transfer decisions, HSC\u2019s discharge decision was a medical judgment \u201cmade by private parties according to professional standards that are not established by the State.\u201d <em>Id. Blum </em>controls this case; it leaves no room for holding HSC\u2019s decision to discharge Pierce Lunceford to strictures that the Constitution or other relevant federal law \u2014here, the EAHCA \u2014 places only on \u201cgovernment action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Blum </em>means that, absent any plausible statutory basis for reaching HSC here as a nonstate actor\u2014 and, as we have explained, no such basis has been shown \u2014 the case should have been dismissed to the extent that it sought relief against HSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1671-8\">III. District of Columbia</p>\n<p id=\"ahi-dedup-0\">Our decision that the injunction against HSC was improper does not end the case. The EAHCA does impose exacting procedural requirements on public authorities, and the District unquestionably is covered by the Act. If a parent or guardian objects to a proposed change in a child\u2019s educational placement, the EAHCA requires that the change not take place until the objections are aired before the appropriate public education agency in a full hearing procedure, including judicial review. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e). If the move to Forest Haven constitutes a change in educational placement, and HSC does not continue to house Pierce, it appears that the District, in order to satisfy its statutory obligation, must provide Pierce other facilities \u2014 ones more closely resembling HSC\u2019s \u2014 which would maintain his educational placement at least until hearings are completed. Thus, we reach the central question whether the move from HSC to Forest Haven, with continued education at HSC, is a change in educational placement under the EAHCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1671-9\">First, we reject the argument that simply because Pierce, after his discharge, will continue to receive the same HSC daytime education he now receives as an HSC resident, his educational placement cannot be said to change. As courts that have required education agencies to provide free <em>residential </em>care as part of a free <em>education </em>under the EAHCA have noted, the educational needs of a severely handicapped child such as Pierce are closely intertwined with the need for other residential services. <em>See Abrahamson v. Hershman, </em>701 F.2d 223, 227 (1st Cir.1983); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number><em>Kruelle v. New Castle County School District, </em>642 F.2d 687, 693-95 (3d Cir.1981). Therefore, we look beyond the concededly unchanged HSC daytime education to residential services provided Pierce at HSC and at Forest Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-4\">The leading precedent on what type of change constitutes a change in educational placement is <em>Concerned Parents v. New York City Board of Education, </em>629 F.2d 751 (2d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1078, 101 S.Ct. 858, 66 L.Ed.2d 801 (1981). The Second Circuit stated in <em>Concerned Parents </em>that a change in educational placement occurs only when there is a change in the \u201cgeneral educational program in which a child ... is enrolled, rather than mere variations in the program itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754. Under <em>Concerned Parents, </em>a move from a \u201cmainstream\u201d program to one consisting only of handicapped students would constitute a change in educational placement; a move from one mainstream program to another, with the elimination of a theater arts class, would not be such a change.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-5\">The type of program required by a profoundly handicapped child such as Pierce is too individualized to enable us to say that a move from one \u201cresidential\u201d placement to another can never be a change in educational placement. However, the <em>Concerned Parents </em>reasoning<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> suggests that appellee must identify, at a minimum, a fundamental change in, or elimination of a basic element of the education program in order for the change to qualify as a change in educational placement. Appellee has not met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-10\">The main change appellee-surrogate parent has alleged<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is in the feeding treatment Pierce will receive at Forest Haven. Appellee does not dispute that Pierce will be fed on a one-to-one basis at Forest Haven, as he is in HSC, or that the Forest Haven feeding program was developed by a nutritionist. Affidavit of Emille Grier, <em>Lunceford, </em>Civ. No. 83-2132 (D.D.C. Oct. 14, 1983). Appellee contends only that the overworked Forest Haven staff cannot administer its feeding program as well as HSC administers its program. Declaration of Sheila Kaplan, <em>Lunceford, </em>Civ. No. 83-2132 (D.D.C. Oct. 14, 1983). This can be a problem, and the subject of a complaint and hearings under the EAHCA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But it is not alone sufficient to constitute a change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>educational placement, requiring the District to keep Pierce at HSC or a comparable facility until hearings are completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-4\">Finally, we address appellee's argument that under the court order in <em>Evans v. Washington, </em>459 F.Supp. 483 (D.D.C.1978), Pierce cannot be re-admitted to Forest Haven in any case. In <em>Evans, </em>Judge Pratt found that constitutional rights of Forest Haven residents had been violated; he issued an order, consented to by the defendants, detailing procedures for, among other things, deinstitutionalization of patients and interim operation of Forest Haven. Section 12 of the order stated: \u201cThere shall be no admissions to Forest Haven until further order of this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-5\">The District argues that section 12 of the <em>Evans </em>order covers only new admissions, not returns or readmissions. In the district court, the District submitted in support of its interpretation an affidavit of the Acting Superintendent of Forest Haven. The affidavit stated that although \u201c[n]o new persons can be admitted or committed to Forest Haven, ... Forest Haven residents have lived outside of Forest Haven [in community residences, hospitals, other institutions] and then [have] returned.\u201d Affidavit of Donald Brooks, <em>Lunceford, </em>Civ. No. 83-2132 (D.D.C. Oct. 14, 1983). The surrogate parent does not challenge the accuracy of the Acting Superintendent\u2019s affidavit. We believe it reflects a proper reading and application of Judge Pratt\u2019s order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1673-8\">Pierce\u2019s surrogate parents have diligently sought the best possible treatment for Pierce, and this court is sympathetic to their concerns. But resources are not infinite, and many other demands compete for limited public funds. The EAHCA does not secure the <em>best </em>education money can buy; it calls upon government, more modestly, to provide an <em>appropriate </em>education for each child. <em>See Hendrick Hudson District School Board v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 198-200, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 3046-3048, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-9\">In this case, the District, using the residential services of Forest Haven and the outpatient education program of HSC, has fulfilled its obligation under the EAHCA to maintain Pierce\u2019s educational placement pending any complaint proceedings the surrogate parent may bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-10\">We reverse the district court\u2019s judgment for plaintiff-appellee, and direct dismissal of the action against HSC, and judgment on the merits for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-11\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1674-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1584\">*1584</page-number>I</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1668-10\">. The notice requirement is stated in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(1)(C) (1982). The EAHCA requires an educational agency to provide \"an impartial due process hearing,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(2), for any complaint \"relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(1)(E). Thus a parent or guardian always has an opportunity to present complaints relating to a child's educational placement, even if the complained-of situation does not amount to a <em>change </em>in educational placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1668-20\">However, while hearings on a complaint take place, \"the child shall remain in [his or her] then current educational placement\" unless the parent agrees to a change. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(3). The result of these provisions is that if a parent complains of a proposed change in educational placement, that change cannot take place until the hearing procedures required by the EAHCA are completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1669-10\">. Peter Hobbs was Pierce Lunceford\u2019s surrogate parent prior to Pierce\u2019s transfer to the Hospital for Sick Children; Hobbs was later replaced by Carol Leach. Both individuals are volunteers from the District of Columbia Association for Retarded Citizens. This court commends both Mr. Hobbs and Ms. Leach for their vigilant protection of Pierce\u2019s right to an appropriate education.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1670-9\">. <em>But see Smith v. Robinson, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984) (\"[T]here is no doubt that the remedies, rights, and procedures Congress set out in the [EAHCA] are the ones it intended to apply to a handicapped child\u2019s claim to a free appropriate public education.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1671-6\">. In <em>Blum, </em>the challengers sued state officials responsible for administering the Medicaid program and for regulating nursing homes, not the homes themselves. However, the Court\u2019s analysis makes it clear that suits against individual nursing homes would have fared no better. <em>See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982); <em>Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1671-7\">Appellee cites discussions between HSC and Forest Haven concerning Pierce\u2019s transfer back to Forest Haven, and the District of Columbia Department of Human Services\u2019 referral to HSC of the surrogate parent\u2019s letter of protest, as evidence that the government \u201cexercises some form of control\u201d over HSC. Appellee Brief at 25-26. If such communication between the government and a private entity evidenced government control sufficient to trigger \"state action\u201d limitations, then the Supreme Court certainly would have found state action in <em>Blum, </em>considering the regular communication between the nursing homes and state officials regarding assessments of patients' care needs. <em>See </em>457 U.S. at 1010, 102 S.Ct. at 2789.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1672-6\">. In reaching its definition of a change in educational placement, the <em>Concerned Parents </em>court considered the statutory provisions and federal regulations using the term, 629 F.2d at 754, and the legislative history of the EAHCA. The court found in the Act\u2019s history a primary legislative concern about \"erroneous identification or classification of children as handicapped.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Of particular significance for the case at hand, the court observed that an interpretation of change in \"educational placement\u201d that would include every curriculum change \"would virtually cripple the Board\u2019s ability to implement even minor discretionary changes within the educational programs provided for its students; that interpretation would also tend to discourage the Board from introducing new activities or programs or from accepting privately sponsored programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755. In the present case, an interpretation of change in \"educational placement\u201d that would include all changes in residence would certainly discourage the District from temporarily changing a child\u2019s residence to improve his education.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1672-7\">. Both Forest Haven and HSC are residential placements, providing 24-hour-a-day care. The surrogate parent concedes that \u201d[a]ccording to the discharge plan, the educational services that Pierce Lunceford receives at the [HSC outpatient] Education Department will not change as a result of his discharge.\" Stipulated Fact No. 22. The Education Department program includes the therapy that the hearing officer ordered the District to provide in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-13\">Appellee acknowledges that Pierce\u2019s medical condition has remained stable since November 23, 1982, Stipulated Fact No. 23, and has alleged no medical service Pierce needs that would not be provided at Forest Haven. Moreover, it is unlikely that any medical service provided by HSC but not provided by Forest Haven would be covered by the EAHCA. As Judge Penn observed in <em>McKenzie v. Jefferson, </em>566 F.Supp. 404, 411 (D.D.C.1983), hospitalization can come under the EAHCA only as a \u201crelated service,\" and medical services are limited under related services to those for \"diagnostic and evaluation purposes only.\u201d <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(17) (1982). To the extent that the district court in the present case understood the EAHCA to entitle Pierce to general medical care, it misper-ceived the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1672-15\">. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1673-6\">.

Section 6-1985 states that for those already institutionalized as of the effective date of the Act \u2014 March 3, 1979\u2014 the admission and commitment procedures of the Act would <em>not </em>be applicable.
