J.</author>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Plaintiff, a resident of the City of Portland, brought this action seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaration that Portland City Code (PCC) 5.73.020, which imposes a tax of $35 \u201con the income of each income-earning resident of the City of Portland\u201d for support of the arts in the public schools (the Arts Tax)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, is a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d in violation of Article IX, section la, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff appeals from a limited judgment in the city\u2019s favor under ORCP 67 B, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s allowance of the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denial of plaintiffs cross-motion for summary judgment on the claim. We, like the trial court, conclude that the Arts Tax is not a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d in violation of the Oregon Constitution. Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The facts are not disputed, and the appeal presents only a question of law. In 2012, the Portland City Council referred to voters a resolution for passage of the Arts Tax, to generate funding for art and music education in the public schools.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As enacted, the measure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201cA tax of $35 is imposed on the income of each income-earning resident of the City of Portland, Oregon who is at least eighteen years old. No tax will be imposed on filer(s) within any household that is at or below the federal poverty guidelines established by the federal Department of Health and Human Services for that tax year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">PCC 5.73.020.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The Portland City Code defines an \u201cincome-earning resident\u201d as \u201ca resident who has income of $1,000 or more in the tax year.\u201d PCC 5.73.010(E). Further, the city\u2019s \u201cArts Education and Access Income Tax\u201d administrative rules define and limit what constitutes \u201cincome\u201d for purposes of the tax. Specifically, those rules provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\">\u201cA. \u2018Income\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, all income earned or received from any source. Examples of income include, but are not limited to, interest from individual or joint savings accounts or other interest bearing accounts, child support payments, alimony, unemployment assistance, disability income, sales of stocks and other property (even if sold at a loss), dividends, gross receipts from a business and wages as an employee. \u2018Income\u2019 does not include benefits payable under the federal old age and survivors insurance program or benefits under section 3(a), 4(a) or 4(f) of the federal Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, as amended, or their successors, or any other income a city or local municipality is prohibited from taxing pursuant to applicable state or federal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">\u201c1. Examples of income the city is prohibited from taxing include, but are not limited to, Social Security benefits, Public Employee Retirement (PERS) pension benefits, federal pension benefits (FERS) and income from US Treasury bill notes and bonds interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">\u201c2. The City may tax income federal and/or state governments choose not to tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Revenue Division, <em>Arts Education and Access Income Tax Administrative Rules, available at </em>https://www.portl.and oregon.gov/revenue/article/434547 (accessed May 26, 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Thus, the Arts Tax is not imposed on all Portland residents who are age 18 or older, or even on all such residents who earn income as that term is commonly understood. Rather, residents are broadly subject to\u2014or, concomitantly, excluded from\u2014the tax by reference to the amount and source of their individual income or their household\u2019s income. For example, none of the following Portland residents is subject to the Arts Tax: (1) a person who earns $900 in annual wages; (2) a person who receives total annual \u201cincome\u201d (in the generic sense) of $1,500, of which $999 is wages and $501 is PERS benefits; (3) a person who receives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>annual PERS benefits of $75,000 but less than $1,000 of income from other, nonexempt sources; and (4) a person who earns annual wages exceeding $1,000 but is a member of a household which is at or below federal poverty guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">In this action, plaintiff, who is a taxpayer in the city and subject to the Arts Tax, asserts that the tax violates Article IX, section la, which, as previously noted, provides, in part: \u201cNo poll or head tax shall be levied or collected in Oregon.\u201d The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In rejecting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granting the city\u2019s motion, the trial court reasoned that the Arts Tax is not a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d within the meaning of Article IX, section la, because the class of Portland residents subject to the tax is defined, in material part, by reference to the amount and source of individual income, as well as total household income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\u201cThe Arts Tax is not a head or poll tax because it is not assessed per capita. In assessing the tax, the City considers persons\u2019 income in three distinct provisions: the tax applies only to (1) income exceeding $1000, (2) non-exempt income sources, and (3) income of individuals residing in households with income above the federal poverty guidelines. Taxpayers who are under the age of 18 are exempt from the tax. The practical effect of the tax is to tax income of certain City residents within a certain income range and is therefore not a poll or head tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">On appeal, plaintiff and <em>amicus </em>contend that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, the Arts Tax is assessed per capita because, although it states that it is imposed \u201con income,\u201d the tax is assessed identically on all required tax-filers <em>{i.e., </em>on all individuals over the age of 18 who meet the minimum income criteria), regardless of income level.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The city responds that the Arts Tax is not a \u201cpoll or head\u201d tax because, as shown by the text, context, and legislative history of Article IX, section la, the electors viewed a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d as a tax \u201clevied uniformly on every individual within a class or group, without regard to income, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>property, or resources.\u201d In the city\u2019s view, the Arts Tax does not fit that description, because, whether a person is subject to the tax includes consideration of the person\u2019s income level (individual income of $1,000 or above) and resources (household income above the federal poverty level).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">As noted, the pertinent text of Article IX, section la, was enacted by initiative in 1910.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our task is to determine the voters\u2019 intent in enacting the measure. In doing so, \u201c[w]e interpret an initiated or referred constitutional amendment the same way that we interpret a statute; that is, we look to the text, context, and legislative history of the amendment.\u201d <em>State v. Reinke, </em>354 Or 98, 106, 309 P3d 1059, <em>adh\u2019cL to as modified on recons, </em>354 Or 570, 316 P3d 286 (2013). Within that construct, \u201c[t]he best evidence of the voters\u2019 intent is the text and context of the provision itself.\u201d <em>State v. Harrell/Wilson, </em>353 Or 247, 255, 297 P3d 461 (2013). Pertinent context \u201cincludes the historical context against which the text was enacted\u2014including preexisting constitutional provisions, case law, and statutory framework.\u201d <em>State v. Sagdal, </em>356 Or 639, 642, 343 P3d 226 (2015). Pertinent history includes \u201c\u2018sources of information that were available to the voters at the time that the measure was adopted and that disclose the public\u2019s understanding of the measure,\u2019 such as the ballot title, arguments included in the voters\u2019 pamphlet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>and contemporaneous news reports and editorials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642-43 (quoting <em>Ecumenical Ministries v. Oregon State Lottery Comm., </em>318 Or 551, 559 n 8, 871 P2d 106 (1994)). Finally, we are admonished that we should be \u201ccautious in relying on statements of advocates, such as those found in the voters\u2019 pamphlet, because of the partisan character of such material.\u201d <em>Sagdal, </em>356 Or at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">The text of Article IX, section la provides, in part: \u201cNo poll or head tax shall be levied or collected in Oregon.\u201d The provision does not define a \u201cpoll or head tax.\u201d However, at the time of its enactment in 1910, the commonly understood meaning of \u201cpoll tax\u201d was \u201ca tax levied by the head or poll; a capitation tax.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1108 (unabridged ed 1907). <em>See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>911 (2d ed 1910) (defining \u201cpoll tax\u201d as \u201c[a] capitation tax; a tax of a specific sum levied against each person within the jurisdiction of the taxing power and within a certain class (as, all males of a certain age, etc.) without reference to his property or lack of it\u201d). Although the parties have not identified\u2014and we have not found\u2014a contemporaneous definition of \u201chead tax,\u201d it appears that the two terms were closely synonymous and probably interchangeable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number><em>Black\u2019s </em>qualification of the tax as being levied \u201cwithout reference to [a person\u2019s] property or lack of it\u201d comports with the consensus of understanding expressed in contemporaneous case law. <em>See, e.g., People of State of New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, </em>204 US 152, 159, 27 S Ct 188, 51 L Ed 415 (1907) (describing \u201cpoll tax\u201d as a \u201ctax of a fixed sum, <em>irrespective of income or earning capacity\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>Thurston County v. Tenino Stone Quarries, </em>44 Wash 351, 356, 87 P 634 (1906) (\u201cThe underlying nature and purpose of a poll tax are disassociated entirely from any consideration of property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">With respect to context, reported Oregon decisions antedating the initiative\u2019s enactment are nondescript, but appear to relate to local measures conforming to the same common understanding. <em>See, e.g., City of Oregon City v. Moore, </em>30 Or 215, 217, 46 P 1017 (1896), <em>reh\u2019g den, </em>305 Or 221 (1897) (describing \u201ca poll tax of two dollars upon each and every person liable therefor\u201d); <em>City of Salem v. Marion County, </em>25 Or 449, 450, 36 P 163 (1894) (describing \u201ca poll tax of two dollars upon every person who was liable to pay a state poll tax within said county\u201d). The only statewide poll tax extant in 1910 was a provision requiring \u201c[e]very male inhabitant of this state over twenty-one years of age and under fifty years of age, unless by law exempt,\u201d to \u201cannually pay a road tax of $3.00.\u201d Lord\u2019s Oregon Laws, title XLII, ch III, \u00a7 6326 (1910).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Firefighters were exempted from that tax. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6327.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number><em>Amicus </em>has submitted a compilation of various Oregon statutes and ordinances enacted between statehood (indeed, in some instances before statehood) and 1907 imposing \u201cpoll taxes.\u201d Those measures imposed a tax in a single, fixed amount, generally on all male residents between specified ages. Although some provided for limited exemptions for those engaged in volunteer community service <em>(e.g., </em>militia service or firefighting)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or for \u201clike-kind exchange\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>performing road work <em>in lieu </em>of payment of poll tax assessed for road construction and maintenance),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> none provided for financial exemption. That is, all were uniformly levied without regard for individual ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Thus, the text and historical context of Article IX, section la\u2014\u201cthe best evidence of the voter\u2019s intent,\u201d Harrell/ <em>Wilson, </em>353 Or at 255\u2014establish that, as of 1910, a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d was a tax in a single, fixed amount imposed <em>per capita, </em>sometimes subject to limited exclusions, without reference to an individual\u2019s income or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The very limited \u201clegislative history\u201d of the 1910 initiative corroborates\u2014or, at the very least, does not contradict\u2014that understanding. The only pertinent history appears to be an argument in favor of the measure, published in the November 1910 Voters\u2019 Pamphlet. <em>See State v. Pipkin, </em>354 Or 513, 529, 316 P3d 255 (2013) (Voters\u2019 Pamphlet arguments in favor of proposed constitutional amendment constitute \u201clegislative history\u201d); <em>accord Sagdal, </em>356 Or at 643 (advising \u201ccautio [n] in relying on\u201d such statements, \u201cbecause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>of [their] partisan character\u201d). That argument, submitted by the Oregon State Federation of Labor and the Central Labor Council of Portland and Vicinity, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\">\u201c[This measure] will repeal the poll tax, which is the most odious and unjust of all taxes[.] ** * With very rare exceptions, the only men who pay the poll tax are a few laborers and men who own real property. The tax is unjust not only because it is collected from very few of the men who are supposed to pay, but also because it bears so unequally on men in proportion to their ability to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">\u201cThe laborer supporting a family on $2 a day pays exactly the same poll tax as the corporation manager with a salary of ten thousand dollars a year. If the laborer can starve his family into saving fifty cents a day, the savings of six days\u2019 labor will just pay his poll tax; the corporation manager can easily save enough to pay his poll tax from his salary for two hours\u2019 work. One man lives easily and saves enough to pay his share of the tax with two hours\u2019 work; the other lives hard and save enough on sixty hours\u2019 work to pay his share of the tax. The odds are thirty to one in favor of the rich man. Is it possible to imagine a more outrageously unjust tax than this?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Official Voters\u2019 Pamphlet, General Election, Nov 8, 1910, 24-25.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">That statement comports with the contemporaneous understanding of a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d as a fixed tax, levied per capita, subject to limited exceptions not based on income or resources. Although some inequity may inhere in almost any type of tax, it was the \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d\u2014 combining features of universal, or near-universal, application with a uniform tax imposed without any regard for ability to pay\u2014that uniquely, egregiously, bore \u201cso unequally on men in proportion to their ability to pay\u201d and, thus, was to be proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">In sum, contemporaneous common usage and historical legal context establish that in 1910 \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d had a precise and particular meaning that did <em>not </em>include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>measures with exemptions based on the amount or source of individual or household income. Rather, \u201cpoll or head\u201d taxes were levied uniformly without financial exemption. Nothing in the enactment history of the 1910 initiative contradicts that understanding. As noted, <em>see </em>278 Or App at 748-49, the Portland Arts Tax incorporates such financial exceptions, yielding diverse, income-predicated applications that contradict the fundamental per capita character of a \u201cpoll or head tax.\u201d Accordingly, the Arts Tax does not violate Article IX, section la.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Appellant and <em>amicus </em>contend, however, that our reasoning in <em>City of Portland v. Cook, </em>170 Or App 245, 12 P3d 70 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 56 (2001)\u2014or, more precisely, one aspect of Cook\u2014compels a qualitatively different construction of \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d as connoting and encompassing any measure by which any person who is not exempt from a tax is required to pay the same, fixed amount. We disagree; <em>Cook </em>is not so expansive.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In <em>Cook, </em>the city brought an action to collect an unpaid business license fee. 170 Or App at 247. The defendant, an attorney, contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Portland business license fee was unconstitutional as imposing a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d prohibited under Article IX, section la. Under the ordinance, any business in the city engaged \u201cin the pursuit of profit or gain\u201d was assessed an annual fee of \u201cthe greater of $100 or 2.2 percent of the adjusted net income that the licensee derive [d] from business within the City.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge, we first referred, parenthetically, to <em>Moore, </em>30 Or at 217, and stated generally, that, for purposes of Article IX, section la, a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d is a \u201cfixed tax assessed on each eligible person.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>170 Or App at 250. We then referred to the Voters\u2019 Pamphlet statement quoted above, 278 Or App at 754, and summarized its content:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">\u201cThe amendment\u2019s supporters explained that a poll or head tax \u2018is unjust not only because it is collected from very few of the men who are supposed to pay, but also because it bears so unequally on men in proportion to their ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>pay. * * * The problem that the measure\u2019s supporters perceived was that poll or head taxes are not graduated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><em>Cook, </em>170 Or App at 250 (quoting Voters\u2019 Pamphlet at 24-25). We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\u201cPortland\u2019s business license fee is not a head or poll tax. It is not assessed per capita. Rather, it is assessed only on those persons or corporations who choose to do business within the city. Moreover, although there is a minimum tax, the tax is proportional. The amount of the tax is generally a function of the income a licensee earns. The tax does not possess the same characteristics that prompted the people to add Article IX, section la, to the Oregon Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 251.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">We note, at the outset, that our threshold description in <em>Cook </em>of a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d as a \u201cfixed tax assessed on each eligible person\u201d was generic; significantly we did not explore or amplify the meaning of \u201ceach <em>eligible </em>person\u201d (emphasis added). Specifically, we did not address\u2014as we had no occasion to address\u2014the content of \u201celigible\u201d <em>vis-a-vis </em>exclusions based on putative taxpayers\u2019 income or household resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">In all events, <em>Cook's </em>ensuing discussion confirms that to constitute a \u201cpoll or head tax,\u201d a tax must have two conjunctive features: (1) the tax must be assessed per capita; <em>and </em>(2) it must not be \u201cproportional\u201d (i.e., it must be for a uniform, fixed amount). Both are required; neither is sufficient. Thus, while all \u201cpoll or head\u201d taxes assess a uniform, fixed amount, not all taxes with a fixed sum, non-\u201cproportional\u201d feature are \u201cpoll or head\u201d taxes. Rather, to so qualify, they must also be assessed per capita\u2014that is, on each member of the putative affected class\u2014without limitation or qualification based on absolute, or relative, ability (or inability) to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">That understanding of <em>\u201celigible\u201d </em>taxpayer, as used in <em>Cook, </em>170 Or App at 250, comports exactly with the historical construct of \u201cpoll or head tax,\u201d including contemporaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>usage in 1910. As noted, the only exemptions from the uniform, per capita imposition of such taxes were based on substantial public service. There were no financial exemptions. Rather, those in exigent circumstances were subject to the tax, albeit sometimes fulfilling their tax obligation through provision of \u201cin kind\u201d labor. <em>See </em>278 Or App at 752-53, 753 nn 9 &amp; 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Here, as the trial court concluded, the Arts Tax is not imposed per capita. The referent class of putative, \u201celigible\u201d taxpayers\u2014that is, defined without reference to ability to pay\u2014is all income-earning residents of Portland who are 18 or older. However, because of the exemptions predicated on level and source of individual and household income, the tax is not \u201cassessed on each eligible person,\u201d <em>Cook, </em>170 Or App at 250, within that per capita class. Accordingly, the Portland Arts Tax is not a \u201cpoll or head tax\u201d proscribed by Article IX, section la.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\"> In its briefs, the city refers to the tax as the \u201cArts Income Tax.\u201d In its administrative rules, the city adopted the neutral nomenclature the \u201ctax.\u201d For clarity, we, like the trial court, refer to the tax as \u201cthe Arts Tax\u201d or \u201cthe tax.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\"> Article IX, section la, of the Oregon Constitution provides: \u201cNo poll or head tax shall be levied or collected in Oregon.\u201d As described below, that language was enacted by way of initiative in 1910.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b769-10\"> <em>Amicus curiae, </em>John A.
