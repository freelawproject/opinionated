ORS 419B.504.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Father contends that the juvenile court erred in terminating his parental rights, because the Department of Human Services (DHS) has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that father is presently unfit due to conduct that is seriously detrimental to the child, that integration of the child into father\u2019s care is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change, and that termination is in the child\u2019s best interests. ORS 419B.500; ORS 419B.504; <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Stillman, </em>333 Or 135, 149, 36 P3d 490 (2001) (emphasizing requirement of <em>present </em>unfitness). DHS joins in father\u2019s contention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415(3)(a), we agree with the parties that the evidence in the record does not establish the statutory grounds for termination of father\u2019s parental rights, and we therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-6\"> The juvenile court has previously terminated mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\"> The parties have filed a joint motion seeking reversal and remand of the judgment on an expedited basis. The court generally will not entertain such a motion when, as here, a determination whether to reverse would require the court to engage in a <em>de novo </em>review (here, the juvenile court\u2019s judgment terminating parental rights, ORS 19.415(3)(a)). However, in the extraordinary circumstances of this case, we conclude that resolving the appeal under the expedited procedure is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
