J.</author>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">These separate juvenile dependency appeals, consolidated for purposes of this opinion only, involve two Indian children, A and J, and arise from judgments continuing jurisdiction as to each child and continuing, as to each child, a permanency plan of \u201canother planned permanent living arrangement\u201d (APPLA), ORS 419B.476(5)(f). Mother, father, A, and J all appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mother assigns error to the juvenile court\u2019s denial of her \u201cmotion [s] to dismiss\u201d the predicate dependency proceedings based on purported noncompliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1963, including requirements that apply when the court \u201cknows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved,\u201d 25 USC \u00a7 1912. Mother contends that, as a result of the court\u2019s error, the proceedings are invalid and the jurisdictional petitions must be dismissed as void. Father joins in mother\u2019s arguments and, alternatively, contends that, even if dismissal is not required, the case must be remanded with instructions for the juvenile court to make an \u201cactive efforts\u201d determination pursuant to 25 USC section 912(d). A and J each contend that the juvenile court erred in determining that \u201ccompelling reasons,\u201d ORS 419B.476(5)(f), precluded changing the permanency plan from APPLA to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">As amplified below, we reject each of those challenges. Specifically: (1) The juvenile court did not err in denying parents\u2019 motions to dismiss, because the record did not substantiate the essential premise of those motions, <em>viz., </em>that, as of May 9, 2011, when the court found jurisdiction and directed that A and J be placed in foster care, the court knew or had reason to know that \u201can Indian child [was] involved.\u201d ORS 419B.878. Accordingly, ICWA was, at that time, inapplicable. (2) Similarly, a remand to the juvenile court to make an \u201cactive efforts\u201d determination would be appropriate only if, as of the time the court changed J\u2019s permanency plan from reunification to APPLA (in June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>2012), the court knew or had reason to know that J was an Indian child, triggering ICWA\u2019s requirements; again, the record does not substantiate that premise. (3) Finally, the juvenile court did not err in determining that, in the totality of the circumstances, deferring action pending the tribe\u2019s \u201cexpression of] an opinion as to adoption\u201d constituted a compelling reason for not immediately changing the children\u2019s permanency plan from APPLA to adoption. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">In juvenile proceedings that do not involve the termination of parental rights, it is within this court\u2019s discretion to review the record <em>de novo. </em>ORS 19.415(3). The parties do not seek <em>de novo </em>review, and we conclude that this is not an exceptional case that justifies <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c), (d). Accordingly, in reviewing the juvenile court\u2019s judgments, we \u201cview the evidence, as supplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative inferences, in the light most favorable to the [juvenile] court\u2019s disposition and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Thus, here, as in every case, our threshold \u201cstatement of facts\u201d is, necessarily, a statement of <em>material </em>facts\u2014 that is, our narrative is, at least implicitly, informed by, and circumscribed by, an assessment of legal materiality. Here, for reasons that will become apparent presently, <em>see </em>278 Or App at 438-42, the significance of various events and circumstances is properly assessed by reference to two benchmarks: the juvenile court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction on May 9, 2011, and the change of the permanency plan from reunification to APPLA on June 19, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">With that understanding, the record discloses the following material facts. In 2004, long before the initiation of this dependency proceeding in 2011, mother had contact with the Department of Human Services (DHS) in connection with a child welfare assessment of A and A\u2019s older sister, R.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, mother indicated that she had an affiliation with the Karuk Indian tribe, and DHS, after making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>a preliminary notation of tribal affiliation in its database, contacted the tribe regarding membership eligibility for A and R. The tribe\u2019s enrollment officer responded by letter, on December 15, 2004, that mother is a \u201cdocumented descendent\u201d but <em>\u201cdoes not meet the Karuk Blood Degree requirement for [tribal] membership.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The letter further stated that A and R \u201care not Karuk Tribal members\u201d and \u201cdo not qualify for ICWA.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In February 2011, A and J came into protective custody when they were removed from the family home based on concerns about abuse and neglect as a result of father\u2019s suspected sexual abuse of R and two of his daughters from a prior relationship, and mother\u2019s substance abuse, mental health, and inability to protect the children from father. A and J were placed in shelter care with the foster parents with whom they have resided since that time and who are now a prospective adoptive placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">At the time of the children\u2019s removal, the \u201cKaruk Tribe\u201d notation from 2004 automatically \u201cpopped up\u201d in DHS\u2019s database. Accordingly, the caseworker asked mother about tribal membership, and mother responded that she had a membership card but did not know if she was enrolled in the tribe. However, mother refused to complete any ICWA-related forms; although the DHS caseworker dropped ICWA forms off at the office of an attorney who was representing parents at that time, those forms were never completed and returned. The shelter order of February 23, 2011, stated that DHS had not yet made \u201cfull inquiry\u201d about ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The court assumed jurisdiction on May 9, 2011, under ORS 419B.100(l)(c), with a permanency plan of reunification. The issue of ICWA applicability was not raised at the hearing, either by parents or by DHS, and the jurisdictional and dispositional judgments did not mention ICWA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court ordered the children to be placed in foster care and directed parents to participate in services. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>parents subsequently declined to engage in court-ordered services and requested that the court not continue to order participation in such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">On June 1, 2011, a new caseworker was able to get parents to complete forms entitled \u201cVerification of ICWA Eligibility.\u201d In response to the question \u201cDo you have any American Indian or Alaskan Native Ancestry?\u201d they answered \u201cNo.\u201d At no time thereafter until July 2013, did mother mention Indian tribal heritage or possible tribal membership to DHS personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">After a disposition review hearing in February 2012, the court continued jurisdiction, ordered that the children continue in their foster care placement, and ordered the parents to participate in services. The judgments made no mention of ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In May 2012, mother received an enrollment card from the Karuk Tribe that identified her as an \u201cEnrolled Descendent Tribal Member.\u201d Mother did not notify DHS of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">At the first permanency hearing on June 11, 2012, no party mentioned ICWA. In its consequent permanency judgments issued on June 19, 2012, the court changed the children\u2019s plan from reunification to APPLA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court found that DHS had made the required reasonable efforts to reunify the family, but that parents were refusing services and had failed to ameliorate the issues that had caused a threat of harm to the children. The court ordered that DHS was not required to provide further services to parents. The court found that the children were thriving in their foster placement, but declined to order adoption at that time, finding that adoption was not appropriate because of each child\u2019s \u201cattachment to parent and * * * sibling.\u201d With respect to A, the court found that A \u201cdoes know that adoption is alternative and she is ambivalent about whether she wants to be adopted or not.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court changed the permanency plan from reunification to APPLA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The next permanency hearing occurred in June 2013. In the consequent permanency judgments, the court continued the permanency plan of APPLA and made findings similar to those made in the previous judgments explaining why adoption was not appropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In July 2013, mother told her DHS caseworker that a tribe would be contacting DHS, but that she did not know which tribe. The caseworker helped mother complete an ICWA eligibility form. The Karuk Tribe contacted DHS in August 2013, requesting additional information, and, in October 2013, the Karuk Tribe notified DHS that A and J (like mother) qualified as \u201cEnrolled Descendent Tribal Members\u201d but not as \u201cEnrolled Tribal Members.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> From that time forward, DHS regarded A and J as Indian children and considered the matter to be subject to ICWA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On June 18, 2014, mother filed motions to dismiss the jurisdictional petitions as to each child based on purported noncompliance with ICWA. Specifically, mother contended that \u201cthe court\u2019s jurisdiction over the child [ren] is inappropriate\u201d because the court had predicated its threshold jurisdictional determination on a preponderance of the evidence standard rather than ICWA\u2019s \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard. <em>See </em>25 USC \u00a7 1912(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The filing of mother\u2019s motions coincided with the third permanency hearing, which also occurred on June 18. In the consequent permanency judgments, the juvenile court: (1) stated, for the first time, that ICWA applied to the proceedings; (2) deferred consideration of mother\u2019s motions pending more complete development of the record as to when DHS knew, or should have known, that the children were Indian children; and (3) continued the permanency plans of APPLA, notwithstanding DHS\u2019s and the children\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>requests that the plans be changed to adoption. With regard to ICWA\u2019s applicability at that time, the court observed that \u201cthe record at this time supports a finding that this was not an ICWA case prior to late 2013.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">On August 22, 2014, the court held the permanency hearing that yielded the September 11, 2014, permanency judgments which are the subject of this appeal. At that hearing, the parties presented evidence pertaining to parents\u2019 motions to dismiss on ICWA grounds,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as well as DHS\u2019s and the children\u2019s renewed request to change the permanency plan to adoption. During that hearing, witnesses testified as to the circumstances recounted above. In addition, England, a certified tribal expert\u2014who, like mother and the children, is an enrolled descendent member of the Karuk Tribe\u2014 testified that the tribe would not intervene, did not object to the children\u2019s current placement, and took no position on adoption. England also testified that it was his opinion that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to stay in their current placement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In the September 11, 2014, permanency judgments now on appeal, the juvenile court, after noting the parties\u2019 dispute \u201cas to when DHS knew or should have known about ICWA applicability,\u201d found that \u201cthe current record before the court established\u201d that \u201cthis was not an ICWA case prior to late 2013\u201d and, consequently, \u201ca reasonable efforts standard was appropriately applied in prior hearings.\u201d Accordingly, the court continued jurisdiction, by necessary implication denying parents\u2019 motions to dismiss. The court checked a box on the judgments indicating that, because the children were Indian children, it made its findings based on clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>and convincing evidence. The court once again rejected the request by DHS and the children that the permanency plan be changed to adoption, and continued the permanency plan of APPLA, finding with respect to each child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">\u201cThe child and sibling have been in this permanent foster care placement for the past thirty-nine months. This has been the child\u2019s only placement since coming into care on this petition. *** The child now qualifies as an Enrolled Descendant Tribal Member. The Tribe has not intervened at this point. DHS called a Tribal Expert to testify. The Court finds that witness, Richard England, to be credible. While the Tribe would prefer a relative placement, given the fact that the child and sibling have been placed together in this long-term, positive placement, DHS would prefer to keep the children together in their stable placement while working to locate a relative resource. Mr. England testified that the child would likely suffer serious physical or emotional damage if returned to Mother or Father\u2019s care at this time. The Tribe has not objected to the current plan or placement. Additionally, foster parent presented as willing and committed to facilitating tribal connections and education for the child given the current status of the case. The tribal expert, Richard England, testified in support of the current placement and indicated that the Tribe supported the current placement. DHS requested a change of plan to adoption at the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In rejecting DHS\u2019s and the children\u2019s request to change the plan to adoption, the court explained that \u201cMr. England reported that the Tribe did not express an opinion on adoption. Therefore, the Court is unable to ascertain the Tribe\u2019s position on DHS\u2019 request.\u201d Accordingly, the court declined to change the plan to adoption \u201cwithout direct input from the Tribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">As noted, mother, father, and the children all appeal. In their appeals, parents challenge the juvenile court\u2019s denial of their motions to dismiss. Father further contends that, even if we affirm the court in that regard, the case must be remanded for the juvenile court to determine whether DHS made \u201cactive efforts\u201d to provide services and programs to prevent the breakup of the family. The children also appeal, contending (in arguments in which DHS joins) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>that the juvenile court erred in not changing the permanency plan to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">We begin with the parents\u2019 appeals. Before addressing the particular merits, however, we summarize, as useful context, some principles pertaining to ICWA\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">When a court conducts a hearing relating to involuntary child custody, the court is required to inquire whether a child is an Indian child subject to ICWA. ORS 419B.878. If the court \u201cknows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved,\u201d the court must order DHS to notify the tribe of the pending proceeding and of the tribe\u2019s right to intervene, and the case is to be treated as an ICWA case \u201cuntil such time as the court determines that the case is not\u201d an ICWA case. <em>Id. </em>The tribe makes the determination whether a child is an Indian child as defined in ICWA. <em>Santa Clara Pueblo v. </em>Martinez, 436 US 49, 72 n 32, 98 S Ct 1670, 56 L Ed 106 (1978). Further, and significantly, under Bureau of Indian Affairs ICWA guidelines, if a public child-protective agency \u201chas discovered information which suggests that a child is an Indian child,\u201d that knowledge is constructively imputed to the juvenile court. <em>See </em>Bureau of Indian Affairs <em>Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings </em>B.1, 44 Federal Reg 67592 (Nov 26 1979) (BIA Guidelines).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">When a custody proceeding involves removal of an Indian child, several additional procedural requirements are applicable. ICWA requires that the tribe be given notice and requires a finding by the court that \u201cactive efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d 25 USC \u00a7 1912(a), (d); ORS 419B.476(2)(a) (at a permanency hearing in an ICWA case, when the plan is reunification, the court must determine whether DHS has made active efforts to make it possible for the child to safely return home). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>court may not award custody of an Indian child to DHS or order placement of an Indian child in foster care without \u201cclear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d 25 USC \u00a7 1912(e); <em>see </em>ORS 419B.340(1), (7).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">An Indian child, parent, or tribe may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate an action taken in violation of ICWA. 25 USC \u00a7 1914.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The party asserting ICWA\u2019s applicability bears the burden of making a <em>prima facie </em>case that a child is an Indian child. <em>Hofmann v. Anderson, </em>176 Or App 311, 314-15, 31 P3d 510 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Parents contend that the juvenile court erred in denying their motions to dismiss because, in February 2011, even before the jurisdictional petitions were filed, DHS \u201cknew or had reason to know\u201d that the case involved Indian children, when it noticed in its records a reference to mother\u2019s Karuk heritage\u2014and, pursuant to BIA Guidelines B.l, DHS\u2019s knowledge is imputed to the juvenile court. <em>See </em>278 Or App at 437. In that regard, parents emphasize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>uncontroverted, testimony that (1) when the children were removed in February 2011, mother told a DHS caseworker that she had a tribal membership card; and (2) before the jurisdictional petitions were filed, the caseworker had an \u201cindication that ICWA applied\u201d when the 2004 \u201cKaruk Tribe\u201d notation \u201cpopped up\u201d in DHS\u2019s database. Thus, parents reason, the jurisdictional judgments must be vacated because, as of the time those judgments were entered in May 2011, the juvenile court had (by way of imputed knowledge via DHS) reason to believe that the children were Indian children and, nevertheless, in violation of ICWA, established jurisdiction based on a preponderance of the evidence standard rather than the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard required under ICWA. <em>See 25 </em>USC \u00a7 1912(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Parents\u2019 position depends on a selective understanding of the record before the juvenile court. Specifically, as noted, testimony at the August 22,2014, hearing established that the \u201cKaruk Tribe\u201d notation for mother in DHS\u2019s database had been entered, as a preliminary matter, in 2004, but that, in response to subsequent, contemporaneous inquiries from DHS, the tribe had explicitly denied that mother or her children met the requirements for tribal membership. <em>See </em>278 Or App at 431-32. That negative response\u2014a response within DHS\u2019s constructive knowledge in 2011\u2014negated the 2004 preliminary notation. Further, the record established that, while that notation automatically \u201cpopped up,\u201d there was no evidence that it had ever been renewed or supplemented based on any subsequent information. Similarly, parents\u2019 reliance on mother\u2019s reference to having a tribal membership card does not engage with the complete context that, at the same time mother made that remark in February 2011, she was adamantly refusing to complete ICWA-related forms provided by DHS. Indeed, mother did not obtain a tribal membership card until May 2012\u2014and, even then, did not so inform DHS.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Given the totality of the circumstances, the juvenile court did not err in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>parents\u2019 motions to dismiss. <em>See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Tucker, </em>76 Or App 673, 677, 10 P2d 793 (1985), <em>rev den, </em>300 Or 605 (1986) (affirming juvenile court\u2019s denial of petition to \u201cinvalidate\u201d foster care placement based on purported ICWA noncompliance; record did not establish that, as of the time the child was placed, ICWA applied, and subsequent determination that the child was an Indian child did not render ICWA retroactively applicable to prior actions of the juvenile court).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Father contends, alternatively, that, even if the jurisdictional judgments are not invalid, once the juvenile court determined that the children were Indian children, it was obligated to revisit and reconsider the June 2012 change of plan from reunification to APPLA. Specifically, father contends that, because no \u201cactive efforts\u201d determination under ICWA, 25 USC section 1912(d), has ever been made in these cases, now that the children have been found to be Indian children, such a determination must be made in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In assessing that contention, we emphasize that between May 2011, (when the court assumed jurisdiction) and June 2012, (when the permanency plan was changed from reunification to APPLA), the only additional information or development bearing on DHS\u2019s knowledge as to whether A and J were Indian children was mother\u2019s execution of the ICWA form in June 2011, in which she expressly <em>denied </em>having Native American or Alaskan American ancestry. Thus, as of June 19, 2012\u2014just as on May 9, 2011\u2014the juvenile court had no reason to know, by way of imputed knowledge, that the children might be Indian children, triggering ICWA\u2019s requirements. Because ICWA was not yet applicable at the time either of the May 2011 placement decision or of the June 2012 change to APPLA, the juvenile court was not required under either the Oregon dependency statutes or ICWA itself to make an \u201cactive efforts\u201d finding. Further, the court\u2019s ultimate determination that the children were Indian children did not render ICWA retroactively applicable to those earlier decisions, specifically including the June 19, 2012, change of plan. <em>See Tucker, </em>76 Or App at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Under ORS 419B.476(2)(a), when the case plan at the time of the hearing is reunification and ICWA does <em>not </em>apply, in order to change to a plan other than reunification, the court must find that DHS made \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the record fails to establish ICWA\u2019s applicability as of the time of June 2012 permanency judgments, the juvenile court properly applied a \u201creasonable efforts\u201d standard, without reference to \u201cactive efforts,\u201d in changing the permanency plans for the children from reunification to APPLA. Again, the fact that ICWA subsequently became applicable did not compel the court to revisit that June 2012 determination. <em>See Tucker, </em>76 Or App at 679 (applicability of ICWA after foster care placement did not require the juvenile court to set aside the foster care placement made before ICWA was applicable).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">When the case plan at the time of the hearing is other than to reunify the family, the focus is on whether DHS has made reasonable efforts to place the ward in a timely manner in accordance with the plan. ORS 419B.476(2)(c); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. L., </em>254 Or App 203, 212, 295 P3d 72 (2012), <em>rev den </em>353 Or 445 (2013) (when permanency plan at time of hearing is not reunification, the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d and \u201csufficient progress\u201d standards in ORS 419B.476(2)(a) do not apply). When the permanency plan is APPLA, the question is whether DHS \u201chas made reasonable efforts to place the ward in a timely manner in accordance with the plant.]\u201d ORS 419B.476(2)(b). Reasonable efforts in accordance with an APPLA plan are DHS\u2019s reasonable efforts to find a permanent foster placement for the child. <em>C. L., </em>254 Or App at 212. That is the standard that applied when the court issued its subsequent (post-July 2012) permanency judgments, including the September 2014 judgments at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>issue here. In those judgments, the court determined that DHS met that standard, and that conclusion is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Nothing in ICWA compels a different result. 25 USC section 1912(d) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u201cAny party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitate programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In turn, a \u201cfoster care placement,\u201d as defined in ICWA, is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cany action removing an Indian child from its parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">25 USC \u00a7 1903(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Given those provisions, <em>if </em>this had been an ICWA case at the time the juvenile court changed the permanency plan to APPLA, the court would have been required to make an \u201cactive efforts\u201d finding. <em>See generally Dept. of Human Services v. J. </em>G., 260 Or App 500, 515-20, 317 P3d 936 (2014) (addressing scope of \u201cfoster care placement\u201d for purposes of 25 USC section 1912(d)). But, again, as the juvenile court determined, ICWA was inapplicable at that time\u2014and the subsequent permanency judgments, including those at issue here, renewed the APPLA plan, without any change in the children\u2019s placement. Thus, so long as the predicate permanency plan of APPLA was continued without change\u2014that is, without \u201ceffect [ing] a foster placement\u201d\u2014ICWA section 1912(d) does not require an \u201cactive efforts\u201d determination, notwithstanding that no such determination had been made previously.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Finally, we address the children\u2019s challenge to the juvenile court\u2019s continuation of the permanency plan of APPLA rather than changing the plan to adoption. As noted, the juvenile court determined not to make a change in the permanency plan because the case had recently been determined to be subject to ICWA and because the Karuk Tribe had not stated a position on adoption. The children emphasize that DHS considers APPLA to be the least preferred permanency plan. <em>See </em>OAR 413-070-0525(1) (describing APPLA as the \u201cleast preferred permanency plan\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> They also point to the requirement in ORS 419B.476(5)(f) that, when the court determines that the permanency plan is APPLA, the court is required to state a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d why it is not in the children\u2019s best interests to impose some other plan, including adoption. The children take the position on appeal that, in the absence of an objection from the Tribe, there is no evidence or legal basis on which the court could conclude under ORS 419B.476 that there was a compelling reason to continue the plan of APPLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">We disagree. ORS 419B.476(5)(f) provides that, if the court determines that the permanency plan for the ward would be a planned permanent living arrangement, the court\u2019s order must include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cthe court\u2019s determination of a compelling reason, that must be documented by the department, why it would not be in the best interests of the ward to be returned home, placed for adoption, placed with a legal guardian or placed with a fit and willing relative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>To be sure, the children identify significant circumstances militating in favor of a change of plan from APPLA to adoption, including parents\u2019 refusal to engage in services, A\u2019s expressed desire to be adopted by her foster family, with whom she is closely bonded, and the foster parents\u2019 desire to adopt A and J.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The juvenile court was well aware of those circumstances, as evinced by its careful and detailed findings in the permanency judgments. Still, mindful of ICWA\u2019s purposes and of the potentially significant adverse consequences of proceeding without express tribal input, the court determined not to immediately change the plans to adoption but, instead, to defer pending such input. In the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say that the juvenile court\u2019s measured approach was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the continuation of the permanency plan of APPLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Affirmed in A157952, A157977, and A157978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\"> A\u2019s biological father has not appeared and is not involved in this proceeding.
