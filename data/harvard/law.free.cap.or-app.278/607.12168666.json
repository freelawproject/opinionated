Mother and father both challenge the court\u2019s conclusions that the Department of Human Services (DHS) had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family and that mother had not made sufficient progress to enable the children to return home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They also both argue that the juvenile court erred in changing the permanency plans to adoption, while in a separate dependency case involving the same three children, the plans remained reunification. Additionally, father challenges certain factual determinations of the court and asks that we exercise our discretion to review those determinations <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We conclude that the juvenile court erred in changing the permanency plan to adoption for each of the three children while a separate plan of reunification for each child was also in effect in a separate dependency case. In this case, where DHS was maintaining separate, concurrent dependency cases involving the same children, it was error for the juvenile court to set different plans in different cases for the same child. Because the court erred in changing the children\u2019s plans on that basis, we do not reach parents\u2019 additional arguments. Accordingly, we vacate and remand the permanency judgments for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We set out only those facts necessary to our disposition of this case, which are largely procedural. Mother and father have three children together, M, T, and A, who were 11, 10, and 2 at the time of the permanency hearing. Mother and father have had an off-and-on relationship with instances of domestic violence, substance abuse, and child neglect that have precipitated reports to DHS over the years and resulted in removal of the children from parents\u2019 care in 2010 and again in 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In October 2014, while the children were in parents\u2019 care, M contacted his aunt with concerns that mother was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>using drugs. In November, DHS removed the three children from parents\u2019 care, placed them in relative foster care, and filed a dependency petition with the court for each child (the 2014 dependency case).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In January 2015, the court took jurisdiction of the children based on the following allegations in the petitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-3\">\u201c3A) Mother is involved in criminal activities that interfere with her ability to safely parent the children, placing them at risk of harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">\u201c3B) Mother leaves the children with unsafe care providers, placing them at risk of harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">&lt;\u00a33C) Despite having been referred for services to address mother\u2019s substance abuse and parenting skills, mother has been unable to remedy the problems, placing the children at risk of harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201c3D) Mother\u2019s substance abuse interferes with her ability to safely parent the children, placing them at risk of harm; \u2021\u215c\u215c\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201c3F) Despite having been referred for services to address father\u2019s substance abuse and parenting skills, father has been unable to remedy the problems, placing the children at risk of harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201c3G) Father\u2019s substance abuse interferes with his ability to safely parent the children, placing them at risk of harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">\u201c3H) Father has engaged in a pattern of domestic violence with mother and is currently in a relationship with mother, placing the children at risk of harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">\u201c31) Father leaves the children with unsafe care providers, placing the children at risk of harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">\u201c3 J) Father\u2019s chaotic lifestyle interferes with his ability to safely parent the children, placing them at risk of harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">The court determined the plan for each child to be return to parent, with a concurrent plan of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>On June 24, 2015, DHS filed new dependency petitions with the juvenile court, alleging that \u201cmother has mental health issues that interfere with her ability to safely parent her children, which places the children at risk of harm,\u201d and that, \u201c[d]espite being offered services by DHS, father has failed to ameliorate the circumstances that led to the child being taken into care.\u201d Because DHS filed new petitions instead of seeking to amend the petitions filed in the 2014 dependency case, those petitions created a new case for each child (the 2015 dependency case). The 2014 and 2015 dependency cases were never consolidated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">In late August, the court took jurisdiction of the children based on the allegations in the 2015 petitions and set the plan for each child as return to parent with a concurrent plan of adoption. The following week, in September 2015, the court held a permanency hearing in the 2014 dependency case at the request of DHS. DHS sought to change the plan for each child in the 2014 dependency case from reunification to adoption. In arguing for the change in plan, DHS advocated that the 2014 dependency case and the 2015 dependency case were separate cases that should be treated separately. DHS also told the court that it was not seeking a change in the plans in the 2015 dependency case, and that it could proceed in that case based on a plan of return to parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">At the hearing, the parties argued whether the plans in the 2014 dependency case could be changed to adoption, while the plans in the 2015 dependency case remained return to parent. The juvenile court concluded that, because the 2014 and 2015 cases were separate, there could be a different plan with respect to each. The court reasoned that, otherwise, \u201cif something came to light about a parent a year into the case, and the agency filed a new petition, then every time you\u2019d have to start over.\u201d The court then found, among other things, that DHS had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family and neither mother nor father had made sufficient progress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>to enable the children to return home. Based on those conclusions, the court changed the permanency plan for each child in the 2014 dependency case from return to parent to adoption. The court did not issue a judgment or order with respect to the 2015 dependency case at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">This appeal arises solely from the permanency judgments entered in the 2014 dependency case, and does not arise from any judgment or order entered in the 2015 dependency case. Mother and father both appeal the permanency judgments in the 2014 dependency case changing the plan from reunification to adoption for each of their three children. We write to address the legal issue raised by parents: whether the juvenile court erred when it changed the permanency plan to adoption for each child in the 2014 dependency case while each child\u2019s plan remained return to parent in the 2015 dependency case. On appeal, DHS \u201cagrees that a child cannot have two different permanency plans\u201d and states that, \u201c[t]o the extent that the juvenile court here imposed two different case plans on each child, it erred.\u201d However, despite those concessions, DHS argues that the court did not actually impose different plans and that, even if it did, we should not correct the error because, on remand, the court could enter the same plan change again. As explained below, we disagree with DHS\u2019s position and conclude that the juvenile court did err and that the permanency judgments in the 2014 dependency case must be vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Under ORS 419B.100(l)(c), the juvenile court has exclusive and original jurisdiction \u201cin any case\u201d that involves a child \u201c[w]hose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others.\u201d Although that section provides that the juvenile court has jurisdiction \u201cin any case,\u201d we have emphasized that the juvenile dependency code contemplates that a juvenile court takes jurisdiction \u201cover a child\u201d because, once jurisdiction is established, the child becomes a ward of the court and the court must decide who will have legal custody of the child based on \u201cits determination of what is in the best interest and welfare of the child\u201d under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. W. A. C., </em>263 Or App 382, 393, 328 P3d 769 (2014); see <em>also, e.g., </em>ORS 419B.090(2)(c) (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to the end that <em>a child coming within the jurisdiction of the court </em>may receive such care, guidance, treatment and control as will lead to the child\u2019s welfare and the protection of the community.\u201d (Emphasis added.)); ORS 419B.310(3) (\u201cThe facts alleged in the petition <em>showing the child to be within the jurisdiction of the court </em>as provided in ORS 419B. 100.(1), unless admitted, must be established by a preponderance of competent evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)); ORS 419B.328(1) (\u201cThe court shall make a child found to be within the jurisdiction of the court as provided in ORS 419B.100 a ward of the court\u201d). Once a child is a ward of the court, that wardship continues and \u201cthe ward is subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d until one of the specified statutory conditions occurs. ORS 419B.328(2). In that way, the juvenile dependency code does not contemplate that a child, and decisions about the child\u2019s welfare, will be split into separate \u201ccases\u201d; the code contemplates that the court will take jurisdiction of the child and make all decisions about the child based on the totality of all the circumstances of that child.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">That statutory focus on the health and safety of the child continues when a court holds a permanency hearing and sets or changes the child\u2019s permanency plan. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.476 (court determinations for permanency hearings). At no point in the process does the dependency code discuss decisions of the juvenile court that affect a ward as being decisions with respect to a \u201ccase\u201d as opposed to the \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cward\u201d over whom the court has jurisdiction. In that respect, when the court is required to set the child\u2019s \u201cplan,\u201d which is referred to in the singular, the code continues to contemplate that there will only be one plan in place at a time per child. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. D. L. H., </em>253 Or App 600, 602, 292 P3d 565 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 445 (2013) (\u201c\u2018Permanency plan,\u2019 as used in ORS 419B.476, specifically refers to a singular plan for the child, rather than a plan for each parent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Based on how the issue has been presented in this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we do not decide whether maintaining two separate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>but concurrent, dependency cases involving the same child is permitted under the dependency code, given that the code does not appear to contemplate proceeding in such a manner. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.806 (consolidation); ORS 419B.809(6) (petitions may be amended \u201cat any time\u201d). However, we conclude that, to the extent there are separate, concurrent dependency cases involving the same child, it is error for the juvenile court to set a permanency plan for a child that results in the existence of different plans for the same child at the same time in those concurrent cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">DHS\u2019s argument that the court did not actually put into place two different plans for the children is unavailing. DHS has pointed to no legal authority, and we are aware of none, that would result in the 2015 dependency case plans automatically becoming a legal nullity or changing to conform with the 2014 dependency case plans. DHS chose to maintain the 2015 dependency case as a separate case when it requested that the court only change the plans in the 2014 dependency case. In accord with that request, the juvenile court took no action with respect to the 2015 dependency case. Thus, when the juvenile court changed each child\u2019s plan from return to parent to adoption in the 2014 dependency case, that resulted in two different plans for each child because the court had set the plans in the 2015 dependency case as return to parent the week before. The juvenile court erred when it took action that resulted in the children being subject to two different permanency plans at the same time. Accordingly, we vacate and remand the permanency judgments for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> On appeal, neither parent argues that DHS failed to show that father had not made sufficient progress to enable the children to return home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-13\"> DHS filed a separate petition for each of the three children, resulting in a separate case for each child.
