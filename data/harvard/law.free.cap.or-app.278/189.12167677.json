J.</author>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Plaintiff Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) is a health and research public university that provides patient care at its hospital. OHSU appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment enjoining it from withholding particular information contained in public records that defendant Oregonian Publishing Company, LLC (The Oregonian) requested under the Oregon Public Records Law (OPRL), ORS 192.410 - 192.505. OHSU contends that the information is exempt from disclosure under the OPRL and that the court erred in compelling its disclosure. As explained below, we conclude that some of the requested information may be exempt from public disclosure if it is contained in a document described in ORS 192.496(1). That subsection exempts from disclosure records that \u201ccontain information about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment of a living individual.\u201d Because the requested public records were not part of the record before the trial court, we cannot determine if any of those records and the information in those records are exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.496(1). We also conclude that the record is insufficient to determine whether one of the relevant records is an \u201ceducation record\u201d under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC \u00a7 1232g, and therefore exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(8). Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court to consider the application of ORS 192.496(1) and ORS 192.502(8) to the requested public records. Otherwise, we conclude that disclosure of the requested information in the tort claim notices that are the subject of this appeal is not precluded by state or federal law. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the judgment ordering disclosure and the supplemental judgment awarding The Oregonian its attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The Oregon Tort Claims Act, ORS 30.260 - 30.300, limits the tort liability of public bodies of the state, including OHSU, and regulates the manner in which those claims are prosecuted. ORS 30.275(1) provides that no tort claim \u201cshall be maintained unless notice of claim is given as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>this section.\u201d ORS 30.275(4) sets forth a formal method for giving a tort claim notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">\u201cFormal notice of claim is a written communication from a claimant or representative of a claimant containing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">\u201c(a) A statement that a claim for damages is or will be asserted against the public body or an officer, employee or agent of the public body;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201c(b) A description of the time, place and circumstances giving rise to the claim, so far as known to the claimant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\u201c(c) The name of the claimant and the mailing address to which correspondence concerning the claim may be sent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The Oregonian publishes a newspaper of that name that is of general circulation within Oregon. In 2011, through a reporter, The Oregonian requested that OHSU provide it information from tort claim notices given to OHSU. Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">\u201c[u]nder Oregon Public Records Law, I am requesting a list of tort claims filed against Oregon Health &amp; Science University and its affiliated entities, preferably in spreadsheet form, with information dating back to Jan 1, 2006 and including only the following types of information or data fields: claim number, claimant full name, attorney full name, date of alleged tort, date of tort claim notice, and whether it is closed or open.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">It further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">\u201cI am not requesting any information generated in the course of medical treatment. I am not requesting health information of any kind. *** This is tort information, not health information, and it is submitted by individuals voluntarily, outside the course of medical treatment, to a public institution and in a venue\u2014torts against public institutions\u2014that is well recognized to be public information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">OHSU had received eight tort claim notices during the period of the request. It compiled a document that listed the type of claim asserted in each notice and then either purported to disclose the requested information about that tort claim notice or cited statutory provisions that excused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>obligation to disclose that information. The eight tort claims notices were described as: \u201cprofessional liability where litigation filed,\u201d \u201cprofessional liability where no litigation filed,\u201d \u201cemployment liability for faculty,\u201d \u201cemployment liability for non-faculty,\u201d \u201cgeneral liability involving students,\u201d \u201cgeneral liability course-of-care patient claims if litigation filed,\u201d \u201cgeneral liability course-of-care patient claims if no litigation filed,\u201d and \u201cother general liability.\u201d The document then listed whether the requested information for each claim (the type of claim, open or closed status, the name of the claimant, the date of the alleged tort, the name of claimant\u2019s attorney, the date of notice, and the claim number) would be disclosed or whether OHSU took the position that the particular information was exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">In the document, OHSU proposed to disclose all of the information with respect to the \u201cother general liability\u201d claim, but withheld the names of the claimants for all of the remaining claims. It also withheld the dates of the alleged torts and names of the claimants\u2019 attorneys for some of those claims. The document cited one or more of various parts of the OPRL, ORS 353.260, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, 45 CFR parts 160 and 164 (Privacy Rule),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and FERPA, 20 USC \u00a7 1232g, as the justification for each of the nondisclosures. The Oregonian responded that those policies did not justify any of the nondisclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Pursuant to ORS 192.450 and ORS 192.460,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Oregonian petitioned the Multnomah County district attorney for an order directing OHSU to disclose \u201ctort claim notices submitted to OHSU since 2006, including claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>name, attorney name, date of tort, date of tort claim notice, and whether it was closed or open.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district attorney ruled that none of the claimed exemptions from disclosure applied and \u201cordered that OHSU promptly disclose the records sought in the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">OHSU then instituted proceedings for declaratory relief in the circuit court, seeking a determination that the information withheld is exempt from disclosure under the OPRL.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 192.490(1) (\u201cThe court shall determine the matter de novo and the burden is on the public body to sustain its action.\u201d). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment; the trial court granted The Oregonian\u2019s motion and denied OHSU\u2019s. Pursuant to that judgment, OHSU \u201cis enjoined from withholding the requested records and ordered to disclose the requested records\u201d to The Oregonian. The trial court also entered a supplemental judgment awarding attorney fees to The Oregonian.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">OHSU raises three arguments on appeal. First, as to claims by patients, OHSU contends that the names of claimants, their attorneys, and the dates of the alleged torts in the four tort claims notices from patients are exempt from disclosure under the statutory exemptions for records containing \u201cinformation about the physical or mental health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>or psychiatric care or treatment of a living individual,\u201d ORS 192.496(1), and \u201c[information of a personal nature\u201d in a record, ORS 192.502(2). Additionally, OHSU argues that the health care information is \u201cprotected health information\u201d under ORS 192.556(ll)(a) and is made confidential by ORS 192.553(l)(a). Under ORS 192.558(2)(b), \u201cprotected health information\u201d is to be disclosed only as \u201cotherwise permitted or required by state or federal law or by order of the court\u201d and, OHSU submits, no legal requirement to disclose exists. Similarly, OHSU contends that the health care information is confidential under the Privacy Rule and, because of that confidentiality, it is exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(8) as \u201cpublic records or information the disclosure of which is prohibited by federal law or regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">As to the two employment-related claims, OHSU asserts that the names of the claimants are exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(2) as \u201c[information of a personal nature.\u201d Moreover, OHSU argues, the employment tort claim notice related to a faculty member is a confidential personnel record under OHSU rules authorized by ORS 353.260(1) and is not a public record that must be disclosed under ORS 353.260(6). With respect to claims involving a student, OHSU contends that the name of the claimant is part of the student\u2019s \u201ceducation records\u201d and confidential under FERPA and, thus, exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Finally, OHSU maintains that if, on review or remand, the court modifies the judgment ordering disclosure, then an award of attorney fees is discretionary, ORS 192.490(3), and the supplemental judgment on fees should be reevaluated for a determination of whether to award fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">II. OREGON PUBLIC RECORDS LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Under ORS 192.420(1), \u201cEvery person has a right to inspect any public record of a public body in this state, except as otherwise expressly provided by ORS 192.501 to 192.505.\u201d ORS 192.420(1) creates a \u201cstatutory presumption that documents will be disclosed to the public.\u201d <em>City of Portland v. Oregonian Publishing Co., </em>200 Or App 120, 124, 112 P3d 457 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cExemptions are to be narrowly construed, <em>i.e., </em>they are to be made on an individualized basis and are to be based on a sufficient showing of justification.\u201d <em>Guard Publishing Co. v. Lane County School Dist., </em>310 Or 32, 39, 719 P2d 854 (1990). \u201cTh[e] \u2018narrow construction\u2019 rule can be applied to resolve ambiguity about the scope of a statutory public records exemption\u201d so that, \u201cif there is a plausible construction of a statute favoring disclosure of public records, that is the construction that prevails.\u201d <em>Colby v. Gunson, </em>224 Or App 666, 676, 199 P3d 350 (2008).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">A public body that withholds records as exempt from disclosure has the initial burden in a review proceeding of showing that a claimed exemption applies. ORS 192.490(1) (\u201c[T]he burden is on the public body to sustain its action.\u201d); <em>see Mail Tribune, Inc. v. Winters, </em>236 Or App 91, 95, 237 P3d 831 (2010). \u201cTo satisfy that burden, a public body must establish exemptions from disclosure \u2018on an individualized basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mail Tribune, Inc., </em>236 Or App at 95 (quoting <em>Guard Publishing Co., </em>310 Or at 39). In establishing whether an exemption applies, a public body may conclude that the individual requesting disclosure has not met the showing required by the text of the statutory exemption. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 192.496(1) (establishing exemption for medical records \u201cif the public disclosure thereof would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy\u201d but providing that the requestor has \u201cthe burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance and that public disclosure would not constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">III. PATIENT INFORMATION</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">OHSU initially asserts that information about the physical care and medical treatment of an identified person that is contained in a patient tort claim notice (including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the name of the patient, the date of the allegedly negligent treatment, and the name of the patient\u2019s attorney) is exempt from disclosure for two reasons. First, OHSU claims that the information is contained in a medical record that is entirely exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.496(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\">\u201cThe following public records are exempt from disclosure:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201c(1) Records less than 75 years old which contain information about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment of a living individual, if the public disclosure thereof would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy. The party seeking disclosure shall have the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance and that public disclosure would not constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Second, OHSU contends that the nondisclosed information from patient tort claim notices is exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(2), which exempts the following records from disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201cInformation of a personal nature such as but not limited to that kept in a personal, medical or similar file, if public disclosure would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy, unless the public interest by clear and convincing evidence requires disclosure in the particular instance. The party seeking disclosure shall have the burden of showing that public disclosure would not constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In OHSU\u2019s view, direct or indirect patient identification information in a tort claim notice, including the name of the patient, date of the tort, and name of the patient\u2019s attorney, is \u201cinformation about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment of a living individual\u201d and \u201c[ijnformation of a personal nature,\u201d the disclosure of which would be an unreasonable invasion of privacy without any clear public interest in favor of disclosure. More specifically, OHSU suggests that <em>any </em>disclosure of individually identifiable health information is an unreasonable invasion of privacy under either statutory exemption because: (1) that type of information is given special protection limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>disclosure in civil discovery under ORCP 55 H;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) ORS 192.553 to 192.581 categorizes that type of information as protected under state law and creates privacy rights in its nondisclosure;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (3) the Privacy Rule classifies that information as \u201cprotected health information\u201d and requires that it be kept confidential in the circumstances of this case; (4) as evidenced by a survey placed in the trial court record, reasonable persons would not wish or expect that written complaints about their health care would be released to the public; and (5) release of the information by OHSU would expose it to liability to the affected patients for the common law tort of unreasonable invasion of privacy. OHSU finally suggests that The Oregonian did not produce clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe public interest requires disclosure\u201d in these instances under ORS 192.496(1) and ORS 192.502(2), given that disclosure would be an unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>invasion of privacy and that there are public interests in <em>nondisclosure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Additionally, OHSU argues that, because the information is \u201cprotected health information\u201d and is confidential under the Privacy Rule, it is exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(8) (exempting from disclosure \u201c[a]ny public records or information the disclosure of which is prohibited by federal law or regulations\u201d). According to OHSU, HIPPA protected information is exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(8) independent of the question whether that disclosure would be unreasonable or in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The Oregonian responds that it did not seek the disclosure of \u201cinformation about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment of a living individual\u201d under ORS 192.496(1), nor did it seek \u201c[information of a personal nature\u201d under ORS 192.502(2). Rather, it sought the claimant names, tort dates, and attorney names in tort claim notices filed during a particular period. Moreover, with respect to ORS 192.496(1), The Oregonian asserts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201c [d] efendant does not seek any \u2018information about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment\u2019 of any person. ORS 192.505 requires a public body to segregate nonexempt material from any exempt material within a record. That a given document might otherwise \u2018contain\u2019 medical information within it does not exempt all information in that document from disclosure. ORS 192.496 does not provide a basis for exemption of the information defendant seeks, the names of persons who have filed tort claim notices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In all events, according to The Oregonian, the information in the patient tort claim notices is not private (primarily because it is disclosed in a legal demand intended for use in litigation that might be filed), nor is there a right of confidentiality about that information under state or federal law. Finally, The Oregonian argues that, without showing what particular health or personal information was part of the tort claim notices, OHSU has not met its burden to make a \u201csufficient showing of justification\u201d to prove that an exemption applies on an \u201cindividualized basis\u201d under <em>Guard Publishing Co., </em>310 Or at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>A. <em>Application of the Privacy Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">As noted, OHSU submits that, because the information sought by The Oregonian from the patient tort claim notices is protected health information under the Privacy Rule, it is exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(8). In relevant part, the Privacy Rule prohibits a \u201ccovered entity\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from disclosing protected health information, unless an exception applies. <em>See </em>45 CFR \u00a7 164.502(a) (\u201cA covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose protected health information, except as permitted or required by this subpart or by subpart C of part 160 of this subchap-ter.\u201d). \u201cProtected health information\u201d includes \u201cindividually identifiable health information,\u201d defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\"><em>\u201cIndividually identifiable health information </em>is information * * * [that includes] demographic information collected from an individual, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201c(1) Is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201c(2) Relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u201c(i) That identifies the individual; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">\u201c(ii) With respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">45 CFR \u00a7 160.103 (emphasis in original); <em>see also </em>42 USC \u00a7 1320d(6). In a provision related to procedures for notifying patients of data breaches, the Privacy Rule lists examples of types of protected health information, which include a patient\u2019s \u201cfull name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code, or other types of information.\u201d 45 CFR \u00a7 164.404(c)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>We assume, for our purposes, that the patient name, date of the alleged medical care tort, and name of the patient\u2019s attorney in the tort claim notices relate to the claimant\u2019s condition or provision of health care and can identify the patient or provide a reasonable basis that can be used to identify the patient. If that is true, the information is \u201cindividually identifiable health information\u201d and \u201cprotected health information\u201d under the Privacy Rule and subject to the nondisclosure requirement of 45 CFR section 164.502(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The Privacy Rule, however, allows disclosure of protected information when that disclosure is \u201crequired by law.\u201d 45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(a)(1). The Oregonian argues that disclosure of the public records containing the requested information is \u201crequired\u201d by ORS 192.420(1), which confers a \u201cright to inspect any public record of a public body in this state, except as otherwise expressly provided by ORS 192.501 to 192.505,\u201d and that no exemption from disclosure under state law mitigates that requirement. OHSU counters that the Privacy Rule prohibits the disclosure of protected health information so that disclosure of that information is inhibited (and not \u201crequired\u201d) by ORS 192.502(8) (exempting from disclosure \u201c[a]ny public records or information the disclosure of which is prohibited by federal law or regulations\u201d). OHSU also contends that the definition of \u201crequired by law\u201d at 45 CFR section 164.103 does not contemplate the disclosure of protected health information under a public records law.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">45 CFR section 164.103 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\"><em>\u201cRequired by law </em>means a mandate contained in law that compels an entity to make a use or disclosure of protected health information and that is enforceable in a court of law. <em>Required by law </em>includes, but is not limited to, court orders and court-ordered warrants; subpoenas or summons issued by a court, grand jury, a governmental or tribal inspector general, or an administrative body authorized to require the production of information; a civil or an authorized investigative demand; Medicare conditions of participation with respect to health care providers participating in the program; and statutes or regulations that require the production of information, including statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>or regulations that require such information if payment is sought under a government program providing public benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">(Emphases in original.) In OHSU\u2019s view, a public records law is not like those required disclosures and, therefore, would not fit the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We conclude that, if the information is not otherwise exempt from disclosure under the OPRL, its disclosure is \u201crequired by\u201d ORS 192.420 and, accordingly, allowed by 45 CFR section 164.512(a)(1). That disclosure requirement is the plain meaning of the \u201cright to inspect\u201d conferred by ORS 192.420 and its companion policy in ORS 192.440(1) that the \u201ccustodian of any public record that a person has a right to inspect shall give the person, upon request\u201d either \u201c[a] copy of the public record\u201d or \u201c[a] reasonable opportunity to inspect or copy the public record.\u201d Under 45 CFR section 164.103, the statutory disclosure requirements are \u201cmandate [s] contained in law that compel [] an entity to make a * * * disclosure\u201d that are \u201cenforceable in a court of law\u201d under ORS 192.490 (court authority in reviewing action denying right to inspect public records).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">If disclosure of protected health information is allowed by 45 CFR section 164.512(a)(1) because it is otherwise \u201crequired by\u201d ORS 192.420, then that disclosure is not \u201cprohibited by federal law\u201d under ORS 192.502(8). We reject OHSU\u2019s assertion that \u201cfederal law\u201d refers only to the disclosure limitations in the Privacy Rule and does not include the disclosure allowances in that same rule. The obvious meaning of \u201cfederal law\u201d is the entire law; the entire operation of the Privacy Rule excuses the nondisclosure limitation in 45 CFR section 164.502(a) if the disclosure is \u201crequired by\u201d an enforceable state law under 45 CFR section 164.512(a)(1). Put another way, whether any protected health information in the patient tort claim notices must be disclosed under the Privacy Rule and the OPRL depends entirely on whether an exemption from disclosure exists under ORS 192.496(1) and ORS 192.502(2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>B. <em>Application of ORS 192.496(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">As noted, ORS 192.496(1) exempts from disclosure</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">\u201c [r] ecords less than 75 years old which contain information about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment of a living individual, if the public disclosure thereof would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy.

That is to say, because a tort claim notice is required to disclose the \u201ccircumstances giving rise to the claim,\u201d ORS 30.275(4)(b), a medical treatment tort claim notice necessarily would describe \u201cthe physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment\u201d of the claimant and the notice might then qualify as a nondisclosable record under ORS 192.496(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Assuming that the patient tort claim notices qualified as exempt records under ORS 192.496(1), the parties framed the question to be whether certain information in those potentially exempt records (name of the patient, date of the tort, name of the patient\u2019s attorney) must be disclosed under ORS 192.505. That statute requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">\u201cIf any public record contains material which is not exempt under ORS 192.501 and 192.502, as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">In light of the issue framed by the parties, the trial court concluded that the name of the patient, date of the tort, and name of the patient\u2019s attorney in a patient tort claim notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>is not \u201cinformation about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment\u201d of the patient, and, therefore, is not exempt from disclosure. Thus, the court ordered that OHSU \u201cmake [that] nonexempt material available for examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\">However, the parties led the court down the wrong path. ORS 192.496 describes four types of records that are entirely exempt from disclosure: medical records, sealed records, custodial records, and student records. ORS 192.496(1) exempts from disclosure all\u2014and any part of\u2014a medical record that qualifies under the statute. In order to properly apply ORS 192.496(1), under the plain meaning of its text, a court must evaluate whether the record contains \u201cinformation about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment of a living individual.\u201d If it does, then the court must determine whether the disclosure of that health, care, or treatment information \u201cwould not constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy\u201d and is otherwise in \u201cthe public interest.\u201d If the medical record qualifies, and disclosure of the record with that information is not otherwise warranted, then the record, in whole or in part, is exempt from disclosure. The trial court did not conduct that evaluation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Instead of determining whether the entire record was exempt from disclosure, the court applied ORS 192.505, concluded that the patient tort claim notices contained \u201cmaterial which is not exempt under ORS 192.501 and 192.502 [claimant name, the name of the claimant\u2019s attorney, and the date of the tort], as well as material which is exempt from disclosure,\u201d and ordered OHSU to make that \u201cnonexempt material available for examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In doing so, the reviewing court misconstrued ORS 192.505, which does not apply to a medical record that otherwise qualifies as exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.496(1). On its face, ORS 192.505 applies only to records that contain material that is nonexempt and material that is exempt from disclosure \u201cunder ORS 192.501 and 192.502.\u201d The medical records in question contain material that might be exempt from disclosure under a different statute, ORS 192.496(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>More broadly, however, we have construed ORS 192.505 to apply to public record exemptions that classify <em>information in a record </em>as exempt from disclosure\u2014so as to require the sorting of that information from other information to be disclosed in the record\u2014and not to apply to exemptions that classify an <em>entire record </em>as exempt from disclosure for which no sorting is necessary. Thus, in <em>Brown v. Guard Publishing Co., </em>267 Or App 552, 554, 341 P3d 145 (2014), a newspaper sought disclosure of an energy supply contract between a municipal utility and an energy company. The municipal utility claimed that the contract was exempt from disclosure, and relied upon ORS 192.502(26), which exempts from disclosure certain \u201c[sensitive business, commercial or financial information\u201d furnished to or developed by a public body engaged in the business of providing electricity if \u201cdisclosure of the information would cause a competitive disadvantage for the public body or its retail electricity customers.\u201d At issue was whether the contract should be treated as exempt in its entirety or whether the municipal utility was required to separate out, and disclose, any nonexempt material within the contract under ORS 192.505. We noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">\u201c[a]s will later prove important, each of the exemptions in ORS 192.502 is worded slightly differently. Some of the exemptions describe particular types of documents and categorically exempt those documents from disclosure. <em>E.g., </em>ORS 192.520(32) (exempting county election security plans); *** ORS 192.502(7), (15) (exempting certain \u2018reports\u2019). Other exemptions, however, are phrased in terms of particular types of data or information within public records. <em>E.g., </em>ORS 192.502(3) (\u2018Public body employee or volunteer addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and telephone numbers contained in personnel records maintained by the public body that is the employer or the recipient of volunteer services.\u2019). Thus, although the definition of \u2018public records\u2019\u2014and, by incorporation, the exemptions * * *\u2014are phrased in terms of whether a writing \u2018contains\u2019 information related to public business, the specific exemptions themselves may apply to a writing in whole or in part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">267 Or App at 563-64. We concluded that ORS 192.505, requiring separation of exempt and nonexempt material in the provision of public records, applies only to the exemptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>within ORS 192.501 and ORS 192.502 that apply to parts of a writing. <em>Id. </em>at 564-65. ORS 192.502(26) was such an exemption, and the case was remanded to the trial court for application of the exemption to parts of the energy supply contract. <em>Id. </em>at 569-70<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In light of the reasoning in <em>Brown, </em>we conclude that the reviewing court erred in applying ORS 192.496(1) to classify information within a patient tort claim notice as subject to disclosure under ORS 192.505. Instead, application of ORS 192.496(1) necessarily requires examination of the actual \u201cinformation about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment of a living individual\u201d that is contained in the public record to determine whether the exemption applies, and then consideration of whether \u201cthe public disclosure thereof would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy.\u201d Thus, the court erred in granting The Oregonian\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the patient health information without a sufficient record to determine the application of ORS 192.496(1) to public records containing that information. <em>See </em>ORS 192.490(1) (in a public records review proceeding, the \u201ccourt, on its own motion, may view the documents in controversy in camera before reaching a decision\u201d)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the application of ORS 192.496(1) on remand may obviate the need to consider the applicability of ORS 192.502(2), we remand to the circuit court to make that determination only if it becomes necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">IV. EMPLOYMENT-RELATED TORT CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The reviewing court ordered disclosure of the name of the claimant in the two tort claim notices pertaining to employment liability. One of the claims was from a faculty member; the other was not. OHSU disclosed the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>of the alleged tort and the name of the claimant\u2019s attorney for those two claims. It argues that the identity of the non-faculty employee-claimant is \u201c[information of a personal nature\u201d under ORS 192.502(2) and exempt from disclosure. As noted, ORS 192.502(2) exempts from disclosure</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">\u201c[information of a personal nature such as but not limited to that kept in a personal, medical or similar file, if public disclosure would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy, unless the public interest by clear and convincing evidence requires disclosure in the particular instance. The party seeking disclosure shall have the burden of showing that public disclosure would not constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In contrast to ORS 192.496, ORS 192.502(2) is framed to exempt \u201cinformation\u201d instead of \u201crecords.\u201d Thus, the issue is whether the name of the claimant can be excluded, under ORS 192.502(2), from the other information disclosed from the record under ORS 192.420. In <em>Mail Tribune, Inc., </em>236 Or App at 96, we framed the test for an exemption under ORS 192.502(2) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cThe personal privacy exemption may be invoked by a public custodian of records upon evidence that (1) the information is personal in nature and (2) disclosure would unreasonably invade privacy. If the public body produces evidence to satisfy those criteria, the burden shifts to the party seeking disclosure, who must show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the public interest nonetheless demands disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Here, OHSU argues that the identity of the nonfaculty employment tort claimant is \u201c[information of a personal nature\u201d because \u201c[disclosure of the employee\u2019s name in that context establishes that the identified employee asserts that her employment was adversely affected with resulting financial, physical, mental or emotional injury.\u201d OHSU explains that \u201c[t]here are manifest public interests in employment privacy related to the nature of employment claims, which are implicated by disclosure of an employee\u2019s name to a newspaper * \u215c *.\u201d We conclude that the name of a claimant in a tort claim notice is not \u201c information of a personal nature\u201d exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>In <em>Jordan v. MVD, </em>308 Or 433, 441, 781 P2d 1203 (1989), the Supreme Court construed the plain meaning of \u2018^Information of a personal nature\u201d in ORS 192.502(2) to be information that was \u201cspecific to one individual.\u201d We expanded on the plain meaning of the phrase in <em>City of Portland v. Anderson, </em>163 Or App 550, 555, 988 P2d 402 (1999). The issue in <em>Anderson </em>was whether ORS 192.502(2) exempted from disclosure records of a disciplinary investigation against a police officer. We concluded that the city failed to prove under ORS 192.502(2) either that the information in the disciplinary records was information of a personal nature or that disclosing the records would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 556-57. We also set out the dictionary definition of \u201cpersonal\u201d that we had relied on in <em>Jordan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">\u201c\u2018Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, at 1686 (Unabridged 1971), defines \u201cpersonal\u201d as meaning \u201c1: of or relating to a particular person: affecting one individual or each of many individuals: peculiar or proper to private concerns: not public or general *** <em>(personal </em>baggage): *** 6: exclusively for a given individual (a <em>personal </em>letter) **$\u00bb&gt;\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 555 (quoting <em>Jordan, </em>308 Or at 441 (emphasis in <em>Jordan)). </em>In determining that the information in the disciplinary file was not information of a personal nature, we concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cthe records in this case, although relating to a specific individual, also have a bearing on his qualification to serve in a position of public trust. The tension between individually specific information and its reflection on matters of public concern is also present in the dictionary definition of the word \u2018personal\u2019 endorsed by the court in <em>Jordan. </em>On the one hand, \u2018personal\u2019 means \u2018relating\u2019 to a particular person. On the other hand, \u2018personal\u2019 means \u2018peculiar or proper to private concerns: not public or general.\u2019 Although the disputed records in this case pertain specifically to [the police officer], they do not affect him exclusively and are not peculiar to his private concerns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Here, while the claimant identification in the tort claim notice does relate to a particular person, it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u201cpeculiar to [the claimant\u2019s] private concerns.\u201d Instead, the claimant identification is made to qualify the tort claim notice as sufficient under ORS 30.275(4)(c) (requiring formal tort claim notices to contain the \u201cname of the claimant\u201d). ORS 30.279(2) requires that a tort claim notice be given to a public body within 180 days after an alleged loss or injury that did not result in death. The timely filing of a sufficient tort claim notice is a necessary predicate to maintaining a tort claim against a public body or its agents. ORS 30.275(1). The purposes of an early and sufficient tort claim notice are to allow a timely investigation of the merits of the claim and a possibility of quick resolution, a process that necessarily requires examination of the information in the tort claim notice and processing of the claim by a number of public employees and agents. The claimant identification information in a tort claim notice is necessary to advance those purposes and to comply with statutory requirements, all of which are matters of public concern that are rooted in statutory policy. The reviewing court did not err in concluding that the name of the claimant in the nonfaculty employment tort claim notice was not \u201c[i]nformation of a personal nature\u201d under ORS 192.502(2) and, thus, was subject to disclosure under the OPRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">OHSU argues that the tort claim notice by a faculty member is not a public record under ORS 353.260. That statute relates to personnel records maintained by OHSU. Under ORS 353.260(7), the term \u201cpersonnel records\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201crecords containing information kept by the university concerning a faculty member and furnished by the faculty member or by others about the faculty member at the member\u2019s or at the university\u2019s request, including but not limited to information concerning discipline, membership activity, employment performance or other personal records of individual persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">ORS 353.260(1) authorizes OHSU to \u201cadopt policies governing access to university personnel records that are less than 25 years old.\u201d ORS 353.260(2) requires those policies to \u201crequire that personnel records be subjected to restrictions on access unless the president of the university finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>that the public interest in maintaining individual rights to privacy in an adequate educational environment would not suffer by disclosure of such records.\u201d ORS 353.260(6) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">\u201c[a]ny category of personnel records specifically designated as confidential pursuant to valid policies or orders as provided in this section shall not be deemed a public record for the purposes of ORS 192.420.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">OHSU claims that, under its adopted policies, all \u201cinformation in the personnel file, apart from that identified above [stating exceptions that do not include tort claim notices], shall be confidential and restricted to access as hereinafter set forth.\u201d OHSU asserts that this designation suffices to disqualify the faculty member tort claim notice as a public record under ORS 353.260(6). We disagree. The summary judgment record does not show that the faculty member tort claim notice is actually \u201cin the personnel file\u201d of the affected faculty member. Instead, the record shows that the tort claim notices are regularly kept by claims managers in OHSU\u2019s risk management department. Accordingly, the reviewing court did not err in concluding that the faculty member tort claim notice is a public record subject to disclosure under ORS 192.420.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">V. STUDENT-RELATED TORT CLAIM NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">OHSU finally claims that the court erred in ordering disclosure of the student name in the tort claim notice pertaining to \u201cgeneral liability involving students.\u201d OHSU asserts that the information is exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(8) as \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is prohibited by federal law or regulations.\u201d Specifically, OHSU contends that FERPA applies to OHSU and protects the privacy of a student\u2019s \u201ceducation records.\u201d 20 USC \u00a7 1232g. FERPA implementing regulations define \u201ceducation records\u201d to mean \u201cthose records that are *** [d]irectly related to a student * * * [and] [m]aintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution.\u201d 34 CFR \u00a7 99.3. We conclude that a student tort claim notice is not an \u201ceducation record\u201d if it is not \u201cdirectly related to a student [\u215b]\u201d activities or status as a student. We remand to the reviewing court to examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tort claim notice \u201cinvolving students\u201d to determine whether it describes and directly relates to activities of a student or the educational status of a student. If it does, then the record may be exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">VI. CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In sum, we conclude that any information contained in a patient tort claim notice may be exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.496(1) if the notice contains \u201cinformation about the physical or mental health or psychiatric care or treatment of a living individual,\u201d the disclosure of which would be an unreasonable invasion of privacy, and if The Oregonian has not shown that \u201cthe public interest requires disclosure [of the record] in the particular instance.\u201d We also conclude that any information in the student tort claim notice may be exempt from disclosure if the notice describes and directly relates to activities of a student or the educational status of a student. We remand the case to the reviewing court to make those determinations. The reviewing court did not err in directing the disclosure of the other information. Because The Oregonian may no longer be entitled to an award of attorney fees as a matter of right, ORS 192.490(3), we reverse the supplemental judgment awarding those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\"> When Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 1996, it empowered the federal Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to promulgate regulations related to the protection of patient health information and the circumstances under which that information could be disclosed if Congress failed to enact legislation addressing those matters within three years. <em>Citizens for Health v.
