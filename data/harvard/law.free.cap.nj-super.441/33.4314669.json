Robinson entered a negotiated plea of guilty to second-degree unlawful possession of a handgun, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b, and was sentenced to a prison term of five years, with a mandatory three-year period of parole ineligibility. Defendant appeals from the denial of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>motion to suppress the handgun, renewing his argument to the trial court that the police were required to obtain a warrant before searching his car. We agree and reverse the denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The only witness at the suppression hearing was the arresting officer. According to the officer, he was on routine patrol in Galloway Township at approximately 12:55 a.m. when he noticed defendant\u2019s car pull onto the highway from a motel parking lot in \u201ca high-crime, high-drug area.\u201d The officer watched as the driver twice activated his right turn signal, first to turn into a convenience store and then to enter a jug handle for a U-turn, only to quickly cut back into his lane both times. Although acknowledging that the driver signaled the lane change back onto the highway each time, the officer termed the conduct a \u201clittle suspicious.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He followed the ear onto the Garden State Parkway and initiated a motor vehicle stop after he noticed an air freshener hanging from the interior rearview mirror that \u201cappeared it could have been a windshield obstruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Upon approaching from the passenger side, the officer found four young black people in the car. Defendant, who was driving, immediately handed over the ear registration and insurance card and said his license was suspended. The car did not belong to any of the occupants, and none could provide the name of the owner. The officer, noticing an open beer bottle in the back seat and that no one was wearing a seat belt, asked the passengers for identification as well. Two of the passengers produced identification cards, neither having a driver\u2019s license. All were cooperative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>When the officer returned to his patrol car to radio dispatch with the information he had obtained from the group, he learned that defendant and one of the men in the backseat, Terr\u00f3n Henderson, had open warrants and that both were known to carry weapons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The officer called for backup and a decision was made to \u201cproceed tactically and in a high-risk fashion.\u201d Four additional cars quickly arrived and all five officers approached the car with guns drawn. Defendant and Henderson were arrested, searched, handcuffed and placed into patrol cars without incident. No contraband was found on either man. The other two passengers, the ones without drivers\u2019 licenses, were also removed at gunpoint, patted down for weapons and detained on the side of the road, away from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">After all of the occupants had been removed and defendant and Henderson arrested, the officer testified that his sergeant directed him to \u201cconduct a sweep of the interior of the vehicle ... [t]o check for weapons.\u201d According to the officer, he checked under the front seats and \u201ccommon areas where a weapon could be hidden.\u201d When he lifted the purse the front seat passenger had left on her seat, he felt a heavy object in the bottom. Touching it, he could feel the outline of a gun. The officer opened the purse and retrieved a loaded .38 caliber revolver. The officers placed the other two passengers under arrest, towed the ear and obtained a search warrant for the vehicle. Nothing further was recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The judge determined the officer lawfully stopped the car based on defendant having committed, in the officer\u2019s judgment, \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>number of motor vehicle offenses as evidenced by the motor vehicle summonses ultimately issued in the case,\u201d namely unsafe lane change, windshield obstruction and careless driving. The judge concluded that the information the officer received from dispatch, that defendant and Henderson had outstanding warrants and were known to carry weapons, gave the officer ample reason to have ordered the men out of the car. Finding that the officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous, the judge concluded that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae0\">certainly reasonable to believe that the weapon may have been located somewhere within the vehicle, possibly hidden in a purse or certainly secreted on top of a car seat or anywhere else, and that certainly is reasonable for officers to want to protect themselves and the public ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">As such, the court concludes the State has demonstrated by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the motor vehicle stop was lawful and appropriate. The police acted reasonably in the totality of the circumstances in performing the protective sweep, so-called <em>Terry[</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark>] frisk, of the interior of the car, and the ... purse for officer\u2019s safety and the protection of the public and, as such, falls within the exception to the warrant requirement including the evidence of crime, namely, the handgun shall be admissible in trial against the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Our review begins with familiar principles. We defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings on a motion to suppress unless they were \u201cclearly mistaken\u201d or \u201cso wide of the mark\u201d that the interests of justice require appellate intervention. <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 245, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007). Our review of the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts, however, is plenary. <em>State v. Rockford, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>424, 440, 64 A.3d 514 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Because the parties agree on the facts, our focus, like theirs, is on the judge\u2019s application of the law to those established facts. The State argues, as it has since the inception of the matter, that the protective sweep and plain-feel exceptions to the warrant requirement justified the warrantless search of the ear. It also contends that defendant lacked the requisite expectation of privacy in his passenger\u2019s purse to challenge the search. Defendant contends that the protective sweep doctrine does not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>automobiles and that the police needed to obtain a warrant before searching his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">After the judge rendered his decision, and the parties filed their briefs in this court, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>State v. Gamble, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>412, 95 A.3d 188 (2014), limning the permissible protective sweep of the passenger compartment of an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\"><em>Gamble </em>arose out of two anonymous late night 9-1-1 calls, the first reporting \u201cshots fired\u201d and the second, an individual sitting in a tan van with a gun on his lap. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 95 A.3d 188. When officers responded to the high-crime neighborhood, they spotted the van and approached with guns drawn. <em>Ibid. </em>The officers watched the two occupants move frantically about as they neared and ordered the men out of the van. <em>Ibid. </em>The passenger did as directed, but the driver, after starting to comply, attempted to duck back into his seat. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 95 A.3d 188. Fearing that the driver could have been going for a gun, one of the officers struck the driver and pulled him from the vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>Officers frisked the men for weapons but found nothing. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Neither man was under arrest at that point. Before allowing the men to return to the van, one of the officers went to search the interior. <em>Ibid. </em>The officer testified that as he entered the vehicle, he saw the handle of a handgun sticking up from the center console. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">After reviewing federal and State law regarding the protective sweep exception to the warrant requirement, the Court applied the doctrine to the facts before it. First, the Court found that the 9-1-1 calls, corroborated by the police finding the van in the location it was reported, combined with the high-crime neighborhood, the late hour and the furtive movements of the occupants as the officers approached, created a reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify the investigatory stop. <em>Id. </em>at 431, 95 A.3d 188. Those circumstances, in addition to the driver\u2019s retreat to his seat after the officers had ordered him out of the van, created reasonable suspicion \u201cthat defendant was dangerous and could gain immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ate access to a weapon, specifically the handgun that had been reported in the 9-1-1 call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 95 A.3d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Turning to the protective sweep of the van, the Court noted that it occurred only after the frisk of the van\u2019s occupants revealed that neither carried a weapon. <em>Ibid. </em>Because of the circumstances that had precipitated the officers\u2019 arrival on the scene and the men\u2019s conduct, the frisk, however, heightened rather than allayed the officers\u2019 concern that there was a gun in the van that would be easily accessible to the men when allowed to return to the vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>Considering those circumstances, the Court held that the same rationale of allowing a cursory visual inspection for the safety of police officers that had justified protective sweeps of a home in <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>325, 327, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1093, 1094, 108 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 276, 281 (1990) and <em>State v. Davila, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>97, 116, 999 A.2d 1116 (2010), \u201capplies equally to limited protective searches of vehicles, where officers are permitted to \u2018ferret out weapons that might be used against police officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gamble, supra, 218 N.J. </em>at <em>433, 95 A.3d 188 </em>(quoting <em>Davila, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at <em>129, 999 </em>A.2d 1116).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Based on the confluence of the facts before it, the Court concluded that \u201conce the officer completed the pat down of defendant and did not locate the gun, it was reasonable for the officer to believe the van contained a gun. To permit defendant and his passenger to reenter the van before ensuring that it did not contain a weapon ignores the risk to officers and public safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434, 95 A.3d 188. It thus determined that \u201cthe narrowly confined visual sweep of the passenger compartment, which revealed a handgun protruding from the center console, was permissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 95 A.3d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Applying the rationale of <em>Gamble </em>to the established facts, we think it clear the search of defendant\u2019s car was impermissible. The police arrested defendant and Henderson after learning from dispatch the men had open warrants. The searches of then-persons were conducted incident to arrest. <em>See State v. Dangerfield, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>446, 461, 795 A.2d 250 (2002) (describing purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>and scope of contemporaneous search incident to arrest exception to the warrant requirement). Unlike the driver and passenger in <em>Gamble, </em>defendant and Henderson were handcuffed and placed in patrol cars; neither was going to return to the ear where there might be a weapon they could use against the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The other two passengers, while not under arrest, were not licensed to drive. Although the arresting officer conceded \u201cin hindsight\u201d that none of the occupants was going to be allowed to drive the car away, he testified \u201cthat was not the first thing on my mind. I would have figured that out after I finished my sweep and made [sure] everything was safe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The point, of course, is that there was no demonstrable need to sweep the car to make sure everything was safe for the officers after defendant and Henderson had been placed under arrest and secured in patrol ears. <em>See State v. Eckel, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>528, 541, 888 A.2d 1266 (2006) (holding that a search of a passenger compartment of a car incident to arrest cannot be sustained where the occupant has been \u201carrested, removed[,] and secured elsewhere,\u201d because the potential for obtaining a weapon has been eliminated).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Unlike in <em>Gamble, </em>neither the searches of defendant and Henderson, nor the protective frisks of the two unlicensed passengers reasonably heightened the officers\u2019 concerns for the presence of a weapon in the car that could be used against them. Although dispatch reported that defendant and Henderson were known to carry weapons, there were no reports of anyone seeing a weapon in their possession that evening or hearing shots fired in their vicinity. The officer did not observe furtive movements upon his initial approach as if the occupants might be trying to conceal a weapon. And none of the occupants made any attempt to retreat to the car as if trying to get at a gun. The officer testified that all of the occupants of the car were calm and cooperative. In short, there were no facts to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the ear contained a gun, and, more importantly, that the unlicensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>passengers posed a danger to the officers requiring a protective sweep of the car after the arrest of defendant and Henderson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">At argument before us, the State contended that the officer\u2019s protective sweep was reasonable because the unlicensed occupants would have been allowed to return to the car to await rescue by a licensed driver or to retrieve their belongings. We reject this argument. First, the officer did not testify that he intended to allow the unlicensed drivers to return to the car for any reason. This stop was conducted on the Garden State Parkway after midnight. The officer several times referred to that fact and its significance for the safety of the officers and the occupants of the car.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Second, there was no testimony that the unlicensed occupants asked to return to the car to retrieve their belongings. We cannot speculate about what might have occurred had the officer chosen not to sweep the car. What we have is the officer\u2019s testimony that his sergeant directed him to sweep the car after defendant and Henderson were handcuffed, and that he did so without considering that the unlicensed passengers would not be driving the car away. When pressed on cross-examination for justification of the sweep under those circumstances, the officer offered, \u201c[bjecause as far as I\u2019m aware, there\u2019s still two people unhandcuffed, there could still have been a weapon in the ear that someone could have access to even if I didn\u2019t let them back in the ear, and I wasn\u2019t about to let some other person, whoever we can get to pick up the car, go into the car if there was a weapon in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The Court\u2019s carefully crafted opinion in <em>Gamble </em>teaches that there must be facts sufficient to support a reasonable suspicion on the part of the officer of the presence of a weapon within easy reach of a person returning to the vehicle, whom the officer has reasonably concluded poses a danger to the officers or others before a protective sweep of the car can be justified. A review of the transcript makes plain that there were no facts developed on this record to support a reasonable suspicion that the car contained a gun or that the unlicensed passengers posed any threat to the officers. The record on this motion simply does not support the State\u2019s argument that the unlicensed passengers would be returning to the ear or that their doing so posed any threat to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We also reject the State\u2019s argument that defendant lacked the requisite expectation of privacy in his passenger\u2019s purse to successfully challenge the search here. As the officer\u2019s testimony made clear, he was searching the passenger compartment of defendant\u2019s car, not his passenger\u2019s purse. Because defendant\u2019s possessory interest in the car in which the purse was found is obvious, the State\u2019s argument is plainly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>528, 547, 940 A.2d 1185 (2008) (explaining that in typical case the notion of possessory or proprietary interest in thing searched or item seized is clear and no inquiry into individual\u2019s substantive right of privacy is required).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Our dissenting colleague concludes that the search of defendant\u2019s car could be justified as either a legitimate protective sweep under <em>Gamble </em>and <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>1032, 1051-52, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>3469, 3481-82, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201, 1221-22 (1983), or under the community caretaking doctrine explained in <em>State v. Navarro, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>104, 108, 708 A.2d 416 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>382, 718 A.2d 1211 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Here is why we think he is wrong. Defendant and Henderson, the two occupants of the car with open warrants and the ones known to carry weapons, had been subject to a full custodial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>arrest and were already secured in the back of separate patrol ears at the time of the officer\u2019s search. There can be no doubt that if they had been the only occupants of the ear, this search would have been illegal under both federal and State law. <em>See Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 <em>U.S. </em>332, 343, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>1710, 1719, 173 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>485, 496 (2009) (holding police may \u201csearch a vehicle incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest only when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>); <em>Eckel, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 541, 888 A.2d 1266. The question then becomes how the presence of the two unlicensed occupants might change that clear result.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The dissent focuses on the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that there still may have been a gun in the car. Accepting that might be so, we are left to wonder what evidence the police possessed to conclude the unlicensed passengers posed any danger to them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Michigan v. Long </em>permits an officer to search a car\u2019s passenger compartment only when the officer \u201chas reasonable suspicion that an individual, whether or not the arrestee, is \u2018dangerous\u2019 and might access the vehicle to \u2018gain immediate control of weapons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gant, supra, </em>556 <em>U.S. </em>at 346-47, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1721, 173 L.Ed.2d at 498 (quoting <em>Michigan v. Long, supra, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>at 1049, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d at 1201).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Once the police decided to proceed \u201ctactically,\u201d the unlicensed passengers, who had cooperated with the police by presenting identification when asked, who had no discernible criminal records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>and who had not engaged in any suspicious behavior or committed any traffic offense, were ordered out of the car at gunpoint and frisked by one of the five officers on the scene. The officer testified they were removed from the car after defendant and Henderson were arrested and searched. The State, which bore the burden of proving the justification for this warrantless search, <em>State v. Brown, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>508, 517, 88 A.3d 45 (2014), did not elicit testimony explaining why it was necessary to remove those passengers from the car at that point instead of monitoring them in place, <em>see State v. Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>599, 618, 637 A.2d 158 (1994) (holding \u201can officer must be able to point to specific and articula-ble facts that would warrant heightened caution to justify ordering the occupants to step out of a vehicle detained for a traffic violation\u201d), or why their pat downs were warranted, <em>see id. </em>at 619, 637 A.2d 158 (\u201cto justify a pat-down of an occupant once alighted from a vehicle, specific, articulable facts must demonstrate that a \u2018reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 27, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 909).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The testimony that was elicited made clear beyond doubt that the officer swept the ear without first considering whether there was any actual need to do so to ensure officer safety. The officer learned there were no valid drivers in the car before he ever contacted dispatch for a records check.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, he knew the passengers the police had detained but not arrested would not be driving the ear away, yet he failed to consider the implication of that fact on the need to make a protective sweep of the car. Sweeping a car reflexively for officer safety in the absence of a genuine safety concern transforms a protective sweep from an exception to the warrant requirement to a police entitlement, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>result the United States Supreme Court has termed anathema to the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Gant, supra, </em>556 <em>U.S. </em>at 347, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1721, 173 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The officer having swept the car before considering whether the unlicensed passengers would be allowed to return to it, the State was reduced to engaging in a game of \u201cwhat if\u2019 with the officer in order to save the search \u2014 what if the passengers wanted to leave the scene, what if they wanted to retrieve their belongings from the car.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The problem, obviously, is that none of those things actually occurred, and we cannot know what might have happened had the officer chosen a different course.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Our dissenting colleague has fallen prey to the same trap, concluding on the basis of one such hypothetical exchange that had they not found the weapon, \u201cthe officers would not have had the vehicle towed,\u201d <em>post </em>at 52, 116 A.3d at 61, ignoring that at the time he conducted his sweep, the officer did not know whether the occupants were lawfully in possession of the car and that the officer also testified he \u201cwould have taken the time to at least try and contact the registered owner to see who [the car] belonged to and ensure that it was supposed to be in one of their hands.\u201d The dissent concludes that because the police <em>would not </em>have towed the car and the passengers <em>would </em>have been allowed back into the vehicle, two \u201cfacts\u201d unknowable to the officer at the time he conducted his search, \u201cthe officer\u2019s testimony amply supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>trial court\u2019s conclusion that the officer reasonably believed a risk remained.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Post </em>at 52, 116 A.3d at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Searches are judged by what the officer knew at the time the search was conducted. <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 221, 463 A.2d 320 (1983) (\u201cFacts learned by the authorities after the search and seizure occurs will not validate unreasonable intrusions.\u201d). Accepting, as we do for purposes of engaging our colleague\u2019s argument, that a dispatch report that defendant and Henderson were known to carry weapons is sufficient after <em>Gamble </em>to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of a weapon in the car under the circumstances here, it does not suffice to justify this protective sweep under either <em>Michigan v. Long </em>or <em>Gamble. </em>What is lacking are specific, articulable facts in the record to support what the officer also needed to conclude before conducting his sweep, that the unlicensed passengers were dangerous, and that they could access the car to gain immediate control of the suspected weapon to use against the officer or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The judge failed to make any findings on those critical issues because the State failed to elicit the testimony necessary to allow him to do so. In the absence of facts in the record demonstrating the sweep was necessary for the safety of the officers, it cannot be judged objectively reasonable. <em>See Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 219, 463 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Finally, we reject our colleague\u2019s conclusion that this search could be justified under the community caretaking doctrine, a position not urged by the State or considered by the trial court. As the Supreme Court has recently noted, it has applied the doctrine cautiously. <em>State v.

Diloreto, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>264, 282, 850 A.2d 1226 (2004), it took pains to warn the State against construing its approval of the warrantless search and seizure there as \u201capproving wide application of the community caretaker doctrine\u201d in the setting of a car stop. The Court stated emphatically that \u201c[t]he community caretaker doctrine remains a narrow exception to the warrant requirement,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>a position it reaffirmed in <em>Vargas, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 326, 63 A.3d 175 (\u201cUnder our state law jurisprudence \u2014 outside of the car-impoundment context \u2014 warrant-less searches justified in the name of the community-caretaking doctrine have involved some form of exigent or emergent circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Applying the doctrine here, on the basis of the officer\u2019s post hoc justification for the protective sweep when confronted with the fact that the unlicensed drivers would not be taking possession of the ear (\u201cI wasn\u2019t about to let some other person, whoever we can get to pick up the car, go into the car if there was a weapon in the car\u201d), is unwarranted because there was no exigency and an unwise expansion of the doctrine beyond anything contemplated by the Court to date. <em>See State v. Bogan, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>61, 77, 975 A.2d 377 (2009) (discussing parameters of simultaneous engagement of officers in community earetaking and criminal investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Because we have concluded the protective sweep of defendant\u2019s car was not permissible under <em>Gamble, </em>we have no need to consider whether the trial court\u2019s finding of an initial lawful stop, supported by a two-inch by three-inch tree-shaped air freshener hanging from the rear-view mirror and two signaled lane changes, is supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\"> Later in his testimony, the officer said that the driver had not signaled as he returned to the highway either time. He did not, however, consider those movements a motor vehicle violation. \"I just thought it was suspicious, suspicious, not because of [ ] motor vehicle violations, but I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be doing something like that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\"> Although the officer noted in his report that the occupants had given conflicting statements, he clarified in his testimony that the statements were actually consistent.

The officer testified that dispatch informed him \"Mr. Henderson had a traffic warrant and Mr. Robinson had an outstanding NCIC (National Crime Information Center) hit warrant for a drug offense.\u201d The officer testified it made sense to him when dispatch said defendant was known to carry weapons, because he saw the NCIC hit, but \u201d[w]here they got the information on Mr. Henderson, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b63-9\"> <em>Terry v.

These forays are ridiculous to us. How exactly would the passenger have departed the side of the Parkway after 2 a.m. without a car, and what was the likelihood of her asking to retrieve her purse with the loaded .38 inside, or better yet, asking one of the officers to fetch it for her, before she left?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b72-9\"> The dissent relies on other \"facts,\u201d including that defendant and Henderson had lied to police and that defendant \"had been at a motel in an area notorious for drug activity.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 50, 116 A.3d at 60.

Applying that standard to its factual determinations, the trial court in the case before us determined that an officer\u2019s protective sweep of the car defendant had been driving was reasonable.

Gamble, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>412, 427, 95 A.3d 188 (2014).

In resolving the inquiry, \u201cdue weight must be given, not to [the officer\u2019s] inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.\u201d <em>Terry v.

At one o\u2019clock in the morning, the car driven by defendant pulled out of a motel located in a \u201cnotorious high-crime, high-drug area[ ]\u201d where there had been a \u201csignificant amount of ... drug and weapons offenses and other vice offenses____\u201d In response to the officer\u2019s questions, defendant falsely identified himself and claimed that he was driving from Atlantic City to Galloway Township without a license, in the car of a friend whose name he did not know, to take home one of the passengers. Yet, instead of taking a direct route to the passenger\u2019s home, defendant drove onto the Garden State Parkway after the officer had begun to follow him. In addition, when asked where he was coming from, defendant omitted to disclose that he had been at the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Two of the car\u2019s four occupants had outstanding warrants, defendant for a drug offense. Defendant and a passenger were both flagged in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database as known to carry weapons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">The National Crime Information Center is a computerized database of criminal justice information available to law enforcement agencies nationwide____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">NCIC is available to more than 90,000 local law enforcement and criminal justice agencies twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year-____In 2007, there were more than 1.8 billion NCIC queries, with an average of more than five million each day. Underlying those transactions is a concern for the safety of police officers, who are at risk when they approach individuals during a traffic stop. <em>See United States v. Finke, </em>85 F.3d 1275, 1280-81 (7th Cir.1996) (finding that concerns for officer safety supported criminal history check during traffic stop).

The factors included evasive action, lying to the police, other incriminating information about the driver or occupants of the car, absence of identification, and the lateness of the hour. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, \u201cthe high-crime nature of [an] area\u201d may also contribute to that suspicion. <em>State v.

However, that defendant had been at a motel in an area notorious for drug activity was not insignificant. Our Supreme Court has commented on the connection between drug activity and guns. <em>See State v. Spivey, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>229, 240, 844 A.2d 512 (2004) (quoting <em>Report to the Governor by Attorney General on the Need to Update the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1987 </em>(Dec. 9, 1996)) (\u201c \u2018Firearms have become ubiquitous in the world of illegal drug activity.

In addition, other judicially recognized \u201cfactors\u201d supported the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion, including defendant\u2019s evasive action, lying, and the lateness of the hour. Furthermore, defendant had an outstanding warrant for a drug offense and was flagged in the NCIC as known to carry a weapon. The officer\u2019s suspicion, based on the totality of the circumstances, that is, the whole picture, was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The majority points out that, though defendant and another of the car\u2019s occupants were known to carry weapons, there were no reports of anyone seeing a weapon in their possession or hearing shots fired. But the police officer in <em>Terry </em>had no information that the suspects he was observing were carrying guns; he feared the men \u201cmay have a gun\u201d because their \u201celaborately casual and oft-repeated reconnaissance of [a] store window\u201d at 2:30 in the afternoon led him to believe the men were \u201ccasing a job, a stickup.\u201d <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 6, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1872, 20 L.Ed.2d at 898. I fail to discern a legally significant reason for differentiating between the experience of an officer who suspects three people are armed because they are \u201ccasing a job, a stick-up,\u201d in the middle of the afternoon, from that of an officer who has observed four occupants of an automobile leave a motel in an area notorious for drugs at 1:00 in the morning, one of whom has an outstanding warrant for drugs and two of whom have been flagged in the NCIC database as known to carry guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The arresting officer having had a reasonable articulable suspicion to believe the occupants or the area to be swept presented a danger, namely a gun, there are two reasons why the protective sweep was justified: two passengers posed a potential threat to the officers if permitted to return to the car to obtain their belongings; and the need to protect the public outweighed defendant\u2019s privacy interest in the car and justified the protective sweep as part of the officer\u2019s community caretaking function.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The majority concludes the passengers who were not arrested posed no threat to the officers because the arresting \u201cofficer did not testify that he intended to allow the unlicensed drivers to return to the car for any reason[,]\u201d and because \u201cthere was no testimony that the unlicensed occupants asked to return to the car to retrieve their belongings.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 41, 116 A.3d at 55. But the arresting officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion concerning a gun \u201cdid not evaporate when [he] failed to find a weapon on either defendant or [the] passenger[s]. The risk to officers and public safety ... is equally present here.\u201d <em>Gamble, supra, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>at 433, 95 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>188. Moreover, there was evidence to support a contrary factual determination concerning the passengers who had not been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The evidence established that the officers would not have had the vehicle towed. The officer who testified at the suppression hearing made that fact clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Q. But prior to making this protective sweep, you would have to make the determination that you were impounding the car, so you didn\u2019t need to do a protective sweep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">A. I had no reason to impound the car. As far as I was aware, it was validly registered and insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">Q. But there were no licensed drivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">A. Right. It\u2019s not a policy to impound vehicles just because there\u2019s a suspended driver and no one could drive it. If they\u2019re comfortable leaving it somewhere safe off the side of the road or if we can get another licensed drive to respond to the scene, that would be fine. Generally, we only tow unregistered or highly disabled vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">Q. So they would have no reason to go back into the car, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">A. Correct, except to retrieve their belongings, if they had any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">The officer confirmed his testimony on redirect examination by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">Q. Officer, [defense counsel] asked you some questions about whether or not there was anyone who would have been able, of the four occupants of the vehicle, she asked you a question about whether any of them would have been able to actually drive the vehicle away. Do you remember that line of questioning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOmW\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-15\">Q. And I believe your answer was that, no, that was for once you conducted subsequent investigation, you were able to confirm that those four would not have been able to drive it away; however, they could have retrieved their belongings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyG\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-16\">Q. Is it fair, then, that [the female passenger] would have been able to go back into that vehicle had you not found the gun and retrieve her purse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-17\">A. Yes, that\u2019s fair to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-18\">Q. And her purse contained a loaded handgun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-19\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-20\">Thus, the officer\u2019s testimony amply supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the officer reasonably believed a risk remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-21\">Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has rejected the notion that if a person subject to a <em>Terry </em>stop is under police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>control, then police may not conduct a protective sweep of the person\u2019s automobile:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">The Michigan Supreme Court appeared to believe that it was not reasonable for the officers to fear that Long could injure them, because he was effectively under their control during the investigative stop and could not get access to any weapons that might have been located in the automobile. <em>See [People v. Long </em>] 413 <em>Mich. </em>[461] at 472, 320 N.W.2d [866] at 869 [ (1982) ]. This reasoning is mistaken in several respects. During any investigative detention, the suspect is \u201cin the control\u201d of the officers in the sense that he \u201cmay be briefly detained against his will ----\u201d <em>Terry, supra, </em>at 34 [88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868] (WHITE, J., concurring). Just as a <em>Terry </em>suspect on the street may, despite being under the brief control of a police officer, reach into his clothing and retrieve a weapon, so might a <em>Terry </em>suspect in Long\u2019s position break away from police control and retrieve a weapon from his automobile. <em>See United States v. Rainone, </em>586 F.2d 1132, 1134 (C.A.7 1978), <em>cert, denied, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>980 [99 <em>S.Ct </em>1787, 60 L.Ed.2d 239] (1979). In addition, if the suspect is not placed under arrest, he will be permitted to reenter his automobile, and he will then have access to any weapons inside. <em>United States v. Powless, </em>546 F.2d 792, 795-796 (C.A.8), <em>cert, denied, </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>910 [97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1185, 51 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>588] (1977). Or, as here, the suspect may be permitted to reenter the vehicle before the <em>Terry </em>investigation is over, and again, may have access to weapons. In any event, we stress that a <em>Terry </em>investigation, such as the one that occurred here, involves a police investigation \u201cat close range,\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 24 [88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868], when the officer remains particularly vulnerable in part because a full custodial arrest has not been effected, and the officer must make a \u201cquick decision as to how to protect himself and others from possible danger____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28 [88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868]. In such circumstances, we have not required that officers adopt alternative means to ensure their safety in order to avoid the intrusion involved in a <em>Terry </em>encounter. <em>[Michigan v. Long, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>1032, 1051-52, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>3469, 3481-82, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201, 1221-22 (1983).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Apart from the risk posed by the car\u2019s occupants, \u201c[i]t is now well recognized that in addition to investigating crimes, the police also engage in what has been \u2018described as community caretaking functions, totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Navarro, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>104, 108, 708 A.2d 416 (App.Div.) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Cady v.

Here, the trial judge determined that the officer acted reasonably not only to protect himself, but also to protect the public. This determination is supported by ample credible evidence in the record. As the majority has recounted, when asked if there was a need to do a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>protective sweep while two of the car\u2019s occupants were handcuffed and the other two were standing on the side of the road in the presence of other officers, the officer who conducted the protective sweep testified that there was such a need:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">Because as far as I\u2019m aware, there\u2019s still two people unhandcuffed, there could still have been a weapon in the car that someone could have had access to even if I didn\u2019t let them back in the car, and I wasn\u2019t about to let some other person, whoever we can get to pick up the car, go into the ear if there was a weapon in the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The officer reasonably believed that \u201cthere could still have been a weapon in the car that someone could have had access to.\u201d Under those circumstances, the officer\u2019s protective sweep was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">As the trial court properly stated, quoting <em>Knights, supra, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>at 118-19, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 591, 151 L.Ed.2d at 505, \u201cthe reasonableness of a search is determined by assessing on the one hand the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy, and, on the other hand, the degree to which it is needed to promote legitimate governmental interests.\u201d When defendant\u2019s privacy interest in a car that he was unlicensed to drive, that he did not own, and that was owned by a person he could not name, is balanced against an officer\u2019s reasonable articulable suspicion that there is a gun in the ear that could come into the possession of an innocent or not-so-innocent person, the balance tips in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
