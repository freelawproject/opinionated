We affirm, because although Gundecha was employed by the company\u2019s New Jersey office, she performed all of her work in North Carolina. Therefore, she was entitled to unemployment benefits in North Carolina, not New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Gundecha began working for Deutsche Bank (DB) in 1999. After working briefly in DB\u2019s London office, she was transferred to New York and worked there until 2007. In 2008 Gundecha began working in a New Jersey office but left on maternity leave in April 2009. The next month she moved to North Carolina. She remained on maternity leave until December 2009. At that time, Gundecha returned to work for DB, telecommuting out of her home in North Carolina. She worked in that manner throughout 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In January 2011 Gundecha became ill and was unable to work for the next eighteen months. She was released by her doctor to return to work in July 2012. She was laid off by DB in September 2012 and given a year of severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">In February 2013 Gundecha applied to New Jersey for unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Her claim was denied. Claimant appealed the agency\u2019s determination. After a telephone interview, the Appeal Tribunal affirmed the prior decision noting that claimant had not established the required base weeks or earnings within New Jersey and was therefore not eligible for benefits under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:17-5.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Gundecha appealed the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the grounds that she had followed the instructions she had received from a North Carolina representative to file for benefits in New Jersey. The Board remanded the matter to the Appeal Tribunal \u201cfor additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>testimony from the claimant ... as to whether the claimant\u2019s services were localized in the state of New Jersey or in the state of North Carolina____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Gundecha participated in a second telephone hearing, following which the Appeal Tribunal rendered its decision. Citing to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19 and the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d therein, the Tribunal found that \u201cclaimant worked most recently for the above named employer [DB] out of her residence in North Carolina as a project manager from 12/2009 until 1/28/11. The claimant\u2019s regular work was in North Carolina. Therefore, the employee\u2019s service was localized in North Carolina, the claimant\u2019s work was not in [\u2018]employment[\u2019] in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21 \u2014 19(i)(2) and the claim dated 2/17/13 is invalid.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gundecha appealed from that decision, and on February 18, 2014, the Board affirmed the decision of the Appeal Tribunal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On appeal, Gundecha argues that she was employed by a New Jersey company and therefore should be considered a New Jersey employee for purposes of unemployment benefits. She states she was temporarily telecommuting from North Carolina and intended to return to physically work in New Jersey.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Our review of legal issues is de novo. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). However, we generally defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its enabling statute. <em>See GE Solid State, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>298, 306, 625 A.2d 468 (1993); <em>SJC Builders, LLC v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envirl. Prot., </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>50, 54, 874 A.2d 586 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Historically, Congress encouraged the states to create their own unemployment systems when it passed the Social Security Act in 1935. In response, states set up systems where employers contribute to the states\u2019 unemployment funds and under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, the excise tax paid by an employer to a state unemployment fund is credited toward the employer\u2019s tax liability. Beverly Reyes, Note, <em>Telecommuters and Their Virtual Existence in the Unemployment World, </em>33 <em>Hofstra L. Rev. </em>785, 789 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">As the systems expanded, it became important for uniform definitions to be used throughout the nation on the theory that only one state would be liable for a claimant\u2019s unemployment compensation benefits. <em>Vale v. Gaylords Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>45, 47, 316 A.2d 56 (App.Div.1974). A uniform definition of \u201cemployment\u201d was ultimately adopted by forty-six states (including New Jersey) and the District of Columbia. Reyes, <em>supra, </em>33 <em>Hofstra L. Rev. </em>at 790. That definition remains in effect today in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(i)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19 requires that a claimant have employment in New Jersey to be eligible for benefits. \u201cEmployment\u201d is defined at Section 43:21 \u2014 19(i)(2) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">[A]n individual\u2019s entire service performed within or both within and without this State if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">(A) The service is localized in this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">(B) The service is not localized in any state but some of the service is performed in this State, and (i) the base of operations, or, if there is no base of operations, then the place from which such services is directed or controlled, is in this State; or (ii) the base of operations or place from which such service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual\u2019s residence is in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:21 \u2014 19(i)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">The statute thus contains four tests to be applied successively to determine the appropriate state for the filing of unemployment benefits. The first test is the localization test. It is defined at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(i)(5) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-13\">[slervice shall be deemed to be localized within a state if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-14\">(A) The service is performed entirely within such state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>(B) The service is performed both within and without such state, but the service performed without such state is incidental to the individual\u2019s service within the state; for example, is temporary or transitory in nature or consists of isolated transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">\n<em>Ubid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">If the first test reveals a single state in which the services are performed, then the state unemployment agency need not apply the other tests. <em>See Vale, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 48, 316 A.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Thus, the primary issue before us is whether claimant\u2019s services were \u201clocalized\u201d in New Jersey. New Jersey courts have not considered the \u201clocalization\u201d requirement in over forty years. <em>See Vale, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>45, 316 A.2d 56. Telecommuting was not a part of the employment landscape until recently but it has become a normal way of working for many employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the issue before us is how the localization rule should be applied to telecommuters.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">One jurisdiction that has addressed the issue of \u201clocalization\u201d as it respects telecommuters is New York. In <em>In re Claim of Allen, </em>100 N.Y.2d 282, 763 N.Y.S.2d 237, 794 N.E.2d 18 (2003), a case with similar circumstances, the claimant employee worked in the employer\u2019s New York office for several years. When she relocated to Florida she was permitted to \u201ctelecommute\u201d to her office in New York. After her employer ended the telecommuting arrangement, the claimant filed for unemployment benefits in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The New York court applied the localization test and held that \u201cphysical presence determines localization for purposes of interpreting and applying Section 511<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to an interstate telecommuter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Because the claimant was regularly physically present in Florida when she worked for her employer in New York, her work was localized in one state \u2014 Florida.\u201d <em>Id., </em>763 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>237, 794 N.E.2d at 22. Accordingly the claimant was found ineligible for unemployment benefits from New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">As was explained by the New York Court of Appeals, \u201cthe uniform rule was intended to promote efficiency, and to ensure that unemployment benefits are paid by the state where an unemployed individual is physically present to seek new work. Unemployment has the greatest economic impact on the community in which the unemployed individual resides____ In our view, physical presence is the most practicable indicium of localization for the interstate telecommuter who inhabits today\u2019s \u2018virtual\u2019 workplace linked by Internet connections and data exchanges.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The localization rule continues to be the simplest and most efficient method for determining jurisdiction for unemployment benefits. And despite the modern technology advances that could not have been imagined when the states adopted the localization test, the theory behind the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d still holds true today. It remains feasible and most practicable for the employee\u2019s physical presence to be the determinative factor in determining \u201clocalization.\u201d It continues to be a straightforward solution for an employee to know where to file for benefits and for each state to know its responsibilities. Of course, if the employee\u2019s service does not fit within the definition, the remaining tests set forth in the statute are analyzed. <em>See Vale, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 48, 316 A.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">In this case claimant lives in North Carolina. Although she was employed by and provided services to the DB office located in New Jersey, she was physically present in North Carolina at all times that she was working. Therefore her work and employment was localized in North Carolina and that is the state responsible for her benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>If claimant was given advice by North Carolina\u2019s Labor Department that she should pursue her benefits in New Jersey that advice was incorrect. Gundecha must pursue her remedies in North Carolina. We find that the Board\u2019s decision holding claimant ineligible for unemployment benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(i)(2) is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\"> Claimant alleges that she contacted the North Carolina Department of Labor and checked its website in September 2012 after being laid off. She states she was told that she had to wait for her severance benefits to be exhausted before she could file for unemployment benefits and that she should apply for benefits in New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> The Appeal Tribunal also considered whether claimant qualified for benefits under the alternate base year after disability option but determined she did not under the same statutory analysis. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> As of the time she filed her appeal, claimant continued to reside in North Carolina.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\"> Between 2005 and 2010 there was an increase in home-based work. \"During this time, the number of home-based workers went from 7.8 percent of all workers to 9.5 percent, an increase of about 2 million.\u201d Peter J.
