Ater a six-day trial, the jury found that defendant Ellen I. Hugelmeyer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the driver of the Mazda sedan that struck plaintiffs\u2019 Lexus SUV from behind, was negligent and the sole proximate cause of the accident. The jury awarded $380,000 in damages to plaintiff Anthony A. Gonzales, the driver of the Lexus, and $810,000 in damages to his wife Valerie, who was a passenger in their vehicle. The trial court also awarded plaintiffs counsel fees, costs, and interest pursuant to the Offer of Judgment Rule, <em>R. </em>4:58-2(a), because the combined damages verdict substantially exceeded the amount plaintiffs had offered to accept in settlement before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Defendant appeals the verdict and final judgment solely with respect to her liability to Mr. Gonzales,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the parties and their insurers have settled all claims respecting Mrs. Gonzales, including her claims for underinsured motorist coverage. Defendant asserts a variety of trial errors regarding both liability and damages, and further argues that the Offer of Judgment Rule is unconstitutional because it allegedly is unfair to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Because of multiple errors that deprived defendant of a fair trial, we vacate the judgment as to Mr. Gonzales and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The evidence shows that at about 5:00 p.m. on April 22, 2008, Mr. Gonzales was driving his Lexus on the Atlantic City Expressway when he encountered congested traffic due to an accident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Mr. Gonzales drove from the far-right lane into the far-left lane of the three-lane highway. According to the testimony of an eyewitness, Stephanie Blount, the Lexus moved across the center lane in front of Hugelmeyer\u2019s car. After Gonzales needed to stop short, Hugelmeyer\u2019s Mazda struck his Lexus from behind, damaging its rear bumper and the Mazda\u2019s front bumper.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">A State Trooper, Vaughn Crouthamel, responded to the scene. The Trooper interviewed several persons, including Mr. Gonzales and Hugelmeyer. According to Hugelmeyer, she \u201cdidn\u2019t have time to react\u201d and avoid the collision because Mr. Gonzales had \u201cjust slammed on his brakes\u201d while in traffic. The Trooper nevertheless issued a traffic citation to Hugelmeyer, although the ticket was eventually dismissed because of the Trooper\u2019s failure to appear in municipal court. The ticket and its disposition were not divulged to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">At trial, Mr. Gonzales testified that the accident had aggravated a pre-existing degenerative disc disease. His main testifying expert, Dr. John C. Baker, a Board-certified orthopedic surgeon, testified that he had arthritis dating back to 1998, and that the accident had greatly worsened his pre-existing disease, causing permanent spinal damage. Mr. Gonzales also presented testimony from Dr. Ira Greg Warshaw, his family physician from 2001 to 2008. Dr. Warshaw testified on direct examination that Mr. Gonzales had never commented on any back problems when treated by him. However, Dr. Warshaw conceded on cross-examination that he had treated Mr. Gonzales in 2006 for lower-leg pain and radiating cervical spine or neck pain, and in 2004 for cervical radiculopathy. Mr. Gonzales also presented videotaped testimony from a chiropractor, Dr. Michael Gerber, who had examined him at the behest of his insurer in connection with his claims for personal injury protection benefits. Based upon tests Dr. Gerber performed, he opined that the condition of Mr. Gonzales\u2019s neck and low back had been \u201cexacerbated or aggravated\u201d by the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The defense presented testimony from Blount and Dr. John Cristini, a Board-certified orthopedic surgeon who had evaluated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Mr. Gonzales. Hugelmeyer did not testify because she was living in a distant state and seven months pregnant. However, portions of her deposition testimony were read aloud to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">As we have already noted, the jury found that Hugelmeyer was negligent but that Mr. Gonzales was not, and awarded substantial monetary damages to both Mr. Gonzales and Mrs. Gonzales. The trial judge denied Hugelmeyer\u2019s motion for a new trial or remitti-tur, and ordered fee-shifting pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:58. The judge declined to address defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to the Offer of Judgment Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">This appeal ensued, which, as we have noted, is confined to the judgment obtained by Mr. Gonzales. Defendant argues that the trial judge erred in (1) allowing Trooper Crouthamel to present inadmissible lay opinion asserting that she was at fault in causing the accident, and also relied on hearsay statements from an unidentified witness he had interviewed at the accident scene; (2) excluding Dr. Warshaw\u2019s treatment office notes that would substantiate the severity of Mr. Gonzales\u2019s preexisting condition; (3) allowing the chiropractor, Dr. Gerber, to present expert opinions on permanency without proper qualifications and to discuss the hearsay findings of a non-testifying radiologist; (4) permitting this \u201cverbal threshold\u201d case brought under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-8(a) to go to the jury without appropriate objective evidence of aggravated injury; and (5) awarding fees and other funds to plaintiffs under the Offer of Judgment Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">For the reasons that follow, the first two claims of prejudicial error are meritorious. Singularly and cumulatively, they warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Defendant rightly contends that she was unfairly prejudiced by two critical aspects of Trooper Crouthamel\u2019s testimony, which plaintiffs\u2019 counsel punctuated in his closing argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>We first consider the Trooper\u2019s reference to hearsay statements by an unidentified eyewitness he interviewed at the accident scene. The Trooper could not recall the accident at trial with much detail and instead relied substantially on the accuracy of his written accident report. The report reflected that he had interviewed an eyewitness, who was not a passenger in either the Mazda or the Lexus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the Trooper informed the jurors that the eyewitness had told him that he or she was driving behind defendant\u2019s Mazda and saw plaintiffs\u2019 Lexus change lanes, get in front of the Mazda and stop abruptly \u201cas traffic backed up.\u201d The Trooper relied on this observation in formulating his conclusions about how and why the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The eyewitness statement, which plaintiffs<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> offered for its truth, was hearsay and should not have been admitted. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>801(e). Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel suggested that the statement was admissible, alternatively, under the hearsay exceptions for present sense impressions, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(1), or excited utterances, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2). The required elements of these exceptions are not present. The eyewitness\u2019s statement was not a present sense impression because it was not made \u201cwhile or immediately after\u201d the declarant saw the accident. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(1); <em>State ex rel. J.A., </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>324, 338-39, 949 A.2d 790 (2008). The Trooper was not present when the accident occurred, but arrived at least \u201cseveral minutes\u201d thereafter. The statement was not eligible as an excited utterance because there was no foundation laid that the declarant spoke \u201cunder the stress of excitement\u201d without \u201cthe opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2); <em>State v. Branch, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>338, 357-58, 865 A.2d 673 (2005). No other hearsay exceptions apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>An even more troublesome aspect of the Trooper\u2019s testimony is the court\u2019s allowance, over objection, of his opinion that defendant was at fault in causing the accident. The first time this occurred, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel elicited the Trooper\u2019s opinions by asking him about the \u201ccontributing circumstances\u201d for the collision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">Q. Okay. Now, based on your investigation at the scene, you concluded what the contributing circumstances were to this rear-end collision, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">Q. <em>What contributing circumstances were there for Mr. Gonzales?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">A. None.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">Q. <em>What were the contributing circumstances for Mrs. Hugelmeyer </em>\u2014 Mrs. <em>Hugel-meyer-Green?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">A. Okay. <em>She was noted as driver inattention </em>was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">Q. Mis \u2014 thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">A. I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">By opining that Mr. Gonzales had no \u201ccontributing circumstances\u201d and that defendant Hugelmeyer, by contrast, had the \u201ccontributing circumstances\u201d of \u201cdriver inattention,\u201d the Trooper surely conveyed to the jury his personal belief that defendant had not been paying sufficient attention and consequently was responsible for rear-ending the Lexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">Later in the Trooper\u2019s direct examination, Mr. Gonzales\u2019s counsel drew from him an even more explicit opinion of defendant\u2019s fault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-16\">Q. Trooper, Mrs. Hugelmeyer-Green said, \u201cI was told by the officer it was not my fault, the accident.\u201d This is at the scene. Did you ever say that to Mrs. Hugelmeyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-17\">A. I don\u2019t recall what was said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-18\">Q. Would you have ever said it was not her fault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-19\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection. Speculative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-20\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll allow the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-21\">MR. GONZALES\u2019S COUNSEL: Would you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-22\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll allow the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-23\">BY THE WITNESS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>A. <em>If it legitimately was not her fault, it would have been indicated on the </em>report\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">Q. What\u2019s indicated on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">A. \u2014along with a statement. If I were to make that statement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">Q. Eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">A. \u2014it would reflect in the report accurately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">Q. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">A. <em>Which in this case I obviously, based on the evidence and my training and experience at this point, found her at fault.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">MR. GONZALES\u2019S COUNSEL: Thank you. No further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">These opinions of fault were improperly elicited by Mr. Gonzales\u2019s counsel from the Trooper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the Trooper testified that he had over five years of experience in investigating motor vehicle accidents, he was not designated or qualified by plaintiffs as an expert witness under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702. His prejudicial opinions on the critical jury issue of fault for the accident were clearly beyond the scope of lay opinion admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>701. In <em>State v. McLean, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>438, 460, 16 A.3d 332 (2011), a criminal case, the Supreme Court disapproved of the admission of critical expert opinions from police officers under the guise of the lay opinion rule. The same principles restricting certain lay opinion from police officers likewise extend to their testimony in civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">Moreover, the Trooper had no personal observation or recollection of the accident and his opinions thus failed the foundational requirements of <em>Rule </em>701. The Supreme Court has instructed that \u201ca police officer cannot provide an opinion at trial when that opinion is based primarily on the statements of eyewitnesses.\u201d <em>Neno v. Clinton, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>573, 585, 772 A.2d 899 (2001). \u201cAny other conclusion,\u201d the Court cautioned in <em>Neno, </em>\u201cwould allow an officer to subvert the prohibition against hearsay and pass along the essence of those hearsay statements to the jury even when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>officer is not permitted to testify to the substance of the witness\u2019s statements under the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 772 A.2d 899. That is exactly what happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">These errors were not harmless. Mr. Gonzales\u2019s counsel explicitly reminded the jurors of these inadmissible portions of the testimony during closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">The problem with [blaming Anthony Gonzales] is <em>the trooper got the bottom line. He finds </em>out from [the person he interviewed] \u2014 here it is. Here it is. The witness says he changed lanes, nothing about cutting anyone off. Did you hear that testimony today from <em>the tiebreaker? </em>Changed lanes, was traveling in front, means he was going a while, and then he stopped abruptly. And you heard why now from today, and \u2014 because traffic backed up, and then she struck him. That\u2019s what the <em>tiebreaker said, at the scene.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">As we recently held in <em>James v. Ruiz, </em>440 <em>N.J.Super. </em>45, 72, 111 A.3d 123 (App.Div.2015), trial counsel may not misuse hearsay or other inadmissible proof in summation by advocating to jurors that they treat such proof as a \u201ctiebreaker\u201d to resolve the competing positions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Counsel apparently intended the term \u201ctiebreaker\u201d to refer to the unidentified eyewitness that the Trooper interviewed at the accident scene, who plaintiffs alleged was Blount. For the reasons we have already noted, the interviewee\u2019s out-of-court statement to the officer was inadmissible hearsay. Counsel should not have made substantive use of that statement in his summation. It was likewise improper for counsel to showcase the Trooper\u2019s inadmissible personal conclusion by advocating to the jurors that the Trooper \u201cgot the bottom line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">We cannot ignore these highly prejudicial circumstances and conclude with any confidence that the jurors were not swayed by the Trooper\u2019s improper testimony. A new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Defendant is also entitled to a new trial because her trial attorney was wrongfully foreclosed from admitting into evidence notes from Mr. Gonzales\u2019s medical chart prepared by his regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>family physician, Dr. Warshaw. The notes were admissible business records under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6). <em>See also Konop v. Rosen, </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 405, 41 A.3d 773 (App.Div.2012) (recognizing that \u201croutine\u201d findings contained in patient medical records generally are admissible hearsay). Relevant statements made by Mr. Gonzales during those visits to his family physician were admissible statements by a party opponent, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(1), and also admissible as statements made to a medical provider for treatment or diagnosis under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(4). The records were highly relevant to substantiate Mr. Gonzales\u2019s pre-existing spinal injuries and condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In excluding these office notes, the trial judge broadly asserted they \u201cdo not come into evidence ... [bjecause the jury has already heard [about] it\u201d through the doctor\u2019s testimony. The judge cited no authority for this blanket proposition, and we have not been made aware of any. Although the court has the authority to exclude cumulative evidence under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 where its probative value is \u201csubstantially outweighed\u201d by countervailing factors, no such compelling showing in favor of exclusion is present here. The records would have provided the jurors with relevant, tangible proof that Mr. Gonzales had been suffering from serious spinal problems for many years. The defense should not have been forced to limit its evidence to the doctor\u2019s spoken testimony. The judge misapplied his discretion in excluding the notes. Because the degree of Mr. Gonzales\u2019s pre-existing condition was a critical disputed issue, the error was not harmless. This also mandates a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">We turn to defendant\u2019s additional contention that Dr. Gerber, the chiropractor, improperly discussed in his testimony spondylosis, a condition which had been identified by a non-testifying radiologist who interpreted MRI studies of Mr. Gonzales\u2019s spine. The chiropractor was not shown to be qualified to interpret those studies himself. Absent such expertise, the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>plex hearsay opinions of a radiologist are not to be conveyed through a testifying chiropractor acting as a conduit. <em>See Agha v. Feiner, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>50, 965 A.2d 141 (2009); <em>James, supra, </em>440 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 61-70, 111 A.3d 123; <em>see also N.J.R.E. </em>808.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Mr. Gonzales\u2019s orthopedic expert, Dr. Baker, was clearly qualified to interpret the MRI studies and he commented on them in his own testimony. However, the chiropractor, Dr. Gerber, who was not shown to have such qualifications, should not have been likewise permitted to testify that his own opinions were specifically \u201cbased on ... [the absent radiologist\u2019s] MRI findings of spondy-losis,\u201d if those findings were disputed. The testifying chiropractor went beyond \u201cthe bare fact that he considered the absent radiologist\u2019s report.\u201d <em>James, supra, </em>440 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 73 n. 17, 111 A.3d 123. Instead, Dr. Gerber passed over that line and \u201cdelv[ed] into\u201d the MRI report\u2019s actual contents. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">We cannot tell from the record, including the phrasing of the questioning and testimony of the medical experts, whether the diagnosis of spondylosis for Mr. Gonzales was, in fact, disputed. The prohibition in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>808 and case law on an expert\u2019s testimony about the complex hearsay opinions of a non-testifying expert does not apply if the opinion is undisputed. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>808; <em>James, supra, </em>440 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 63, 111 A.3d 123; <em>see also Nowacki v. Community Med. Ctr., </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 652 A.2d 758 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>95, 660 A.2d 1194 (1995). Defense counsel did not object to this portion of Dr. Gerber\u2019s testimony at trial, which suggests that the defense was not disputing the spondylosis diagnosis. If there is no such dispute, then Dr. Gerber\u2019s reference to the hearsay finding was innocuous. On retrial, defense counsel shall clarify whether the MRI finding is indeed disputed and, if so, Dr. Gerber\u2019s videotaped testimony must be redacted accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">III.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">[At the direction of the court, the published version of this opinion omits Part III, which briefly addresses the other points defendant raised on appeal.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The final judgment is vacated in its entirety, and the case is remanded for a new trial on liability and damages as to the claims of Mr. Gonzales.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\"> At various points in the record, defendant's surname is identified as Hugel-meyer-Green.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-12\"> For purposes of clarity, we refer to plaintiffs as \u201cMr. Gonzales\" and \u201cMrs. Gonzales,\" intending no disrespect by our omission of such titles for the other individuals mentioned in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\"> Mr. Gonzales's counsel speculates that Blount was the eyewitness that the Trooper had interviewed, but that was not confirmed by the Trooper, who did not recognize Blount in the courtroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales each had separate counsel at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b486-15\"> Plaintiff has not argued in his brief that defendant \"opened the door\" to the officer's opinions by alleging in her testimony that the officer told her she was not at fault.
