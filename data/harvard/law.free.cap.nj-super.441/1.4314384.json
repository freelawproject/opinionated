Defendant sought to get his identification by entering his apartment, which the officer permitted on the condition that the officer accompany him. While in his apartment, defendant attempted to conceal the sweatshirt he was wearing which contained a firearm, but he was thwarted by the officer. Defendant appeals the denial of his motion to suppress the handgun, contending that the officer should not have been allowed to accompany him to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution, \u201cguarantee the right of people to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures in their homes.\u201d <em>State v. Lamb, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>300, 314, 95 A.3d 123 (2014). Both the United States Supreme Court and the New Jersey Supreme Court have found that when individuals under arrest seek to enter their residence to obtain identification, clothing, or other items, it is reasonable and permissible for the police to accompany them to prevent them from escaping or endangering the police. <em>Washington v. Chrisman, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>1, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>812, 70 L.Ed.2d 778 (1982); <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 234, 463 A.2d 320 (1983), <em>cert, denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 L.Ed.2d 695 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">We apply those decisions to the situation here. The officer had valid authorization to detain defendant for an investigatory stop based on reasonable suspicion, and had a reasonable belief that defendant was armed and dangerous. We hold that an officer in that situation may accompany the detainee who chooses to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>his residence to obtain identification or other personal items.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">At the suppression hearing, Officer Richard Dill testified to the following facts. Dill was a uniformed K-9 officer with ten years of experience in the Patrol Unit of the Somers Point Police Department. On the night of January 17, 2012, he was dispatched to investigate a noise complaint in a high-crime, high-narcotics apartment complex he patrolled regularly. As he drove through the complex, Dill saw defendant and another man standing on a common porch of the apartment building. Entering the building from another direction using a common hallway, Dill heard the two men yelling to people in an apartment where there was loud talking and music. After Dill neared the door to the common porch, defendant opened the door about twelve inches. Officer Dill smelled an overpowering odor of burnt marijuana coming through the open doorway.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Suspecting defendant was committing a criminal act involving marijuana, Officer Dill walked onto the common porch and identified himself. Defendant immediately turned and started walking at a fast pace into the parking lot. Dill told defendant to stop and asked where he was going. Defendant said he was going to his car. Dill asked if defendant had any identification. Defendant said his identification was up in his apartment, immediately volunteered to go into his apartment to get his ID, and started walking back to the apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Officer Dill told defendant, \u201cI have to come with you to get [the ID].\u201d Defendant did not protest and continued to walk into the building. As defendant was walking, Officer Dill noticed a bulge in the pocket of the grey hooded sweatshirt defendant was wearing. Dill was concerned it could be a weapon or contraband that defendant was attempting to conceal. Dill went with defendant because \u201che\u2019s a suspect at this point and I wasn\u2019t going to allow him out of my sight where he could possibly discard evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the crime being committed or possibly get any sort of weapon\u201d that would endanger officer safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Accompanied by Officer Dill, defendant entered the apartment, went into the bedroom, picked up a wallet, removed his identification, and handed it to Dill. Neither defendant nor the woman in the apartment protested Dill\u2019s accompanying defendant. Defendant and Dill went into the living room, where Dill radioed in the information from defendant\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">As Officer Dill was radioing, defendant took off his grey sweatshirt, handed it to the woman, and told her to put it in the bedroom. His suspicions further aroused, Dill stopped his radio transmission and told defendant: \u201cwe\u2019re going to need that sweatshirt.\u201d Defendant and Dill followed the woman back into the bedroom. Although she put the grey sweatshirt on the floor, defendant stepped over the grey sweatshirt and grabbed another sweatshirt from the closet. Dill picked up the grey sweatshirt from the floor, and said to defendant: \u201cthis is the sweatshirt you were wearing. We need this one.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attempts to get rid of the grey sweatshirt further raised Officer Dill\u2019s concern for his safety and the preservation of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Reentering the living room with defendant, and holding the grey sweatshirt, Officer Dill resumed calling in defendant\u2019s identification to check for outstanding warrants. Defendant became extremely nervous, repeatedly looked at the sweatshirt, and his demeanor became uncooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Increasingly concerned for his safety, Officer Dill asked defendant to step back outside, where Dill\u2019s patrol vehicle, K-9 dog, and backup Officer Mark McElwee were. Once outside, Dill asked defendant to have a seat on the building steps. Defendant started tying his shoe, causing concern he was preparing to flee. Dill placed the sweatshirt on the ground. Defendant kept looking at the sweatshirt and looking around nervously, so Dill informed him he was handcuffing and detaining him during the investigation, but was not arresting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>When Officer Dill\u2019s warrant inquiry came back negative, he asked if he could cheek the sweatshirt, but defendant declined to consent. Dill said he would conduct a canine sniff of the sweatshirt, and to keep him from provoking the K-9 dog, he placed defendant in the back of the patrol vehicle. Dill got another sweatshirt and a towel from his police vehicle and placed them alongside the grey sweatshirt, but the dog put his nose in the grey sweatshirt, grabbed it in his mouth, and threw it to the pavement. It landed making a metal \u201cclank\u201d that sounded like a weapon. Dill picked up the sweatshirt, for the first time manipulated the pocket, and felt a metal handgun. The officer seized the loaded handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Defendant was indicted for second-degree unlawful possession of a handgun without a permit, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(b), and second-degree possession of a weapon by a convicted person, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:89-7. He filed a suppression motion. After hearing the testimony and receiving supplemental briefing and argument, the trial court denied the motion. Defendant pled guilty to possession of a weapon by a convicted person, and was sentenced to a negotiated term of five years in prison without eligibility for parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied bail pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Defendant appeals the October 11, 2013 judgment of conviction, raising the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">POINT I. THE COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING DEFENDANT IS LIKELY TO FLEE IF ALLOWED BAIL PENDING APPEAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">POINT II.

TRIAL COURT RULED ON FACTS THAT WERE OUTSIDE OF RECORD.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">We must hew to our \u201cdeferential standard of review.\u201d <em>State v. Rockford, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>424, 440, 64 A.3d 514 (2013). \u201c[A]n appellate court reviewing a motion to suppress must uphold the factual findings underlying the trial court\u2019s decision so long as those findings are supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThose findings warrant particular deference when they are substantially influenced by [the trial judge\u2019s] opportunity to hear and see the witnesses and to have the \u2018feel\u2019 of the case, which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">Here, the trial court found Officer Dill\u2019s testimony \u201cvery credible and reliable.\u201d Defendant argues the court should have discredited Dill because of differences in wording between his testimony and report, and a discrepancy between his time estimate and that of Officer McElwee. However, \u201c \u2018[a]ppellate courts should defer to trial courts\u2019 credibility findings that are often influenced by matters such as observations of the character and demeanor of witnesses and common human experience that are not transmitted by the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Kuropchak, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>368, 382, 113 A.3d 1174 (2015) (quoting <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 474, 724 A.3d 234 (1999)). Defendant has not shown the suppression court\u2019s findings were \u201c \u2018so clearly mistaken that the interests of justice demand intervention and correction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Robinson, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>1, 15, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">Defendant also notes the trial court\u2019s letter opinion contained certain factual details not reflected in the suppression hearing testimony. We will base our determinations solely on the facts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the testimony, and consider the validity of each stage of Officer Dill\u2019s encounter with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Defendant does not dispute that Officer Dill had the right to enter the common hallway of the apartment building to investigate the noise complaint. <em>State v. Walker, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>281, 296, 62 A.3d 897 (2013); <em>State v. Smith, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>481, 496, 181 A.2d 761 (1962); <em>State v. Brown, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 547, 660 A.2d 1221 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>322, 670 A.2d 1064 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">When defendant opened the door of the common porch, Officer Dill detected the overwhelming odor of burnt marijuana. \u201c \u2018New Jersey courts have recognized that the smell of marijuana itself constitutes probable cause \u201cthat a criminal offense ha[s] been committed and that additional contraband might be present.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Walker, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 62 A.3d 897 (quoting <em>State v. Nishina, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>502, 516-17, 816 A.2d 153 (2003) (quoting <em>State v. Vanderveer, </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>475, 479, 667 A.2d 382 (App.Div.1995))).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">In <em>Vanderveer, </em>a police officer encountered two individuals on an outdoor porch and detected the odor of burnt marijuana. <em>Vanderveer, supra, </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 477, 479, 667 A.2d 382. We held the marijuana odor gave rise to probable cause \u201cto conduct a warrantless search of the persons in the immediate area from where the smell has emanated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 667 A.2d 382. Thus, Officer Dill had the right to search defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Officer Dill chose to take a more restrained approach, simply entering the common porch to speak to defendant. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>192, 209, 793 A.2d 619 (2002). When defendant tried to hurry away, Dill stopped him. The trial court properly found reasonable suspicion justifying this investigatory stop of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>At a suppression hearing, \u201c \u2018the State bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a warrantless search or seizure falls within one of the few well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Mann, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>328, 337-38, 2 A.3d 379 (2010) (citation omitted). \u201cOne such exception is denominated an investigatory stop or a <em>Terry </em>stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 2 A.3d 379 (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). An investigatory stop \u201c \u2018is valid if it is based on specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">As \u201c \u2018the smell of burnt marijuana under the total circumstances create[s] a heightened and reasonable suspicion that an offense was being committed,\u2019 \u201d Dill was justified in stopping defendant. <em>Walker, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 62 A.3d 897 (quoting <em>State v. Judge, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>194, 202, 645 A.2d 1224 (App.Div.1994)). In addition, given the evidence that defendant just committed a marijuana offense, his hurried departure when the officer appeared \u201c \u2018reasonably justified] an inference that it was done with a consciousness of guilt and pursuant to an effort to avoid an accusation based on that guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Tucker, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>158, 169, 642 A.2d 401 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Moreover, Officer Dill appropriately asked defendant to produce identification. \u201c[I]t is well established that an officer may ask a suspect to identify himself in the course of a <em>Terry </em>stop.\u201d <em>Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>177, 186, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2451, 2457, 159 L.Ed.2d 292, 303 (2004); <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>692, 700 n. 12, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2587, 2593, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>340, 348 (1981). \u201c[T]he ability to ... check identification in the absence of probable cause promotes the strong government interest in solving crimes and bringing offenders to justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>221, 229, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>675, 680, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>604, 612 (1985); <em>see State v. Sirianni </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 390-91, 790 A.2d 206 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>178, 796 A.2d 894 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">When Officer Dill asked defendant for his identification, defendant said his ID was up in his apartment, immediately volunteered to go get it, and started walking to the apartment. Dill told defendant he would have to accompany defendant. Defendant claims the officer violated his rights by accompanying him into the apartment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The facts of this case strongly resemble the facts in <em>Chrisman. </em>There, a police officer saw a college student \"with alcohol and stopped him and asked for identification. <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 3, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 815, 70 L.Ed.2d at 783. The student said that his ID was in his dormitory room and asked if the officer would wait while he went to retrieve it. <em>Ibid. </em>The officer answered that, under the circumstances, he would have to accompany the student. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The United States Supreme Court held the officer could properly accompany the student into his dorm room, and upheld his plain view seizure of the drugs he saw in the room. <em>Id. </em>at 7-9, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 817-18, 70 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 785-86. The Court ruled that \u201cthe officer had placed [the student] under lawful arrest, and therefore was authorized to accompany him to his room for the purpose of obtaining identification. The officer had a right to remain literally at [the student\u2019s] elbow at all times; nothing in the Fourth Amendment is to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 816, 70 L.Ed.2d at 784 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">The Court \u201ch[e]ld therefore that it is not \u2018unreasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment for a police officer, as a matter of routine, to monitor the movements of an arrested person, as his judgment dictates, following the arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 817, 70 L.Ed.2d at 785. \u201cThe officer\u2019s need to ensure his own safety \u2014 as well as the integrity of the arrest \u2014 is compelling. Such surveil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>lance is not an impermissible invasion of the privacy or personal liberty of an individual who has been arrested.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In <em>Bruzzese, </em>our Supreme Court \u201cadopt[ed] the <em>Chrisman </em>rule as the law of New Jersey.\u201d <em>Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 234, 463 A.2d 320.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There, when officers went to the defendant\u2019s house to execute an arrest warrant, the defendant said he wanted to put on shoes and a jacket before going outside. The officers, \u201c[wjithout invitation,\u201d followed the defendant upstairs to his bedroom, saying they had to accompany him. <em>Id. </em>at 215, 463 A.2d 320. Our Supreme Court upheld their actions, \u201crul[ing] that once a defendant is placed under lawful arrest, the arresting officer has the right to remain at his side and to follow him wherever he chooses to go.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 463 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Our Supreme Court found \u201cthe reasons advanced by the Supreme Court for its holding [in <em>Chrisman </em>] are equally applicable in New Jersey.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Both Courts stressed \u201c \u2018[ejvery arrest must be presumed to present a risk of danger to the arresting officer---- Moreover, the possibility that an arrested person will attempt to escape if not property] supervised is obvious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 463 A.2d 320 (quoting <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 7, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 817, 70 L.Ed.2d at 785).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\u201c[T]he concerns <em>[Chrisman </em>found] present in an arrest situation may also be present in an investigatory detention.\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 <em>Va.App. </em>507, 371 S.E.2d 156, 162 (1988). Both the United States and New Jersey Supreme Courts have found the danger of \u201c \u2018an on-the-street or roadside investigatory encoun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ter\u2019 \u201d to be comparable to \u201c \u2018[t]he risk of danger in the context of an arrest in the home.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jones, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>377, 406, 846 A.2d 569 (2004) (quoting <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>325, 333, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1093, 1098, 108 L.Ed.2d 276, 285 (1990)). Our Supreme Court has likened the public interest in preventing flight from an attempted arrest and an attempted investigatory stop because a \u201cdefendant\u2019s refusal to obey the officer\u2019s command to stop [can] set off a chase along with the attendant danger of escalating violence no different than if he had disobeyed a command to submit to an arrest.\u201d <em>State v. Crawley, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>440, 457, 901 A.2d 924, <em>cert, denied, </em>549 <em>U.S. </em>1078, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>740, 166 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>563 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Federal Courts of Appeals have recognized that \u201c[although the Supreme Court [in Chrisman] refers to the student as having already been placed under arrest when the officer accompanied him back to his dorm room to retrieve identification, we do not think that this characterization makes <em>Chrisman </em>any less applicable\u201d to a pre-arrest situation. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>612 F.3d 306, 308, 310 n. 4 (5th Cir.) (officers waiting for a defendant to get identification before executing an arrest warrant could accompany the defendant into his apartment), <em>cert, denied, </em>562 <em>U.S. </em>1116, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>839, 178 L.Ed.2d 570 (2010). Thus, where an officer has probable cause, but no plan to arrest the detainee unless he is unable to provide identification, \u201cit is reasonable for police to keep him in view to ensure that credentials are the <em>only </em>object of the expedition.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>376 F.3d 648, 651-52 (7th Cir.2004). Indeed, \u201cseveral courts have since applied Chrisman\u2019s reasoning to allow a police officer to accompany a suspect into dwellings in situations in which probable cause existed but formal arrests had not yet occurred.\u201d <em>Hoover v. Dir., N.D. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>748 N.W.2d 730, 737 (N.D.2008); <em>State v. Diercks, </em>674 S.W.2d 72, 79 (Mo.Ct.App.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Other courts have applied <em>Chrisman </em>to <em>Terry </em>stops where the officer has reasonable suspicion and a reasonable belief a suspect is \u201cpotentially dangerous.\u201d <em>Conway v.

All of these eases hold that an officer can accompany a person detained in an investigatory stop who seeks to retrieve personal items from his residence. Our research has found no published case to the contrary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We agree an officer who has lawfully detained a suspect in an investigatory stop, like an officer who has lawfully arrested a subject, need not let the suspect out of his sight or presence during the detention. Rather, if the detained person seeks to obtain identification or other items from his residence, the officer may accompany the detainee to prevent escape or danger to the officer and others. Such monitoring is justified by the normal authority of an officer conducting a lawful <em>Terry </em>stop \u201c \u2018to take such steps as [are] reasonably necessary to protect [his and others\u2019] personal safety and to maintain the status quo during the course of the stop.\u2019 \u201d <em>Servis, supra, </em>371 S.E.2d at 162 (quoting <em>Hensley, supra, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>at 235, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 683-84, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d. </em>at 616).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">We recognize there are differences between a detention and an arrest. \u201c[T]he privacy rights of an individual who is placed under lawful arrest are diminished.\u201d <em>Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 232, 463 A.2d 320. Moreover, arrestees are more likely to \u25a0want to retrieve items such as clothing or footwear because they are being taken to a police station. On the other hand, investigatory stops, like arrests, are \u201cencounters with the police in which a person\u2019s freedom of movement is restricted,\u201d <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 246, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007), and the detainee may be subjected to the \u201cinvasion of privacy that occurs in a pat-down of a person\u2019s body,\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>599, 619, 637 A.2d 158 (1994). Moreover, detainees have not yet been searched and may not have been frisked. Thus, there is a greater risk that detainees, particularly unfrisked detainees, have on their persons weapons they could access, or contraband or evidence they could conceal or destroy, if left unaccompanied. A <em>Terry </em>stop \u201c \u2018involves a police investigation \u201cat close range\u201d ... when the officer remains particularly vulnerable in part <em>because </em>a full custodial arrest has not been effected.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Carter, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 239 n. 4, 561 A.2d 1196 (App.Div.1989) (citation omitted); <em>Servis, supra, </em>371 S.E.2d at 162. By accompanying the detainee, the officer can better act \u201cat the first indication that he was in danger, or that evidence might be destroyed,\u201d <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 9, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 818, 70 L.Ed.2d at 786, and better \u201cprevent [the detainee\u2019s] escape,\u201d <em>Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 234, 463 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Moreover, as the high courts observed in <em>Chrisman </em>and <em>Bruzzese, </em>permitting such monitored movement may benefit the suspects who desire to get identification, clothing, or similar items. \u201cIndeed, were the rule otherwise, it is doubtful that an arrested person would ever be permitted to return to his residence, no matter how legitimate the reason for doing so. Such a rule would impose far greater restrictions on the personal liberty of arrested individuals than those occasioned here.\u201d <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 7 n. 4, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 817, 70 L.Ed.2d at 785; <em>see Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 234, 463 A.2d 320 (finding \u201cthe <em>Chrisman </em>rule offers a sensible middle ground\u201d). Such monitored movement may benefit detainees even more than arrestees because it could enable them to dispel police suspicions. Many detainees would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201cwelcome the opportunity to find their driver\u2019s licenses and thus avoid full custodial arrest.\u201d <em>Garcia, supra, </em>376 F.3d at 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The Supreme Courts in <em>Chrisman </em>and <em>Bruzzese </em>held that officers can accompany arrestees as a matter of course, without a special showing. \u201cThe absence of an affirmative indication that an arrested person might have a weapon available or might attempt to escape does not diminish the arresting officer\u2019s authority to maintain custody over the arrested person.\u201d <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 6, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 816-17, 70 L.Ed.2d at 785. \u201cThe officer need not posit any special need for the accompaniment so long as the arrest is lawful.\u201d <em>Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 232, 463 A.2d 320. \u201c \u2018There is no way for an officer to predict reliably how a particular subject will react to arrest or the degree of the potential danger,\u2019 \u201d and there is \u201cthe constant risk that the arrested defendant will seek to escape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 234, 463 A.2d 320 (quoting <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 7, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 817, 70 L.Ed.2d at 785). The same could be said about <em>Terry </em>stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Here, the circumstances justified Officer Dill accompanying defendant. Dill clearly had reasonable suspicion that defendant engaged in a marijuana offense. Defendant\u2019s attempt to evade Dill by rushing off to his car gave reason to believe defendant would flee if allowed to head toward his apartment unaccompanied.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Moreover, after defendant started walking to his apartment, the officer noticed a bulge in the pocket of defendant\u2019s grey sweatshirt. \u201cThe bulge in the [defendant\u2019s] jacket permitted the officer to conclude that [he] was armed and thus posed a serious and present danger to the safety of the officer.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>106, 111-12, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 334, 54 L.Ed.2d 331, 337-38 (1977). \u201cIndeed, a bulge alone has been held sufficient to validate a protective pat-down.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 621, 637 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Thus, the circumstances here provided not only reasonable suspicion defendant was involved in crime, but also reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>suspicion that he was armed and dangerous. The circumstances clearly justified Officer Dill in accompanying defendant to prevent him from escaping, accessing a possible weapon in his sweatshirt or his residence, or concealing or destroying the possible contraband in the sweatshirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Because both types of reasonable suspicion are present here, we need not decide whether reasonable suspicion that a detainee was involved in crime is itself sufficient to justify accompanying the detainee. However, we do not believe probable cause is necessary to justify accompanying a detainee in a <em>Terry </em>stop to prevent attack or escape. \u201c\u2018The Fourth Amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Arthur, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8, 691 A.2d 808 (1997) (quoting <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>143, 145, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612, 616 (1972)). Instead, the officer is permitted to detain the defendant diming the <em>Terry </em>stop and prevent his escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Defendant stresses Officer Dill was investigating a noise complaint and a marijuana offense. However, an \u201cofficer\u2019s authority to maintain custody over\u201d a defendant is not \u201caltered by the nature of the offense.\u201d <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 6-7 &amp; n. 3, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 816-17, 70 L.Ed.2d at 784-85. Moreover, the officer\u2019s authority to maintain custody allows him to accompany the defendant \u201cas a matter of routine\u201d; the Court rejected defendant\u2019s claim that \u201c \u2018exigent circumstances\u2019 \u201d are required. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7, 11, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 816-17, 819, 70 L.Ed.2d at 785, 788 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">For the reasons above, we apply <em>Chrisman </em>and <em>Bruzzese </em>and conclude Officer Dill\u2019s action of accompanying defendant to his apartment \u201cwas reasonable, and hence, constitutional, under both the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution.\u201d <em>Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 235, 463 A.2d 320. We note that \u201cthe police did not create the scenario that prompted defendant to return to his [apartment].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIt was the defendant himself who decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>go [there].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe police did not order or even suggest that defendant\u201d do so. Ibid,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he policeman\u2019s act of following defendant [to his apartment] was a reasonable consequence of defendant\u2019s own voluntary choice to go\u201d there to get his identification. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">We emphasize that a detainee may choose not to enter his residence once he becomes aware an officer must accompany him. As <em>Bruzzese </em>stated, \u201ceven after the police told the defendant they would have to accompany him, he could have declined to go [into his apartment] or asked [a third party] at that point to get his [identification].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If defendant had elected not to enter his apartment, \u201cthe officers could not have entered [it] without a search warrant.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Thus, a defendant holds the key to whether there is accompanied entry into the residence, because it is based on his own entry, and it cannot occur if he decides not to enter accompanied. Here, defendant turned that key by continuing into his apartment after learning that the officer would have to accompany him.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Given that the defendant holds the key, our Supreme Court in <em>Bruzzese </em>authorized officers to accompany an arrestee into his home even though \u201cone of this country\u2019s most protected rights throughout history has been the sanctity and privacy of a person\u2019s home,\u201d and that courts have \u201capplied a more stringent standard ... to searches of a residential dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 463 A.2d 320. The Court emphasized that \u201cthe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness,\u201d and that the officer\u2019s action in following the defendant into his home \u201cwas reasonable, and hence, constitutional, under both the Fourth Amendment of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 235, 463 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We similarly recognize that \u201c \u2018physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Vargas, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>301, 313, 63 A.3d 175 (2013) (quoting <em>United States v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>297, 313, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2125, 2134, 32 L.Ed.2d 752, 764 (1972)). \u201cThe Fourth Amendment and the New Jersey Constitution assure the \u2018highest degree of protection to privacy interests within the home.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coles, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>322, 337, 95 A.3d 136 (2014) (citation omitted). \u201cBoth protect against unreasonable searches and regard the warrantless entry into a person\u2019s home as \u2018presumptively unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Nonetheless, like the Supreme Court in <em>Bruzzese, </em>\u201cwe balance, as we must in all search and seizure eases, the interests of public safety, in this instance the protection of policemen, against the intrusion.\u201d <em>Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 232, 463 A.2d 320. We similarly conclude the \u201cofficer is entitled to the protection he or she would receive under this rule,\u201d and that it is \u201creasonable to permit policemen to keep [detained] persons in sight and within reach to prevent their escape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 234, 463 A.2d 320. This is particularly true where, as here, there is a reasonable belief they may be armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Once defendant entered his apartment, he provided Officer Dill further grounds for believing his grey sweatshirt contained a weapon or other contraband. Defendant removed the grey sweatshirt and instructed his female companion to put it in the bedroom while the officer was busy, and then suspiciously stepped over the grey sweatshirt to grab another sweatshirt from the closet. Given this indication that defendant was trying to conceal evidence, Dill \u201chad unrestricted access to the [apartment]\u201d to prevent it. <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 9, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 818, 70 L.Ed.2d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Indeed, Officer Dill would have been justified in seizing and searching the sweatshirt \u201cunder the well-recognized \u2018plain view exception to a warrantless seizure of property under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 235-36, 239, 463 A.2d 320 (upholding the plain view seizure and inspection of boots). The officer was \u201clawfully in the viewing area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 463 A.2d 320. As set forth below, he had \u201c \u2018probable cause to associate the [sweatshirt] with criminal activity' \u201d based on what he \u201c\u2018reasonably knew at the time of the seizure.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>at 213, 793 A.2d 619 (quoting <em>Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 237, 463 A.2d 320). Finally, Dill \u201cdiscover[ed] the evidence \u2018inadvertently,\u2019 \u2018meaning that he did not know in advance where evidence was located nor intend beforehand to seize it.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 793 A.2d 619 (quoting <em>Bruzzese, supra </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 236, 463 A.2d 320). Because he \u201cdid not know in advance that evidence would be found in\u201d the grey sweatshirt before he first encountered defendant, he did not use \u201cthe plain-view doctrine only as a pretense\u201d to avoid getting a warrant in advance of the encounter. <em>Id. </em>at 211-13, 793 A.2d 619; <em>see also State v. Padilla </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 109 &amp; n. 7, 728 A.2d 279 (App.Div.1999), <em>affd o.b., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>3, 746 A.2d 452 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"AqP\">Once again, Officer Dill chose a more restrained approach and simply secured the grey sweatshirt rather than immediately searching it. Invalidating his actions \u201cwould have the perverse effect of penalizing the officer for exercising more restraint than was required under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 8, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 817, 70 L.Ed.2d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Moreover, Officer Dill\u2019s monitoring of defendant\u2019s movements was \u201cconducted in an objectively reasonable fashion.\u201d <em>Bruzzese, supra </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 234, 463 A.2d 320. He did not \u201c \u2018lead the accused from place to place and attempt to use his presence in each location to justify a search\u2019 \u201d of the apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 234-35, 463 A.2d 320 (citation omitted). Instead, he simply insisted that defendant keep the sweatshirt he had been wearing, and accompanied him to retrieve it. Dill also did not \u201cdirect [defendant] to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>to another area without a legitimate reason grounded in the safety of the police or the public.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Instead, when defendant became extremely nervous, repeatedly looked at the sweatshirt, and became uncooperative, Dill directed defendant back outside of the apartment where the stop could be conducted with greater safety for the officer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Defendant\u2019s increasing nervousness, uncooperativeness, and apparent preparation to flee led Officer Dill, whose backup officer was leaving to investigate another person, to handcuff defendant. Dill then conducted a canine sniff of defendant\u2019s sweatshirt, placing him in the police car to prevent him from triggering any protective efforts by the police dog. The metal clank resulting from the canine sniff gave further proof that the sweatshirt contained a weapon, as the subsequent search confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The trial court properly found these precautions were reasonable and not unnecessarily intrusive under the circumstances. \u201cThe touchstone of a court\u2019s analysis under the Fourth Amendment is, as always, \u2018 \u201cthe reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 614, 637 A.2d 158 (quoting <em>Mimms, supra, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>at 109, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 332, 54 L.Ed.2d at 335 (quoting <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 19, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1878-79, 20 L.Ed.2d at 904)). \u201cAuthorities must be allowed \u2018to graduate their response to the demands of any particular situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

However, handcuffing does not necessarily \u201cestablishf ] the fact of an arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 706 A.2d 180. Further, our Supreme Court has refused \u201cto hamstring the police officers\u2019 on-the-scene determination to keep defendant detained in the patrol car\u201d during a <em>Terry </em>stop if their investigation requires them to divert their attention from the defendant. <em>Coles, supra, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>at 347, 95 A.3d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Moreover, \u201cconducting a dog sniff [does] not change the character of a <em>[Terry </em>] stop that is lawful at its inception and otherwise executed in a reasonable manner,\u201d because it \u201cgenerally does not implicate legitimate privacy interests.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>405, 408-09, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>834, 837-38, 160 L.Ed.2d 842, 847 (2005); <em>see also State v.

Officer Dill had reasonable suspicion that defen dant\u2019s sweatshirt contained drugs or a weapon, and the K-9 dog trained to detect drugs was immediately available to conduct a dog sniff for drugs. Indeed, an officer in a lawful investigatory stop may conduct a dog sniff even if it \u201cprolongs the stop\u201d to a reasonable extent needed to complete the dog sniff procedure, so long as the officer has \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of drug possession. <em>Rodriguez v.

Therefore, there was plainly probable cause to arrest defendant before he was handcuffed or confined, and even before Dill secured the sweatshirt in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">It is \u201c \u2018irrelevant\u2019 \u201d whether Officer Dill had the subjective belief he had probable cause to arrest. <em>State v. O\u2019Neal, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>601, 613-14, 921 A.2d 1079 (2007) (citation omitted). As <em>Bruzzese </em>held, \u201c[i]n determining whether a police officer\u2019s actions are constitutional, we do not rely on the officer\u2019s own subjective appraisal, but upon an objective evaluation by a neutral judicial authority.\u201d <em>Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 219-20, 463 A.2d 320. \u201cAlthough an officer may testify to his or her subjective intent, the crucial inquiry is whether the officer\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 614, 921 A.2d 1079. \u201c \u2018An action is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the] action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613-14, 921 A.2d 1079 (quoting <em>Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>398, 404, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>1943, 1948, 164 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>650, 658 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u201c[T]he fact that the officers did not believe there was probable cause and proceeded on a consensual or Terry-stop rationale would not foreclose the State from justifying [a defendant\u2019s] custody by proving probable cause.\u201d <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>491, 507, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1319, 1329, 75 L.Ed.2d 229, 242 (1983) (plurality opinion) (citing <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>40, 66-67, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1889, 1904, 20 L.Ed.2d 917, 936-37 (1968)). Thus, in <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>our Supreme Court upheld a purported <em>Terry </em>stop because \u201cobjectively, [the officers] had probable cause,\u201d and \u201ccould have immediately placed him under arrest, searched him, and seized the bag of drugs as a search incident to a lawful arrest.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>O\u2019Neal, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 607, 611, 613-14, 921 A.2d 1079. Similarly, even if Officer Dill\u2019s precautions made this a de facto arrest, probable cause justified arrest, the search of defendant\u2019s sweatshirt, and the seizure of the gun. <em>See id. </em>at 613-14, 921 A.2d 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">At the suppression hearing, the parties cited <em>Chrisman </em>and <em>Bruzzese, </em>which the State urged authorized Officer Dill to accompany defendant into his apartment. The trial court agreed \u201cthe police acted within their authority in following the Defendant into the apartment.\u201d However, in its appellate brief, the State without explanation abandoned that position, and instead argued that we should uphold the denial of suppression on the grounds of inevitable discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">At oral argument, the State clarified it was not confessing error in the trial court\u2019s ruling, but merely offering a new, alternative basis for affirmance. Regardless, any confession of error would not be binding on this court. <em>State v. Josey, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>17, 32, 674 A.2d 996 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>497, 683 A.2d 200 (1996). \u201c[A] confession of error by the State must be taken into account by an appellate court but is not a controlling factor,\u201d and \u201c \u2018does not relieve this [c]ourt of the performance of the judicial function.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Young v. United States, </em>315 <em>U.S. </em>257, 258, 62 <em>S.Ct. </em>510, 511, 86 <em>L.Ed. </em>832, 834-835 (1942)). The trial court has made a ruling, and \u201c\u2018our judicial obligations compel us to examine independently the errors confessed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 674 A.2d 996 (quoting <em>Young, supra, </em>315 <em>U.S. </em>at 258-59, 62 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 511, 86 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 835). Our analysis finds no error by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Thus, we do not consider the State\u2019s new inevitable discovery argument, which was raised for the first time on appeal, without the necessary facts being developed in the trial court. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 516, 677 A.2d 1129 (App.Div.1996); <em>see State v. M.A., </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 358 n. 1, 954 A.2d 503 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(App.Div.2008); <em>see generally State v. Robinson, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18-22, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Defendant\u2019s appellate brief also challenged the sentencing court\u2019s denial of bail pending appeal. He did not file a motion in this court seeking bail pending appeal under <em>Rule </em>2:9-4. A defendant requesting bail pending appeal should raise that issue by motion filed promptly after filing the appeal, to bring the request to our attention earlier. At this point, the appeal is no longer pending before us and the issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In any event, a defendant may only receive bail pending appeal \u201cif it appears that the case involves a substantial question that should be determined by the appellate court, that the safety of any person or of the community will not be seriously threatened if the defendant remains on bail and that there is no significant risk of defendant\u2019s flight.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The sentencing court found that the safety of the community would be seriously threatened given defendant\u2019s firearm conviction and criminal history, and that there was a significant risk of flight as he was facing a substantial prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u201cThe setting of bail is vested in the sound discretion of the trial court, and we consequently review the trial court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Steele, </em>430 <em>N.J.Super. </em>24, 34, 61 A.3d 174 (App.Div.), <em>appeal granted, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>233, 69 A.3d 116 (2013), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>\u2014 <em>N.J. </em>-, \u2014 A.3d - (2014). Even assuming the appeal presents a substantial question, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-15\"> Defendant's sentence was concurrent to a three-year sentence for an unrelated drug possession charge, and a one-year sentence for an unrelated obstruction charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b43-10\"> At oral argument on appeal, defendant conceded the officer had not violated his rights prior to that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b44-10\"> The Court noted that \"our lower courts also have followed the <em>Chrisman </em>approach.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing, <em>e.g., State v.
