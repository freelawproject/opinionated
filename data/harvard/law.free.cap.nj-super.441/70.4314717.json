The Attorney General \u2014 on behalf of three municipalities, the Bergen County Police Department, the New Jersey State Police (NJSP), and their records custodians \u2014 appeals from the trial court\u2019s order compelling disclosure pursuant to both OPRA and the common law. Having reviewed the State\u2019s arguments in light of the record and applicable principles of law, we conclude the trial court misinterpreted OPRA\u2019s provisions governing criminal investigatory records. The court also erred in declining to consider the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>proposed ex parte showing of why releasing certain requested documents would undermine its investigation and be inimical to the public interest. As a result, we reverse the court\u2019s order compelling release of the requested documents, and remand for reconsideration in light of the principles we set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Plaintiff North Jersey Media Group, Inc. (NJMG) is the owner of numerous print and web-based news organizations, including <em>The Record, </em>a general circulation daily newspaper, and the <em>South Bergenite, </em>a weekly community newspaper. Reporters for these two publications sought various records of local, county, and state law enforcement agencies (LEAs) pertaining to the fatal police shooting of a criminal suspect, Kashad Ashford. The shooting followed a high-speed chase of Ashford and his passenger Jem-maine T. Bynes across multiple municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The records custodians of the LEAs did not respond consistently. None provided documents before NJMG filed its November 3, 2014, complaint. Thereafter, NJMG received 9-1-1 call recordings, various redacted police documents containing computer aided dispatch (CAD) reports, and a uniform force report (UFR).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the defendants continue to deny access to many other requested documents, or to even acknowledge they exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The events leading to the fatal shooting are set forth in a September 16, 2014, press release of the Attorney General\u2019s Office (OAG); a December 9, 2014, certification of Cortney Lawrence, the NJSP\u2019s lead detective in the Attorney General\u2019s Shooting Response Team (SRT) investigation; and a December 10, 2014, certification of New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice (DCJ) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Lieutenant Robert McGrath, Detective Lawrence\u2019s supervisor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A North Arlington resident called 9-1-1 at 2:12 a.m. on September 16 to report an attempted burglary of her vehicle from her driveway. A North Arlington patrol vehicle was dispatched to the scene to interview the resident. Meanwhile, additional officers from the police departments of North Arlington, Lyndhurst, Rutherford, and Bergen County joined the investigation into the attempted burglary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Officers soon spotted an SUV matching the information provided. Police determined the SUV was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Police attempted to perform a motor vehicle stop, but the driver, later identified as Ashford, refused. Instead, Ashford led officers on a high-speed chase through several municipalities. At one point, Ashford attempted to ram a police vehicle head-on. He later crashed into a guardrail on Ridge Road at Route 3 in Lyndhurst.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The press release and the detective\u2019s certification present different versions of what happened next. According to the press release, more than one officer fired upon Ashford after he spun his tires and allegedly backed his SUV at the officers, ramming a police vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Det. Lawrence\u2019s certification issued nearly three months later was less definitive. The detective stated Ashford and Bynes revved the engine \u201cas if to force their way out\u201d; police had surrounded the vehicle; and ultimately, Ashford was shot and killed. The detective did not assert Ashford backed up, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>rammed a police vehicle, nor did the detective state how many officers shot at Ashford.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Ashford was fatally shot at around 2:27 a.m., and pronounced dead at a nearby hospital at 7:05 a.m. Officers found a .357-caliber Magnum handgun and a facemask in the vehicle. Bynes was arrested at the scene and charged with weapons offenses and receiving stolen property. The SRT immediately assumed control of the investigation. According to released CAD reports, NJSP investigators began interviewing officers that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Following the shooting, <em>The Record </em>reporter Abbott Koloff and <em>South Bergenite </em>reporter Meghan Grant submitted separate requests under OPRA and the common law regarding the incident. On September 16, 2014, Koloff asked Lyndhurst, North Arlington, Rutherford, and the Bergen County Police Department to produce:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">1. Incident Reports, Operation Reports, Investigation Reports, and/or Offense Reports (including supplemental reports);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">2. Log book notations, daily activity logs, daily bulletins, daily statistical sheets, tally sheets, vehicle logs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">3. Audio recordings, and if available, written transcripts of such audio recordings of all police and law enforcement dispatches and recorded conversations including all 911 calls;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">4. Arrest reports for individual(s) in the incidents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">5. All information required to [be] released by law enforcement under Section 3(b) of the New Jersey Open Public Records Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3(b) where (i) an arrest has not yet been made; and (ii) where an arrest has been made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">6. Use of force reports;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">7. Audio and Video recordings from the mobile recorders (MVRs) in the vehicles of law enforcement personnel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">8. Motor Vehicle Accident Reports, Crash and Investigation Reports;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-15\">9. Computer Aided Dispatch reports;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-16\">10. Mobile Data Terminal Printouts (MDTs).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The same day, Koloff requested the following records from the State Police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">1. use of force report[;] 2. audio recordings of law enforcement dispatches and recorded conversations including 911 calls; 3. audio and video recordings from mobile recorders (MVRs) in vehicles of law enforcement personnel; 4. computer aided dispatch reports[;] 5. arrest reports[;] 6. Motor Vehicle Accident Reports, Crash and Investigation Reportsf;] 7. incident reports, operation reports, investigation reports and offense reports (including supplemental reports)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Grant\u2019s September 17, 2014, request asked Lyndhurst to disclose the following documents \u201cas they are created\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u2014All police reports concerning the Sept. 16, 2014 pursuit of suspects later identified as Kashad Ashford and Jemmaine Bynes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">\u2014All use of force reports by Lyndhurst officers concerning the Sept. 16, 2014 shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">\u2014Any additional documentation kept by the Lyndhurst Police Department concerning the Sept. 16, 2014 pursuit of suspects later identified as Kashad Ashford and Jemmaine Bynes and shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">\u2014Any video tape (or a transcription of the video tape) obtained during the course of the investigation into the Sept. 16 pursuit and shooting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Although the responses varied, none of the LEAs\u2019 records custodians produced responsive documents before NJMG filed its complaint. Lyndhurst\u2019s records custodian denied both reporters\u2019 requests on September 25, 2014, based on the OAG\u2019s ongoing investigation. Before doing that, the custodian had referred the records request to OAG, which referred it back to Lyndhurst. North Arlington\u2019s records custodian wrote to Koloff on September 25, 2014, stating that his requests were subject to an \u201congoing [OAG] investigation\u201d and the OAG would determine what to release. The Bergen County Police Department\u2019s records custodian likewise denied Koloffs request based on the criminal investigatory records exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Rutherford\u2019s borough clerk also denied Grant\u2019s request in a September 23, 2014, letter, stating it pertained to an investigation in progress, and release would jeopardize persons\u2019 safety, the investigation, or would otherwise be inappropriate. The clerk provided a statement from the Rutherford Police Chief, disclosing that the department generated one CAD entry, two incident reports, a daily activity log, and a copy of radio and telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>transmissions, which were to be turned over to the Attorney General\u2019s Office. The police chief stated that all further information requests should be directed to the OAG, at the request of Lt. McGrath, the supervisor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">NJSP postponed its response three times, the last time promising to respond by November 6, 2014. As late as October 23, 2014, the NJSP records custodian wrote that he was \u201cstill trying to determine if the investigation into the death of Kashad Ashford was conducted by the NJSP.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The records custodian stated his search was impeded by the lack of a \u201ccase number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">NJMG\u2019s two-count complaint alleged violations of OPRA and the common law right to know. NJMG sought an order compelling the release, or an in camera review, of documents believed to be exempt; and fees and costs pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-6. The court entered an Order to Show Cause (OSC) returnable December 12, 2014, which was adjourned to January 9, 2015, at the OAG\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">After the complaint was filed, Rutherford and the OAG released documents. On December 5, 2014, Rutherford\u2019s counsel wrote that he determined disclosure was appropriate under OPRA \u201cdespite initially being advised to the contrary by the New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s Office.\u201d The counsel provided unredacted copies of: a CAD report, a property report, a compact disc (CD) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>containing the recordings of three phone calls from the public regarding the incident, and a CD containing \u201cRadio Transmissions from Rutherford PD Case # 14H9344, 9-16-14.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The CAD report listed the names of the officers dispatched, their ear numbers, along with their response times, and the name of the dispatcher. It included an entry that all additional information and reports were to be generated by the OAG.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Rutherford\u2019s attorney also provided three investigation reports, which were redacted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A Vaughn<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> index was provided, explaining the records were redacted for three reasons: to protect against disclosing personal information that would violate \u201creasonable privacy interests,\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 and <em>Burnett v. County of Bergen, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>408, 968 A.2d 1151 (2009); to shield criminal investigatory records, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1; and to shield records related to an ongoing investigation, the release of which would be detrimental to the public interest, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3(a) <em>and </em>(b). Rutherford Police Department telephone and radio recordings were placed on a CD-R, which was turned over to the NJSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">On December 22, 2014, the OAG released a 9-1-1 call recording, and what its counsel described as \u201cCAD reports\u201d in the possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>of the DCJ. The dispatch reports were actually contained within other documents, which were to varying degrees, redacted without explanation. These included: a North Arlington Police Department Investigation Report, which included mostly unredacted incident details, and completely redacted sections entitled \u201cname details\u201d and \u201cnarrative details\u201d; a Lyndhurst Police Department Dispatch Log, with the officer name section redacted; a Bergen County Police Department Incident Report Form, which included unredacted information about the incident, but redacted the names of the officers who generated and approved the report, and included a blaeked-out half page. The State did not provide a <em>Vaughn </em>index, nor did it expressly confirm whether the remaining requested documents existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In its response to the OSC, the State provided certifications from Det. Lawrence and Lt. McGrath. In addition to setting forth details of the events leading to the shooting, Det. Lawrence stated that the SRT assumed control of the investigation \u201conce the shooting took place.\u201d The SRT\u2019s investigation of the shooting, as well as its investigation into Bynes\u2019s actions, were ongoing at the time of the certification, on December 10, 2014. However, Bynes, who was released on bail, was fatally shot in Newark in March 2015.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Det. Lawrence asserted that all documents generated after the initial 9-1-1 call were investigatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Lt. McGrath generally explained the Attorney General\u2019s Directive 2006-5, which established the procedures for investigating fatal police shootings, and the role of the SRT, which operates independently from the ordinary chain of command. Lt. McGrath stated that consistent with the directive, the SRT assumed control of the investigation of the shooting, and the underlying alleged criminal actions of Ashford and Bynes. Also consistent with the directive, Lt. McGrath expected the matter to be presented to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>State Grand Jury after the SRT completed its investigation. DCJ maintained all evidence and investigative materials. Lt. McGrath asserted the investigation was ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">With respect to the reporters\u2019 document requests, Lt. McGrath conceded the reporters were entitled to the 9-1-1 recordings and related CAD reports, which the OAG released soon thereafter with redactions in the case of the CAD reports. He explained the initial 9-1-1 recording was not a product of the investigation, although the call prompted it. He did not explain the basis for releasing the CAD reports. Lt. McGrath asserted that releasing \u201cany of the other requested records ... would irrevocably compromise the ongoing investigation.\u201d He contended that release would \u201ccorrupt the independent recollections of witnesses,\u201d and lead witnesses to alter prior statements, resulting in inconsistent statements that may benefit a defendant. However, Lt. McGrath did not confirm which of the other requested documents were actually withheld, and which simply did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Lt. McGrath sought the opportunity to present, under seal and ex parte, <em>\u201ccase-specific </em>examples of how the threats to the integrity of the ongoing investigation and the negative impact of same on the public interest, would be evident in release of the records being sought for production here.\u201d He stated he could not provide a more specific justification without disclosing the information the OAG sought to keep confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">On the return date of the OSC, the trial court concluded NJMG was entitled to all the records requested pursuant to both OPRA and the common law, effective upon entry of the court\u2019s order. The court denied the OAG\u2019s motion to review an ex parte certification from Lt. McGrath.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">In its decision, the court reviewed the factual history of the case, and the various governmental entities\u2019 responses to NJMG\u2019s OPRA requests. The court held that redacting documents was equivalent to the denial of access, citing <em>Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. New Jersey Sports &amp; Exposition Authority, </em>423 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 148, 31 A.3d 623 (App.Div.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Addressing NJMG\u2019s access rights under OPRA, the court concluded that neither the criminal investigatory records exception, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47-.1A-1.1, nor the ongoing investigation exception, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3(a), shielded the documents from release. The former provision excludes \u201ccriminal investigatory records\u201d from the definition of government records subject to disclosure under OPRA, unless the records are \u201crequired by law to be made, maintained or kept on file.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The court concluded the governmental entities failed to meet their burden to show the \u201crequired by law\u201d exception-to-the-exception did not apply. The court held that UFRs were required by law to be made, pursuant to Attorney General directives, which have the force of law, citing <em>O\u2019Shea, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382, 982 A.2d 459. The court held that 9-1-1 calls, police dispatch records, and CAD entries were also \u201crequired by law\u201d documents, citing <em>Serrano v. South Brunswick Township, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 364, 817 A.2d 1004 (App.Div.2003), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-1, and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:24-2.4. Motor vehicle accident reports were not exempt from disclosure because they must be made public pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-131. As for the remaining documents, the court held that local police general orders and policies have the force of law necessary to remove the records from the exemption, citing <em>O\u2019Shea, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382-83, 982 A.2d 459, and the State failed to demonstrate by competent evidence that those orders or policies did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The court also rejected the State\u2019s reliance on the \u201congoing investigation\u201d exception, which applies only if release of documents would be \u201cinimical to the public interest.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1-3(a). The court was unpersuaded by the State\u2019s general argument that release of investigatory materials would taint witnesses\u2019 independent recollections. The court declined to consider Lt. McGrath\u2019s proposed ex parte submission. The court held that whether to consider documents under seal was a discretionary decision, citing <em>Hammock ex rel. Hammock v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>356, 380, 662 A.2d 546 (1995). The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>concluded Lt. McGrath had failed to provide sufficient proof of injury if the proposed second certification were publicly released.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The court likened the State\u2019s arguments to the claim that release of investigatory documents would taint potential jurors, which the court stated was rejected in <em>Cornier News v. Hunterdon County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>373, 817 A.2d 1017 (App.Div.2003). Additionally, the court discussed the public\u2019s substantial interest in police shootings of suspects, particularly given recent incidents in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York. The court noted that significant time had passed since the shooting of Ashford, and witness statements were likely already obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The court also held that the OAG failed to comply with the OPRA provision requiring release of certain information, specified in the law, absent a showing the release would jeopardize persons\u2019 safety, an investigation, or was otherwise inappropriate. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3(b). The court determined the press release was insufficient, and release of underlying documents was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The court found the responding entities failed to comply with the timelines mandated by OPRA. Also, the court concluded NJMG was entitled to fees under OPRA and asked the parties to attempt to agree upon a \u201creasonable quantum of fees.\u201d Absent agreement, the court set a schedule for submission of a certification of services, as well as a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Finally, the court addressed NJMG\u2019s rights under the common law right of public access. Citing <em>Keddie v. Rutgers, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>36, 689 A.2d 702 (1997), the court identified the three predicates to the common law right of access. As stated in <em>Keddie, </em>the three predicates are: \u201c(1) the records must be common-law public documents; (2) the person [or entity] seeking access must establish an interest in the subject matter of the material; and (3) the citizen\u2019s right to access must be balanced against the State\u2019s interest in preventing disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 689 A.2d 702 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The trial court noted that no party disputed that the requested documents were com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>mon law public records. Moreover, NJMG had standing, given its interest in policing the workings of government. Lastly, balancing the factors set forth in <em>Loigman v. Kimmelman, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>98, 505 A.2d 958 (1986), the court found that the public\u2019s interest in disclosure outweighed the responding entities\u2019 interest in confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">By order entered January 22, 2015, the court compelled defendants to \u201clocate, identify and produce, without redactions, all responsive records to [NJMG\u2019s] OPRA requests and provide such records to [NJMG]\u201d within three days. On January 26, 2015, the court granted a stay until January 30, 2015, but otherwise denied a stay pending appeal. We subsequently granted an emergent motion for leave to appeal, and stayed the court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We exercise de novo review of the trial court\u2019s decision that OPRA requires disclosure of publicly held records. <em>See, e.g., K.L. v. Evesham Twp. Bd. of Educ., </em>423 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 349, 32 A.3d 1136 (App.Div.2011), <em>certif. denied, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>108, 40 A.3d 732 (2012). \u2018We apply the same standard of review to the court\u2019s legal conclusions with respect to whether access to public records is appropriate under the common-law right of access.\u201d <em>Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath LLP v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 497, 24 A.3d 829 (App.Div.2011). We apply a different and deferential standard of review when a court conducts an in camera review of documents and balances competing interests in disclosure and confidentiality in connection with a common-law-based request to inspect public records. <em>Shuttleworth v. City of Camden, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 588, 610 A.2d 903 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>429, 627 A.2d 1135 (1992). However, \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the extent [the appellate court] can be said to be reviewing essentially a legal determination, [it] can review the documents which the trial judge ordered disclosed____\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In determining whether documents or information related to a criminal investigation must be disclosed under OPRA, a court must engage in a three-stage statutory analysis, which we describe below. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1, -3(a), -3(b). The governmental entity bears the burden to establish a basis for non-disclosure. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-6. It is undisputed that but for any exemptions, the requested records qualify as \u201cgovernment reeord[s]\u201d subject to access under OPRA, because they are documents or recordings made, maintained, or kept on file by public officials. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. The trial court\u2019s decision raises interpretational issues as to each stage of the statutory analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">First, the court must consider whether the requested document is a \u201ccriminal investigatory record[ ],\u201d which is excluded from the definition of government record generally subject to disclosure under OPRA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. A \u201ccriminal investigatory record\u201d is defined as a document \u201cheld by a law enforcement agency which pertains to any criminal investigation or related civil enforcement proceeding[,]\u201d which is \u201cnot required by law to be made, maintained or kept on file.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The provision thus raises two issues for analysis: what \u201cpertains to\u201d an investigation or enforcement proceeding; and what satisfies the \u201crequired by law\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Second, even if the document does not qualify as a \u201ccriminal investigatory record\u201d \u2014 for example, because it is a \u201crequired by law\u201d document \u2014 -the court must consider whether the document may be withheld as a document that \u201cpertain[s] to an investigation in progress by any public agency ... if the inspection, copying or examination of such record or records shall be inimical to the public interest.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3(a). This exception, however, does not apply to a record that was \u201copen for public inspection ... before the investigation commenced.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We examine the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>court\u2019s rejection of the State\u2019s claim that release of the documents was \u201cinimical to the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Regardless of whether a document can be withheld as a \u201ccriminal investigatory record\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1, or as a document pertaining to an ongoing investigation, the release of which would be mimical to the public interest under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3(a), a public agency must still disclose certain \u201cinformation\u201d pertaining to a criminal investigation within twenty-four hours of a request or as soon as practicable. <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:lA-3(b). This information includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">where a crime has been reported but no arrest yet made, information as to the type of crime, time, location and type of weapon, if any;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">if an arrest has been made, information as to the name, address and age of any victims unless there has not been sufficient opportunity for notification of next of kin of any victims of injury and/or death to any such victim or where the release of the names of any victim would be contrary to existing law or court rule. In deciding on the release of information as to the identity of a victim, the safety of the victim and the victim\u2019s family, and the integrity of any ongoing investigation, shall be considered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">if an arrest has been made, information as to the defendant\u2019s name, age, residence, occupation, marital status and similar background information and, the identity of the complaining party unless the release of such information is contrary to existing law or coui-t rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">information as to the text of any charges such as the complaint, accusation and indictment unless sealed by the court or unless the release of such information is contrary to existing law or court rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">information as to the identity of the investigating and arresting personnel and agency and the length of the investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">information of the circumstances immediately surrounding the arrest, including but not limited to the time and place of the arrest, resistance, if any, pur-suit, possession and nature and use of weapons and ammunition by the suspect and by the police; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">information as to circumstances surrounding bail, whether it was posted and the amount thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">However, the public agency may withhold such information if release would \u201cjeopardize the safety of any person or jeopardize any investigation in progress or may be otherwise inappropriate to release.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This \u201cexception shall be narrowly construed to prevent disclosure of information that would be harmful to a bona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>fide law enforcement purpose or the public safety.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>When a public agency relies on this exception, it shall issue a brief explanation. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We turn first to the court\u2019s determination that the State failed to meet its burden to show that the requested documents were criminal investigatory records, that is, records \u201cpertaining] to any criminal investigation or related civil enforcement proceeding!,]\u201d and \u201cnot required by law to be made, maintained or kept on file.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. As explained above, \u201crequired by law\u201d documents constitute an exception-to-the-exception of documents pertaining to a criminal investigation or related civil enforcement proceeding. Based on the legislative history, and prior case law, we are persuaded that the court interpreted the \u201crequired by law\u201d exception-to-the-exception too broadly. On the other hand, the court\u2019s findings with respect to release of 9-1-1 recordings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>part of the CAD reports are consistent with principles we shall set forth below regarding what constitutes documents that do or do not \u201cpertain[ ] to any criminal investigation.\u201d <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">We address the \u201crequired by law\u201d issue first. We begin by reviewing legislative history, which justifies applying pre-OPRA case law in interpreting this exeeption-to-the-exception. We then review that case law, and apply it to the requests in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">OPRA was adopted in 2002 as an amendment to the Right to Know Law (RTKL), which had remained largely intact since its enactment in 1963. <em>L. </em>1963, c. 73.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The RTKL generally created a statutory right of access to government documents \u201crequired by law to be made, maintained or kept on file.\u201d <em>L. </em>1963, c. 73, \u00a7 1, <em>repealed by L. </em>2001, c. 404, \u00a7 17. The \u201crequired by law\u201d precondition was narrowly construed. <em>See, e.g., Keddie, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 46, 689 A.2d 702 (\u201c[T]his Court has consistently held that the Righb-to-Know Law\u2019s definition of a public record is narrow and is to be strictly construed.\u201d). The RTKL also excluded from release documents pertaining to investigations in progress, if release would be inimical to the public interest. <em>L. </em>1963, c. 73, \u00a7 3 (permitting the denial of access to records that \u201cpertain to an investigation in progress ... [and] inspection, copying or publication of such record or records shall be inimical to the public interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The \u201crequired by law\u201d standard was recognized as a significant impediment to public access under the law. As noted by Senator Robert J. Martin, the principal co-author of the Senate version of the legislation that ultimately was enacted as OPRA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">We have a Right to Know Act, which dates back to 1963. The problem with that law is that it only requires ... [access to] documents that are required by law to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>made ... maintained, or kept on file. The statute, in other words, is very narrow in its form. And what has happened is that many records, which the public, I think, would expect to be available to them, are not required by law to be made \u2014 to be maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\"><em>[Public Hearing before Senate Judiciary Comm., Senate Bill Nos. 161, 351, 573, and, 866, </em>209th Legislature (March 9, 2000) (Statement of Sen. Martin) at 1-2.] <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The legislative response in OPRA required access to \u201cgovernment records\u201d subject to enumerated exceptions, and defined \u201cgovernment records,\u201d as those in their various forms, \u201cthat ha[ve] been made, maintained or kept on file\u201d without regard to whether the law required them to be made, maintained, or kept on file. This change was embodied in the legislation as introduced, and as finally enacted. <em>Compare </em>Assembly Bill No. 1309, 209th Legislature (Pre-filed for Introduction in the 2000 Session) and Senate Bill No. 2003, 209th Legislature (December 14, 2000), <em>with </em>Assembly Bill No. 1309, 209th Legislature (Fifth Reprint) (January 8, 2002), and <em>L. </em>2001, c. 404, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In its initial version, the legislation did not single out criminal investigatory records for special treatment within the definition of \u201cgovernment record.\u201d However, a Senate floor amendment offered by Senator Martin to the Assembly-passed version of Assembly Bill No. 1309 changed that. The amendment excluded from the definition of government records, \u201ccriminal investigatory records,\u201d which it defined as \u201ca record which is not required by law to be made, maintained or kept on file that is held by a law enforcement agency which pertains to any criminal investigation or related civil enforcement proceeding.\u201d <em>See </em>Assembly Bill No. 1309 (Fifth Reprint). Such records were \u201cdeemed ... confidential\u201d for the purposes of the statute, as were other documents covered by other exemptions. The purpose was to narrow access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>to criminal investigatory records. <em>See </em>Statement to Senate Bill No. 2003 with Senate Floor Amendments, 209th Legislature (Proposed by Senator Martin) (Adopted May 3, 2001) (\u201cThe amendments exempt criminal investigatory records of a law enforcement agency from the statutory right of access. However, a common law right of access could be asserted to these and other records not accessible under the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Also part of the floor amendment was the provision now codified at section 3(b), described above, which requires disclosure of specified information about a criminal investigation, notwithstanding any exemption from disclosure, provided it does not jeopardize persons\u2019 safety, the investigation, or is otherwise inappropriate. The provisions of section 3(b) were largely drawn from an executive order of Governor Whitman, <em>see </em>Exec. Order No. 69, 113 (Whitman) (May 15, 1997), which in turn largely incorporated the terms of an executive order of Governor Kean. <em>See </em>Exec. Order No. 123, H 2 (Kean) (Nov. 12,1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Beginning with an order of Governor Hughes in 1963, \u201c[fingerprint cards, plates and photographs and other similar criminal investigation records which are required to be made, maintained or kept by any State or local government agency\u201d were exempt from disclosure under the RTKL. Exec. Order No. 9, 112(e) (Hughes) (Sept. 30, 1963). Governor Kean continued this exemption, with the proviso that the information, ultimately identified in section 3(b), \u201cshall be made available to the public as soon as practicable unless it shall appear that the release of such information will jeopardize the safety of any person or any investigation in progress or be otherwise inappropriate.\u201d Exec. Order No. 123, 112 (Kean). The order went on to state that \u201c \u2018as soon as practicable\u2019 shall generally be understood to mean within 24 hours.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Thus, Senator Martin\u2019s amendment restored, with respect to criminal investigatory records, the RTKL\u2019s \u201crequired by law\u201d standard. Criminal investigatory records were exempt from access if they were \u201cnot required by law to be made, maintained or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>kept on file.\u201d In other words, the public\u2019s right of access to criminal investigatory records reverted to what existed pre-OPRA: access was granted to records \u201crequired by law to be made, maintained or kept on file.\u201d However, the drafters also codified the mandate to release of identified information, in place since Governor Kean\u2019s 1985 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In view of this history, it is appropriate to interpret the \u201ccriminal investigatory records\u201d exception in OPRA in light of preOPRA case law interpreting the RTKL\u2019s \u201crequired by law\u201d standard in cases involving requests for records pertaining to criminal investigations. According to well-established principles of statutory construction, the Legislature\u2019s reinsertion of the RTKL\u2019s formulation reflected its approval of prior judicial interpretation, as it applied to criminal investigatory records.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">The construction of a statute by the courts, supported by long acquiescence on the part of the Legislature, or by continued use of the same language or failure to amend the statute, is evidence that such construction is in accordance with the legislative intent. The persuasive effect of such legislative inaction is increased where the statute has been amended after a judicial construction without any change in the language so interpreted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\"><em>[Lemke v. Bailey, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>295, 301, 196 A.2d 523 (1963) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">\u201cMoreover, courts will not impute a legislative intention to alter an established judicial interpretation absent a \u2018clear manifestation\u2019 of such intent.\u201d <em>Coyle v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Warren (My., </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>260, 267, 787 A.2d 881 (2002) (citation omitted). The case for inferring legislative endorsement of prior judicial interpretation is especially strong in this case, which presents not merely the acquiescence in prior language, or amendment without change of prior language, but the affirmative restoration of prior language after its deletion in earlier versions of the legislation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We recognize that OPRA generally commands that limitations on access to government documents \u201cshall be construed in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the public\u2019s right of access.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1. By contrast, as noted, the \u201crequired by law\u201d standard was narrowly construed, including as applied to records related to criminal investigations. <em>See Shuttleworth, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 581, 610 A.2d 903; <em>Home News Publ\u2019g Co. v. State, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>7, 11, 539 A.2d 736 (App.Div.1988). We do not construe OPRA\u2019s general rule of construction as a basis to deviate from the established interpretation of the \u201crequired by law\u201d standard, which by amendment was reinserted into OPRA. The OPRA rule of construction guides statutory interpretation where the statute is unclear, or ambiguous. The \u201crequired by law\u201d standard was already clearly defined by established case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">According to pre-OPRA judicial interpretation, documents are \u201crequired by law to be made, maintained or kept on file,\u201d if so mandated by a statute, regulation, executive order, or judicial decision. We are not persuaded that a generic record retention policy, or an internal agency directive of a public official would suffice to satisfy the \u201crequired by law\u201d standard with respect to criminal investigatory records.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The distinction between documents \u201crequired by law,\u201d and documents created through the exercise of discretion, was recognized in <em>Irval Realty Inc. v. Board of Public Utility Commissioners, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>366, 294 A.2d 425 (1972), which involved civil investigational records. <em>Id. </em>at 369-71, 294 A.2d 425. After a gas explosion, the plaintiffs sought reports that a utility prepared and filed with the Board of Public Utility Commissioners (PUC), and an investigative report prepared by the PUC staff. <em>Id. </em>at 369-70, 294 A.2d 425. The utility\u2019s report was prepared pursuant to a formally promulgated PUC regulation requiring utilities to report certain accidents. <em>Id. </em>at 370, 294 A.2d 425. The Court held that the RTKL encompassed the utility\u2019s reports because the PUC\u2019s regulation had \u201cthe force of law and require[d] that such reports be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375, 294 A.2d 425. The Court did not so find as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the PUC staffs reports, stating, \u201cWhether the investigation reports prepared by members of defendant\u2019s staff meet this definition is less clear, but need not be decided here since they certainly qualify as public records within the scope of the common law rule.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> See also </em>Attorney General George F. Kugler, Jr., <em>New Jersey\u2019s Right to Know, A Report On Open Government </em>9 (1974) (stating that the \u201crequired by law\u201d precondition \u201cclearly embodies administrative rules and regulations as well as statutes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In another utility case, the Court held that an order of the Board of Public Utilities (BPU), which directed solid waste utilities to provide the BPU with customer lists, did not satisfy the RTKL\u2019s \u201crequired by law\u201d standard, meaning the lists were not subject to release under the RTKL. <em>In re Request for Solid Waste Util. Customer Lists, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>508, 525, 524 A.2d 386 (1987) <em>(\u201cIn re Request </em>\u201d). The Court stated: \u201cThe lists are not \u2018records which are required by law to be made, maintained[,] or kept on file by any board____\u2019 [T]he order was merely an administrative directive, and not the equivalent of either a statute or a Board regulation ... and therefore not subject to disclosure as public records.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In another case, the Court also held that the RTKL did not cover documents pertaining to a background character investigation, performed in response to the Governor\u2019s discretionary request. <em>Nero v. Hyland, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>213, 220-21, 386 A.2d 846 (1978). The records were not \u201crequired by law to be made, maintained or kept on file\u201d because \u201c[n]o statute, regulation, executive order or judicial decision require[d] that the Governor conduct a character investigation____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court rejected the trial court\u2019s \u201cen-grafting upon [the RTKL] the definition of a public record contained in the Destruction of Public Records Law [ (DPRL) ], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:3-16.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 386 A.2d 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The Court directly addressed a RTKL request for documents pertaining to a criminal investigation in <em>State v. Marshall, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>89, 690 A.2d 1, <em>cert, denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>850, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>140, 139 L.Ed.2d 88 (1997). In his effort to collaterally challenge his conviction, Marshall sought access to the entire investigative file in his ease. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 690 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The Court broadly and unqualifiedly held, \u201cThe Right-to-Know Law does not provide defendant with the right to inspect the law-enforcement files sought in this case because no law or regulation requires that such files \u2018be made, maintained or kept.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272-73, 690 A.2d 1 (citation omitted). The court cited with approval <em>River Edge Savings &amp; Loan Association v. Hyland, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 545, 398 A.2d 912 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>58, 404 A.2d 1157 (1979), for the proposition that \u201cno law required that results of law-enforcement official\u2019s investigation into alleged criminal offense be maintained or kept, and thus such results were not subject to Right-to-Know Law.\u201d <em>Marshall, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 273, 690 A.2d 1. The court also approvingly cited <em>Asbury Park Press, Inc. v. Borough of Seaside Heights, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 67, 586 A.2d 870 (Law Div.1990), for the principle that \u201cno law required that police reports be maintained or kept and thus reports were not subject to [the] Right-to-Know Law.\u201d <em>Marshall, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 273, 690 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We applied these principles in denying a newspaper\u2019s claim under the RTKL to access to a police department\u2019s investigational reports in <em>Daily Journal v. Police Department of Vineland, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>110, 120-21, 797 A.2d 186 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>364, 807 A.2d 195 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">We have found no case holding that criminal investigation reports are public records under the RTKL. Indeed, the courts have held to the contrary, on the basis that no law or regulation requires the making, maintaining or keeping on file the results of a criminal investigation by a law enforcement officer or agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">[Id at 120, 797 A.2d 186.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">We rejected the contention that the \u201crequired by law\u201d standard was satisfied by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-6, which we stated \u201cprovides how ... governmental material shall be kept in order to secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>material against fire and ordinary theft,\u201d or by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118, which \u201cprovides only for the creation of a police force and for the maintenance, regulation and control thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121, 797 A. 2d 186. Thus, the incidental or indirect creation or retention of documents is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Shuttleworth, </em>where, as here, the plaintiff sought records involving a fatal police shooting of a criminal suspect. <em>Shuttleworth, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 579-81, 610 A.2d 903. The shooting victim in that case, named Watson, was already in custody. <em>Id. </em>at 578, 610 A.2d 903. Specifically, the plaintiff sought \u201call reports relating to Watson\u2019s arrest and the related firearm discharges[,] ... tape recordings of the investigation, the police inventory of Watson\u2019s possessions, and copies of any rules or procedures of the Camden Police Department pertaining to firearms in the area of prisoner detentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 610 A.2d 903. We rejected the plaintiffs argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-6 or provisions of the municipal code required \u201cthat the investigative reports ... be made, maintained or kept on file.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We stated, \u201cRather, they provide how material which is in the possession of the government, whether by virtue of some legal requirement or otherwise, is to be maintained. Thus, they need not be \u2018maintained\u2019 by law within the meaning of the [RTKL].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">A broad reading of the \u201crequired by law\u201d exception to the \u201ccriminal investigatory record\u201d exception, as suggested by NJMG, also conflicts with the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed by the adoption of the provision, previously found in Governor Kean\u2019s and Governor Whitman\u2019s executive orders, mandating disclosure of specified information about a reported crime. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-3(b). Were access to investigative records as extensive as NJMG suggests, notwithstanding the \u201ccriminal investigatory records\u201d exception, then there would have been little need to mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>disclosure of information in section 3(b). We are unpersuaded by NJMG\u2019s argument that the principal purpose of adding section 3(b) was simply to assure the speedy release of the specified information.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We recognize that the RTKL authority reviewed above does not expressly address whether an internal agency directive satisfies the \u201crequired by law\u201d standard. Nor do the cases address the impact of judicial decisions requiring the creation or preservation of investigational materials. However, we are unprepared to endorse including them within the universe of documents \u201crequired by law to be made, maintained or kept on file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">First, the Court in <em>Marshall </em>spoke definitively and without reservation that the defendant\u2019s law enforcement file did not include \u201crequired by law\u201d documents. <em>See Marshall, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 273, 690 A.2d 1. We hesitate to find exceptions to the Court\u2019s definitive statement of law. <em>See White v. Twp. of N. Bergen, 11 N.J. </em>538, 549-50, 391 A.2d 911 (1978) (noting that trial and intermediate appellate courts are \u201cbound, under the principle of <em>stare decisis, </em>by formidable precedent\u201d). Moreover, we are unprepared to explore the applicability of any judicial mandates to create or preserve investigatory records, inasmuch as NJMG does not rely on any such requirement, and the issue has not been briefed by the parties.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Second, administrative directives of the Attorney General, similar to the BPU order in <em>In re Request, </em>are \u201cnot the equivalent of either a statute or a ... regulation.\u201d <em>See In re Request, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 525, 524 A.2d 386. Concededly, an administrative directive may be deemed, in one sense, to carry the full force and effect of law within the administrative structure. <em>See O\u2019Shea, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382, 982 A.2d 459 (stating that Attorney General\u2019s \u201cUse of Force Policy\u201d which requires police departments to complete and maintain UFRs \u201chas the force of law for police entities,\u201d based on the Attorney General\u2019s authority under the Criminal Justice Act of 1970, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-97 to -117 to adopt \u201cguidelines, directives and policies that bind local police departments\u201d). On the other hand, the same may be said of the BPU order in <em>In re Request </em>\u2014 it had the force of law as it concerned the regulated utilities. <em>In re Request, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 513, 524 A.2d 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The issuance of directives, such as the UFR directive, usually lies within the Attorney General\u2019s discretion and may be withdrawn or modified at will. They also are internal to the agency and related agencies. Attorney General directives address other aspects of the investigative process. <em>See, e.g., Delgado, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 61-62, 902 A.2d 888 (discussing Attorney General guidelines requiring preservation of materials pertaining to identification procedures). On the other hand, \u201c[a]gencies should act through rulemaking procedures when the action is intended to have a \u2018widespread, continuing, and prospective effect,\u2019 deals with policy issues, materially changes existing laws, or when the action will benefit from rulemaking\u2019s flexible fact-finding procedures.\u201d <em>In re Provision of Basic Generation Serv. for Period Beginning June 1, 2008, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>339, 349-50, 15 A.3d 829 (2011) (quoting <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 329-31, 478 A.2d 742 (1984)); <em>see also Woodland Private Study </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Grp. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>62, 69-76, 533 A.2d 387 (1987) (analyzing the difference between internal agency directives, which may be adopted informally, and directives that affect the general public and must be adopted through formal rule-making); <em>In re Request, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 518-19, 524 A.2d 386 (discussing administrative agency\u2019s informal action, as distinct from formal rulemaking or adjudication).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Treating internal agency directives on record creation or retention as \u201crequired by law\u201d would also create an anomaly under the law. OPRA retained the provision of the RTKL that authorizes agencies to exempt documents from disclosure by \u201cregulation promulgated under the authority of any statute or Executive Order of the Governor.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1; <em>see also Irval, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 374, 294 A.2d 425 (stating this exemption power was not intended to be \u201cunlimited\u201d and must \u201cbe exercised only when necessary for the protection of the public interest\u201d). Thus, an agency may, through formally promulgated regulations, both require the making of a document, and exempt it from access. By its plain language, the exemption power refers to promulgated regulations, and does not extend to informally adopted agency directives. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1. It would, therefore, be anomalous to treat documents required or preserved pursuant to internal directives as documents \u201crequired by law,\u201d since the directive\u2019s author would lack the accompanying power to control its accessibility, which is otherwise granted under OPRA.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We interpret next what constitutes a document that \u201cpertains\u201d to a criminal investigation. The issue is relevant both to (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the interpretation of \u201ccriminal investigatory record\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1 \u2014 which is defined as a document that \u201cpertains to any criminal investigation or related civil enforcement proceeding\u201d and is \u201cnot required by law to be made, maintained or kept on file\u201d; and (2) the interpretation of the ongoing investigation exception in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3(a) \u2014 which exempts from disclosure records that \u201cpertain to an investigation in progress by any public agency\u201d if release would be \u201cinimical to the public interest\u201d and the record was not already open for public inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The ongoing investigation exception, as noted above, was first established in the RTKL. OPRA added the \u201cexception-to-the-exception\u201d for documents already open to the public. <em>L. </em>2001, c. 404, \u00a7 5. Aside from minor wording changes, the RTKL exception remained unchanged in OPRA. However, we have found no pre-OPRA, RTKL case that expressly interprets the phrase \u201cpertain to an investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">OPRA cases have established that a document that is created before an investigation starts, and therefore does not \u201cpertain\u201d to an investigation at that point, does not change its character once an investigation begins, even if the document relates to the investigation. For example, a 9-1-1 tape created before an investigation begins does not pertain to an investigation commenced later, even if triggered by the 9-1-1 call. <em>Courier News, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 376, 380-81, 817 A.2d 1017. In <em>Serrano, </em>the court addressed the \u201cpertain to an investigation\u201d language used in the ongoing investigation exception. <em>Serrano, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 366, 817 A.2d 1004. \u201cThe tape that is the subject of this appeal was created hours before the police investigation began. If it was a public record when created, then it would remain accessible to the public under N.J.S.A 47:lA-3(a) even if its release would be inimical to the public interest.\u201d <em>Ibid.; cf. O\u2019Shea, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 385-86, 982 A.2d 459 (rejecting argument that a UFR generieally pertains to a criminal investigation, as \u201cit cannot be assumed that a UFR might become part of a criminal investigation\u201d). On the other hand, when an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>officer turns on a mobile video recorder to document a traffic stop or pursuit of a suspected criminal violation of law, that recording may pertain to a \u201ccriminal investigation,\u201d albeit in its earliest stages.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">However, there are other documents that police prepare, whether or not an investigation is commenced, which may partly pertain to an investigation that has already commenced. For example, daily activity logs or CAD reports are apparently prepared on a regular basis, regardless of whether an officer is performing a community caretaking function, such as assisting a boy who fell off a bicycle; or investigating a crime, such as interviewing a confidential informant regarding an ongoing investigation into gang activity. An entry about the former activity would not \u201cpertain to an investigation,\u201d but the latter would. Similarly, a UFR prepared after a police officer shoots a dangerous dog may not pertain to a criminal investigation. However, a UFR documenting the use of force in the course of arresting a criminal suspect would. We conclude that entries related to criminal investigative activities are properly deemed to \u201cpertain[ ] to any investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Applying these principles, we are persuaded that most of the documents sought by the reporters fall within the criminal investigatory records exception, because they are \u201cnot required by law to be made, maintained or kept on file\u201d and they \u201cpertain[ ] to any criminal investigation.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The reporters seek documents that report officers\u2019 daily activities, including CAD reports detailing information received by or from police dispatchers, log book notations, daily activity logs, daily bulletins, daily statistical sheets, tally sheets, and vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>logs. The requesters also seek various forms of audio and video recordings (as well as transcriptions), including recordings of the pursuit and shooting; communications among police officers and between police officers and others; and recordings made by mobile video recorders (MVRs). The reporters also requested various reports or officer work product, including UFRs, police reports, incident reports, operation reports, investigation reports, offense reports, and supplemental reports. All of these documents are exempt. No law cited to the court required their creation or retention. They pertain to a criminal investigation, to the extent the entries concern or address an officer\u2019s involvement in the search for the attempted burglary suspect, the pursuit of Ashford and Bynes once they were identified as suspects, the shooting of Ashford and arrest of Bynes, the subsequent investiga-tional activities related to Bynes\u2019s arrest, and the SRT investigation of the fatal shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">We reject NJMG\u2019s argument that these documents are \u201crequired by law\u201d because the various LEAs are governed by the DPRL and regulations, which require adoption of record retention schedules. <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:3-19, -20. No person may destroy public records under his or her control without obtaining consent under the DPRL or regulations thereunder. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:3-17. These provisions of law have been in place unchanged since 1953. <em>L. </em>1953, c. 410, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The Court in <em>Nero </em>expressly declined to read the DPRL <em>\u201cin pan materia </em>\u201d with the RTKL. <em>Nero, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 221, 386 A.2d 846. As discussed above, we have also repeatedly held that general, non-specific record preservation statutes or regulations do not satisfy the \u201crequired by law\u201d standard under the RTKL. <em>See Daily Journal, supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 120-21, 797 A.2d 186 (regarding <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-6, stating that a statute that \u201cprovides how ... governmental material shall be kept in order to secure the material against fire and ordinary theft\u201d does not satisfy the \u201crequired by law\u201d standard); <em>Shuttleworth, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 580, 610 A.2d 903 (stating that statute or code that merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cprovide[s] how material which is in the possession of the government, whether by virtue of some legal requirement or otherwise, is to be maintained\u201d does not satisfy the RTKL).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We reach the same conclusion with respect to general retention schedules adopted pursuant to the DPRL. Were we to reach the opposite conclusion, then the criminal investigatory records exception would have virtually no effect. Particularly in light of the legislative history, and the RTKL case-law shielding criminal investigatory records, we shall not presume that the exception is insignificant surplusage. <em>See In re Civil Commitment of J.M.B., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>563, 573, 964 A.2d 752 (\u201cInterpretations that render the Legislature\u2019s words mere surplusage are disfavored.\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>558 <em>U.S. </em>999, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>509, 175 L.Ed.2d 361 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Requested records that fall outside the criminal investigatory records exception include the recording of the 9-1-1 call, which are \u201crequired by law\u201d to be maintained for no less than thirty-one days according to promulgated regulations. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:24-2.4.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Also outside the exception are motor vehicle accident reports, which are required by law to be made available to the public. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-131. In addition, those portions of the CAD records and other logs of police activity, which do not discuss or relate to the criminal investigations, are excepted because they do not \u201cpertain[ ] to any criminal investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">As discussed above, even if documents are not exempt from OPRA as criminal investigatory records, they may be shielded from public access if they pertain to an investigation in progress and release would be \u201cinimical to the public interest.\u201d We have already reviewed the meaning of the \u201cpertain to\u201d lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>guage. The related issue presented on appeal is the trial court\u2019s rejection of the State\u2019s argument that release of the withheld documents would be \u201cinimical to the public interest.\u201d Although we conclude that most of the records requested were exempt under the criminal investigatory records exception, for the sake of completeness we address the trial court\u2019s consideration of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">A case-by-case analysis is appropriate. <em>Cf. Irval, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 375-76, 294 A.2d 425 (rejecting, under common law analysis, after review of disputed documents, defendant\u2019s claim that public interest in confidentiality outweighed plaintiffs interest in access in the case presented, but observing \u201cnevertheless the facts of another ease may quite possibly call for a different result\u201d). The <em>Irval </em>Court stated that, as a general rule, a trial judge should \u201ccall for and examine the report or other record\u201d to determine \u201c[i]f in his sound judgment some part or all of the information therein contained should not be revealed____\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In our own decision in <em>Irval, </em>we rejected the general argument that \u201cif inspection [by the public] of utility company accident reports were permitted the reports would be less than candid.\u201d <em>Irval Realty, Inc. v. Bd. of Pub. Util. Comm\u2019rs., </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>338, 345, 279 A.2d 866 (App.Div.1971), <em>affd, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>366, 294 A.2d 425 (1972). Moreover, we found no threat to the public interest in permitting review of the Board\u2019s own reports, once its investigation was completed. <em>Id. </em>at 345-46, 279 A.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In <em>Serrano, </em>we were unpersuaded that release of 9-1-1 recordings was \u201cinimical to the public interest\u201d assuming for argument\u2019s sake they were deemed to pertain to an ongoing investigation. <em>Serrano, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 367, 817 A.2d 1004. In particular, we rejected the argument that release of the 9-1-1 tape to a news organization, and its anticipated widespread dissemination, would interfere with the selection of a jury. <em>Ibid. </em>We surmised that the 9-1-1 caller had no presumed expectation of privacy; the public\u2019s interest in release was substantial; any difficulties in impaneling a jury would be manageable; and we noted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>attorney for the defendant agreed that release would not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>at 367-69, 817 A.2d 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In <em>Conner News, </em>we likewise rejected the argument that release of 9-1-1 recordings was \u201cinimical to the public interest,\u201d where the defendant asserted that public dissemination of the recording would risk tainting the jury pool, and anticipated playback at trial of an electronically enhanced version of the recording would cause juror confusion. <em>Courier News, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 381-83, 817 A.2d 1017. We found that the first concern did not present an insurmountable barrier to selecting a fair and unbiased jury, and the second concern was purely speculative. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">On the other hand, our courts have recognized \u201ca real need to deny access where there is an ongoing law enforcement investigation, or where the protection of witness information or a witness\u2019s identity is at stake.... \u201d <em>Shuttleworth, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585, 610 A.2d 903 (applying common law balancing). The Court in <em>Marshall </em>recognized the public interest in confidentiality of ongoing criminal investigations, albeit in the context of applying the common law right to inspect public documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">The receipt by appropriate law enforcement officials of information concerning the existence or occurrence of criminal activities is critical to the uncovering and the prosecution of criminal offenses, and is thus crucial to effective law enforcement. In order that the flow of such information be not impeded or cut off, the law has long treated the information as confidential and privileged against disclosure, thereby protecting witness security, the State\u2019s relationship with its informants and witnesses, and other confidential relationships, among other things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\"><em>[Marshall, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 273, 690 A.2d 1 (quoting <em>River Edge Sav. &amp; Loan, </em>Ass\u2019n, <em>supra, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 543-44, 398 A.2d 912).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\"><em>See also Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 107-08, 505 A.2d 958 (discussing \u201cthe vital public interest in ... the success of criminal prosecutions and the protection of potential witnesses and informants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">In reference to criminal investigations, the need for confidentiality generally declines once the investigation is closed; but the need for confidentiality, at least as to some materials \u2014 such as those pertaining to confidential informants \u2014 may survive. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>Keddie, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 54, 689 A.2d 702 (recognizing \u201cthe need for confidentiality is greater in pending matters than in closed cases,\u201d but stating \u201c[e]ven in closed cases ... attorney work-product and documents containing legal strategies may be entitled to protection from disclosure\u201d); <em>River Edge Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 545, 398 A.2d 912 (noting that \u201ceven inactive investigatory files may have to be kept confidential in order to convince citizens that they may safely confide in law enforcement officials\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>cf. Shuttleworth, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585, 610 A.2d 903 (stating that the \u201csame values do not survive a balancing after the investigation is closed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The trial court dismissed as exaggerated the State\u2019s fear that premature release of witness statements might taint other witnesses\u2019 independent recollections and undermine the integrity of the investigation into the police shooting. However, absent review of Lt. McGrath\u2019s proposed ex parte, in camera submission, we cannot be so sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">First, we are convinced that where an investigation is ongoing, the public reporting of one witness\u2019s recollections may risk causing another witness to question his or her own recollections, or intentionally or unintentionally conform them to the reported reality. Assessing the extent of the risk is a fact-sensitive inquiry. Notably, the United States Department of Justice recently documented that phenomenon in its report on the fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Justice Report Regarding the Criminal Investigation into the Shooting Death of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson </em>(March 4, 2015) 46, 58, <em>available at </em>http://www.justice.gov/sites/defaulVfiles/ opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_ shooting_of_miehael_brown.pdf (discussing witnesses\u2019 alteration of statements after watching media reports). In other contexts, the Court has recognized the fallibility of memory, and its susceptibility to suggestion and error. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>208, 268-71, 27 A.3d 872 (2011). We have also endorsed prophylactic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>measures to prevent witnesses, who may be in league with each other, from learning what others have said and tailoring their testimony accordingly. <em>See Morton Bldgs., Inc. v. Rezultz, Inc., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>227, 233, 603 A.2d 946 (1992) (addressing a trial court\u2019s discretion regarding witness sequestration).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Second, the trial court\u2019s rejection of the State\u2019s concern was premature, as the court did not review the documents at issue, nor permit the State to explain, ex parte, the reasons why release would compromise its ongoing investigation. An assessment of the public\u2019s interest will often require review of requested documents in camera. <em>See Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 108-09, 505 A.2d 958; <em>Keddie, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 53-54, 689 A.2d 702. In some cases, in camera review of a <em>Vaughn </em>index may be appropriate, because the release of even a \u201cdetailed <em>Vaughn </em>index\u201d to a requesting party \u201cmay in some cases enable astute parties to divine with great accuracy the names of confidential informers, sources, and the like____\u201d <em>Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 111, 505 A.2d 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Where appropriate, a court should also allow the governmental entity to submit an ex parte explanation as to why disclosure is inimical to the public interest. \u201cBecause of the <em>in camera </em>nature of the review, the custodian, if necessary or appropriate, can explain <em>ex parte </em>the significance of documents and the impact their disclosure might have and the trial judge can state his reasons for non-disclosure.\u201d <em>Shuttleworth, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 589, 610 A.2d 903 (applying common law right to inspect).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Applying these principles, we conclude it was error for the court to deny the State\u2019s motion to submit the proposed McGrath certification ex parte and in camera. As discussed above, there are few requested records in this ease that fall outside the \u201ccriminal investigatory record\u201d exception; any that did would still be subject to review under the \u201congoing investigation exception.\u201d Moreover, the foregoing discussion is relevant to the court\u2019s consideration of NJMG\u2019s claim of a common law right to inspect the documents, which we discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">With respect to section 3(b), the State contends: (1) NJMG is entitled only to the information delineated in the subsection, and not documents that contain such information; and (2) the State disclosed all the information required. We agree with the State as to the first point, but not as to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Had the Legislature intended section 3(b) to oblige a public agency to release records, as opposed to information, it would have said so. We are guided by the plain language of the statute. In interpreting a statute, \u201c[i]f the plain language is clear, the court\u2019s task is complete.\u201d <em>In re Kollman, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>557, 568, 46 A.3d 1247 (2012). We assign to words their generally accepted meaning. <em>In re Petition for Referendum on Trenton Ordinance 09-02, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>349, 358, 990 A.2d 1109 (2010). We must \u201cread every word in a statute as if it was deliberately chosen and presume that omitted words were excluded purposefully.\u201d <em>State v. Scott, </em>429 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 6-7, 55 A.3d 728 (App.Div.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>117, 67 A.3d 1191 (2013). In particular, we presume the Legislature acts intentionally when it uses \u201cparticular language in one section of the statute but omits it in another section of the same Act.\u201d <em>N.J. Dep\u2019t of Children &amp; Families v. A.L., </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>1, 21, 59 A.3d 576 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We conclude the word \u201cinformation,\u201d as used in the statute, is not synonymous with tangible records, such as written documents, notes, or recordings that contain the specified information. The required \u201cinformation\u201d may be conveyed in a newly drafted press release. Conceivably, the information could be provided in a public oral announcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The principal provision of OPRA generally authorizes access to \u201cgovernment <em>records,\u201d N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 (emphasis added), defined to include, among other things, tangible items such as \u201cany paper, written or printed book, document, drawing, map, plan, photograph, microfilm, data processed or image processed document.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. The drafters recognized that \u201cinformation\u201d is not limited to its tangible forms. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1 (stating that \u201c[g]overnment records\u201d include <em>\u201cinformation </em>stored or maintained electronically,\u201d exempting \u201cinformation received by\u201d a legislator, \u201cincluding but not limited to <em>information </em>in written form or contained in any e-mail or computer data base\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-2.2 (discussing government records containing personal \u201cinformation\u201d). Section 3(b) refers only to \u201cinformation\u201d and not specific tangible, records.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">As discussed above, section 3(b) was drawn from Governor Whitman\u2019s executive order. That order expressly authorized public officials to respond orally to requests for the specified information. \u201cThe law enforcement official responding to oral requests should make best efforts to respond orally over the tele-phone____\u201d Exec. Order No. 69 (Whitman), H3. Although this provision was not imported into OPRA, we reject NJMG\u2019s assertion this non-inclusion imbues \u201cinformation\u201d with a different meaning. Therefore, we conclude the State was permitted to comply with section 3(b) by providing the \u201cinformation\u201d in a press release.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">However, we agree with NJMG that the State failed to include all the information required by the law. In particular, the State omitted \u201cinformation as to the identity of the investigating and arresting personnel and agency and the length of the investigation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3(b). The press release also did not include information on the \u201cuse of weapons and ammunition by ... the police.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The OAG did not \u201cissue a brief statement\u201d explaining the omissions. Nor did the State argue that its omissions were warranted because release of the information would \u201cjeopardize the safety of any person or jeopardize any investigation in progress or may be otherwise inappropriate to release.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The State shall promptly release the omitted information, or, upon remand, make a sufficient showing under section 3(b) to the trial court why it should be excused from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Lastly, we consider the State\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s order compelling release of the documents pursuant to the common law right of access. The State concedes the requested records are public records, subject to the common law right to inspect. <em>See Nero, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 386 A.2d 846 (stating \u201c[t]he elements essential to constitute a public record are ... that it be a written memorial, that it be made by a public officer, and that the officer be authorized by law to make it\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The State also concedes that NJMG has the requisite standing to request inspection. <em>See, e.g., S. Jersey Publ\u2019g Co. v. N.J. Expressway Auth., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>478, 487, 591 A.2d 921 (1991) (\u201c[A] newspaper\u2019s interest in keep[ing] a watchful eye on the workings of public agencies is sufficient to accord standing under the common law.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>Irval, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 372, 294 A.2d 425 (stating that some showing of interest is required to enforce the common law right to inspect). The State challenges the court\u2019s balancing of NJMG\u2019s interest in the documents against the LEAs\u2019 interest in confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The principles governing the common-law balancing are well-settled. We discussed some of them in our discussion above of the balancing under the \u201cinimical to the public interest\u201d standard under the RTKL and OPRA. The balancing of the competing interests in disclosure and confidentiality often involves an \u201cexquisite weighing process by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 108, 505 A.2d 958 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The <em>Loigman </em>Court recognized the \u201cvital public interest in ... the success of criminal prosecutions and the protection of potential witnesses and informants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 505 A.2d 958. Toward that end, pursuant to executive order, NJSP investigative files may not be disclosed without court order or executive order. <em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 505 A.2d 958 (citing Exec. Order No. 48 (Hughes)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Since there is a high degree of need for confidentiality in such materials, more than a showing of good faith and citizen status will be required to overcome the public interest in confidentiality. It does not constitute a clear showing of such public need to say only that there may be something corrupt that should be exposed for the benefit of the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">[Id at 108, 505 A.2d 958.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\"><em>Loigman </em>specifically addressed a request under the common law to inspect documents related to an OAG audit of a prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s confidential account. <em>Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 101, 505 A.2d 958. The Court identified several factors the trial court should consider in balancing the requester\u2019s needs against the public agency\u2019s interest in confidentiality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">(1) the extent to which disclosure will impede agency functions by discouraging citizens from providing information to the government; (2) the effect disclosure may have upon persons who have given such information, and whether they did so in reliance that their identities would not be disclosed; (3) the extent to which agency self-evaluation, program improvement, or other decisionmaking will be chilled by disclosure; (4) the degree to which the information sought includes factual data as opposed to evaluative reports of policymakers; (5) whether any findings of public misconduct have been insufficiently corrected by remedial measures instituted by the investigative agency; and (6) whether any agency disciplinary or investigatory proceedings have arisen that may circumscribe the individual\u2019s asserted need for the materials. Against these and any other relevant factors should be balanced the importance of the information sought to the plaintiffs vindication of the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 113, 505 A.2d 958 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The motivation of the requester is a relevant consideration in the balancing process under the common law. \u201cSomewhat different but related considerations arise when the citizen seeks access to information to further a public good\u201d as opposed to a private interest. <em>Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 104, 505 A.2d 958. In connection with requests for a criminal investigatory file, the Court held in <em>Marshall </em>that \u201cthe common-law right to inspect public documents may not be invoked in a pending criminal case by a defendant seeking discovery rights beyond those granted by <em>Rule </em>3:13-2 to -4.\u201d <em>Marshall, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 274, 690 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">As we noted, the need for confidentiality in investigative materials may wane after the investigation is concluded. With respect to grand jury proceedings, for example, \u201cour case law has with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>increasing frequency expanded the right of victims and some other persons with particular interest to gain access [to grand jury transcripts] after completion of the criminal case.\u201d <em>Shuttleworth, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585, n. 6, 610 A.2d 903; <em>see also State v. Doliner, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>236, 246, 475 A.2d 552 (1984) (stating that \u201ca strong showing of a particularized need\u201d must be made to secure access to grand jury materials).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">We applied the <em>Loigman </em>principles in <em>Shuttleworth </em>which, as noted above, involved the request for documents pertaining to a Camden Police investigation into the fatal police shooting of a suspect in custody. <em>Shuttleworth, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 578, 610 A.2d 903. The investigation in <em>Shuttleworth </em>was closed, and a determination had already been made not to prosecute the involved officer or officers. <em>Ibid. </em>We affirmed the trial court\u2019s release of an autopsy report \u201cprecisely because the investigation was closed without the filing of charges.\u201d <em>Shuttleworth, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 595, 610 A.2d 903. On the record presented, we were unable to determine which other documents the trial court actually ordered disclosed pursuant to the common law right to inspect. We remanded for an in camera review of documents listed on a <em>Vaughn </em>index. <em>Id. </em>at 589-91, 610 A.2d 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">By contrast, in <em>Daily Journal, </em>we affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of access to records of a grand jury presentment regarding alleged government corruption. <em>Daily Journal, supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 127-31, 797 A.2d 186. Although the investigation was also closed, the trial court found that the interests in confidentiality were warranted, particularly in light of the unique nature of the presentment process. <em>Id. </em>at 128-30, 797 A.2d 186. Other circumstances may establish an overriding need for confidentiality, despite the closing of an investigation. <em>See Keddie, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 54, 689 A.2d 702; <em>River Edge Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 545, 398 A.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">As a procedural matter, a court must make a threshold determination whether an in camera review of documents is warranted. <em>Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 109, 505 A.2d 958. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>review itself may cause unjustified risks to the public\u2019s interest in conducting effective criminal investigations. <em>Ibid. </em>The court may first require the submission of a <em>Vaughn </em>index, to identify the documents at issue, and the asserted rationale for nondisclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 109-10, 505 A.2d 958. The court may, if appropriate, require the submission of the index in camera, as well as a further explanation of the reasons for non-disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 505 A.2d 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Applying these principles, the trial court\u2019s order granting access to the requested materials is flawed because it is based on an incomplete record. We recognize the intense public interest in a case involving the possible use of excessive force by police. The issue has arisen in cases across the country. The public\u2019s need to know is not limited to the public\u2019s interest in knowing what happened in a particular ease. Information may assist the public in evaluating the adequacy of police procedures in general, and the claim that police force is used disproportionately against members of minority groups. Access to records related to fatal police shootings may also be relevant to public policy debates about proposed reforms.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In this case, the discrepancy between the OAG\u2019s press release and the investigating detective\u2019s subsequent certification raises obvious questions about what happened immediately prior to the shooting. As noted, it was asserted in the press release that Ashford rammed a police vehicle before being shot. The detective\u2019s certification stated only that Ashford\u2019s engine revved \u201cas if\u2019 to force his way out from the spot where the car was lodged against the guardrail. The discrepancy between these two documents also raises questions about the reliability or accuracy of the information upon which the press release was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The requesters\u2019 and the public\u2019s interest in access must be balanced against the substantial interests in conducting a thorough and effective investigation, untainted by premature release of investigative materials. In order to engage in a proper balancing of interests, the trial court should have considered the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>posed in camera and ex parte submission by Lt. McGrath. <em>See Shuttleworth, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 589, 610 A.2d 903. If the court were still unpersuaded that non-disclosure was warranted, the court should have ordered the State to prepare a <em>Vaughn </em>index, for submission in camera if appropriate. <em>See Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 108-12, 505 A.2d 958. The court should have reviewed the documents themselves in camera, applying the <em>Loigman </em>factors, and retaining the ability to release a document in a redacted form.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The government\u2019s interest in confidentiality may decline once investigative activity ceases. The investigation was ongoing according to certifications submitted to the trial court in December. Over eight months have elapsed since the SRT began its investigation. It is unclear that the investigation is still ongoing and, if it is, the nature of those continuing activities. The trial court should ascertain, based upon in camera submissions if appropriate, the current status of the investigation, as part of its balancing of competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Conceivably, one part of the investigation may be closed, while another part is still active. For example, the gathering of evidence of alleged criminal activity by Ashford and Bynes may have ceased, in view of their deaths. In other respects, records regarding the actions of Ashford and Bynes, and statements of Bynes, may still be relevant to the SRT\u2019s work. Such facts may be relevant in justifying the release of some documents, but not others.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">In sum, we remand to the trial court to reconsider plaintiffs requests in light of the principles set forth in this opinion. We have identified those records that are exempt from OPRA pursuant to the criminal investigatory records exception. N.J.S.A 47:1A:1.1. With respect to the requests for any records that fall outside that exception, the court shall consider whether their release would be inimical to the public interest under <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>47:lA-3(a). In so doing, the court shall review, in camera, McGrath\u2019s proposed ex parte certification. However, the State shall promptly comply with its disclosure obligation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3(b), or make a sufficient showing to the trial court why it should be excused from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The trial court shall also reconsider its determination that plaintiffs are entitled to access under the common law. In so doing, the court shall consider McGrath\u2019s proposed certification. The court shall also determine whether a <em>Vaughn </em>index should be prepared and, if so, whether it should be submitted in camera. In light of those submissions, the court shall determine whether to review the withheld documents in camera, and whether release of the requested records is warranted, in whole or in part, with or without redaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for reconsideration.
