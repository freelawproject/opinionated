(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">These related interlocutory appeals raise questions concerning the admissibility of custodial statements given by co-defendants to law enforcement. Defendant Charles Puryear (Puryear) and defendant Markus Brown (Brown) were charged with crimes related to a fatal shooting that took place on November 26, 2011, in Newark, and an armed robbery that took place several days later in a motel in Sussex County. Each defendant gave two custodial statements to law enforcement on December 5, 2011. After a hearing, the trial court in Essex County ultimately suppressed the first statement given by Puryear, which concerned the robbery in Sussex County, and admitted Puryear\u2019s second statement, which concerned the Essex County shooting. The trial court admitted Brown\u2019s first statement, which concerned the Sussex County robbery, and ultimately suppressed his second statement, which concerned the shooting in Essex County.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">On these interlocutory appeals, Puryear argues that his second statement also should have been suppressed, and the State argues that the trial court erred in suppressing Puryear\u2019s first statement and Brown\u2019s second statement. Given the related facts and procedural history, we issue this consolidated opinion addressing all of the interlocutory appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">Having conducted a thorough review of the record in each ease, and having considered all of the arguments, we affirm the well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>reasoned decision by Judge Michael L. Ravin, and his companion order, issued on December 17, 2014, which suppressed one of the statements given by each defendant, but admitted the other statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The State alleges that on November 25, 2011, at approximately 10:00 p.m., Puryear and Brown approached a group of people on a street in Newark, New Jersey. Puryear pointed a .22 caliber handgun at the group, and shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d The group of people attempted to run away, and Puryear fired nine shots, hitting and killing one person. Later, nine .22 caliber shell casings were recovered at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Concerning the Sussex County incident, the State alleges that on December 4, 2011, Puryear and Brown committed an armed robbery at the Rolling Hills Motel in Sussex County. A gunshot was fired during that robbery, and the State Police were notified. When State troopers arrived, they encountered Brown, who fled. Following a search, Puryear and Brown were eventually apprehended in the early morning hours of December 5, 2011, near the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">When defendants were apprehended, they were both arrested and advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, defendants were taken to the State Police barracks. While at the State Police barracks, each defendant was separately interviewed twice by law enforcement officers. Puryear was first interviewed by a State Police detective and a State trooper. That interview began shortly after 5:00 a.m. on December 5, 2011, and primarily focused on the alleged robbery at the motel in Sussex County. A number of hours later, beginning at approximately 5:44 p.m. on December 5, 2011, Puryear was interviewed by two Essex County detectives. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>That interview primarily focused on the alleged shooting in Newark.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Brown was first interviewed on December 5, 2011, beginning at approximately 7:00 a.m., by the same State Police detective and State trooper who had interviewed Puryear. Several hours later, beginning at approximately 8:59 p.m. on December 5, 2011, Brown was interviewed by the same two Essex County detectives who would later interview Puryear.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">At the beginning of all four interviews, the officers advised each defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and each defendant signed <em>Miranda </em>waiver forms. The interviews were audio and video recorded. During each interview, Puryear and Brown made a number of incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Puryear and Brown were both indicted and charged with a number of crimes in Essex and Sussex Counties. In Essex County, they were charged under three different indictments. The charges against Puryear in Essex County included first-degree murder, first-degree robbery, and weapons-related offenses. The charges against Brown in Essex County included first-degree felony murder, first-degree robbery, and weapons-related offenses. The charges in Sussex County against both defendants included first-degree robbery, second-degree burglary, aggravated assault, and weapons-related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In Essex County, defendants moved to suppress their statements, and the State moved to admit all four statements. The State also moved to use portions of those statements that did not directly relate to the charges in Essex County under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The trial court conducted a three-day hearing. During that hearing, all four law enforcement officers who participated in the four interviews of defendants testified. The State also introduced and played at the hearing the audio and video recordings of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>of the four statements. Transcripts of those statements were also provided to the trial court. The State also introduced into evidence copies of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver forms signed by each defendant. Defendants elected not to testify at the hearing and did not call any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The trial court twice addressed the motions to suppress and admit the statements. Initially, the trial court issued a written opinion and order, dated September 8, 2014, and ruled that all four statements were admissible. The court reserved on the <em>Rule </em>404(b) portion of the motion, which concerned whether the portions of the statements that did not directly relate to the Essex County charges could be used as evidence of motive or intent. The court stated that it would address at trial limitations and possible redactions under <em>Rule </em>404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Defendants then moved for reconsideration. On December 17, 2014, the court granted partial reconsideration and issued a written decision and order. The trial court found that each of the defendants\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>rights had been violated in connection with one of the statements given by each defendant. The court also found that the other statement given by each defendant was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">With regard to Puryear, the trial court ruled that his first statement was inadmissible. The trial court focused on a statement made by a State Police detective when Puryear first came into the interview room. Specifically, the detective told Puryear that he could not hurt himself by giving the statement, but he could only help himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">DET. PAULIS: The only thing you can possibly do here is help yourself out. You cannot get yourself in any more trouble than you\u2019re already in. You can only help yourself out here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">So you\u2019ve been helping yourself out with Trooper Donnelly. I just want to hear what you have to say as far as the explanation as to what happened tonight, all right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>After making that statement, the detective then read Puryear his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and Puryear agreed to speak with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The trial court reasoned that the statement by the detective was incorrect and misleading. The court went on to reason that the statement by the detective \u201cneutraliz[ed]\u201d the <em>Miranda </em>warning that Puryear was given immediately after the detective\u2019s statement. The court then found that because of the detective\u2019s incorrect statement, the State had failed to show that Puryear made a knowing waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Turning to Puryear\u2019s second statement, given to Essex County detectives, the trial court ruled that statement was admissible. The court found that Puryear was correctly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that Puryear knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The trial court also considered, but rejected, a number of other arguments put forth by Puryear. In that regard, the trial court found that when Puryear asked to speak to the mother of his child, he was not invoking his right to silence or counsel. The court also rejected Puryear\u2019s contention that his failure to respond immediately when the detective asked if Puryear wished to speak was not an invocation of his right to silence. In that regard, Puryear was twice asked if he wished to speak and he delayed responding for approximately four seconds and seven seconds. When Puryear did not immediately respond, the detective reminded Puryear that he had the right not to speak. Thereafter, Puryear stated that he wished to speak to the officers. The court also found that Puryear had not been effectively ordered to sign the <em>Miranda </em>form. Finally, the court found that Puryear had been properly informed that there was a warrant out for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Concerning the statements given by Brown, the trial court ruled that Brown\u2019s first statement was admissible, but his second statement was not admissible. The first statement, which was given to a State Police detective and trooper, concerned the Sussex County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>robbery. The court found that the officers properly advised Brown of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that Brown knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived those rights and agreed to speak with the officers. The court noted, however, that it was reserving \u201con whether this statement, which concerns that Sussex County robbery, is admissible [in the Essex County matters] under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">As to Brown\u2019s second statement, the trial court found that Brown had not knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Specifically, the court focused on an explanation provided by an Essex County detective when Brown asked for clarification of what it meant that his statements could be used against him in a court of law. In response, the detective told Brown that it meant that if Brown lied, his statement could be used against him. In that regard, the second recorded interview of Brown had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">DET. MCENROE: Okay. \u201cAnything you say can be used against you in a court of law.\u201d You understand number \u2014 number (2)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">MR. BROWN: \u201cAnything you say can be used against you in a court of law.\u201d So that means I may have to stand up in their court and say this again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">DET. GONZALEZ: Well, what that\u2019s saying is anything you say can be used against you,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">MR. BROWN: (Indiscernible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">DET. GONZALEZ: \u2014 meaning if you lie, it can be used against you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">MR. BROWN: (Indiscernible.) Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">The court reasoned that the detective\u2019s explanation was an incorrect and misleading explanation of one of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The court then found that the State had not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that Brown understood all of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and he had not knowingly waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">We granted the State leave to appeal the suppression of Brown\u2019s second statement. We also granted Puryear and the State leave to appeal the rulings concerning Puryear\u2019s statements. On appeal, Puryear makes two arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>POINT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">BECAUSE THE AUTHORITIES NEVER WITHDREW OR CORRECTED THE ADVICE GIVEN TO DEFENDANT THAT \u201cYOU CAN ONLY HELP YOURSELF OUT\u201d BY GIVING A STATEMENT, HIS SECOND STATEMENT, MADE ONLY HOURS LATER, ALSO HAD TO BE SUPPRESSED AS NOT KNOWING OR INTELLIGENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">POINT II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">THE STATE FAILED TO SCRUPULOUSLY HONOR DEFENDANT\u2019S CLEAR INDICATION THAT HE DID NOT WISH TO MAKE A STATEMENT UNTIL AFTER HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIS BABY\u2019S MOTHER, THUS VIOLATING HIS RIGHTS UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AND OUR STATE CONSTITUTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The State argues that the trial court was correct in initially ruling that both statements by Puryear were admissible and it erroneously granted Puryear\u2019s motion for reconsideration. With regard to Brown, the State argues that the trial court erred in suppressing Brown\u2019s second statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees all persons with the privilege against self-incrimination. This privilege applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, in New Jersey, there is a common law privilege against self-incrimination, which has been codified in statutes and rules of evidence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-19; <em>N.J.R.E. </em>503; <em>State v. Reed, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>237, 250, 627 A.2d 630 (1993). Accordingly, it has long been established that when a person is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his or her freedom that person is entitled to certain warnings before he or she can be questioned. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 478-79, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1630, 16 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Before any questioning, the defendant must be advised that she or he has the right to remain silent, that anything she or he says can be used against her or him in a court of law, that she or he has the right to have an attorney present during questioning, and that if she or he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for her or him before any questioning if she or he so desires. <em>Id. </em>at 479, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726. These warnings are commonly referred to as <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">After receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, a suspect may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement. <em>Ibid. </em>The State, however, must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights was intelligent, voluntary and knowing. <em>State v. Nyhammer, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>383, 400-01, 963 A.2d 316, <em>cert, denied, </em>558 <em>U.S. </em>831, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>65,175 L.Ed.2d 48 (2009); <em>State v. Presha, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>304, 313, 748 A.2d 1108 (2000); <em>State v. Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 654, 628 A.2d 735 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In determining whether a statement is voluntary, courts consider the totality of the circumstances, including the characteristics of the accused and the details of the questions. <em>State v. Knight, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>449, 462, 874 A.2d 546 (2005) (citing <em>Galloway, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 654, 628 A.2d 735). \u201cRelevant factors include the defendant\u2019s age, education, intelligence, advice concerning his [or her] constitutional rights, [the] length of detention, and the nature of the questioning.\u201d <em>State v. Bey, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>123, 135, 548 A.2d 887 (1988) (citing <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamante, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>218, 226, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2041, 2047, 36 L.Ed.2d 854, 862 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">If a suspect invokes his or her right to silence or legal counsel, law enforcement must \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d that assertion, and all questioning must cease. <em>See Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>96, 103-04, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>321, 326, 46 L.Ed.2d 313, 321 (1975); <em>see also Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 <em>U.S. 477, </em>484-85, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, 386 (1981) (applying the same standard); <em>State v. Alston, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>614, 624, 10 A.3d 880 (2011) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress statements, appellate courts generally defer to the fact-findings of the trial court when they are supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>See Nyhammer, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 409, 963 A.2d 316 (citing <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 243-44, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007)); <em>see also State v. W.B., </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>588, 603 n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>4, 17 A.3d 187 (2011) (\u201cAs the finding of compliance with <em>Miranda </em>and voluntariness turned on factual and credibility determinations, we need only find sufficient credible evidence in the record to sustain the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.\u201d (citing <em>Elders, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 242-44, 927 A.2d 1250)). Moreover, we defer to a trial court judge\u2019s findings \u201c \u201cwhich are substantially influenced by [the judge\u2019s] opportunity to hear and see the witnesses and to have the feel of the case, which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Davila, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>97, 109-10, 999 A.2d 1116 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 161, 199 A.2d 809 (1964) (internal quotation marks omitted)). When a defendant\u2019s statement is videotaped, however, and \u201cthe trial court\u2019s factual findings are based only on its viewing of a recorded interrogation that is equally available to the appellate court ... deference to the trial court\u2019s interpretation is not required.\u201d <em>State v. Diaz-Bridges, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>544, 566, 34 A.3d 748 (2012). We review de novo the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions that flow from established facts. <em>See State v. Mann, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>328, 337, 2 A.3d 379 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We first address the trial court\u2019s decision to grant reconsideration. The State argues that the trial court erred in changing its decision on a motion for reconsideration. We reject that argument. The court has the discretion and right to reconsider an interlocutory ruling at any time before the entry of final judgment in \u201c \u2018the sound discretion of the [ ] court to be exercised in the interests of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>See State v. Timmendequas, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>515, 554, 737 A.2d 55 (1999) (quoting Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 3 on <em>R. </em>1:7-4 (1995), and noting that there is not an explicit rule for motions for reconsideration in criminal matters, but holding that such motions are permitted in criminal matters), <em>cert, denied, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>858, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>136, 151 L.Ed.2d 89 (2001). <em>See also State v. Campbell, </em>436 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 273, 93 A.3d 416 (App.Div.2014) (explaining that \u201cthe court can even reconsider its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>previous decision to admit the evidence, if subsequent developments support such reconsideration\u201d (citing <em>Cummings v. Bohr, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 384-88, 685 A.2d 60 (App.Div.1996))).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Reconsideration is not to be granted lightly and the grounds for reconsideration are generally limited. The proper object of reconsideration is to correct a court\u2019s error or oversight. <em>Palombi v. Palombi, </em>414 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 288, 997 A.2d 1139 (App.Div.2010). As we have explained, a motion for reconsideration is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">not appropriate merely because a litigant is dissatisfied with a decision of the court or wishes to reargue a motion, but \u201cshould be utilized only for those cases which fall into that narrow corridor in which either 1) the [c]ourt has expressed its decision based upon a palpably incorrect or irrational basis, or 2) it is obvious that the [c]ourt either did not consider, or failed to appreciate the significance of probative, competent evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>D'Atria v. D'Atria, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 401, 576 A.2d 957 (Ch.Div. 1990)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\"><em>See also R. </em>l:7-4(b) (governing reconsideration of final orders or judgments); <em>Cummings, supra, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 384, 685 A.2d 60 (explaining the grounds appropriate for reconsidering a final judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Here, the trial court candidly found that it had failed to appreciate the significance of the explanation given by the detective to Brown during his second interview concerning his second <em>Miranda </em>warning; that second warning being that his statements could be used against him in a court of law. The trial court also found that it failed to appreciate the significance of the introductory statement made by the State Police detective to Puryear in his first interview advising Puryear that he could not hurt himself by answering the detective\u2019s questions. Given the facts of these interviews, we find no abuse of discretion and no error by the trial court in its decision to grant reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">Indeed, it is entirely appropriate for a judge to reconsider a prior ruling given the right set of circumstances. Judges are not infallible. Judges who are willing to admit that they overlooked competent evidence, or failed to appreciate such evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>should be commended because they are doing just what good judges do in the very limited circumstances where reconsideration is appropriate. Obviously, that is why there are rules for reconsideration. <em>See R. </em>l:7-4(b); <em>R. </em>4:42-2; <em>R. </em>4:49-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We also will address the court\u2019s ultimate substantive decisions concerning the suppression or admission of each of the statements given by defendants. Our grant of interlocutory appeal included appeals from all aspects of the order on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">We turn to the rulings on Brown\u2019s second statement. As already noted, the trial court admitted Brown\u2019s first statement, which principally concerned the Sussex County robbery. Brown has pled guilty to the charges in Sussex County, and he has not appealed the decision to admit his first statement. As previously pointed out, when the ease is tried in Essex County the trial judge will address whether and how much of the first statement can be used under <em>Rule </em>404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The State appeals the decision to suppress Brown\u2019s second statement, which was given to Essex County detectives and which concerned the murder in Essex County. Specifically, the State argues that when Brown\u2019s second interview is reviewed in full context, Brown\u2019s inquiry about his second <em>Miranda </em>right\u2014 that his statements could be used in court \u2014 was really a concern that Brown did not want to testify in court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, the State argues Brown understood and knowingly waived all his <em>Miranda </em>rights, including <em>Miranda </em>Right No. 2, but he made it clear that he did not intend to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">The State also argues that Brown had a prior criminal record and, therefore, he already understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>of his prior interactions with the criminal justice system. <em>See Knight, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 463, 874 A.2d 546 (explaining that it is relevant to consider a defendant\u2019s \u201cprevious encounters with law enforcement\u201d in determining the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights). In addition, the State argues that the trial court erred in relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Pillar, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 268, 820 A.2d 1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>572, 832 A.2d 322 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In <em>Pillar, </em>the defendant\u2019s conviction was reversed \u201cdue to the improper admission of a highly incriminating statement made by [the] defendant to police at the time of his arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257, 820 A.2d 1. The defendant in <em>Pillar </em>was charged with sexually abusing a child. When questioned by law enforcement, the defendant invoked his right to have an attorney before providing a statement. <em>Id. </em>at 262, 820 A.2d 1. The defendant then stated that he wanted to \u201csay something \u2018off-the-record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>After the detectives who were interviewing the defendant in <em>Pillar </em>agreed to listen, the defendant confessed to fondling the minor victim. This court held \u201cthat the statement, made immediately following administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and after an assurance from an officer that [the] defendant could make a statement \u2018off-the-record,\u2019 was not only obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>but was involuntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257, 820 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The trial court correctly found that the detective\u2019s explanation of the <em>Miranda </em>Right No. 2 was incorrect. While the trial court acknowledged that Brown\u2019s request for clarification may have stemmed from a concern about testifying at trial, the court found that did not change that Brown was given an incorrect explanation of his <em>Miranda </em>Right No. 2. It is the \u201cresponsibility of law-enforcement authorities to inform defendants of their rights [ ] with the proper administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>State v. Adams, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>438, 448, 605 A.2d 1097 (1992) (citing <em>State v. McKnight, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>35, 47, 243 A.2d 240 (1968)). \u201cA police officer cannot directly contradict, out of one side of his mouth, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings just given out of the other.\u201d <em>Pillar, supra, </em>359 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>at 268, 820 A.2d 1. <em>See also United States v. Ramirez, </em>991 F.Supp.2d 1258, 1269-70 (S.D.Fla.2014) (telling a defendant if he or she did not answer questions \u201cit would be worse\u201d contradicted the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The trial court also correctly found that the detective\u2019s incorrect explanation of Brown\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights was not cured by Brown\u2019s prior contact with the criminal justice system. Here, the State showed only that Brown had been arrested in 2005 and pled guilty in 2008, but did not offer proof that such prior experience enabled him to understand his <em>Miranda </em>rights despite the detective\u2019s incorrect explanation of his <em>Miranda </em>Right No. 2. Absent a more specific showing by the State, the trial court did not err in making such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The focus of a <em>Miranda </em>analysis should be on whether the defendant had a clear understanding and comprehension of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Nyhammer, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 963 A.2d 316. Moreover, as already pointed out, the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s waiver is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The trial court here found that the State had not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that Brown understood the nature of his <em>Miranda </em>Right No. 2 and the consequences of waiving that right. We defer to such \u201cfactual findings made by the trial court[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 963 A.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Given the totality of the circumstances in this case, the trial court\u2019s findings that the State failed to prove that Brown completely understood all of his <em>Miranda </em>rights are adequately supported by credible evidence in the record. Moreover, our independent review of the video of Brown\u2019s second interview does not lead us to a different conclusion. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s decision to suppress Brown\u2019s second statement is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">We now review the rulings on Puryear\u2019s statements. The State argues that we should reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling on reconsid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>eration, which held that Puryear\u2019s first statement concerning the Sussex County robbery was inadmissible. Puryear argues that the trial court correctly suppressed his first statement, but erred in not suppressing his second statement concerning the Essex County murder. We find neither of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On appeal, the State argues that \u201cthere is no credible evidence that [Puryear] did not understand his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d The trial court, however, ultimately found otherwise. The court focused on the instruction given by the State Police detective that Puryear could not hurt himself and could only help himself by providing a statement. The court found that instruction was incorrect and directly contradicted the <em>Miranda </em>warning that anything the suspect says can be used against him in a court of law. The court then found that the detective\u2019s incorrect explanation of the consequences of giving a statement was not cured by Puryear\u2019s prior contact with the criminal justice system. Thus, the court found that the State had not carried its burden of proving that Puryear knowingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The factual findings by the trial court are supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. The State contends that \u201cwhile awkwardly phrased,\u201d the detective\u2019s instruction simply informed defendant that the evidence against him was overwhelming. That characterization of the instruction does not change the fact that the instruction contradicted a key <em>Miranda </em>warning. Moreover, the instruction by the detective was not a permissible interrogation technique. <em>See Pillar, supra, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 268, 820 A.2d 1; <em>cf. State v. Patton, </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>16, 31, 46, 826 A.2d 783 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>35, 834 A.2d 408 (2003) (explaining that New Jersey courts allow some \u201ctrickery\u201d in interrogation techniques, but do not allow fabrications of evidence). That the State seeks to admit Puryear\u2019s statement against him shows that Puryear could hurt himself by giving the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The State also points out that in its initial decision admitting Puryear\u2019s first statement, the trial court relied upon <em>State v. Miller, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>392, 388 A.2d 218 (1978), but on reconsideration it did not explain how <em>Miller </em>was distinguishable. In <em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court held that it was not a violation of <em>Miranda </em>for a police officer to \u201c[a]ppeal[] to a person\u2019s sense of decency and urg[e] him to tell the truth for his own sake.\u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 405, 388 A.2d 218. The Court went on to recognize, however, that depending on the context, such techniques can move into a \u201cshadowy area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403-04, 388 A.2d 218. Consequently, <em>Miller </em>is distinguishable on the specific facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Indeed, the Supreme Court has clarified the fact-sensitive basis of motions to suppress because in another case, the Court upheld the suppression of a statement because the defendant was advised that by answering questions she \u201cwould actually benefit\u201d herself. <em>State ex rel. A.S., </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>131,151, 999 A.2d 1136 (2010). In AS., the Court held that advice \u201ccontradicted the <em>Miranda </em>warning provided to [the defendant]: that anything she said in the interview could be used against her in a court of law.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Pillar, supra, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 268, 820 A.2d 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In short, it is well-established that the question of whether <em>Miranda </em>rights are knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived is a fact-specific analysis. Based on the specific facts found by the trial court, we find no error in the court\u2019s decision to suppress Puryear\u2019s first statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">We also find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Puryear\u2019s second statement. The second statement was given several hours after the first statement and primarily focused on a different crime. Importantly, the second statement was given to different law enforcement officers, who gave Puryear fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings and had Puryear execute a separate written <em>Miranda </em>waiver form. Thus, the trial court found that that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>second statement was given after Puryear knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Puryear argues that the second statement was contaminated by the incorrect instruction given during the first statement. Pur-year goes on to assert that his situation is analogous to an impermissible \u201cquestion first and warn later\u201d technique. <em>See Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>600, 611-12, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2601, 2610, 159 L.Ed.2d 643, 655 (2004). In <em>Seibert, </em>the police interrogators adopted an official policy of inducing confessions prior to providing <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then eliciting the same confession to the same crime. The United States Supreme Court stated that such a procedure \u201crender[ed] <em>Miranda </em>warnings ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2610, 159 L.Ed.2d at 654. The facts in <em>Seibert </em>are clearly distinguishable. Moreover, the trial court here found that there was a clear break between the two separate interviews and that fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings cured any problem with the instruction given at the beginning of the first interview. Again, those fact-findings are supported by substantial credible evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Puryear also argues that because he repeatedly asked to speak with the mother of his child, he was effectively expressing a desire to remain silent. Puryear, however, told the detectives that he wanted to tell the mother of his child that she should move on without him. The trial court reviewed the video of the interview and found that the request by Puryear to speak with the mother of his child was not an invocation of his right to remain silent. Our independent review of the recorded interview supports that same finding. In short, Puryear\u2019s request to speak with the mother of his child was not an invocation of his right to remain silent. <em>See Diaz-Bridges, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>at 567, 34 A.3d 748 (holding that \u201crequests by an adult to speak with someone other than an attorney ... do not imply or suggest that the individual desires to remain silent\u201d (citing <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 228-32, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993))).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In summary, we find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s decision to suppress Brown\u2019s second statement and suppress Puryear\u2019s first statement. We also find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Puryear\u2019s second statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> <em>Miranda v.
