(the \u201cdeveloper\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the developer\u2019s insurers, Evanston Insurance Company (\u201cEvans-ton\u201d) and Crum &amp; Forster Specialty Insurance Company (\u201cCrum &amp; Forster\u201d) (collectively the \u201cinsurers\u201d), and various subcontractors (the \u201csubcontractors\u201d). The developer served as the general contractor on the condominium project and hired the subcontractors who performed all the construction work. Plaintiff sought coverage from the insurers under the developer\u2019s commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) insurance policies for consequential damages caused by the subcontractors\u2019 defective work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The judge determined that there was no \u201cproperty damage\u201d or \u201coccurrence\u201d as required by the policy to trigger coverage, granted summary judgment to Evanston, and dismissed the complaint against Crum &amp; Forster as moot. Plaintiff appeals from a January 31, 2014 order denying reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment to Evanston. The insurers cross-appeal from various orders contending that if we reverse on plaintiffs appeal, then we should address their arguments raised, but not considered, by the judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration to determine whether the trial court abused its discretionary authority. <em>Cummings v. Bahr, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 389, 685 A.2d 60 (App.Div.1996). When reviewing an order granting summary judgment, we apply the same standards that the trial court applied when ruling on the motion. <em>Oyola v. Xing Lan Liu, </em>431 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>493, 497, 70 A.3d 744 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>86, 77 A.3d 489 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The sole question in this appeal is whether consequential damages to the common areas of the condominium complex and to the unit owners\u2019 property, caused by the subcontractors\u2019 defective work, constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. We consider this issue by interpreting the plain language of the policy, which follows the Insurance Services Office, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cISO\u201d) 1986 standard CGL form (the \u201c1986 ISO form\u201d). Applying the relevant standards, we reverse the order denying reconsideration, set aside the orders dismissing plaintiffs complaint, and remand with instructions to consider the insurers\u2019 alternate contentions that plaintiffs claims are otherwise excluded under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We hold that the unintended and unexpected consequential damages caused by the subcontractors\u2019 defective work constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. We base this holding in part on the developer\u2019s reasonable expectation that, for insurance risk purposes, the subcontractors\u2019 faulty workmanship is to be treated differently than the work of a general contractor. We reach that conclusion by viewing the policy as a whole and distinguishing <em>Weedo v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>233, 405 A.2d 788 (1979), and <em>Firemen\u2019s Insurance Co. of Newark v. National Union Fire Insurance Co., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 904 A.2d 754 (App.Div.2006), two opinions construing ISO\u2019s 1973 standard CGL form (the \u201c1973 ISO form\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">We view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, as we must do at this stage. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The subcontractors failed to properly install the roof, flashing, gutters and leaders, brick and EIFS facade, windows, doors, and sealants (the \u201cfaulty .workmanship\u201d). The faulty workmanship amounted to what has typically been considered in the construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tion industry as defective work. In the insurance industry, such replacement costs are usually regarded as a cost of doing business and are considered a \u201cbusiness risk.\u201d <em>See Heldor Indus. v. Atl. Mut. Inc. Co., </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 396, 551 A.2d 1001 (App.Div.1988) (stating that \u201cthe insured assumes the risk of necessary replacement or repair ... as a part of the cost of doing business\u201d). Plaintiff has not argued that the replacement costs constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">According to plaintiff, the faulty workmanship also caused consequential damages to the \u201ccommon areas and unit owners\u2019 property [including] damage to steel supports, exterior sheathing and interior sheathing and sheetrock, insulation and other interior areas of the building, both visible and latent[.]\u201d Some unit owners experienced \u201cwater infiltration at the interior window jambs and sills[,]\u201d and \u201croof leaks.\u201d Other unit owners \u201cexperienced significant damage to the interior of their units, including exterior wall sheathing, wall cavity insulation, insulation sheetrock, wall finishes, wood flooring, and trim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In relation to sharing the cost of risks as a matter of insurance underwriting, consequential damages flowing from defective work are vastly different than the costs associated with replacing the defective work. <em>See Hartford Ins. Grp. v. Marson Constr. Corp., </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>253, 258-59, 452 A.2d 473 (App.Div.1982) (holding that defective work causing damage to other property is not a business risk), <em>certif. denied, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>247, 460 A.2d 656 (1983); <em>Newark Ins. Co. v. Acupac Packaging, Inc., </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 392-93, 746 A.2d 47 (App.Div.2000) (noting that damage to third-party property is a tort liability and not a business risk or work performance issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On appeal, plaintiff raises two principal arguments. First, plaintiff contends that under a plain reading of the language in the policy, the consequential damages constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Plaintiff asserts that we must conduct this initial threshold analysis. If a determination is made that \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence\u201d exist, plaintiff concedes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the insurers would be free to argue, on remand, that plaintiffs claims are otherwise excluded under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Second, plaintiff argues that the judge erroneously placed substantial reliance on the holdings in Weedo and <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>to determine whether there existed \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Plaintiff maintains that those cases are distinguishable because they (1) involved only replacement costs flowing from a business risk rather than consequential damages caused by defective work; and (2) interpreted different policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">We begin by addressing plaintiffs first contention, that there exists \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the plain language of the policy. The following well-settled principles inform our analysis of the policy\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">A court\u2019s interpretation of an insurance contract is a determination of law. <em>Sealed Air Corp. v. Royal Indem. Co., </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 375, 961 A.2d 1195 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>601, 960 A.2d 396 (2008). We afford no special deference to a trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from the established facts. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). Accordingly, we review a trial court\u2019s interpretation of an insurance policy de novo. <em>Sealed Air, supra, </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 375, 961 A.2d 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">An insurance policy must be construed \u201cas a whole and effect given to every part thereof.\u201d <em>Herbert L. Farkas Co. v. N.Y. Fire Ins. Co., </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>604, 610, 76 A.2d 895 (1950); <em>Arrow Indus. Carriers, Inc. v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co. of N.J., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 334-35, 556 A.2d 1310 (App.Div.1989) (noting that our \u201cresponsibility is to give effect to the whole policy, not just one part of it\u201d). When interpreting insurance contracts, we begin by first examining the plain language of the policy. <em>Pizzullo v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>251, 270-71, 952 A.2d 1077 (2008). If the terms are clear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>then we give them their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Ibid. </em>Construction of the insurance policy must be \u201cconsistent with the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>Sealed Air, supra, </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 376, 961 A.2d 1195 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Here, the language of the policy follows the 1986 ISO form. The policy provides the terms for coverage in Section I, A.1, with certain words defined in Section V. These sections provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">SECTION I \u2014 COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">COVERAGE A. BODILY INJURY &amp; PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiR\">1. Insuring Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">a. We will pay those sums that the Insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance [policy] applies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">b. This insurance applies to ... \u201cproperty damage\u201d only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">(1) The ... \u201cproperty damage\u201d is caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d that takes place in the \u201ccoverage territory\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">(2) The ... \u201cproperty damage\u201d occurs during the policy period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ-\">SECTION V \u2014 DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">13. \u201cOccurrence\u201d means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">16. \u201cProperty damage\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">Although the policy does not define the term \u201caccident,\u201d our Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe accidental nature of an occurrence is determined by analyzing whether the alleged wrongdoer intended or expected to cause an injury.\u201d <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 183, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Section I, A.1 is followed by Section I, A.2, which provides separate language excluding various claims. Thus, before reaching the policy\u2019s exclusions, the insuring agreement requires that there be an initial determination of whether there is \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Construing the language in Section I, A.1, we conclude that the consequential damages here amount to \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">As to whether there exists \u201cproperty damage,\u201d the consequential damages clearly constitute \u201cphysical injury to tangible property.\u201d The faulty workmanship damaged \u201cthe common areas and unit owners\u2019 property[.]\u201d The interior structures, including the drywall, insulation, wall finishes, and wood flooring, were damaged by water infiltration from the faulty workmanship. As a result, the consequential damages constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">As to whether there exists an \u201coccurrence,\u201d the consequential damages amount to an unexpected and unintended \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d The insurers do not contend, and we cannot reasonably believe, that the subcontractors either expected or intended for their faulty workmanship to cause \u201cphysical injury to tangible property.\u201d Thus, the consequential damages constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Turning to plaintiffs second argument, we conclude that in granting summary judgment, the trial judge erroneously applied the holdings in <em>Weedo </em>and <em>Firemen\u2019s. </em>Those cases are distinguishable because they (1) involved only replacement costs flowing from a business risk, rather than consequential damages caused by defective work; and (2) interpreted different language than the policy language in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">In <em>Weedo, </em>the Court did not resolve whether consequential damages resulting from subcontractors\u2019 faulty workmanship con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>stituted \u201cproperty damage\u201d or an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Rather, the Court focused only on issues related to insurance coverage. The insurer conceded that \u201cbut for the exclusions in the policy, coverage would obtain.\u201d <em>Weedo, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 237-38 n. 2, 405 A.2d 788. Implicit in this concession, therefore, is the tacit admission that there was an \u201coccurrence\u201d and \u201cproperty damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The <em>Weedo </em>Court, in interpreting the 1973 ISO form, held that there was no insurance coverage for \u201cfaulty workmanship ... where the damages claimed [were solely] the cost of correcting the work itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 405 A.2d 788. The Court considered such business-risk damages to be uninsurable. <em>Id. </em>at 240-41, 405 A.2d 788. Here, unlike in <em>Weedo, </em>the consequential damages are <em>not </em>defective-work damages. In other words, the consequential damages are distinct from the cost of correcting the work itself. Thus, the holding in <em>Weedo </em>is not dispositive on the issue presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In <em>Firemen\u2019s, </em>we also interpreted the 1973 ISO form. We concluded that there was no \u201cproperty damage\u201d or \u201coccurrence,\u201d and thus no insurance coverage, for damages that were solely related to replacing sub-standard firewalls because the damages were a business risk, not consequential damages. <em>Firemen\u2019s, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 443-45, 904 A.2d 754. We noted in <em>Firemen\u2019s, </em>unlike here, that there were no allegations of damages to the \u201crest of the building,\u201d and we followed <em>Weedo </em>indicating that the replacement of the defective work \u2014 a business risk \u2014 was uninsurable. <em>Id. </em>at 443, 446, 904 A.2d 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Even though <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>did not involve consequential damages, we acknowledged that \u201cthe risk of ... [consequential] damage to property caused by faulty workmanship,\u201d like here, is a different type of risk than the cost of doing business. <em>Id. </em>at 443, 904 A.2d 754 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). We stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">[u]nlike business risks ... where the tradesman commonly absorbs the cost attendant upon the repair of his faulty work, the accidental injury to property or persons substantially caused by his unworkmanlike performance exposes the contractor to almost limitless liabilities. While it may be true that the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>neglectful craftsmanship can be the cause of both a business expense of repair and a loss represented by damage to persons and property, <em>the two consequences are vastly different in relation to sharing the cost of such risks as a matter of insurance underwriting.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added) (quoting <em>Weedo, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 239-40, 405 A.2d 788) (internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Thus, this case falls within the caveat that <em>Weedo </em>and <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>expressly recognized, and accords with our prior holdings in <em>Hartford Insurance, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 258-59, 452 A.2d 473, and <em>Newark Insurance, supra, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 393, 746 A.2d 47. We emphasize that the consequential damages here are not the cost of replacing the defective work \u2014 that is the improperly installed roof, flashing, gutters and leaders, brick and EIFS facade, windows, doors, and sealants. Those costs are considered a business risk associated with faulty workmanship. Rather, the consequential damages are those additional damages to the common areas of the condominium building and the unit owners\u2019 property. The consequential damages are therefore not the cost of correcting the defective work, such as the cost of replacing the stucco in the <em>Weedo </em>case or replacing the firewalls as in <em>Firemen\u2019s, </em>but rather the cost of curing the \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising from the subcontractors\u2019 faulty workmanship.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">There are also two critical differences between the 1973 ISO form considered in <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>and the 1986 ISO form in this case. These differences provide additional support for our conclusion that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the holding in <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>is misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">First, \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined differently. The 1973 ISO form defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201c \u2018an accident ... which results in ... property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Firemen\u2019s, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 441, 904 A.2d 754. Here, the policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d \u201cProperty damage,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>therefore, is not directly included in the policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence,\u201d and <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>is consequently not squarely on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Second and most importantly, the 1986 ISO form includes a significant exception to an exclusion not contained in the 1973 ISO form. Due to this exception, we conclude that for insurance risk purposes, consequential damages caused by a subcontractor\u2019s faulty workmanship are considered differently than property damage caused by a general contractor\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Pertinent to our conclusion that reliance on <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>is misplaced, the policy contains the following exclusionary language that did not appear in the policy we considered in <em>Firemen\u2019s:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">2. Exclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">1. Damage to Your Work [the \u2018Your Work\u201d Exclusion] <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d to \u201cyour work\u201d arising out of it or any part of it____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\"><em>This exclusion does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor. </em>[The \u201csubcontractor's exception\u201d].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">The policy defines \u2018Tour Work\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">a. Work or operations performed by you or on your behalf; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-14\">b. Materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">Although we need not resolve whether plaintiffs property damage claims are excluded under the policy, the addition of the subcontractor\u2019s exception is of critical importance when determining whether the subcontractors\u2019 faulty workmanship causing consequential damages amounts to \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. The subcontractor\u2019s exception did not appear in ISO forms before 1986. Commentators have observed that ISO added the subcontractor\u2019s exception because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the insurance and policyholder communities agreed that the CGL policy should provide coverage for defective construction claims so long as the allegedly defective work had been performed by a subcontractor rather than the policyholder itself. This resulted both because of the demands of the policyholder community (which wanted this sort of coverage) and the view of insurers that the CGL was a more attractive product that could be better sold if it contained this coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"as-dedup-0\">[Christopher C.

Stempel, <em>Stempel on Insurance Contracts </em>\u00a7 14.13d at 14-224.8 (3d ed. supp.2007)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">ISO also provided guidance regarding the subcontractor\u2019s exception by making clear that the policy \u201c \u2018cover[ed] damage caused by faulty workmanship to other parts of work in progress; <em>and damage to, or caused by, a subcontractor\u2019s work after the insured\u2019s operations are completed.\u2019 \u201d U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. J.S.U.B., Inc., </em>979 So.2d 871, 879 (Fla.2007) (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting ISO Circular, Commercial General Liability Program Instructions Pamphlet, No. GL-86-204 (July 15, 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">As a practical matter, it is very difficult for a general contractor to control the quality of a subcontractor\u2019s work. If the parties to the insurance contract did not intend a subcontractor\u2019s faulty workmanship causing consequential damages to constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence,\u201d as those terms are defined in the policy, then it begs the question as to why there is a subcontractor\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The absence of such an exception in the 1973 ISO form is important because in defining \u201cproperty damage\u201d to effectuate insurance coverage, we previously rejected any attempt to separate a subcontractor\u2019s faulty workmanship from that of a general contractor. In <em>Firemen\u2019s, supra, </em>we recognized that cases interpreting the 1973 ISO form \u201cequate[d] subcontractors with general contractors for the purposes of determining whether there was \u2018property damage[.]\u2019 \u201d 387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 446, 904 A.2d 754. But here, the policy includes the subcontractor\u2019s exception. Thus, as a matter of an insurance underwriting risk, the exception treats consequential damages caused from faulty workmanship by subcontractors differently than damage caused by the work of general contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Even though we were not required to consider whether there was an \u201coccurrence\u201d in <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>because we had concluded that there was no \u201cproperty damage,\u201d we noted that \u201cthe majority rule [at that time was] that faulty workmanship [did] not constitute an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 904 A.2d 754. We made that statement, however, analyzing the 1973 ISO form in a case involving only damages related to a business risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In <em>Firemen\u2019s, </em>we cited out-of-state case law involving the pre1986 ISO form, which provided that \u201c \u2018[t]he completed product is to be viewed as a whole, not as a grouping of component parts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 904 A.2d 754 (quoting <em>Knutson Constr. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marne Ins. Co., </em>396 N.W.2d 229, 236-37 (Minn.1986)). But once again, we were construing a different insurance policy and equating, for insurance underwriting risk purposes, the work of subcontractors with that of general contractors. Here, the trial court\u2019s treatment of the subcontractors\u2019 work and the developer\u2019s completed product \u201cas a whole,\u201d ignores the import and purpose of the subcontractor\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Thus, looking at the policy in its entirety, the developer would reasonably expect that consequential damages caused by the subcontractors\u2019 faulty workmanship constituted \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence.\u201d This reasonable expectation is supported by applying the definitions of \u201cproperty damage\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d together with the subcontractor\u2019s exception and its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">We also find persuasive that \u201cthe majority rule [currently] is that construction defects [causing consequential damages] constitute \u2018occurrenees[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Construction Defects, supra, </em>47 <em>Gonz. L.Rev. </em>at 24-26. The leading case decided by the Florida Supreme Court, <em>United States Fire Insurance Co., supra, </em>held that under the same policy language as here, consequential damage caused by defective work constituted \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>renee\u201d under the policy. 979 So.2d at 889-91. The Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">faulty workmanship that is neither intended nor expected ... can constitute an \u201caccident\u201d and thus an \u201coccurrence\u201d under a post-1986 standard form CGL policy. We further conclude that physical injury to the completed project that occurs as a result of the defective work can constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined in a CGL policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 891.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">It is notable that the Florida Supreme Court distinguished the holding in <em>Weedo </em>by stating that <em>Weedo </em>\u201cinvolved the issue of whether there was coverage for the contractor\u2019s own defective work, [and] was dependent on the policy language of pre-1986 CGL policies, including the relevant insuring provisions and applicable exclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Other courts have also reached the same conclusion. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, applying Maryland law, found that under the same policy language as here, liability coverage existed \u201cfor the cost to remedy unexpected and unintended [consequential] property damage to the contractor\u2019s otherwise non-defective work-product caused by the subcontractor\u2019s defective workmanship.\u201d <em>French v. Assurance Co. of Am., </em>448 F.3d 693, 706 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see also Construction Defects, swpra, </em>47 <em>Gonz. L.Rev. </em>at 25-27, n.78-92 (listing cases that reached similar holdings from the Supreme Courts of Georgia, Texas, Kansas, Indiana, Minnesota, Alaska, Mississippi, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wisconsin).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The judge in this case found persuasive the reasoning expressed by the Third Circuit in an unpublished and non-precedential case, <em>Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Co. v. Park-shore Development Corp., </em>403 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>770 (3d Cir.2010). The Third Circuit remarked that we concluded in <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>that \u201cfaulty workmanship[,] whether performed by a contractor or subcontractor^] which causes damage to the general contractor\u2019s work[,] is not an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 772. In <em>Firemen\u2019s, </em>however, we interpreted the 1973 ISO form, which omitted any reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the subcontractor\u2019s exception to the \u2018Tour Work\u201d exclusion. As a result, any such reliance on <em>Firemen\u2019s </em>is respectfully misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Interpreting \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy to include unexpected and unintended consequential damages caused by the subcontractors\u2019 faulty workmanship will not convert the policy into a performance bond. <em>See United States Fire, supra, </em>979 So.2d at 887-88. A performance bond guarantees the completion of a construction contract if a contractor defaults, and unlike an insur ance policy, it benefits the project owner rather than the contractor. <em>Ribeira &amp; Lourenco Concrete Constr. v. Jackson Health Care Assoc., </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 451-54, 603 A.2d 976 (App.Div.1992). A surety, unlike a liability insurer, is also entitled to indemnification from the contractor. <em>Montefusco Excavating &amp; Contractor Co. v. Cnty. of Middlesex, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>519, 525, 414 A.2d 961 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Moreover, although we express no opinion as to the weight of any potential cross-claim against the subcontractors or their insurance companies, we note that the policy contains an endorsement requiring that the subcontractors name the developer as an additional insured on the subcontractors\u2019 insurance policies, and the endorsement requires the subcontractors to maintain CGL insurance in an amount of at least \u201cequal\u201d to the insurance provided in the policy. As a result, such purported added insurance protections further prevent the policy from acting solely like a performance bond by arguably shifting the insurers\u2019 indemnification obligations to the subcontractors and their insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Finally, concluding that plaintiff met the definitions of \u201cproperty damage\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy does not automatically mean that insurance coverage exists. We do not reach the question of whether plaintiff is entitled to insurance coverage under the policy. The insurers contended before the judge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>even if there were \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy, plaintiffs claims would otherwise be excluded. The judge never reached those issues, and we decline to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">It is well-established that we \u201cmay exercise such original jurisdiction as is necessary to complete the determination of any matter on review.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-5. However, original jurisdiction should be exercised with \u201cgreat frugality\u201d and not when there is a need to \u201cweight ] evidence anew\u201d or \u201cmak[e] independent factual fmdingst.]\u201d <em>State v. Micelli, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>284, 293, 72 A.3d 235 (2013) (alterations in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The <em>Micelli </em>Court cautioned against what the insurers are now urging us to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Although we decline to exercise original jurisdiction and address the issues raised by the insurers in their cross-appeals, the insurers may argue, as plaintiff concedes, on remand that the exclusions in the policy preclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\"> The insurers' policies contain the same pertinent language.
