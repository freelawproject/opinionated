The Registration Law authorizes a court to terminate a registrant\u2019s obligations if, among other requirements, the registrant \u201chas not committed an offense within 15 years following conviction or release ... whichever is larger, and is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-2f. Appellants\u2019 applications were denied because each appellant had committed an offense \u2014 though not a sex offense \u2014 within the fifteen year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">These appeals require us to decide whether the term \u201coffense\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f means \u201ca crime, a disorderly persons offense or a petty disorderly persons offense unless a particular subsection in the code is intended to apply to less than all three[,]\u201d the definition given in the general definitional subsection of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (the Code); or a \u201csex offense\u201d as defined in the Registration Law. Having considered appellants\u2019 arguments in light of the record and controlling law, and having found no ambiguity in the statutory language, we conclude the term offense means what the Code\u2019s general definitional subsection defines it to mean. Accordingly, we affirm the trial courts\u2019 orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">A. A.D.\u2019s Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The parties do not dispute the facts. On February 7,1997, A.D. was convicted of third-degree endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, an offense that triggered the requirements of the Registration Law. The court sentenced A.D. to three years\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>probation and community supervision for life (CSL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C.-43-6.4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A.D. initially complied with the Registration Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">More than fifteen years after his conviction, in 2015, A.D. filed a motion to be relieved of the Registration Law\u2019s obligations. In support of his application, he submitted a licensed psychologist\u2019s \u201cPsychosexual Evaluation Actuarial Risk Assessment\u201d in which the psychologist reported that A.D.\u2019s recidivism risk level was low. The psychologist noted that A.D. had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">During the hearing on A.D.\u2019s application, his counsel represented that A.D. \u201cha[d] gone fifteen years since his date of conviction[,] ... [and] the underlying crimes for which he was convicted do not bar him from removal pursuant to subsection G of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Emphasizing A.D.\u2019s expert report, counsel argued A.D. no longer posed a threat to society. Additionally, counsel explained that because A.D. suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and was under the constant care and supervision of his mother, the registration requirements presented nothing more than a burden to his family. The State did not oppose A.D.\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">For reasons that have nothing to do with the issue on appeal and thus need not be explained, neither the court nor counsel were aware that in 2005 A.D. had pled guilty to, and been convicted of, violating a special condition of CSL, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6.4, for failing to notify his parole officer of his change of address. Three months after the court granted A.D.\u2019s application to terminate his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>registration obligations, the State became aware of his 2005 conviction and moved for reconsideration under <em>Rule </em>4:49-2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In opposition to the State\u2019s motion, A.D. produced, among other things, an addendum from A.D.\u2019s psychologist affirming that A.D. remained at a low risk for sexually reoffending and did not present an increased risk of harm to members of the community, notwithstanding the intervening conviction. A.D. also submitted a letter written in another case by Philip H. Witt, Ph.D., one of the primary authors of the Registrant Risk Assessment Scale manual. The Registrant Risk Assessment Scale (RRAS) is used to assess whether a registrant\u2019s risk of reoffending is low, moderate or high. Dr. Witt stated in his letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">Scoring non-sexual offenses on the RRAS is an attempt to capture a general level of \u201canti-sociality\u201d. Hence, only if the non-sexual offense that occurs after the sex offense adjudication (or release from incarceration) is part of a broader, anti-social pattern of behavior, would it increase the likelihood of sex offense recidivism and therefore be of interest. This is particularly true of a \u201cfailure to register\u201d charge. There is substantial research indicating that failure to register in and of itself does not increase likelihood of sex offense recidivism. Therefore, it is my recommendation that a failure to register charge not preclude an individual\u2019s applying for release from Megan\u2019s Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">During the hearing on the State\u2019s motion, A.D.\u2019s mother testified that subjecting her son to the Registration Law would impose a significant hardship upon her. She explained that A.D. did not understand the purpose of the hearing and would not be able to register because he would be unable to travel. A.D.\u2019s mother emphasized that A.D. was under her care and goes nowhere by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The court granted the State\u2019s motion and vacated its previous order terminating A.D.\u2019s registration obligations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court rejected A.D.\u2019s argument that his application should be granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>because he had not committed a sex offense within fifteen years. A.D. appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">B. J.B.\u2019s Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">J.B. pled guilty to second-degree sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C.T4-2c, and was sentenced in March 1995 to a five-year custodial term. Following his release from custody, J.B. initially complied with the Registration Law. In 2006, however, J.B. failed to register and moved from his current address without notifying authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In August 2007, J.B. pled guilty to fourth-degree failure to notify law enforcement agencies of a change of address, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2d(l) and was placed on probation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, in 2014 when J.B. applied to terminate his obligation under the Registration Law, the court denied his application, concluding that the intervening conviction, though not for a sex offense, was a bar under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f to termination of his Registration Law obligations. J.B. appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">C. C.M.\u2019s Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">C.M. pled guilty to third-degree aggravated criminal sexual contact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3a, and was sentenced in May 1999 to four years\u2019 probation. His judgment of conviction was amended in April 2002 to subject C.M. to the requirements of Megan\u2019s Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Fifteen years after C.M.\u2019s sex offense conviction, he applied to the Law Division to terminate his Registration Law obligations. The court denied the application due to an intervening conviction for violating a final restraining order under the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-17 to -35.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>court rejected C.M.\u2019s argument that he was entitled to have his registration obligations terminated because he had not committed a sex offense within fifteen years. C.M. appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">On this appeal, A.D. raises these points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">I. THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE WORD \u201cOFFENSE\u201d AS USED IN <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:7-2\u00a9 IS TO BE [INTERPRETED] AS A \u201cSEX OFFENSE[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">II.

If the statute is interpreted to preclude a registrant from being removed from Megan\u2019s Law for committing a non-sexual offense, it would lead to absurd results, as it did in this case in the Law Division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">C. The doctrine of lenity favors interpreting the statute to mean sex offense, not a non-sexual criminal offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">III.

INTERPRETING THE WORD \u201cOFFENSE\u201d TO INCLUDE NON-SEXUAL CRIMINAL OFFENSES WOULD NOT BE RATIONALLY RELATED TO THE GOAL OF MEGAN\u2019S LAW, MAKING SUCH INTERPRETATION UNCONSTITUTIONAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-14\">V. OTHER TRIAL COURTS AVOID A STRICT, OUT-OF-CONTEXTUAL INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD \u201cOFFENSE[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-15\">J.

When construing a statute, appellate courts conduct a de novo review. <em>State v. Revie, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>126, 132, 104 A.3d 221 (2014) (citing <em>State v. J.D., </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>344, 354, 48 A.3d 1031 (2012)); <em>C.A. ex rel. Applegrad v. Bentolila, </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>449, 459, 99 A.3d 317 (2014) (citing <em>In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94, 935 A.2d 1184 (2007)). \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s intent is the paramount goal when interpreting a statute and, generally, the best indicator of that intent is the statutory language.\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005); <em>accord State v. Friedman, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>102, 117, 35 A.3d 1163 (2012). Thus, \u201c[t]he plain language of the statute is our starting point.\u201d <em>Patel v. N.J. Motor Vehicle Comm\u2019n, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>413, 418, 982 A.2d 445 (2009). In considering a statute\u2019s language, we are guided by the legislative directive that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXU\">words and phrases shall be read and construed with their context, and shall, unless inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature or unless another or different meaning is expressly indicated, be given their generally accepted meaning, according to the approved usage of the language. Technical words and phrases, and words and phrases having a special or accepted meaning in the law, shall be construed in accordance with such technical or special and accepted meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>1:1-1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">When construing a statute in which \u201cthe Legislature has clearly defined a term, the courts are bound by that definition.\u201d <em>Febbi v. Bd. of Review, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>601, 606, 174 A.2d 481 (1961) (citations omitted); <em>accord Stenberg v. Carhart, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>914, 942, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2597, 2615, 147 L.Ed.2d 743, 766 (2000). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that the statutory definition of the term excludes unstated meanings of that term.\u201d <em>Meese v. Keene, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>465, 484, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1862, 1873, 95 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>415, 431 (1987) (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018[W]here the Legislature has clearly and explicitly defined a term within a statute, we must assume it did so intentionally and with the intent that its stated definition be applied to that term throughout the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ciesla v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Sr. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>Sevs., </em>429 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 143-44, 57 A.3d 40 (App.Div.2012) (quoting <em>Commerce Bancorp, Inc. v.

The Code\u2019s general definitional section, <em>N.J.SA. </em>2C:1-14, includes the following statement and definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">In this code, unless a different meaning plainly is required:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">k. \u201cOffense\u201d means a crime, a disorderly persons offense or a petty disorderly persons offense unless a particular subsection in this code is intended to apply to less than all three[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">The Code\u2019s general definitional subsection does not define the term sex offense.

Acknowledging that courts need not refer to extrinsic evidence to determine a statute\u2019s meaning if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, appellants begin their argument with the premise that if statutory language \u201c \u2018admits to more than one reasonable interpretation, [courts] may look to sources outside the language to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 <em>State v. Reiner, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>307, 311 [850 A.2d 1252] (2004).\u201d They next assert that the term offense in subsection f admits to more than one reasonable interpretation. From these two premises, appellants reason that we must resort to extrinsic aids, a process that leads to the conclusion that the term offense means sex offense. For several reasons, we disagree with appellants\u2019 assertion that the term offense in subsection f admits to more than one reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">First, the Code explicitly defines the term offense. As previously noted, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:l-14k states: \u201c \u2018Offense\u2019 means a crime, a disorderly persons offense or a petty disorderly persons offense unless a particular subsection in this code is intended to apply to less than all three[.]\u201d Because the Legislature has defined the term and stated that its meaning applies throughout the Code \u201cunless a different meaning plainly is required,\u201d we must assume that the Legislature intended that the term\u2019s stated definition controls, <em>Ciesla, supra, </em>429 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 144, 57 A.3d 40 and that the term excludes unstated meanings, <em>Meese, supra, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>at 484, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1873, 95 L.Ed.2d at 431. Applying those principles leads to the conclusion that the term offense in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f means precisely what it is defined to mean \u2014 a crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly persons offense \u2014 \u25a0 and not the unstated limited meaning, \u201csex offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Next, interpreting the term offense in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-2f as the Code defines it in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-14k is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute in <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 662 A.2d 367 (1995). In that decision, the Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the Registration Law as well as the Community Notification Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-6 to -11, are constitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 662 A.2d 367. After summarizing the Registration Law\u2019s requirements, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">All of these are lifetime requirements unless the registrant has been offense-free for fifteen years following conviction or release from a correctional facility (whichever is later) and, on application to terminate these obligations, can persuade the court that he or she is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\"><em>[Id, </em>at 21, 662 A.2d 367.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The Court did not summarize the Registration Law\u2019s termination provision as requiring a registrant to be sex offense-free for fifteen years; rather, the Court summarized the termination provision as requiring registrants to be offense-free. And, after so characterizing the Registration Law\u2019s termination provision, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">We are aware of the uncertainties that surround all aspects of the subject of sex offender recidivism and the effectiveness of preventive measures. Legislatures, despite uncertainty, sometimes act to deal with public needs, basing such action on what they conclude, in a welter of conflicting opinions, to be the probable best course. Our Legislature could reasonably conclude that risk of reoffense can be fairly measured, and that knowledge of the presence of offenders provides increased defense against them. Given those conclusions, the system devised by the Legislature is appropriately designed to achieve the law\u2019s purpose of protecting the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">[Id. at 25, 662 A.2d 367.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Lastly, the Registration Law was one of \u201ca group of bills concerning sex offenders\u201d that became law on October 31, 1994. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 662 A.2d 367. In addition to the Registration Law and Community Notification Law, the Legislature enacted <em>L. </em>1994, c. 130, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 2, the Violent Predator Incapacitation Act of 1994, which, among other things, established the special sentence of community supervision for life, now parole supervision for life, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4. Subsection c authorizes courts to \u201cgrant a petition for release from a special sentence of community supervision only upon proof that the person has not committed a crime for 15 years since last conviction or release from incarceration, whichever is later, and that the person is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others if released from supervision.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Legislature\u2019s decision to define the term sex offense in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-2b, use the term offense in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f, and use the term crime in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4c, evidences an intent to use those terms throughout Megan\u2019s Law precisely as the terms are defined in the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">A.D. argues that the term offense in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f \u201cbecomes ambiguous when considering it in conjunction with the other subsections of 2C:7-2.\u201d J.B. and C.M. argue that because \u201cthe State and the Public Defender have a reasonable interpretation of the instant provision,\u201d the term offense in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f admits to more than one reasonable interpretation. We find appellants\u2019 arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">A.D. cites three of the Registration Law\u2019s sections: <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2b(l) &amp; (2), and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2e. Subsection 2b(l) includes as sex offenses aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, kidnapping under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-lc(2), \u201cor an attempt to commit any of these crimes if the court found that the offender\u2019s conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive compulsive behavior, <em>regardless of the date of the commission of the offense or the date of the conviction </em>[.]\u201d (emphasis added). Subsection 2b(2), enumerates specific crimes and adds, \u201cor an attempt to commit any <em>of these enumerated of</em>fenses----\u201d (emphasis added). Subsection 2e provides, among other things, that \u201c[a] person required to register under paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section or under paragraph (3) of subsection b. on the basis of <em>a conviction for an offense similar to an offense enumerated in paragraph (2) of subsection b </em>shall verify his address annually in a manner prescribed by the Attorney General.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Emphasizing each of the underscored phrases, A.D. argues that each reference to \u201c[t]he word \u2018offense\u2019 in these [phrases] obviously refers to a sex offense, yet the Legislature only used the word offense, most likely because the continual repetition of the word \u2018sex offense\u2019 would have been too wordy and redundant.\u201d From that observation, A.D. argues that \u201c[s]ince that same pattern is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>carried in subsection [f], the likely conclusion is that the word \u2018offense\u2019 refers to a \u2018sex offense\u2019 in that subsection as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">A.D. overlooks both the context and syntax of the subsections he cites. Subsection b(l) designates certain crimes as sex offenses, includes attempts to commit any of \u201cthese crimes,\u201d and makes irrelevant \u201cthe date of the commission of the offense or the date of conviction.\u201d Contextually, the terms \u201cthese crimes\u201d and \u201cthe offense\u201d are meaningless unless they refer to the specifically enumerated crimes. Syntactically, the demonstrative pronoun \u201cthese\u201d before \u201ccrimes\u201d and the definite article \u201cthe\u201d before \u201coffense\u201d refer to specific antecedents, namely, the crimes enumerated in the same subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The same is true of subsections b(2) and e. In subsection b(2), the phrase \u201cthe enumerated offenses\u201d both contextually and syntactically refers back to the offenses enumerated in that subsection; and the phrase in subsection e \u2014 \u201con the basis of a conviction for an offense similar to an offense enumerated in paragraph (2) of subsection b\u201d \u2014 refers explicitly to the crimes enumerated in subsection b(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In contrast, subsection f permits \u201ca person required to register under this act,\u201d to apply for termination of the obligation \u201cupon proof that the person has not committed <em>an offense </em>within 15 years following conviction or release from a correctional facili-ty____\u201d (emphasis added). The text of subsection f contains no enumerated crimes, and the phrase \u201can offense\u201d includes the indefinite article \u201can,\u201d which neither contextually nor syntactically refers to an antecedent. Stated in terms of the Code\u2019s general definitional section, neither the context nor syntax of subsection f \u201cplainly require[s]\u201d a meaning of offense different from the term\u2019s defined meaning. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-14k.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">We are also unpersuaded by J.B. and C.M.\u2019s argument that because they and the State both have reasonable interpretations of the term offense in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f, the term offense admits to more than one reasonable interpretation. The question whether statutory language is ambiguous is not resolved based on one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>party\u2019s self-proclaimed assertion that the parties\u2019 conflicting interpretations of a statute are reasonable. As two distinguished authors have pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">You might be tempted to say, \u201cIf the language were plain and unambiguous, we wouldn\u2019t be arguing about it, would we?\u201d Banish the thought: lawyers argue about plain and unambiguous language all the time. That is their job: to inject doubt when it is in their clients\u2019 interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">[Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner, <em>Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, </em>54 (2012).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Appellants have offered neither persuasive authority nor a persuasive reason why the Legislature\u2019s definition of the term offense should be disregarded. Were we to adopt their arguments we would, in effect, be requiring the Legislature to not only define a term and state that it is used as defined unless a different meaning is plainly required, but then redefine the term each time it is used throughout an enactment. The folly of such a result is self-evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">A.D. alternatively contends that if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f is found to be facially unambiguous, we should nevertheless consider a committee statement accompanying the bill that became law and added section g to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2. <em>L. </em>2001, c. 392. A.D. bases his argument on the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201cwhatever the rule of construction, it is subordinate to the goal of effectuating the legislative plan as it may be gathered from the enactment \u201cwhen read in the full light of its history, purpose and context.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lewis, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>363, 369, 886 A.2d 643 (2005) (quoting <em>State v. Gill, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>441, 444, 221 A.2d 521 (1966)). Although we question the validity of A.D.\u2019s argument in a case where a statute is facially unambiguous, we nevertheless address it for the sake of completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">The Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2 in 2002 to comply with the federal Jacob Wetterling Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 14071.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">[The Jacob Wetterling Act] directs the federal Attorney General to establish guidelines for state programs such as Megan\u2019s Law that require the registration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>pei'sons guilty of offenses of the kind committed by the registrants herein and prescribes the length of time for which offenders must remain registered. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 14071(a)(1).

States that fail to implement the Jacob Wetterling Program are to be denied, under 42 <em>XJ.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 14071(g)(2), ten percent of certain funding that would otherwise be allocated to the States under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3756.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\"><em>[In re L.E., </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 66, 840 A.2d 850 (App.Div.2003).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">This is the pertinent portion of the committee statement A.D. relies on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">This bill prohibits the removal of certain sex offenders from the State\u2019s sex offender registry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">Under the provisions of this bill, registered sex offenders who have been convicted of ... more than one sex offense or who have been convicted of ... aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault involving physical force or coercion may not apply to the Superior Court to terminate the obligation to register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">Under <em>current State law, </em>a sex offender who has not committed <em>a repeat offense </em>for at least fifteen years may petition a judge to remove his name from the registry. The federal Megan\u2019s Law provision in the Jacob Wetterling Act, however, prohibits twice convicted sex offenders or violent sex offenders with one conviction from being released from the requirement to register. States that do not comply with this requirement will lose federal funding beginning in the year 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\"><em>[Senate Law and Public Safety Committee Statement to Senate No. 2711 </em>(Nov. 29, 2001) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">A.D. asserts that the phrase \u201ccurrent State law\u201d refers to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f, and the term \u201ca repeat offense\u201d refers to the commission of another sex offense. From those assertions, A.D. reasons that the legislative plan as described in the committee statement \u201cis to bar repeat sex offenders from being removed from the purview of Megan\u2019s Law\u201d and that the \u201cplan is to be effectuated regardless of the literal text of 2C:7-2f, which is subordinate to the legislature\u2019s plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">We reject A.D.\u2019s argument. The purpose of the committee statement was to describe the provisions of pending legislation, not the provisions of legislation enacted seven years earlier. Thus, any conclusion about previous legislation that might be deduced from the statement is speculative. More significantly, even if the committee statement refers to a repeat sex offender, the committee statement accurately described the \u201cexisting law\u201d; before <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2 was amended to add subsection g, a repeat sex offender who had not committed an offense of any kind, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>including a sex offense, within fifteen years of the last sex offense was not prohibited from seeking termination of his registration requirements. The offender would nonetheless have been prohibited from seeking termination of his registration requirements if he had committed a recent non-sex offense. We thus reject A.D.\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Appellants next argue that interpreting the word offense in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-2f to mean a non-sex offense would not be rationally related to the goal of Megan\u2019s Law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The purpose of the Registration Law is stated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">a. The danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders and offenders who commit other predatory acts against children, and the dangers posed by persons who prey on others as a result of mental illness, require a system of registration that will permit law enforcement officials to identify and alert the public when necessary for the public safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">b. A system of registration of sex offenders and offenders who commit other predatory acts against children will provide law enforcement with additional information critical to preventing and promptly resolving incidents involving sexual abuse and missing persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">As we previously pointed out, after noting that Megan\u2019s Law\u2019s registration requirements \u201care lifetime requirements unless the registrant has been offense-free for fifteen years following conviction or release from a correctional facility (whichever is later) and ... can persuade the court that he or she is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others[,]\u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 21, 662 A.2d 367, the Supreme Court determined that \u201c[o]ur Legislature could reasonably conclude that risk of reoffense can be fairly measured, and that knowledge of the presence of offenders provides increased defense against them. Given those conclusions, the system devised by the Legislature is appropriately designed to achieve the laws\u2019 purpose of protecting the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 662 A.2d 367. The Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements are dispositive of appellants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">A.D. asserts that \u201cthe psychological community believes that the commission of a non-sexual, technical parole violation does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>increase one\u2019s risk, or danger, to recidivate.\u201d From that assertion, A.D. reasons, \u201c[i]t ... cannot rationally be concluded that the State\u2019s interpretation of the word \u2018offense\u2019 is related to the objective of Megan\u2019s Law.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>\u201c[conflicting studies and interpretations, especially concerning the precise numbers, abound, but as noted above, the resolution of the controversy in this area is solely a legislative matter.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 15, n. 1, 662 A.2d 367. Moreover, the Attorney General developed the RRAS and the Registrant Risk Assessment Manual to implement the legislative directive to provide three levels of notification depending upon the risk of reoffense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-8. \u201cThe [RRAS] was rationally derived by a panel of mental health and legal experts by the following process: 1) the selection of risk assessment criteria that have empirical support; 2) the [weighing] of these pertinent risk assessment criteria; and 3) the use of sample eases to assist in the setting of numerical cutoff points for low, moderate and high risk scores.\u201d <em>Attorney General Guidelines for Law Enforcement For the Implementation of Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Law </em>(June 1998, rev\u2019d February 2007), Appendix E at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The RRAS takes into consideration antisocial acts other than sex offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 3. We point this out not to suggest that the Guidelines and Manual are somehow reflective of the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting Megan\u2019s Law\u2019s registration requirements, but rather to emphasize the invalidity of A.D.\u2019s assertion that reports from one or two psychologists are either reflective of the psychological community\u2019s beliefs or authority for the proposition that including non-sex offenses in the statutory scheme is contrary to the statutory purpose. In short, we are unpersuaded by appellant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Appellants next argue that in <em>In re Registrant J.G., </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>304, 777 A.2d 891 (2001), the Supreme Court held that the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>offense in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f means sex offense. Alternatively, appellants argue that the Court\u2019s reference to the term offense in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2 as \u201csex offense\u201d is dicta and the Supreme Court\u2019s dicta is binding on the Appellate Division and trial courts. Lastly, appellants argue that the Supreme Court opinion in <em>J.G. </em>at least demonstrates that the term offense in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-2f is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In <em>J.G., </em>the Court undertook \u201cthe judicial task of harmonizing [the Legislature\u2019s generalized intent to apply Megan\u2019s Law to juveniles adjudicated delinquent based on convictions of sex offenses] with the protective philosophy underlying the Code of Juvenile Justice, as well as with that statute\u2019s specific provisions[.]\u201d <em>J.G., supra, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>at 320, 777 A.2d 891. The Court held that for juveniles adjudicated delinquent for committing a sex offense when they were under age fourteen, \u201cMegan\u2019s Law registration and community notification orders shall terminate at age eighteen if the Law Division, after a hearing ... determines on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that the delinquent is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 777 A.2d 891. In so holding, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">We import that standard but with a higher burden of proof, from <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-2, the provision of Megan\u2019s Law that authorizes the termination of registration obligations of persons who have not committed a <em>sex offense </em>within fifteen years of conviction or release from a correctional facility, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Appellants argue that the Court\u2019s reference to \u201cthe termination of registration obligations of persons who have not committed a sex offense within fifteen years\u201d could have referred only to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f, is central to the Court\u2019s holding, and is therefore dispositive of whether the term offense in that statutory subsection means sex offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">We disagree with appellants that the Court\u2019s reference to the term \u201coffense\u201d as \u201csex offense\u201d was part of its holding. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2f imposes two conditions on a registrant\u2019s right to seek termination of the registration requirements: first, the registrant must prove that he has not committed an offense within fifteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>years following conviction or release; second, the registrant must prove that he is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others. The Court\u2019s holding in <em>J.G., </em>which the Court stated explicitly, was that Megan\u2019s Law\u2019s registration and community notification requirements shall terminate at age eighteen if, after a hearing, the Law Division \u201cdetermines on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that the delinquent is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.\u201d <em>J.G., supra, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>at 337, 777 A.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The Court in <em>J.G. </em>did not impose as a condition of termination a juvenile registrant\u2019s non-commission of an offense, sexual or otherwise. Thus, the Court\u2019s holding would have been entirely unaffected if it had deleted everything following the statutory citation from its statement, \u201c[w]e import that standard, but with a higher burden of proof, from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2, the provision of Megan\u2019s Law that authorizes the termination of registration obligations of persons who have not committed a sex offense within fifteen years of conviction or release from a correction facility, whichever is later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Indisputably, the Court\u2019s \u201cexpression of opinion on a point involved in a case, argued by counsel and deliberately mentioned by the court, although not essential to the disposition of the case ... becomes authoritative! ] when it is expressly declared by the court as a guide for future conduct.\u201d <em>State v.

Rather, the Court\u2019s reference to sex offense appears to be a passing comment. Moreover, the comment appears to contradict the Court\u2019s previous explanation that the Registration Law\u2019s requirements are lifetime requirements unless the registrant has been \u201coffense-free.\u201d <em>Doe v.
