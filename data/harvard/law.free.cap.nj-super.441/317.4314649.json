McNeely, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>1552, 185 L.Ed.2d 696 (2013), the United States Supreme Court considered whether \u201cthe natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream presents a <em>per se </em>exigency that justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1556, 185 L.Ed.2d at 702 (emphasis added). Concluding that fact alone did not present a <em>\u201cper se </em>exigency,\u201d the Supreme Court held, \u201cconsistent with general Fourth Amendment principles, that exigency in this context must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">In this case, we granted leave to the State to appeal from an order that suppressed the results obtained from a blood sample taken from a drunk driving suspect without a warrant. The facts of the case are set forth in our opinion. <em>State v. Jones, </em>437 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 96 A.3d 297 (App.Div.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">At the time of our decision, our Supreme Court had not yet determined whether the rule announced in <em>McNeely </em>would be enforced retroactively in New Jersey. Although another panel of this court had determined that <em>McNeely </em>should not be applied retroactively, <em>State v. Adkins, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 484-85, 81 A.3d 680 (App.Div.2013), <em>rev\u2019d and remanded, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>300, 113 A.3d 734 (2015), we found it unnecessary for us to determine the retroactivity issue. <em>Jones, supra, </em>437 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 77-78, 96 A.3d 297. We reviewed the United. States Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>analysis in <em>McNeely </em>and discussion of its holding in <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>757, 771-72, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1826, 1836, 16 L.Ed.2d 908, 920 (1966) and concluded \u201cthe application of <em>McNeely </em>to the facts of this case\u201d did not warrant the suppression of the blood test results. <em>Jones, supra, </em>437 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 75-78, 96 A.3d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We found McNeely\u2019s discussion of the proper weight to be given to dissipation of alcohol instructive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">[T]he Supreme Court accepted as \u201ctrue\u201d the immutable fact that the alcohol level in one\u2019s bloodstream begins to dissipate from the time \u201cthe alcohol is fully absorbed and continues to decline until the alcohol is eliminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1560, 185 <em>L.Ed2d </em>at 706. It is through this lens that the Supreme Court assessed the totality of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">... The Court emphasized this point stating,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">This fact was <em>essential </em>to our holding in <em>Schmerber, </em>as we recognized that, under the circumstances, <em>further delay </em>in order to secure a warrant <em>after the time spent investigating the scene of the accident and transporting the injured suspect to the hospital </em>to receive treatment <em>would have threatened </em>the destruction of evidence. [Id. at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1561, 185 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 707 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\"><em>[Id </em>at 78-79, 96 A.3d 297.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">We further reviewed McNeely\u2019s description of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-15\">the special facts considered in the <em>Schmerber </em>Court\u2019s analysis which, the <em>[McNeely] </em>Court agreed, were sufficient to support a warrantless blood test:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-17\">[T]he petitioner had suffered injuries in an automobile accident and was taken to the hospital. While he was there receiving treatment, a police officer arrested the petitioner for driving while under the influence of alcohol and ordered a blood test over his objection____[W]e concluded that the warrantless blood test \u201cin the present ease\u201d was nonetheless permissible because the officer \u201cmight reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threatened \u2018the destruction of evidence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-20\">In support of that conclusion, we observed that evidence could have been lost because \u201cthe percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops, as the body functions to eliminate it from the system.\u201d We added that \u201c[p]articularly in a case such as this, where time had to be taken to bring the accused to a hospital and to investigate the scene of the accident, there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant.\u201d \u201cGiven these special facts,\u201d we found that it was appropriate for the police to act without a warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-21\">[Id. at 80, 96 A.3d 297 (quoting <em>McNeely, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1559-60, 185 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 705-06) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">We described the \u201csalient points\u201d to be applied to our analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>[T]he dissipation of blood alcohol continues to be an \u201cessential\u201d factor in analyzing the totality of the circumstances; that time spent investigating an accident and transporting an injured suspect to the hospital causes delay; that obtaining a warrant will result in further delay; and that such additional delay will \u201cthreaten\u201d the destruction of evidence. The Supreme Court did not require the State to show that the \u201cfurther delay\u201d would substantially impair the probative value of a blood sample drawn after a warrant was obtained or that it was impossible to obtain a warrant before the evidence was dissipated. In short, the Court did not require proof that evidence would be destroyed; it was sufficient to show that delays \u201cthreatened\u201d its destruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 79, 96 A.3d 297.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">[T]he \u201cspecial facts\u201d that supported a warrantless blood sample in <em>Schmerber </em>and were absent in <em>McNeely, </em>were present in this case: an accident, injuries requiring hospitalization, and an hours-long police investigation. Therefore, it was not necessary for the officers to shoulder the further delay entailed in securing a warrant that would have threatened the destruction of the blood alcohol evidence. Defendant\u2019s suppression motion should have been denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\"><em>[Id </em>at 81, 96 A.3d 297.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Thereafter, our Supreme Court reversed the Appellate Division decision in <em>Adkins, supra, </em>and held that the <em>McNeely </em>totality of the circumstances analysis would be given pipeline retroactivity to all blood draws from suspected drunk drivers. <em>State v. Adkins, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>300, 317, 113 A.3d 734, 744 (2015). The Court held further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">[L]aw enforcement should be permitted on remand in these pipeline cases to present to the court their basis for believing that exigency was present in the facts surrounding the evidence\u2019s potential dissipation and police response under the circumstances to the events involved in the arrest. Further, the exigency in these circumstances should be assessed in a manner that permits the court to ascribe substantial weight to the perceived dissipation that an officer reasonably faced. Reasonableness of officers must be assessed in light of the existence of the <em>McNeely </em>opinion. But, in reexamining pipeline cases when police may have believed that they did not have to evaluate whether a warrant could be obtained, based on prior guidance from our Court that did not dwell on such an obligation, we direct reviewing courts to focus on the objective exigency of the circumstances that the officer faced in the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\"><em>[Id </em>at 317, 113 A.3d at 744.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">In the interim, defendant filed a motion in the Supreme Court for leave to appeal from our decision as within time. Following its decision in <em>Adkins, </em>the Court summarily remanded this appeal to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Adkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>We have reviewed the facts of this case in light of <em>Adkins </em>to determine whether the situation faced by the officer presented an \u201cobjective exigency.\u201d As we noted in our earlier opinion, this was not a routine motor vehicle stop. The exigency of the circumstances did not depend solely upon the fact that alcohol dissipates in the blood. Defendant drove her vehicle into a car stopped at a traffic light, propelling it into a third car in front of it at approximately 7:00 p.m. at a busy intersection. <em>Jones, supra, </em>437 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 71, 96 A.3d 297. Eleven police officers, at least two Emergency Medical Service (EMS) vehicles and four EMS personnel, two fire trucks and an unknown number of firefighters responded to the accident scene. <em>Ibid. </em>Defendant was in her vehicle unconscious and bleeding. <em>Ibid. </em>It took approximately one-half hour to extricate her from her heavily damaged ear. <em>Ibid. </em>Both defendant and an occupant from one of the other vehicles, who was injured in the accident, were taken to the hospital for treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 96 A.3d 297. Defendant did not regain consciousness until she was at the hospital. <em>Ibid. </em>The investigation at the accident scene took several hours. <em>Ibid. </em>The damage caused to a nearby building struck by defendant after hitting the vehicle raised \u25a0 a concern that the building might collapse. <em>Id. </em>at 71, 96 A.3d 297. The blood sample from defendant was drawn by a nurse approximately one hour and fifteen minutes after police responded to the accident scene and, upon testing, had a blood alcohol content of 0.345. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 96 A.3d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Viewing the circumstances here objectively, we are satisfied the officer \u201cmight reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threatened \u2018the destruction of evidence[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Sehmerber, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 770, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1835, 16 L.Ed.2d at 919-20 (citation omitted). Under the totality of the circumstances analysis required by <em>Adkins, </em>we find no reason to disturb our prior decision reversing the order that suppressed the results of the blood sample analysis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
