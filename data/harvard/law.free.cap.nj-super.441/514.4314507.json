Plaintiffs Timber Glen Phase III, LLC and JSM at Timber Glen, LLC appeal from the summary judgment dismissal of their complaint in lieu of prerogative writs that challenged an ordinance adopted by defendant Township of Hamilton, assessing an annual licensing fee on residential apartment units.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs attack the trial judge\u2019s legal interpretation of the Licensing Act as enabling defendant\u2019s action and, alternatively, argue the amount of the licensing fee imposed by defendant\u2019s ordinance was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. Several amici appeared and presented arguments favoring or opposing the authorization to exercise municipal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Following our consideration of the arguments presented, viewing the evidential materials in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, <em>Davis v. Brickman Landscaping, Ltd., </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>395, 406, 98 A.3d 1173 (2014), we conclude the ordinance falls outside the authority granted to municipal governments under the Licensing Act. We reverse the grant of summary judgment to defendant as the licensing ordinance is ultra vires and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The facts are not disputed. Plaintiffs are incorporated in New Jersey and own apartment buildings in Mays Landing. In total, the buildings contain 498 units, leased for residential purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Defendant adopted Ordinance No. 1708-2011 in response to the findings of its Strategic Planning Smart Growth Committee (SMART), whose task included issuing recommendations to improve the quality of life and address safety issues in the township\u2019s residential properties. SMART proposed defendant adopt an ordinance requiring annual licensing for all residential properties, specifically designed to \u201cprotect ... tenants [and] ... landlords who may not have been aware of some of the activities taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>place at the[ir] rental properties.\u201d SMART expressed a goal to place landlords on notice of safety and habitability issues requiring attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The ordinance, entitled \u201cAN ORDINANCE OF THE TOWNSHIP OF HAMILTON, COUNTY OF ATLANTIC, REQUIRING RESIDENTIAL RENTAL UNIT LICENSES, TENANT OCCUPANCY PERMITS AND PERIODIC HABITABILITY INSPECTIONS AND RE-INSPECTIONS,\u201d mandated, among other things, the registration and licensing of apartment units starting January 1, 2012. The ordinance provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">222-3. Residential Rental Unit License Required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">Effective upon adoption of this Ordinance no person shall occupy any Residential Rental Unit nor shall the owner permit the occupancy of any[ ] residential rental unit within the Township of Hamilton if said unit has not been Licensed by the Bureau of Fire Prevention on forms which shall be provided for that purpose. Any owner permitting the occupancy of a Residential Rental Unit without said License 90 days after the Adoption of this ordinance shall be in violation of this ordinance, and each and every day thereafter shall be deem[ed] a separate offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">A \u201cResidential Rental Unit\u201d was defined in 222-1 as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">Any dwelling ... which the owner rents or leases to any third party for the purposes of that third party or parties to reside in the premises for a period in excess of thirty days regardless of the term of any written or verbal lease____Any room or rooms, suite or a part thereof, whether furnished or unfurnished, which is occupied or intended, arranged or designed to be occupied for sleeping or dwelling purposes____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">Other provisions set forth in the ordinance required disclosure of names, addresses and phone numbers of all owners and mortgagees, designation of an Atlantic County agent for owners not located in the county and other unit-specific information. The license was to be renewed and the $100 per unit fee paid annually. Failure to obtain or renew the license prohibited the owner from renting the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">Other sections of the ordinance addressed a tenant occupancy permit, which owners were required to obtain annually for a $25 fee per unit. Finally, provisions for annual habitability inspections, which included a fire inspection, were included with a separate fee of $125.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Plaintiffs filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs seeking a declaratory judgment invalidating the ordinance as unconstitutional, ordering repayment of all fees collected to date, awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs of suit and granting other relief not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Prior to filing its answer, defendant met with plaintiffs and others affected by the ordinance. Based upon concerns raised, defendant adopted an amendment under Ordinance No. 1727-2012, eliminating several original provisions, such as the tenant occupancy permit fee and some tenant registration requirements. A slightly reduced annual licensing fee was adopted<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the habitability inspection requirements were retained. The modifying ordinance also added a clause stating licensing fees were not intended as a source of municipal revenue, but rather all fees generated were designated for enforcement purposes. Defendant later adopted Ordinance No. 1752-2013, also amending the original ordinance by repealing the annual habitability inspection provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The Law Division reviewed the matter on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs argued the ordinance did not recite the enabling legislation granting defendant authority to license residential rentals, and argued it did not fall within a municipality\u2019s general police power. Further, plaintiffs asserted the Licensing Act did not allow defendant to license and regulate residential apartment buildings with leases of 175 days or more, as the clear intent of the statute was directed toward temporary or transient housing and short-term vacation rentals. Moreover, plaintiffs pointed out the regulatory ordinance did nothing more than impose another fee on apartment units, which were already regulated by the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Act (HMDA), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>55:13A-1 to -28, and local property maintenance and fire ordinances. Finally, plaintiffs asserted the ordinance burdened tenants by arbitrarily imposing the constantly changing annual fee, designed to shift municipal burdens onto landlords and tenants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Defendant challenged plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, stating the licensing ordinance was validly enacted under the regulatory legislative functions of the township and was implemented for a public purpose, that is, to aid tenants experiencing inappropriate housing conditions unabated by landlords. Defendant also cited the HMDA, which provides authority to license and inspect when a new tenancy commences. Defendant suggests the HMDA did not prohibit adoption of an ordinance for more frequent licensing, and as remedial legislation, it must be liberally construed to permit such ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The judge, in a memorandum decision accompanying the November 6, 2013 order, interpreted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:52-l(d) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12a as authorizing defendant to license rental properties. Accordingly, he granted summary judgment to defendant and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Our examination of this statutory interpretation challenge presents legal questions, warranting de novo review. <em>See Redd v. Bowman, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 187, 77 A.3d 1230 (App.Div.2013), <em>certif. granted, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>293, 88 A.3d 190 (2014). We \u201cowe no deference to the trial court ... if [we conclude it has] wrongly interpreted a statute.\u201d <em>Zabilowicz v. Kelsey, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>507, 512, 984 A.2d 872 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In construing the meaning of a statute, our task is well-defined: we must \u201cdetermine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent,\u201d examining the language used and statutory objectives to be achieved. <em>Redd, supra, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 187, 77 A.3d 1230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-1 (\u201cIn the construction of ... statutesf,] ... words and phrases shall be read and construed with their context, and shall, unless inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature[,] ... be given their generally accepted meaning, according to the approved usage of the language.\u201d). \u201c \u2018Construction of any statute necessarily begins with consideration of its plain language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mun. Council v. James, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>361, 370, 873 A.2d 544 (2005) (quoting <em>Merin v. Maglaki </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 434, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992)). We give plainly written statutes their \u201cordinary meaning, absent a legislative intent to the contrary,\u201d with the understanding the language must be construed \u201cin a fashion consistent with the statutory context in which it appears.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Shelton v. Restaurant.com, Inc., </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>419, 428-29, 70 A.3d 544 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">If our review finds the statutory provisions are ambiguous, we are free to examine extrinsic aids, such as legislative history, to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intended meaning. <em>Shelton, supra, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>at 429, 70 A.3d 544. In interpreting two seemingly conflicting sections of the same statute, we must read the provisions <em>in pari materia, </em>construing them \u201ctogether as a unitary and harmonious whole.\u201d <em>Am. Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. N.J. Div. of Taxation, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>65, 80, 912 A.2d 126 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cEvery reasonable construction should be applied\u201d to assure each section is meaningful. <em>Twp. of Mahwah v. Bergen Cnty. Bd. of Taxation, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>268, 281, 486 A.2d 818, <em>cert, denied, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1136, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2677, 86 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>696 (1985). Finally, we keep in mind \u201cevery word in a statute has meaning and is not mere surplusage.\u201d <em>Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Melcar Util. Co., </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>576, 587, 59 A.3d 561 (2013) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Guided by these rules, we examine defendant\u2019s position arguing the ordinance followed supportive enabling legislation, which authorized its imposition of licensing requirements for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>rental residential real estate, as well as plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to that asserted authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Defendant contends its licensing authority is grounded generally in a municipality\u2019s police power, and, more specifically, in subsection (d) of the Licensing Act. Defendant\u2019s view is supported by amicus New Jersey State League of Municipalities (League of Municipalities), which additionally cites the enforcement provision of the HMDA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>55:13A-21, suggesting licensure is compatible with the regulatory power over dwelling space upon termination of occupancy found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12m.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Plaintiffs disagree. Their primary challenge argues defendant may only regulate apartment rentals for terms less than 175 consecutive days, as allowed by subsection (n) of the Licensing Act, because regulation of residential rentals generally rests with the State under the HMDA, unless otherwise authorized. Amici New Jersey Builders Association, New Jersey Realtors, and New Jersey Apartment Association support plaintiffs\u2019 positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Initially, when reviewing a municipal action, we apply a presumption of validity and reasonableness to adopted ordinances. <em>Lake Valley </em>Assocs., <em>LLC v. Twp. of Pemberton, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 505, 987 A.2d 623 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>43, 994 A.2d 1039 (2010); <em>see also First Peoples Bank v. Twp. of Medford, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>413, 418, 599 A.2d 1248 (1991) (\u201c[A] reviewing court should presume the validity and reasonableness of a municipal ordinance.\u201d). We do not \u201cpass on the wisdom of the ordinance; that is exclusively a legislative function.\u201d <em>Pheasant Bridge Corp. v. Twp. of Warren, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>282, 290, 777 A.2d 334 (2001), <em>cert, denied, </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>1077, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>1959, 152 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1020 (2002). A party challenging an ordinance must demonstrate the ordinance, \u201cin whole or in application to any particular property,\u201d is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 289-90, 777 A.2d 334 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the \u201cpresumption of validity [cannot] be overcome unless the evidence clearly establishes its unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Twp. of Livingston v. Marchev, </em>85 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 432, 205 A.2d 65 (App.Div.1964) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>(citing <em>Vickers v. Twp. Comm. of Gloucester Twp., </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>232, 242, 181 A.2d 129 (1962)), <em>certif. denied, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>412, 209 A.2d 145 <em>appeal dismissed, </em>382 <em>U.S. </em>201, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>393, 15 L.Ed.2d 269 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The validity of local legislative action is based on the New Jersey State Constitution Article IV, section VII, paragraph 11, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">The provisions of this Constitution and of any law concerning municipal corporations formed for local government, or concerning counties, shall be liberally construed in them favor. The powers of counties and such municipal corporations shall include not only those granted in express terms but also those of necessary or fair implication, or incident to the powers expressly conferred, or essential thereto, and not inconsistent with or prohibited by this Constitution or by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\"><em>See also Moyant v. Paramus, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>528, 534, 154 A.2d 9 (1959) (discussing presumptive validity of municipal ordinances). This \u201c[h]ome rule is basic in our government\u201d and \u201cembodies the principle that the police power of the State may be invested in local government to enable local government to discharge its role as an arm or agency of the State and to meet other needs of the community.\u201d <em>Inganamort v. Ft. Lee, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>521, 528, 303 A.2d 298 (1973). \u201cExpress powers as well as those that arise by fair implication are given broad latitude, so long as they are not wielded in contravention of the overarching statutory grant of authority or conflict otherwise with an express statutory limitation or prohibition.\u201d <em>Varsolona v. Breen Capital Servs. Corp., </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>605, 625, 853 A.2d 865 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The presumption of the validity of local legislative action, however, is constrained by the obvious understanding that \u201c[a] statute has supremacy over an ordinance,\u201d <em>In re Ordinance 01-75, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>446, 469, 931 A.2d 595 (2007), and \u201ca local municipality is but a creature of the State, capable of exercising only those powers granted to it by the Legislature____\u201d <em>Moyant, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 535, 154 A.2d 9. <em>See also Dome Realty, Inc. v. Paterson, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>212, 225, 416 A.2d 334 (1980) (\u201cMunicipalities, being created by the State, have no powers save those delegated to them by the Legislature and the State Constitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201cWhether the State alone should act or should leave the initiative and the solution to local government, rests in legislative discretion.\u201d <em>Inganamort, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 528, 803 A.2d 298. Thus, \u201cthe Legislature <em>may </em>invest in local government the police power to devise measures tailored to the local scene.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">When examining the municipal authority to regulate in the first instance, the Supreme Court in <em>Inganamort </em>instructed judicial review of an ordinance requires</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">three constituent questions: (1) does the State Constitution prohibit delegation to municipalities of the power ...; (2) if that power may be granted, has the Legislature done so; and (3) if the State statutes vesting police power in municipalities do embrace this area, is the exercise of that power by local government preempted or barred by reason of the existence of other statutes dealing with the subject matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 527, 303 A.2d 298.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The general grant defining a municipality\u2019s police power is found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">Any municipality may make, amend, repeal and enforce such other ordinances, regulations, rules and by-laws not contrary to the laws of this state or of the United States, as it may deem necessary and proper for the good government, order and protection of persons and property, and for the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare of the municipality and its inhabitants, and as may be necessary to carry into effect the powers and duties conferred and imposed by this subtitle, or by any law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>40:48-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">The Court has held this statute \u201cauthorizes a municipality to take such action as it deems necessary and proper for the purposes specified subject only to the limitation that such action not be prohibited by or inconsistent with the Constitution or the other statutes____\u201d <em>Moyant, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 542, 154 A.2d 9 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[^either the constitutional nor the statutory provision is a blanket authorization to pursue the governing body\u2019s particularized notion of the public good or to legislate beyond the bestowed powers, express or implied.\u201d <em>Repair Master, Inc. v. Borough of Pauls-boro, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 8, 799 A.2d 599 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>A municipality is also granted specific authority to regulate local \u201cbuildings and structures and their use and occupation to prevent and abate conditions therein harmful to the health and safety of the occupants of said buildings and structures and the general public in the municipality.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12a. Specific statutes address imposing registration requirements for residences containing two or more families, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12c, and regulating \u201cthe maintenance and condition of any unit of dwelling space, upon termination of occupancy,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12m. These statutes do not authorize licensure of residential apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s and the League of Municipalities\u2019 arguments, the powers to <em>regulate </em>and to <em>license, </em>although related, are discrete. <em>See, e.g., Moyant, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 545, 154 A.2d 9 <em>(\u201cRegistration and licensing </em>are commonly accepted as such reasonable regulatory means____\u201d (emphasis added)). The Court addressed this distinction in <em>Nelson Cooney &amp; Sons v.

The rental of real property for a term less than 175 consecutive days for residential purposes by a person having a permanent place of residence elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUxc\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>40:52-1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">The Legislature\u2019s primary purpose in enacting the Licensing Act was to \u201cauthorize municipalities to license and regulate, as police measures for the public health, safety, morals or welfare, the local businesses described therein, and only incidentally to impose on the businesses thus licensed and regulated license fees for revenue which may, at least within reasonable limits, exceed the regulatory costs.\u201d <em>Salomon v. Jersey City, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>379, 390, 97 A.2d 405 (1953). Therefore, a municipality\u2019s exercised licensing authority \u201ccannot be an arbitrary exertion of th[at] power,\u201d <em>Ring v. N. Arlington, </em>136 <em>N.J.L. </em>494, 497, 56 A.2d 744 (Sup.Ct.), <em>affd o.b., </em>1 <em>N.J. </em>24, 61 A.2d 508 (1948), nor can the exercise be unreasonable, <em>Indep. Warehouses v. Scheele, </em>134 <em>N.J.L. </em>133, 136, 45 A.2d 703 (E. &amp; A.1946), <em>affd, </em>331 <em>U.S. </em>70, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>1062, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>1346 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>In this matter, the parties\u2019 primary positions interpreting the Licensing Act can be summed up as follows: defendant argues the broad language in subsection (d) encompasses any form of licen-sure of rental residences as apartments fall within \u201cfurnished and unfurnished rented housing or living units.\u201d Plaintiffs, on the other hand, reject this sweeping interpretation, suggesting subsection (d) applies only to temporary residential uses, drawing support from subsection (n), which permits licensing authority over short-term residential rentals, not more permanent dwellings. Plaintiffs argue if authority to license residential real estate is included within subsection (d), subsection (n) is rendered superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">On its face, the statute appears to contain an ambiguity, as the provisions of subsection (d) (directed to \u201cfurnished and unfurnished <em>rented housing or living units </em>and all other places and buildings used for sleeping and lodging purposes, <em>and the occupancy </em>thereof\u2019) would appear to include the subject of subsection (n) (governing <em>\u201c[t]he rental of real property for a term less than 175 consecutive days for residential purposes </em>by a person having a permanent place of residence elsewhere\u201d) <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:52-l(d), (n) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u201cApplying traditional principles of statutory construction, we look to the legislative history to aid in determining the legislative intent of a statute whose plain language is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv. Gen. Servs. Co. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>90, 94, 103 A.3d 260 (2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492-93, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005) (\u201c[I]f there is ambiguity in the statutory language that leads to more than one plausible interpretation, we may turn to extrinsic evidence, \u2018including legislative history, committee reports, and contemporaneous construction.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Cherry Hill Manor Assocs. v. Faugno, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>64, 75, 861 A.2d 123 (2004))).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Subsection (d) as originally adopted provided municipal licensing of \u201c[hjotels, boarding houses, lodging and rooming houses, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>all other places and buildings used for sleeping and lodging purposes, restaurants and all other eating places, and the keepers <em>thereof----\u201d L. </em>1941, c. 92. Thereafter the statute was amended, largely in response to judicial interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">By 1948, \u201ctrailer camps and camp sites\u201d were added. <em>L. </em>1948, c. 425. <em>See Edwards v.

In <em>Boulevard Apartments, Inc. v. Hasbrouck Heights, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189, 206 A.2d 372 (Law Div.1965), <em>affd o.b., </em>90 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 217 A.2d 139 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>239, 220 A.2d 112 (1966), the Law Division held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">We do not consider an apartment house to be in the same general or specific class as a hotel, boarding house, lodging or rooming house. These are commercial businesses requiring regulation for the safety, health and morals of the community. An apartment house, where unfurnished apartments are rented for a term, without overnight or transient business, is in the same category as a private or two- or three-family residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">We are cognizant that the statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:52-l(d), contains the words \u201call other places and buildings used for sleeping and lodging purposes.\u201d We do not consider apartment houses to be in that category.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 193-94, 206 A.2d 372.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">Thereafter, subsection (d) was amended to add \u201cmotels, furnished and unfurnished rented housing or living units ... and the occupancy thereof.\u201d <em>L. </em>1968, <em>c. </em>296.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">In 1998, subsections (m), relating to rental of commercial property, and (n), relating to residential rentals, were added. <em>L. </em>1997, c. 317. A legislative statement attached to the bill when introduced, adding this new subsection, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-15\">This bill would limit the authority of a municipality to license the rental of commercial and residential real property to leases of less than 125 days. Under current law, a municipality has the authority to regulate all leases. This bill would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>effectively limit that authority to seasonal leases, such as weekly rentals in shore municipalities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">[Ziid.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The proposal was altered by the Senate Community Affairs Committee, increasing 125 to 175 days. The amendment as adopted did not make changes to subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Since the 1998 amendment, few opportunities have been presented for judicial review of these statutory provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Importantly, none of those cases considered the issue now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Obligated as we are to \u201cseek an interpretation that will make the most consistent whole of the statute,\u201d <em>In re Registrant N.B., </em>222 <em>N.J. </em>87, 101, 117 A.3d 1196, 2015 <em>WL </em>4078555, at *7 (2015) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), we determine the bill statement accompanying the 1998 amendment serves as powerful evidence of the objectives and intentions of the Legislature with respect to licensing residential rentals. We conclude municipalities are not authorized to issue ordinances imposing licenses for apartment units which provide tenancies of 175 days or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Aligned with the maxim <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius,\u201d </em>which means the inclusion of one excludes the other, <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 495, 874 A.2d 1039, we understand the very specific addition of subsection (n), which limits licensure to residential rentals of \u201cless than 175 consecutive days,\u201d precludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>licensure of residential rentals for 175 days or more. Further, the Legislature\u2019s addition of this discrete provision, expressly limiting licenses to \u201crental of real property for a term less than 175 consecutive days for residential purposes by a person having a permanent place of residence elsewhere,\u201d must be considered purposeful and made while cognizant of subsection (d) because \u201c[a] legislative body in this State is presumed to be familiar ... with the statutory law of the State____\u201d <em>Yanow v. Seven Oaks Park, Inc., </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>341, 350, 94 A.2d 482 (1953). The bill\u2019s interpretative statement reinforces this view and reflects an explicit intent to limit municipal licensing authority \u201cto seasonal leases\u201d and, therefore, assures the full meaning of all statutory provisions. <em>See Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light, supra, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>at 587, 59 A.3d 561 (stating a court must assume legislative enactments do not use \u201cany unnecessary or meaningless language\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The trial judge did not mention the language or impact of subsection (n) when rendering his decision. However, we find this provision critical to the overall understanding of the scope of statutory authority. Reading the whole of the statute, we conclude the addition of a separate section directed to short-term or seasonal residential leases suggests temporal implications when considering the meaning of \u201cfurnished and unfurnished rental units\u201d described in subsection (d). This is especially true because the other arrangements mentioned in subsection (d) refer to short-term living (e.g., motels, hotels, boardinghouses, rooming houses and camp sites). Reading these two provisions in this way reconciles the Legislature\u2019s decision not to amend subsection (d) when adding subsection (n). <em>See Shelton, supra, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>at 440, 70 A.3d 544 (\u201cWords in a statute should not be read in isolation.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">We cannot agree with defendant and the League of Municipalities that subsection (n) merely provides another type of rental housing subject to licensure or was limited to rentals in resort communities. The interpretative statement to the 1998 amendment refutes these assertions. Were defendant\u2019s view correct, a clarifl-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>cation in (d) would have been sufficient. Instead, we conclude the addition of (n) was designed and significant as it reflects a specific intent to limit licensing of residential rentals, which were viewed differently from the living arrangements listed in subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">As we stated above, licensing is a distinct function authorized by <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:52-1. We conclude the Legislature chose to limit municipal licensing authority to short-term lease arrangements. If that interpretation is incorrect, the Legislature will act to provide further clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Therefore, defendant may not mandate by ordinance licensure of residential rentals for 175 days or more, accompanied by an annual licensing fee. The ordinance mandating this licensure is invalid as ultra vires and unenforceable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We choose not to address plaintiffs\u2019 alternative argument, as we conclude it is moot. <em>Comando v. Nugiel, </em>436 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 219, 93 A.3d 377 (App.Div.2014) (declining discussion of issue when controversy is concluded).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">We vacate the summary judgment dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and reverse the order upholding defendant\u2019s licensing ordinance. We remand this matter to the Law Division for further proceedings as necessitated by our opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\"> The $100 fee was reduced to $85. In a subsequent ordinance, the fee was altered to \"an amount established by the Township Committee through Resolution annually as to the cost of licenses during that calendar year.\" At the time the matter was heard, the fee was $65 per unit per year, which would be an annual expense to plaintiffs of $32,370.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\"> Plaintiffs raised additional issues before the Law Division, including constitutional challenges and a demand for attorney's fees under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983; however, they chose not to pursue these issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\"> In <em>Lake Valley, </em>a municipal ordinance imposing licensing and inspection requirements upon a change in tenancy of residential rentals was upheld upon a finding the State did not preempt the area by enacting the HMDA. <em>Lake Valley, supra, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 505-07, 987 A.2d 623. Licensing authority was not examined. <em>See ibid. </em>Similarly, in <em>Repair Master, </em>this court struck down an ordinance regulating the nature of occupancy of rental property; however, the issue of licensing authority was neither challenged nor reviewed. <em>Repair Master, supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 14, 799 A.2d 599. Finally, in <em>United Property Owners Association of Belmar v.
