State, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>494, 107 A.3d 1250 (2015). Previously, we considered the summary judgment dismissal of plaintiff Brian Dunkley\u2019s complaint against his employer, defendant S. Coraluzzo Petroleum Transporters. Plaintiffs complaint alleged violations of the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49 (LAD). <em>Dunkley v. S. Coraluzzo Petroleum Transporters, </em>437 <em>N.J.Super. </em>866, 370-73, 98 A.3d 1202 (2014), <em>remanded, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>217, 110 A.3d 929 (2015). Plaintiff claimed he was the victim of racial discrimination by Richard Harrington, an employee assigned to train him. <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff also \u201cinsisted he endured negative consequences after reporting Harrington\u2019s conduct,\u201d which he maintained ultimately led to his resignation. <em>Id. </em>at 372, 98 A.3d 1202. Plaintiff asserted defendant was liable under the LAD for negligence and was vicariously liable by allowing \u201cconduct amounting to a hostile work environment ..., which caused his constructive discharge\u201d because Harrington was his supervisor. <em>Id. </em>at 373, 98 A.3d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">We affirmed the summary judgment dismissal of plaintiffs complaint, determining defendant was not liable because once plaintiff informed his supervisors he was experiencing racial dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>crimination, they immediately took action in accordance with defendant\u2019s \u201cproperly defined\u201d anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies, to \u201cprotect plaintiff from further discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 98 A3d 1202. \u201c[T]he harm was remedied immediately and effectively!;,]\u201d as plaintiff admitted he experienced no further discriminatory interactions or harassment. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 98 A.3d 1202. As to plaintiffs assertions of \u201cperceived ostracism by coworkers,\u201d we concluded such allegations were insufficient to support claims for constructive discharge or hostile work environment under the LAD. <em>Id. </em>at 382-83, 98 A.3d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">On remand, the Court ordered we address, \u201cat a minimum,\u201d two specific issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">(1) [W]hether there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to plaintiffs direct claim for negligence under the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-1 to -49; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">(2) [W]hether there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to plaintiffs claim for vicarious liability for the actions of a supervisor under the LAD based on a hostile work environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"av-dedup-0\"><em>[Dunkley v. S. Coraluzzo Petroleum Transporters, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>217, 110 A.3d 929 (2015).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">We permitted limited briefing and conducted a telephonic argument on these issues. In light of the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Aguas, </em>plaintiff maintains summary judgment must be vacated and the matter remanded to the trial court for review of the materially disputed facts surrounding whether defendant adequately acted to prevent discrimination, and also to determine whether Harrington was his supervisor at the time he made the racially-charged remarks. Defendant disagrees and asserts plaintiffs proofs fail to sustain a claim for either defendant\u2019s direct negligence or vicarious liability because its policies were published and properly implemented to terminate the offending conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">We have considered plaintiffs arguments under the Court\u2019s guidance set forth in <em>Aguas </em>and conclude plaintiff has presented no factual support showing defendant\u2019s conduct was negligent or that it ignored its affirmative duty to prevent discrimination. Defendant adopted well-defined policies to prevent discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>in its workplace, trained its employees, and, when informed of harassing discriminatory behavior, implemented procedures to curb the conduct. Further, we reject plaintiff\u2019s assertions of vicarious liability for alleged supervisory harassment. The facts show defendant enforced its anti-harassment policy and plaintiff suffered \u201cno employment action.\u201d <em>Aguas, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>at 523-24, 107 A.3d 1250. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Our review begins with a discussion of the Court\u2019s recent decision. In <em>Aguas, </em>the plaintiff asserted two LAD claims against her employer, the State of New Jersey, alleging her supervisors subjected her to sexual harassment in the workplace, creating a hostile work environment. <em>Aguas, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>at 505, 107 A.3d 1250. These claims included a direct claim for negligence and a claim for vicarious liability. <em>Id. </em>at 506, 107 A.3d 1250. The plaintiff had verbally reported her allegations to supervisors, but never filed a written complaint pursuant to the State\u2019s written anti-harassment policy, a copy of which the plaintiff admits she received. <em>Id. </em>at 504, 107 A.3d 1250. The trial court found the plaintiff presented a prima facie hostile work environment claim, but granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, because the State established an affirmative defense by showing an effective anti-harassment policy was in place. <em>Id. </em>at 506, 107 A.3d 1250. The policy delineated a reporting procedure through the State\u2019s Equal Employment Division, which plaintiff failed to follow. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">On certification to the Supreme Court, the plaintiff argued the affirmative defense was unavailable in cases of sexual harassment by a supervisor, under the LAD. <em>Id. </em>at 507, 107 A.3d 1250. The Supreme Court examined the plaintiffs vicarious liability sexual harassment claim and the defendant\u2019s asserted defenses to the alleged liability. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 107 A.3d 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Initially adopted in <em>Lehmann v. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 592, 626 A.2d 445 (1993), the Court recognized employer liability is exclusively governed by principles of agency. <em>Aguas, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>at 511, 107 A.3d 1250. An employer is liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>torts committed by an employee \u201cwhile acting in the scope of their employment,\u201d as well as those committed by employees, even when acting outside the scope of their employment, if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">(a) the [employer] intended the conduct or the consequences, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">(b) the [employer] was negligent or reckless, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">(c) the conduct violated a non-delegable duty of the [employer], or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">(d) the [employee] purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 511, 107 A.3d 1250 (quoting <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-11\"><em>See also Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">The Court observed \u201ctwo primary categories of claims\u201d arise from the alleged sexual harassment of employees: \u201ca direct cause of action against the employer for negligence or recklessness under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b) ... [and] vicarious liability under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).\u201d <em>Aguas, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>at 512, 107 A.3d 1250. \u201c[0]ften discussed in tandem,\u201d the Court distinguished the two types of claims as \u201canalytically distinct from and independent of one another\u201d and, therefore, each clam \u201cmust be addressed separately.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">Addressing the plaintiffs claim for the direct action of negligence or recklessness, the Court noted a plaintiff must prove an employer \u201cfailed to exercise due care with respect to sexual harassment in the workplace, that its breach of the duty of care caused the plaintiffs harm, and that [he or] she sustained damages.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In defense to allegations of an employer\u2019s direct liability for negligently creating a sexually harassing hostile work environment, the Court recognized \u201can employer\u2019s implementation and enforcement of an effective anti-harassment policy,\u201d as \u201ca critical factor in determining negligence and recklessness claims under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 499, 107 A.3d 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Next, the Court addressed the plaintiffs claim for vicarious liability, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">[A]n employee may assert that the employer is vicariously liable for sexual harassment committed by its employee because the sexual harasser purported to act on the employer\u2019s behalf and \u201cthere was reliance upon [his or her] apparent authority,\u201d or because the harasser \u201cwas aided in [his or her misconduct] by the existence of an agency relationship]\u201d with his or her employer, alleging them. <em>[Id. </em>at 514, 107 A.3d 1250 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Although <em>Lehmann </em>and its progeny never expressly \u201caddress[ed] the analytical framework under which an employer\u2019s anti-harassment policy may be considered in a hostile work environment harassment claim involving a supervisor,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the Court noted \u201cthat [same] jurisprudence strongly supports the availability of an affirmative defense, based on the employer\u2019s creation and enforcement of an effective policy against sexual harassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 515-17, 107 A.3d 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The Court adopted what is known as the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>test for defending claims alleging vicarious liability for supervisory harassment under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b), thus allowing employers to plead, as an affirmative defense, the adoption and enforcement of an effective policy against sexual harassment, so long as the employee suffered no tangible employment action. <em>Id. </em>at 523-24, 107 A.3d 1250 (citing <em>Burlington Indus. v. Ellerth, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>742, 765, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>2257, 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d 633, 655 (1998) and <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>775, 807-08, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>2275, 2292-93, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>662, 689 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">We now turn to our examination of plaintiffs complaint. In count one, he asserted a violation of the LAD, alleging defendant \u201cfailed to take action\u201d when informed of the \u201crepeated discriminatory racial remarks\u201d made by Harrington, claiming \u201c[d]espite the complaint made by [p]laintiff, [defendant] either took no action to correct or prevent the racial discrimination and harassment in the workplace or took steps which were not reasonably calculated to end the harassment.\u201d Count two alleged defendant \u201cfailed to remediate a course of conduct constituting racial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>harassment, discriminatory intimidation, ridicule[,] and insult of a racial nature, pervasive hostility,\u201d creating a \u201chostile and offensive work environment that intimidated, frightened[,] and offended [p]laintiff,\u201d as an African-American. Plaintiff also maintained defendant \u201cdelegated the authority to control the work environment to employees and agents who failed to remediate any claims of racial discrimination or hostility in the work environment,\u201d causing his constructive discharge, as set forth in count three.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">During oral argument, plaintiff insisted defendant was negligent in enforcing its anti-discrimination policy because it did not discipline or fire Harrington and management employees admitted a lack of knowledge of procedural aspects of the policy directed to prevent racial and other discrimination. Further, plaintiff asserted defendant was vicariously liable for Harrington\u2019s racially harassing conduct as he held defendant\u2019s apparent authority while serving as plaintiffs supervisor during the two-week training period.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><em>Aguas </em>provides a framework for analyzing claims and defenses offered regarding sexual harassment hostile work environment claims. With respect to direct claims for negligence or recklessness, the Court\u2019s discussion, anchored in <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b), applies generally to employer liability for the torts of employees, for any type of discrimination. <em>See id. </em>at 499, 107 A.3d 1250 (\u201c[A]n employer\u2019s implementation and enforcement of an effective anti-harassment policy, or its failure to maintain such a policy, is a critical factor in determining negligence and recklessness claims under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b).\u201d). We also conclude the Court\u2019s analysis of an employer\u2019s vicarious liability is not limited solely to sexual harassment LAD claims. Rather, the principles can be tailored and adopted to address allegations of other discriminatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">To prevail on a direct claim alleging defendant\u2019s negligence, plaintiff bears the burden to show a defendant negligently created a discriminatory work environment by failing to exercise due care with respect to racial discrimination in the workplace, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>breaching the duty of due care, which caused plaintiff harm. <em>See id. </em>at 512, 107 A.3d 1250. To defend against such a claim as discussed in <em>Aguas, </em>defendant may prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">[T]he existence of: (1) formal policies prohibiting harassment in the workplace; (2) complaint structures for employees\u2019 use, both formal and informal in nature; (3) anti-harassment training, which must be mandatory for supervisors and managers, and must be available to all employees of the organization; (4) the existence of effective sensing or monitoring mechanisms to check the trustworthiness of the policies and complaint structures; and (5) an unequivocal commitment from the highest levels of the employer that harassment would not be tolerated, and demonstration of that policy commitment by consistent practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 513, 107 A.3d 1250 (quoting <em>Gaines v. Bellino, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>301, 313, 801 A.2d 322 (2002)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">An employer is not required to meet each and every one of these factors. Rather, it is a balance of facts and circumstances to determine whether the employer shows \u201cthe existence of effective preventative mechanisms,\u201d <em>Gaines, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 313, 801 A.2d 322, designed to comply with the LAD\u2019s defined purpose \u201cto root out the cancer of discrimination.\u201d <em>Cicchetti v. Morris Cnty. Sheriffs Office, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>563, 588, 947 A.2d 626 (2008). <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(a). Succinctly, \u201c\u2018the efficacy of an employer\u2019s remedial program is highly pertinent to an employer\u2019s defense\u2019 \u201d against liability under the LAD. <em>Aguas, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>at 513, 107 A.3d 1250 (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Gaines, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 314, 801 A.2d 322).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Although plaintiff concedes defendant had a formal anti-harassment policy in place, and acknowledges he received specific training on the policy with other employees, plaintiff argues defendant failed to sufficiently satisfy the remaining <em>Gaines </em>factors. He suggested management employees did not receive \u201ccivil rights\u201d training, there were no effective monitoring mechanisms \u201cto check the effectiveness of the policies and complaint structures,\u201d and his supervisor\u2019s conduct did not demonstrate \u201can unequivocal commitment\u201d that harassment would not be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">To support his argument, plaintiff isolates statements made in depositions by some of defendant\u2019s management employees. Plaintiff asserts this testimony creates a material dispute of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>regarding the effectiveness of the anti-harassment policy and defendant\u2019s commitment to combat racial discrimination, which must be assessed by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Plaintiff has chosen to edit the deposition transcripts by including only portions that purportedly contain statements he construes as favorable, depriving this court of full review of the context in which all statements were made. Nevertheless, we have examined each of the statements identified by plaintiff and viewed the evidence in a light most favorable to him. <em>Davis v. Brickman Landscaping, Ltd., </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>395, 406, 98 A.3d 1173 (2014). We conclude the record does not support plaintiffs claims of materially disputed facts regarding defendant\u2019s implementation and enforcement of its anti-harassment policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">First, management employees did state they received specific training that addressed discrimination. Elwood Sickler, plaintiffs direct supervisor, testified he, along with defendant\u2019s other managers, attended sensitivity training presented by an attorney, but was unsure of the exact date, stating he believed it was in 2010. He also received racial discrimination training in his prior position in the United States Marine Corps. Sickler mistakenly thought the Human Resources Department (HR), which was principally charged with responding to discrimination complaints, was not in place until sometime in 2011, but also maintained terminal managers were supervising drivers, such as plaintiff. The record actually proves defendant\u2019s HR manager was hired in October 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Second, the record includes the employee handbook. One section entitled \u201cPolicy Prohibiting Harassment <em>&amp; </em>Discrimination\u201d specifically instructs: \u201cAny employee who has a complaint regarding harassment or discrimination must report the matter to their manager. If that person is not available, or if you believe it would be inappropriate to contact that person, contact the Human Resources Department.\u201d The handbook contains a list of telephone numbers, including that of HR.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Third, plaintiff never made a complaint to his supervisor or the HR manager, as instructed by the written policy in the handbook. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Harrington\u2019s discriminatory conduct came to light only because Sickler noticed plaintiff failed to report for work, called him directly, and arranged for plaintiff to explain what was happening. The next day, Sickler, accompanied by Thomas Sprague, defendant\u2019s safety coordinator, and Steve Cohen, defendant\u2019s regional safety manager, met with plaintiff to review and address his concerns. <em>Dunkley, supra, </em>437 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 372, 98 A.3d 1202. At that meeting, for the first time, managerial employees learned of plaintiffs experiences and his expressed concerns Harrington was \u201ca racist.\u201d Prior to the meeting, Sickler had not received complaints regarding Harrington or other employees charging them with racially-biased behavior. Sickler made it clear defendant\u2019s policy was \u201cthere is no race____We are all employees.\u201d He arranged for plaintiffs training to be guided by another employee, discussed the situation with Sprague, and also met with Harrington.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Finally, the record contains plaintiffs acknowledgement he had no difficulty with his new trainer and, in fact the two \u201cgot along great.\u201d Further, plaintiff never saw Harrington again; did not experience any further raeially-discriminatory conduct; and was not again exposed to racial harassment. Despite these facts, plaintiff criticized the extent of defendant\u2019s investigation, arguing notes should have been taken during his meeting with managers, other individuals should have been interviewed, and Harrington should have been fired. Plaintiff also recounted the work atmosphere following the meeting and his placement with a new trainer, saying things were \u201cdifferent.\u201d He stated other employees \u201cwould shy away\u201d and \u201cnobody would even talk to [him],\u201d making him feel \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and preventing him from \u201cgetting a fresh start.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Granting all reasonable inferences to plaintiffs evidence, we reject the suggestion <em>Gaines, </em>as adopted by <em>Aguas, </em>requires the jury to assess the degree of effectiveness of defendant\u2019s response to plaintiffs complaints when the discriminatory conduct admittedly was addressed and rectified. <em>Aguas </em>emphasized the LAD does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>not impose \u201cstrict liability.\u201d <em>Aguas, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>at 510-11, 107 A.3d 1250. We also disagree the jury may assess or even consider whether an employer\u2019s decision not to terminate an offending employee denotes the discrimination policy as ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Here, the facts support the <em>Gaines </em>factors. Defendant proved it adopted a formal policy prohibiting workplace harassment and discrimination. Formal training was conducted, as evinced by the deposition testimony of plaintiff, as well as Sickler. Viewing the events that transpired here, we determine defendant\u2019s commitment to prohibit discrimination was not mere lip service. Defendant\u2019s managers were proactive: they initiated contact with plaintiff before he uttered a complaint, and thereafter swiftly responded by investigating his complaints and implementing procedures to assure plaintiff no longer experienced discriminatory treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Moreover, defendant\u2019s anti-harassment policy included elements of both formal and informal procedures to receive and address complaints. <em>See Gaines, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 313, 801 A.2d 322. Aggrieved employees were instructed to report untoward conduct to either \u201ctheir manager\u201d or, if necessary, HR personnel. Importantly, management initiated contact with plaintiff and scheduled a meeting; defendant\u2019s formal complaint mechanism was not engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We concede the record is sparse as to whether monitoring mechanisms were in existence to check the \u201ceffectiveness of the policies and complaint structures.\u201d In part, this resulted because plaintiff did not initiate a complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, once managers were made aware of the situation, they took action pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>defendant\u2019s anti-harassment policy and plaintiff was no longer victimized.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">As to whether plaintiff demonstrated a constructive discharge, his testimony pointed to no tangible action showing retaliatory acts by defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, he generally related his sense people were less interactive and more distant with him. We repeat our originally expressed comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">We also conclude plaintiffs perceived ostracism by co-workers fails to support his claim of hostile work environment. <em>See Cokus v.

No prior instances of racial slurs or harassment were known and when plaintiffs complaint surfaced, it was immediately addressed. \u201cMore important, plaintiffs own report [was] he did not experience any further discriminatory harassment and suffered no change in his position, duties or compensation....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 98 A.3d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">We decline plaintiffs invitation to allow a jury to evaluate its view of whether defendant\u2019s policy could be more effective or to assess defendant\u2019s decision not to fire the offending employee. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>is neither the role of the jury nor the work of courts to intrude so deeply into an employer\u2019s operational decisions. Plaintiff never saw Harrington again, which might suggest he was transferred to a different site. Plaintiffs own words demonstrate defendant\u2019s policy, as implemented, worked and he completed his training without encountering further derogatory or discriminatory treatment. The legislative objective of the LAD is to assure a commitment to end discrimination in the workplace. <em>See Fuchilla v. Layman, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>319, 334, 537 A.2d 652 (1988). The facts here show that was accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Taken as a whole, this record reflects defendant did not breach its duty or ignore the serious legal responsibilities it owes its employees to eradicate racial discrimination in its workplace. We conclude plaintiff has not identified factual support to show the elements of a negligence action against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Next, we examine the record as to whether the facts presented suggest defendant is vicariously hable for a supervisor\u2019s harassment. In <em>Aguas, </em>the Court identified four questions a plaintiff must affirmatively demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">1. Did the employer delegate the authority to the supervisor to control the situation of which the plaintiff complains ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">2. Did the supervisor exercise that authority?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">3. Did the exercise of authority result in a violation of [the LAD]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">4. Did the authority delegated by the employer to the supervisor aid the supervisor in injuring the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\"><em>[Aguas, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 107 A.3d 1250 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 620, 626 A.2d 445).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-14\"><em>See also Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">In <em>Aguas, </em>the Court noted it never explicitly considered the impact of an employer\u2019s anti-harassment policy on a vicarious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>liability claim for supervisory sexual harassment, <em>Aguas, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 107 A.3d 1250, but New Jersey nonetheless has \u201cacknowledged the value of effective anti-harassment policies in combatting sexual harassment in the workplace, and recognized that employers will be motivated to implement and enforce such policies if their policies provide a defense to a claim of vicarious liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517, 107 A.3d 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The Court found support for this principle in federal law construing Title VII, which recognizes an employer defending such a sexual harassment claim may assert as an affirmative defense that the employer had an effective anti-harassment policy and the employee failed to take advantage of or comply with that policy. <em>Id. </em>at 521, 107 A.3d 1250 (citing <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 807, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292-93, 141 L.Ed.2d at 689 and <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 765, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655).

If no tangible employment action has been taken against the plaintiff, the defendant[-]employer may assert the two-pronged affirmative defense of <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher.[</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>To establish that defense, the defendant employer has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, both prongs of the affirmative defense: first, that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and to correct promptly sexually harassing behavior; and second, that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to otherwise avoid harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 524, 107 A.3d 1250.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The Court also addressed the definition of a \u201csupervisor,\u201d describing it as \u201ca pivotal factor in the application of the agency principles set forth in <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, 107 A.3d 1250.

As we noted in our earlier opinion, the record does not allow us to accept or reject that claim. Nevertheless, we do not need to decide that fact to apply the legal analysis adopted in <em>Aguas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Here, defendant took no tangible employment action against plaintiff. It is not disputed that plaintiff resigned voluntarily because he \u201cfelt uncomfortable,\u201d an assertion we have rejected as satisfying the proofs necessary to sustain a constructive discharge claim. Consequently, defendant may assert the two-pronged <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense, <em>see id. </em>at 524, 107 A.3d 1250, showing it acted in a reasonable and prompt manner to prevent or correct the harassing behavior and plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventative or corrective measures imple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>mented to avoid further harm. <em>See id. </em>at 521, 107 A.3d 1250 (quoting <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 807, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292-93, 141 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d at 689).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">As discussed above, plaintiff, despite training and the opportunity to formally register his complaint with his manager or HR, unreasonably failed to initiate corrective action. It was defendant who undertook responsibility to determine the reasons why plaintiff failed to return to work, then exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct harassing conduct by the prompt enforcement of its anti-discrimination policy.
