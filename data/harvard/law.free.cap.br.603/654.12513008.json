Cruickshank, the plaintiff and chapter 7 trustee of the bankruptcy estate of Blast Fitness Group, LLC (\"BFG\"), seeks damages and injunctive relief against over forty named and dozens of unnamed defendants, including Newfit, LLC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a Delaware limited liability company whose managers are defendants, Harold R. Dixon, who controlled BFG, and CapeCapital LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company. CapeCapital, in turn, was BFG's sole manager and was, itself, managed by Mr. Dixon. BFG filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on January 26, 2016, at which time its debts exceeded $ 16 million. This adversary proceeding was commenced two years after the petition date on January 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Newfit has moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), per Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012(b), to dismiss\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   count VI (turnover under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 542(b) ), count XVI (conspiracy), count XVII (aiding and abetting), count XIX (fraud), count XX (intentional interference with contractual advantage), count XXI (tortious interference with contractual advantage), count XXIII (substantive consolidation), count XXIV (successor liability), count XXV (alter ego/piercing the corporate veil), and count XXIX (attorneys' fees). Newfit does not seek dismissal of the remaining counts against it for constructive fraudulent transfer under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B) (count I), actual fraudulent transfer under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A) (count II), constructive fraudulent transfer under Massachusetts Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"MFTA\") \u00a7 5(a)(2) (count III), constructive fraudulent transfer under MFTA \u00a7 6(a) (count IV), actual fraudulent transfer under MFTA \u00a7 5(a)(1) (count V), turnover (count VII), unjust enrichment (count VIII), preferential transfer under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 547 and MFTA \u00a7 6(b) (count IX), statutory reach and apply under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 550 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20214%2C%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    Mass.

CapeCapital was the sole manager of BFG, and Mr. Dixon, in turn, was the sole manager and a member of CapeCapital. \u00b6 3. At its peak, BFG owned and operated over sixty fitness clubs bearing its name throughout the United States. (Intro., p. 2). At all relevant times, BFG acted at the direction of CapeCapital and Mr. Dixon. \u00b6 92. BFG owned, entirely or partially, seventeen subsidiaries through which it operated its business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6 53. Fitness clubs at different locations were often operated through separate BFG subsidiaries, and those subsidiaries were often the actual tenants under the applicable leases for the premises. \u00b6\u00b6 251, 256. At all times relevant to the claims and causes of action alleged in the complaint, BFG was insolvent and insufficiently capitalized. \u00b6\u00b6 310-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2011 and 2012, BFG, Mr. Dixon and Steven Borghi, Mr. Dixon's business partner and a member of BFG, were mired in a dispute with Elizabeth Beninati, the widow of Mr. Borghi's previous business partner in the discount fitness club business. \u00b6\u00b6 71, 73, 76-79. Mr. Dixon, Mr. Borghi and BFG hired Mr. Dixon's longtime personal lawyer at Goodwin, John LeClaire, who is a defendant in this action, to represent them in negotiations with Ms. Beninati in April 2011. \u00b6 80. Negotiations failed, and Ms. Beninati commenced a Massachusetts state court lawsuit against Mr. Dixon, Mr. Borghi and BFG on May 24, 2012, seeking millions of dollars in damages. \u00b6\u00b6 79, 376. Goodwin represented Mr. Dixon, BFG and Mr. Borghi in that litigation. \u00b6\u00b6 107, 376. In July 2014, the state court entered judgment against Messrs. Dixon and Borghi. \u00b6\u00b6 88, 315. Final judgment against them in excess of $ 4.5 million entered on January 9, 2015. \u00b6\u00b6 90, 317.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Lexfit and Newfit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In late 2012, while the Beninati litigation was pending, Mr. Dixon began transferring profitable BFG clubs to new entities in order to shield them from BFG's creditors such as Ms. Beninati. \u00b6\u00b6 82, 273, 308-309. Defendants Lexfit, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company, and Newfit, both managed by Mr. Dixon and/or CapeCapital, were two of these entities. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, 103, 273. Newfit was organized as a Delaware limited liability company after January 30, 2013 and before May of 2013. \u00b6\u00b6 180, 283.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Lexfit and Newfit Transactions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 6, 2012, Mr. Dixon, CapeCapital and another defendant transferred\n   sixteen of BFG's more profitable fitness clubs to Lexfit for no or nominal consideration. \u00b6\u00b6 274, 276. On January 30, 2013, Mr. Dixon, CapeCapital and another defendant transferred an additional eight of BFG's more profitable clubs to Newfit, which had not yet been created. \u00b6\u00b6 283-84, 289. BFG did not receive full consideration for these transfers. \u00b6 285. Also on January 30, 2013, Lexfit transferred eight of the clubs received from BFG in the December 2012 transaction to Newfit for less than full consideration. \u00b6\u00b6 289, 291, 293.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 31, 2013, BFG assigned to Newfit all of its right, title and interest in a management agreement under which BFG managed three fitness clubs in Mashpee, West Roxbury and Needham, Massachusetts, which were owned by non-BFG entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 350, 352. Under the management agreement, which BFG had the right to assign, BFG managed the three clubs in exchange for a management fee equal to 50% of gross revenue which was later increased to 75% with respect to the Mashpee and West Roxbury clubs. \u00b6\u00b6 350-354. The term of the management agreement ended in January 2018, and it provided for a $ 2 million fee payable to BFG if the club owners terminated the agreement. \u00b6 351. BFG transferred the rights to receive the clubs' gross revenues to Newfit in exchange for $ 10 while BFG retained the obligation to manage the clubs. \u00b6 355.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Newfit and BFG\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There was overlap between Newfit and BFG with respect to management, assets and operations. Both entities shared the same manager, CapeCapital, which, in turn, was managed by Mr. Dixon, who controlled BFG. Defendant Thomas Moran, who was BFG's Director of Finance, held the same position with Newfit. \u00b6 345. Newfit rented office space at the same Auburndale, Massachusetts location as BFG but paid a lower rent. \u00b6 358. Newfit was represented by BFG's general counsel, Peter Fenn,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   in several matters. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 325. Newfit is also represented in this action by the same counsel representing Mr. Dixon, CapeCapital, the Cape Real Estate Entities and other Dixon-related entities and family members. On a date not specified in the complaint, BFG transferred all of its intellectual property in the fitness operation to Newfit without consideration. \u00b6 329.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 18, 2013, Mr. LeClaire emailed Mr. Dixon about the creation of Newfit and related governance options, providing advice on how to \"protect you better against things like what Beninati is doing.\" \u00b6 301. In May 2013, after the creation of Newfit, Mr. LeClaire was aware that cash of the specific fitness clubs and Newfit was treated as \"fungible.\" \u00b6 180. Bank account records reflect multiple electronic transfers of funds between BFG and Newfit, demonstrating commingling of funds. \u00b6 348-49. Goodwin advised Messrs. Dixon and Moran, in the context of the Beninati litigation, to avoid any discussion of Newfit and to maintain that the transfer of profitable clubs to a separate entity had \"nothing to do\" with the Beninati litigation and shielding assets from creditors. \u00b6 180.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5. Landlords and Third Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   BFG could not pay its debts as they arose and it implemented a strategy, through Mr. Dixon and CapeCapital, of\n   shifting assets from one fitness club to another. \u00b6\u00b6 255, 312. A large number of BFG's creditors are landlords who leased space to wholly-owned entities of BFG. \u00b6 248. The landlords relied on guaranties from BFG, third party guarantors, or other obligors under the leases. \u00b6 249. BFG purchased fitness clubs from sellers, assumed the sellers' obligations under existing leases and often breached its obligations to remove the sellers as obligors under the leases. \u00b6\u00b6 250, 359. When a club was shut down, the subsidiary, which was the actual tenant under the lease, would stop making rent payments to the landlord. \u00b6 256. The landlord would sue the tenant, only to find that the assets of the tenant had been transferred to another subsidiary of BFG. \u00b6 257. Landlords, guarantors, and obligors then pursued fraudulent transfer, indemnification and other claims against BFG and others. \u00b6\u00b6 198, 232, 257, 359-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   From 2014 to 2016, BFG was involved in numerous lawsuits commenced by landlords and others for unpaid rents and other lease defaults. \u00b6\u00b6 186, 198-199, 231-33, 261. BFG could not satisfy its debts to landlords due to its insolvency. \u00b6 186. On an unspecified date, Mr. Dixon forwarded an email from another principal of BFG to Goodwin advising that \"I have gotten hammered today by many different vendors/contractors. I have threatening messages on my phone ....\" \u00b6 299.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     6. 2015 Newfit Transactions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the end of March 2015, Blast Fitness Acquisition, LLC, a BFG subsidiary and defendant in this action, transferred nine profitable health clubs worth between $ 7.6 (liquidation value) and $ 15.9 million (internal valuation based on a multiple of projected EBITDA) to Newfit in a cashless transaction, in exchange for which Newfit purported to retire $ 7 million of antecedent debt owed to it by Blast Acquisition. \u00b6 319. Mr. Fenn represented both BFG and Newfit in the transaction. \u00b6 212. The transfer was made to shield assets from creditors who had already begun to sue BFG. \u00b6 320.

The trustee has sufficiently supported his claims with specific allegations concerning Mr. Dixon's pervasive control over Newfit (and its control over BFG), which was managed by him and CapeCapital, of which he was the sole manager and a member. Further, the trustee has sufficiently alleged that Mr. Dixon formed and/or used Newfit and other entities to promote fraudulent transactions in a common enterprise which benefited him and his affiliates. Lastly, he has included numerous allegations regarding intermingling of business activity and assets among BFG and Newfit. Both entities shared the same manager, office space, counsel, and director of finance, and Newfit's assets such as profitable fitness clubs, intellectual property, and rights under the management agreement were all acquired from BFG and its subsidiaries. While mindful that veil piercing will be permitted in only rare situations, I find at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, with all reasonable inferences drawn in the trustee's favor, the allegations are sufficient to support a plausible claim for veil piercing and/or alter ego determination against Newfit and the numerous Dixon-controlled entities.
