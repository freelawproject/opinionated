Debtor filed an objection (the \"Objection\") and has also filed an adversary proceeding against the mortgage servicer and others for alleged violations of state and federal law arising from denials of her requests to modify her mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Motion and Objection present two novel issues: (1) Debtor's claim that, under the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\"), a mortgage servicer cannot seek stay relief to continue a state court foreclosure action if the debtor has submitted a non-bankruptcy loss mitigation request to it, and may not pursue stay relief until the loss mitigation process has concluded, including any applicable appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and (2) Debtor's claim that an alleged post-petition RESPA violation is a defense to a motion for stay relief. Debtor also asserts a more conventional defense that she can adequately protect the lender's interest, but to an undefined point in time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons herein, the Motion is granted and Debtor's Objection is overruled; the adversary proceeding will be separately addressed in due course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), (G) and 1334(b), and the\n   Standing Orders of Reference in effect in the Eastern District of New York dated August 28, 1986, and as amended on December 5, 2012, but made effective\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   as of June 23, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This decision constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Rules 7052 and 9014 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Foreclosure Action and Bankruptcy Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2006, Debtor and co-obligor Michael Kolnberger (\"Co-Debtor\") executed a note in favor of First Financial Equities, Inc. in the amount of $456,000, secured by a mortgage against real property located at 106 Park Hill Avenue, Massapequa, NY 11758 (the \"Loan\" and the \"Property\"). The Loan was modified in 2009, creating a new principal balance of $462,140.85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2015, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as trustee, on behalf of the holders of the Impac Secured Assets Corp., Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2006-4 (\"DBT\") commenced a foreclosure action against Debtor and Co-Debtor in Nassau County, New York, under Index Number 15-007128 (the \"Foreclosure Action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 11, 2018, DBT obtained a judgment of foreclosure and sale (the \"Judgment of Foreclosure\"). A foreclosure auction of the Property was scheduled for September 4, 2018; that sale was stayed by Debtor filing this bankruptcy case under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on August 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Marianne DeRosa was appointed the Chapter 13 Trustee (the \"Trustee\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In her bankruptcy petition and schedules, Debtor claims the Property as her residence, with an ascribed value of $475,000, secured by a mortgage in favor of Select Portfolio Servicing in the amount of $583,066.93. [dkt items 1, 4] Debtor identified the Foreclosure Action in her schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 31, 2018, Debtor filed her chapter 13 plan (the \"Plan\"), in which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , she proposes to request a loan modification of the Loan secured by the Property. Her Plan provides that her pre-petition mortgage arrears of $166,686 will be capitalized into the outstanding principal balance, resulting in a new principal balance of $583,066, to be paid at 4% interest over 40 years, resulting in a monthly mortgage payment of $3,456 per month, including interest and escrow payments of $1,020. [dkt item 6] The Plan has not been confirmed. DBT objected to confirmation of the Plan. [dkt items 15, 40]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 24, 2018, Select Portfolio Servicing Inc., as servicer for DBT (\"SPS\"; however, for purposes of this decision SPS will also be referred to as \"DBT\" unless the context requires otherwise) filed its Motion seeking stay relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) and/or (2) and relief from the co-debtor stay of \u00a7 1301(a) to continue the Foreclosure Action. [dkt item 23] The Motion alleges,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Loan balance has increased to $577,181.26, interest is accruing at 5.25% per year, that the Property had a value of $485,000 as of September 2018, and that Debtor has failed to make post-petition monthly mortgage payments of approximately $3,783.49 per month. DBT gave Debtor notice of a hearing set for January 31, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 22, 2019, Debtor filed her Objection. [dkt item 26] Debtor does not challenge the factual allegations concerning her defaults, the Loan balance, nor the Property value, nor does she claim that DBT lacks standing to seek stay relief. Rather, she states she submitted a loss mitigation package post-petition to SPS on November 9, 2018 (the \"Modification Request\"), which was denied by letter dated November 13, 2018; she lodged an appeal on November 29, 2018, which had not been resolved until December 27, 2018, which was three days after DBT's Motion was filed. Debtor asserts these alleged facts provide three bases to deny stay relief. First, she asserts that post-petition DBT violated RESPA, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201024.41\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), by failing to provide a specific basis for denying Debtor's Modification Request. Similarly, Debtor alleges DBT violated \u00a7 419.11(d) of title 3 of the New York Compilation of Codes, Rules, and Regulations for its failure to provide a detailed basis for denial of the Modification Request.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Comp.%20Codes%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20tit.%203%2C%20%C2%A7%20419.11\">\n    N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 3, \u00a7 419.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Debtor asserts that post-petition DBT violated RESPA's \"dual tracking\" prohibition, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201024.41\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), because the Motion was filed prior to the loss mitigation process, including any appeals, finally concluding. Finally, Debtor alleges she has or can provide adequate protection of DBT's interests, presumably under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 361, 362(d)(1) and has paid the Trustee monthly payments of $3,456.00 as called for under her Plan to adequately protect DBT's interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 25, 2019, DBT filed a response, arguing essentially that Debtor's defenses pursuant to RESPA should be precluded under the doctrines of\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , and collateral estoppel because the state court in the Foreclosure Action denied Debtor's similar arguments in connection with DBT's denial of loan modification requests submitted by Debtor prior to entry of the Judgment of Foreclosure. Additionally, DBT asserts that RESPA does not have any bearing on the determination of whether cause exists to lift the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(d)(1),(2), that Debtor's pre-petition arrears to DBT total $166,645.82 and that DBT is not adequately protected. [dkt item 28]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 28, 2019, Debtor filed an adversary proceeding against DBT, SPS, and Bank of America NA, seeking damages for alleged pre and post-petition RESPA and New York state law violations in connection with Debtor's various requests for loan modifications (the \"Adversary\"). [adv. pro. no. 19-8021; dkt item 1]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court held the hearing on the Motion on January 31, 2019. Part of the arguments concerned the allegations made in\n   the Adversary and the relief Debtor seeks there. Debtor acknowledged at the hearing that she has been denied a loan modification on various occasions, she has been in default on the Loan since 2014, and that she cannot confirm a chapter 13 plan unless DBT provides her with the loan modification substantially as she has proposed in her Plan. Pending this decision, the Court authorized the Trustee to disperse three months of payments to DBT, of $11,400 that Debtor had previously paid the Trustee as interim adequate protection. The Court set a post hearing briefing schedule allowing supplemental briefs on the stay relief issues to be filed by February 14, 2019 and scheduled an adjourned hearing for February 28, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 14, 2019, and corrected on February 15, 2019, Debtor filed a memorandum of law, in which she asserts that she has a right of setoff against DBT based on the alleged RESPA and state law violations being pursued in the Adversary, which she estimates to be worth $750,000. Debtor also asserts that DBT is violating a servicer participation agreement (\"SPA\") that SPS entered into with Federal National Mortgage Association, a federally chartered corporation, as financial agent of the United States (\"Fannie Mae\"), in which SPS agreed to participate in, among other things, the Home Affordable Modification Program (\"HAMP\"), which as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was intended to, among other things, make foreclosure prevention services available to the marketplace.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [dkt item 37] Debtor asserts that the SPA requires participating servicers to screen all loans that are in default or imminent danger of default for modification under the HAMP guidelines. Additionally, Debtor asserts that DBT is in violation of a certain pooling and servicing agreement, which requires DBT as trustee to service certain mortgage loans in compliance with Fannie Mae guidelines. Debtor asserts DBT is in violation of the Fannie Mae guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 14, 2019, DBT filed its supplemental memorandum of law, asserting that Debtor has failed to establish that an alleged violation of RESPA is a defense to a motion for relief from the automatic stay for cause. Additionally, DBT asserts that RESPA's prohibition of \"dual tracking\" does not prohibit a servicer from seeking stay relief because a motion for stay relief is not one of the expressly prohibited acts under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201024.41\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   DBT also asserts that Debtor's\n   monthly payments in the amount of $3,456 do not adequately protect DBT because the monthly mortgage obligation on the Loan is $3,783.49. [dkt item 31]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 28, 2019, the Court held an adjourned hearing and then took the Motion on submission, but allowed the parties to file a letter identifying specific cases that were discussed at the February 28 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 1, 2019, Debtor filed a letter with citations to additional cases. [dkt item 39] DBT filed a letter in response.

The automatic stay enjoins a lender or servicer or any other creditor from moving for foreclosure judgment or order of sale or conducting a foreclosure sale unless and until the bankruptcy court lifts the stay. However, an order lifting the stay is not the same as moving for a foreclosure judgment or an order of sale, or conducting a foreclosure sale; all of these acts occur under the auspices of a non-bankruptcy process, either through a judicial or a non-judicial proceeding governed by non-bankruptcy law; an order lifting the stay simply allows the parties to return to the non-bankruptcy process and for the servicer to then resume the foreclosure proceeding should it choose to do so. Thus, merely seeking relief from the injunctive effect of the automatic stay is not itself an act prohibited on the face of the applicable RESPA statute or the regulations promulgated thereunder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, since Congress passed both the Bankruptcy Code and RESPA, if it\n   had intended to prohibit stay relief from being pursued while the Reg X loss mitigation process proceeded, it could have said so either in the Bankruptcy Code or in RESPA; it did not.

The CFPB was clearly cognizant of the automatic stay during the rule making process because it provided in \u00a7 1024.39(c) that a servicer is not required to communicate with a borrower in a manner inconsistent with applicable bankruptcy law or a court order in a bankruptcy case. Had the CFPB intended that a servicer not pursue relief from the automatic stay while a post-petition loss mitigation request was pending it could have expressly so provided, but did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, if this Court were to accept Debtor's argument and read\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201024.41\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) as prohibiting a servicer from seeking stay relief during the RESPA loss mitigation process, then the regulations promulgated in Reg X under RESPA might be in conflict with the Bankruptcy Code's provisions concerning stay relief; in that circumstance, this Court would need to determine whether \"legislative statutes take precedence over conflicting administrative regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    In re NextWave Pers.

As this Court has previously stated, \"Congress intended that stay relief litigation be summary in fashion and expeditious in time. This is due in part to the stay being an injunction imposed by the mere filing of a bankruptcy case, and the recognition that granting stay relief returns the parties to the auspices of a court of competent jurisdiction to determine, on the merits, the relative rights, liabilities and responsibilities of the parties. Congress manifested this intention, in part, by requiring that stay relief motions be heard and determined within thirty days from filing of the motion, unless the court determines within such thirty days that the party opposing stay relief has demonstrated a 'reasonable likelihood' that it will prevail at the conclusion of a final hearing; such a final hearing is to then be held within thirty days thereafter.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\"\n   <em>\n    In re Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186513\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/457/229/#p236\">\n    457 B.R. 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236 (Bankr.

State law issues clearly predominate in the Foreclosure Action, which has been on going in state court since 2015 and was litigated to a judgment. Allowing the parties to continue the Foreclosure Action will not prejudice other creditors because there is no equity in the Property, as discussed below. Debtor's Adversary can proceed before this Court or the federal district court while DBT's Foreclosure Action proceeds in state court. The balance of harms in lifting the stay does not favor Debtor because, as discussed above, Debtor's RESPA claims do not provide Debtor with a right to injunctive relief against DBT to stay the foreclosure process, and it would be prejudicial to DBT to keep the stay in effect based on Debtor's RESPA violation claims when injunctive relief would not otherwise be available.
