Barash, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  The principal question presented by this adversary proceeding is whether a chapter 13 debtor's failure to list and schedule a debt in time for the creditor to timely file a proof of claim renders the debt nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code section 523(a)(3)(A), irrespective of the reason for that failure, the election of the creditor not to seek leave to file an untimely proof of claim, or other equitable considerations. Where the creditor does not otherwise have notice or actual knowledge of the chapter 13 case before the claims bar date, the Court answers this question in the affirmative.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  In so doing, the Court limits its reading of section 523(a)(3)(A) to the plain language of the statute, relying on the reasoning of\n  <em>\n   Mahakian v. William Maxwell Invs., LLC (In re Mahakian),\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116120\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/268/\">\n   529 B.R. 268\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (9th Cir. BAP 2015), a chapter 7 case in which the estate held assets and a bar date was established, and the scholarly concurrence of Judge O'Scannlain in\n  <em>\n   Beezley v. Cal. Land Title Co. (In re Beezley)\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518281,6525124\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/1433/\">\n   994 F.2d 1433\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 1433 (9th Cir. 1993) (O'Scannlain, J., concurring). Conversely, the Court rejects as inapplicable those Ninth Circuit bankruptcy cases that apply an equitable test to the construction of section 523(a)(3)(A).\n </opinion>\n <p id=\"p-11\">\n  The Court also considers the whether this adversary proceeding is barred by the doctrine of laches, but ultimately concludes that the debtors have not met their burden to demonstrate that the requirements of that doctrine are satisfied.\n </p>\n <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n  The Court conducted a trial in this adversary proceeding on October 15, 2018. Plaintiff West Valley Medical Partners, LLC (\"West Valley\" or \"Plaintiff\") was represented by Ian Landsberg of Landsberg Law, APC. Defendants Stanley Menaker and Marina Menaker (the \"Defendants\" or the \"Debtors\") were represented by Michael Jay Berger of the Law Offices of Michael Jay Berger. The Court has received post-trial briefing from the parties, heard and considered the oral arguments of counsel, and reviewed the trial record. The matter is now ripe for decision.

The lease was for a seven-year term commencing on October 22, 2009, expiring on September 30, 2016. By April of 2013, the Defendants had vacated the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 24, 2013, the Defendants filed a joint voluntary chapter 13 petition. On June 7, 2013, the Defendants filed their schedules of assets and liabilities and statement of financial affairs. The Defendants did not schedule the Plaintiff as the holder of a claim. The Defendants likewise did not list Plaintiff on their master mailing list of creditors. Plaintiff did not receive written notice of the commencement of the case, the 341(a) meeting of creditors, or the bar date established in the case for filing proofs of claim. The bar date (except as to governmental units) was October 8, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 16, 2013, the Defendants' chapter 13 plan was confirmed. Thereafter, the chapter 13 trustee filed her\n   <em>\n    Notice of Intent to Pay Claims\n   </em>\n   (the \"Notice,\"). Case Dkt. 35. Because the Defendants did not schedule the Plaintiff as the holder of a claim, the Plaintiff was not listed on the Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 3, 2014, unaware of the filing of the bankruptcy case, Plaintiff filed a complaint for breach of the lease against the Defendants in the Los Angeles Superior Court. Defendants did not respond to the state court action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 26, 2015, the Defendants filed an amended schedule F in this case to include the Plaintiff as an unsecured creditor in the amount of $47,000. The amended schedule lists Dan Persoff, the Plaintiff's state court counsel, as the contact, as well as his law firm's address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 15, 2015, the Defendants' bankruptcy counsel, Elena Steers, served on Persoff a\n   <em>\n    Notice of Stay of Proceedings\n   </em>\n   (the \"Notice of Stay\") in the state court action. Thereafter, Persoff also filed a Notice of Stay in the state court action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 17, 2017, the Defendants obtained their discharge in the bankruptcy case. On January 25, 2017, the bankruptcy case was closed. On March 27, 2017, the Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case for the purpose of determining the nondischargeability of a debt under Bankruptcy Code section 523(a)(3). On April 6, 2017, the Court entered an order reopening the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 5, 2017, the Plaintiff filed its\n   <em>\n    Complaint to Determine Dischargeability of Debt Pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(3)\n   </em>\n   (the \"Complaint,\").

On October 12, 2018-just one Court day before trial-the Plaintiff then filed an\n   <em>\n    Emergency Motion to Amend Joint Exhibit Register to Replace Exhibit B\n   </em>\n   (the \"Emergency Motion\"). Adv. Dkt. 42. By way of the Emergency Motion, the Plaintiff sought to replace the tenant ledger identified as Exhibit B in the Joint Exhibit Register with an updated version that previously had not been shared with the Defendants. The Court denied the Emergency Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At trial, the Court received live testimony from (1) Gary Grabel, the principal of the Plaintiff, (2) Dan Persoff, former counsel to the Plaintiff, (3) Ian Landsberg,\n   current counsel to the Plaintiff, (4) Elena Steers, bankruptcy counsel to the Defendants, (5) Defendant Marina Menaker, and (6) Defendant Stanley Menaker. At the end of the trial, the Court continued the proceeding for legal argument and invited post-trial briefing. Following a stipulated continuance and the filing of post-trial briefs, the Court heard closing arguments on January 10, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Subject to certain other exceptions not applicable here, a chapter 13 debtor is entitled to a discharge of \"all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under section 502 of this title\" except any debt of the kind specified in Bankruptcy Code section 523(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The Defendants do not deny that they failed to timely schedule the Plaintiff's debt, but argue that the debt nevertheless should be subject to the discharge in this case. First, as a matter of equity, they contend that the omission was justified and should not result in the exclusion of the Plaintiff's claim from the discharge. Second, even though the Plaintiff did not receive a case commencement notice or claims bar date notice, the Defendants contend that Plaintiff effectively had knowledge of the case prior to the claims bar date. Additionally, the Defendants assert the equitable defense of laches, arguing that the Plaintiff's delay in bringing this suit was prejudicial and should preclude a determination that the debt is nondischargeable. The Court explains below why each of the Defendants' arguments fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The appropriate inquiry is whether the debtor listed the debt and provided notice in time for the creditor to timely file a proof of claim or whether the creditor otherwise had notice or actual knowledge of the bankruptcy case in time for such a filing. Equitable considerations have no place in the analysis. Here, the Defendants admit that Plaintiff's claim was not listed or scheduled, and that Defendants did not attempt to give written notice of the bankruptcy case, until well after the claims bar date had passed. As discussed below, moreover, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiff had notice of the case in time to file a timely proof of claim. As such, the Plaintiff's debt is nondischargeable under section 523(a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Defendants' Alternative Approach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Rather than adhere to the plain language of the statute, the Defendants urge the Court to apply the multi-factor equitable test adopted by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to determine if a claim is non-dischargeable under section 523(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stone v.

Specifically, the Defendants contend that they did not list the debt because the Plaintiff's representative, Grabel, had advised Marina Menaker previously that the Plaintiff did not intend to pursue the Defendants for damages under the breached lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Defendants also argue that the Plaintiff-upon learning of the bankruptcy-should have requested leave to file a late claim, thereby minimizing the impact of that claim on the Defendants' chapter 13 case. The Defendants contend that if the Plaintiff had done so, the Defendants might have been able to address the debt under their chapter 13 plan, e.g., by extending the plan from a three-year plan to a five-year plan and making partial payments on the claim. They argue that it would be inequitable under these circumstances to \"reward\" the Plaintiff with a nondischargeable debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court does not find these arguments persuasive. As a threshold matter, the Court declines to follow the Fifth Circuit approach articulated in\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   . Although the Defendants cite to several California bankruptcy decisions that have followed the Fifth Circuit approach, these cases appear to be no-asset, no-bar date chapter 7 cases and all precede the decisions in\n   <em>\n    In re Beezley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Mahakian\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6496466\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/102/752/\">\n    102 B.R. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir.

D. Alaska 1990). Moreover, it appears that these courts followed the Fifth Circuit approach to address the perceived unfairness of strictly applying section 523 in a no-asset, no-bar date chapter 7 case. As the subsequent Ninth Circuit per curiam decision and Judge O'Scannlain's concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Beezley\n   </em>\n   demonstrate, section 523(a)(3) simply does not apply by its terms in those circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The case presently before the Court is a chapter 13 case in which a bar date was set, a plan confirmed and monthly payments made to creditors. There are no exceptions to the plain language of the statute. This is consistent with the position advocated by Judge O'Scannlain in his\n   <em>\n    Beezley\n   </em>\n   concurrence, and applied by Ninth Circuit courts in cases involving the existence of estate assets and the fixing of a bar date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mahakian,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116120\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/268/\">\n    529 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   274 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Purcell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3959258\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/362/465/\">\n    362 B.R. at 472-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the court in\n   <em>\n    In re Purcell\n   </em>\n   observed, \"no\n   court that has followed\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

The Defendants' Equitable Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Even if the Defendants' equitable arguments under section 523(a)(3) were legally relevant to the analysis, the Court does not find them persuasive. The Defendants' first equitable argument is that they did not schedule the Plaintiff's debt because Grabel told Maria Menaker, during an in-person conversation in December 2012, that he did not intend to pursue a claim against the Defendants for breach of the lease. Maria Menaker testified that she \"sincerely believed\" Grabel had made such a commitment, but her direct testimony describing what Grabel actually said does not provide objective evidence of such a commitment. Maria testified that after telling Grabel she intended to discontinue the business, move out of the premises and file bankruptcy, Grabel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Yeah. What am I going to do with this bankruptcy? I'm not going to get anything from you. You don't have anything for me to get. What, am I going to get this picture of the bankruptcy, just put it on my wall? No. I have someone that is interested in the facility. I have the Children's Hospital. They want to come in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Trial Record at 2:58 p.m. Her counsel thereafter asked her directly \"Do you remember specifically that he said he was not going to pursue this debt from you?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3959258\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/362/465/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But she did not answer directly, instead saying \"He... I sincerely believed him because up to that point he never lied to me. And, ah, everything he said he followed up.\" She later testified that she told her husband and her bankruptcy lawyer that she believed \"Gary was not going to go after us\" but did not testify to any statements by Grabel evidencing an express modification or novation of the parties' obligations under the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   More importantly, whatever Grabel's statement, and whatever Maria's understanding of it, the Defendants' alleged reliance on it was not justified. First, the lease itself provides that the terms and conditions thereunder cannot be modified other than in a writing signed by all parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit A at \u00b6 35.13 (\"This Lease ... may not be modified except by a written document executed by the parties hereto.\"). Maria testified that there was no writing evidencing Grabel's alleged commitment not to pursue Plaintiff's rights under the lease. Second, the Bankruptcy Code is set up to provide debtors certainty about debts that may or may not have been satisfied or extinguished prepetition. The Bankruptcy Code enables a debtor to schedule a debt on his/her schedules and obtain a discharge-in this instance upon completion of all payments due under a chapter 13 plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if the Defendants had obtained a writing purporting to extinguish their obligations under the lease, the Court can imagine no good reason why the Defendants would not have timely listed the Plaintiff as a creditor and scheduled the debt-in a zero amount and/or as a \"disputed\" claim-to enjoy the certainty and peace of mind that results from the discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Defendants' second equitable argument is that Defendants should have requested leave to file a late claim, upon learning of the chapter 13 case. The Defendants contend that if the Plaintiff had sought leave to file a late claim, the Defendants may have been able to amend their plan to treat that claim over the term of the plan. If accepted, however, this argument would turn the Bankruptcy Code on\n   its head. The very structure of section 523(a)(3)(A) -that a discharge is denied if a debt is not timely listed in the schedules by the debtor-is an indication of Congress' intent to place the burden squarely on the debtor to take the action necessary to earn a discharge. There is no indication in the text of the statute that the burden shifts to the creditor to act if it receives\n   <em>\n    untimely\n   </em>\n   notice of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, untimely notice of the opportunity to file a proof of claim in a chapter 13 case and possibly participate in distributions under a chapter 13 plan does not necessarily \"restore\" the rights to which a creditor is entitled. Untimely notice may come only after distributions have begun under a chapter 13 plan and the only available distributions will result in less than the creditors' pro rata entitlement. Untimely notice of the case also may deprive the creditor of other important rights in the life of a chapter 13 case, such as the right to conduct discovery and object to confirmation of the chapter 13 plan, the right object to other claims and thereby increase the creditor's share of the estate, and the right to challenge any proposed disposition of assets prior to confirmation of the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Thus, it would be fundamentally unfair to require a creditor to file a claim in a chapter 13 case after the bar date has elapsed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fugate,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1113547\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/286/778/\">\n    286 B.R. 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 2002) (chapter 13) (\"There is no way, after the claims bar date has passed, to extend the date and force the creditor to participate in a plan to which it never had the chance to object. The court agrees that this result is justified 'as a punishment for a fundamental bankruptcy sin, failing to list all creditors which are known or should have been known to the debtor.' \") (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Kristiniak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377741\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/208/132/#p136\">\n    208 B.R. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136 (Bankr.

For these reasons, even though Plaintiff could have sought permission to file a late claim after learning of the chapter 13 case, it was not obligated to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Actual Knowledge of the Bankruptcy Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The nondischargeability of a debt under Bankruptcy Code section 523(a)(3)(A) requires not only that the debtor fail to schedule the debt in time for the creditor to timely file a claim, but also that the creditor not have \"had notice or actual knowledge of the case in time\" to file such a claim. While it is undisputed by the Defendants that the Plaintiff did not receive timely written notice of the bankruptcy case or the claims bar date, the Defendants argue that Maria Menaker's statements to Grabel in December 2012 nevertheless were adequate to give the Plaintiff notice for purposes of section 523(a)(3)(A). The Court disagrees. An open-ended statement by a debtor regarding his/her intent to file bankruptcy in the future is not a substitute for notice that the debtor\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   has filed a bankruptcy case, the date of such filing, the court in which such case has been filed, and the bar date set in that case for filing proofs of claim. Maria Menaker's statement in December 2012 of her intent to someday file bankruptcy does not constitute notice of the actual filing of a bankruptcy case that did not occur for another five months. To construe the actual notice exception of section 523(a)(3)(A) in this manner defies logic, and would undermine the burden Congress clearly placed on debtors to timely list and schedule all creditors against whom bankruptcy relief is sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Laches as a Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Defendants invoke the equitable doctrine of laches to contend that Plaintiff should be denied relief because it waited an unreasonable amount of time to commence this proceeding under Bankruptcy Code section 523(a)(3)(A). The Defendants contend that Plaintiff learned of the Defendants' bankruptcy case in either January 2015 or April 2015, but did not commence this adversary proceeding for nearly two years, after the bankruptcy case was closed. The Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Beaty v. Selinger (In re Beaty),\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11440419,1088740\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/914/\">\n    306 F. 3d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2002), in which the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a party could assert laches as a defense to action brought under Bankruptcy Code section 523(a)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even if the Court assumes for the sake of argument that the holding in\n   <em>\n    In re Beaty\n   </em>\n   is equally applicable to actions under both sections 523(a)(3)(A) and 523(a)(3)(B), the Defendants have failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the requirements of this defense have been satisfied.

Given the totality of the circumstances presented, the Court does not conclude that the delay here constitutes a lack of diligence. The Defendants did not give the Plaintiff notice of their chapter 13 case until nearly two years after their chapter 13 plan had been confirmed and the bar date had long since expired. Plaintiff had filed a state court action based on the breached lease more than one year before its discovery of the bankruptcy, which state court action was thereafter stayed. At trial, Grabel testified credibly that before launching this adversary proceeding he wanted to have greater clarity on the extent of Plaintiff's damages under the lease, considering Plaintiff's efforts at mitigation and the results thereof. Although Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have filed this adversary earlier, the Court is not persuaded that its election not to do so constitutes a lack of diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Beaty,\n   </em>\n   the Ninth Circuit held that a section 523(a)(3) action should not be barred without a \"particularized showing of demonstrable prejudicial delay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544081\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/829/#p833\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544081\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/829/#p833\">\n    at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Defendants contend that they have been substantially prejudiced because: (1) they have been deprived the finality of their discharge; (2) they are facing a potential non-dischargeable judgment that may exceed $371,000, (3) they believe that if Plaintiff had filed a late proof of claim during that period, Plaintiff would have received a distribution of approximately $12,000, (4) they are incurring attorney's fees that they otherwise would not have faced; and (5) there is unspecified documentary evidence and witness testimony that is unavailable because of the passage of time. As in\n   <em>\n    In re Beaty\n   </em>\n   , these arguments are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Plaintiff's delay in bringing this adversary proceeding did not deprive the Defendants' of the finality of their discharge. As to Plaintiff's debt, it is Defendants' failure to timely schedule the debt that has deprived them of finality-and ultimately the discharge itself. As to all other claims, this adversary action has had no effect whatsoever on the Defendants' discharge. Likewise, the potentially large amount of the non-dischargeable judgment the Defendants are facing is not the result of Plaintiff's delay in bringing this action but is a result of the Defendants' prepetition breach. Further, the Defendants' contention that Plaintiff could have received a distribution (and the Defendants could have received a discharge) if Plaintiff had sought leave to file a late claim is likewise irrelevant. As discussed above, Plaintiff was not obligated to do so and its election not to do so is not a form of prejudice to the Debtors. Even if that were not the case, logically speaking, any such prejudice would not be the result of Plaintiff's delay in filing this lawsuit, but instead of its election not to seek to file a late claim. Similarly, the Defendants have failed to (i) demonstrate that the attorneys' fees incurred defending this adversary proceeding could have been avoided if the proceeding had been commenced earlier or (ii) identify any documentary evidence or witness testimony that would have assisted in the Defendants' defense of this action but that is no longer available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In short, the Defendants have failed to meet their burden of proof to demonstrate that the claim asserted in this adversary proceeding is barred by the doctrine of laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For all the foregoing reasons, the Court finds the Plaintiff has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it holds a nondischargeable debt under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A). Because the Joint Pretrial Stipulation did not identify the amount of the Plaintiff's claim under the lease as an issue to be determined at trial,\n   the Court does not make that determination. That issue properly may be determined by the state court. Accordingly, the Court will enter a separate judgment in favor of the Plaintiff determining that the Defendants' debt under the lease-whatever the amount-is nondischargeable in this case under Bankruptcy Code section 523(a)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The listed address does not include the suite number for the law firm.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3004 permits a debtor to file a proof of claim on behalf of a creditor who fails to do so timely, provided the debtor does so within 30 days of the bar date by which the creditor was required to file that claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
