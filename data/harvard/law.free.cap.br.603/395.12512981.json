Gregg, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   Laura J. Genovich, the chapter 7 trustee (the \"Trustee\") for the estate of Spiech Farms, LLC (the \"Debtor\"), alleges that Produce Pay, Inc. (\"Produce Pay\") and thirteen other creditors (the \"Growers\", and together with Produce Pay, the \"Plaintiffs\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   violated the automatic stay when they asserted claims that are property of the Debtor's estate in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. The Trustee also contends that the Plaintiffs collaterally attacked at least one order of this court when they raised issues in the Southern District of Georgia that were previously adjudicated by this court. Accordingly, the Trustee requests that the Plaintiffs be found in contempt of court and sanctioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Plaintiffs deny that any violation of the automatic stay occurred because they have neither named the Debtor as a defendant nor asserted claims that constitute property of the Debtor's estate. The Plaintiffs further maintain that they are not collaterally attacking an order of this court because the claims and issues in the Southern District of Georgia are completely different from those previously decided by this court. As such, the Plaintiffs argue no basis exists upon which to hold them in contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the following reasons, the court shall grant the motion in part and deny the motion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (e).

The Trustee further argues that even if some of the Plaintiffs' causes of action could be construed as personal, the Plaintiffs' recovery would directly interfere with the estate's recovery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Plaintiffs generally disagree. The Plaintiffs argue that because they did not name the Debtor as a defendant, they have not violated the automatic stay. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs summarily state that because they \"are seeking money damages from non-debtors for harm done to them by the non-debtors in breach of the duties that the non-debtors owed to the [Plaintiffs],\" they are not interfering with property of the Debtor's estate. (Resp. at \u00b6 9). Finally, the Plaintiffs contend that the\n    Trustee lacks standing to pursue piercing the veil/alter ego claims against the Principals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    As an initial matter, the Plaintiffs are mistaken when they argue that no violation of the automatic stay occurred because the Debtor was not named as a defendant. The Plaintiffs are correct in that the automatic stay does not extend to non-debtors absent the issuance of an injunction under section 105(a).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parry v.

Unfortunately, the Complaint and the Plaintiffs' briefs are confusing on a number of levels, making it nearly impossible for the court and the Trustee to thoroughly assess each of the Plaintiffs' causes of action.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    First, the Complaint fails to identify which state's law applies to the eight causes of action sounding in tort. The Plaintiffs' briefing only adds to the uncertainty. In their response brief, the Plaintiffs represent that\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    of their state law claims are brought under Georgia law, without providing any analysis as to why each cause of action is personal to them. (Resp. at \u00b6 6). However, in their sur-reply, the Plaintiffs suggest that Michigan law applies to at least one of their claims, thereby directly contradicting their previous representation that Georgia law applies to all claims. (Sur-Reply at \u00b6 2). Only at the hearing did the Plaintiffs definitively state that their tort causes of action are brought pursuant to Georgia law. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Hr'g Tr. at 25: 4-10).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Second, the Complaint identifies each individual Spiech as a manager, member, or officer of\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    Spiech Michigan and Spiech Georgia, despite the fact that the Complaint expressly states that Spiech Georgia is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Debtor. (Compl. at \u00b6 21; Compl. at Ex. E). In addition, the Spieches and Stone are collectively defined as the \"Principals\" of\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    the Debtor and Spiech Georgia. (Compl. at \u00b6 21(g)). Throughout the Complaint, the term \"Principals\" is used to refer to the Spieches and Stone without identifying the specific role or capacity in which each Principal was acting with respect to each cause of action.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Third, the Complaint's five counts for piercing the veil/alter ego, much like the counts for the tort causes of action, fail to identify whether Georgia law, Michigan law, or some other state's law applies. The Plaintiffs' briefing is again inconsistent. In their sur-reply, the Plaintiffs confusingly cite to decisions relying on Michigan law, despite having stated that Georgia law applies to all causes of action in their response. (\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Resp. at \u00b6 6\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Sur-Reply at \u00b6 2). The confusion is compounded by the Plaintiffs' failure to identify whether they are seeking to pierce the veil of the Debtor, Spiech Georgia, or both. The Plaintiffs repeatedly conflate the two entities without definitively stating whose veil is being pierced. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 453, 454, 458, 459, 461, 463, 464, 465, 467, 468;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Resp. at \u00b6 11; Sur-Reply at \u00b6 3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Prior to the hearing, the court assumed that perhaps the Plaintiffs were seeking to pierce the veil of the Debtor to impose liability on the Spieches as members of the Debtor. Alternatively, the court speculated that the Plaintiffs might be seeking to reverse pierce the veil of the Debtor to impose alter ego liability on Spiech Georgia. The Trustee was also confused. (Hr'g Tr. at 12: 18-22, 19: 5-11, 51: 5-12). During the hearing, the Plaintiffs disclosed that\n    they are not seeking to pierce the veil of the Debtor at all. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Hr'g Tr. at 26: 17-21, 27: 10-15). Instead, the Plaintiffs repeatedly stated they are only attempting to pierce the veil of Spiech Georgia under Georgia law in order to impose liability on \"the Principals.\" (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Hr'g Tr. at 50: 21-23).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Setting all of this aside, the court has little difficulty concluding under the circumstances that the Plaintiffs violated the automatic stay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <em>\n     1.

The Second Circuit explained this principle as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    Indeed, every creditor in bankruptcy has an individual claim (set forth in a proof of claim) against the debtor, whether it be in tort ..., contract, or otherwise. But often there are claims against third parties that wrongfully deplete the debtor's assets. Individual creditors may wish to bring claims against those third parties to seek compensation for harms done to them by the debtor and secondary harms done to them by the third parties in wrongfully diverting assets of the debtor that would be used to pay the claims of the individual creditor. The fact that an individual creditor may seek to do so does not make those secondary claims particular to the creditor, for it overlooks the obvious: Every creditor has a similar claim for the diversion of assets of the debtor's estate. Those claims are general - they are not tied to the harm done to the creditor by the debtor, but rather are based on an injury to the debtor's estate that creates a secondary harm to all creditors regardless of the nature of their underlying claim against the debtor.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <em>\n     Tronox Inc. v.

The Plaintiffs are represented in the Southern District of Georgia by the same attorneys who have represented Produce Pay in the Debtor's case from its inception. The Plaintiffs included a footnote in the Complaint disclosing the existence of the Debtor's bankruptcy case to the Southern District of Georgia.

However, the Plaintiffs' failure to substantively explain why their causes of action do not belong to the estate leads the court to believe the Plaintiffs made the decision \"to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Nicole Gas Prod., Ltd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520200\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/566/#p573\">\n     916 F.3d at 577\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quotation omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Like the conduct in\n    <em>\n     Nicole Gas\n    </em>\n    , the Plaintiffs' conduct in this case is not a close call.
