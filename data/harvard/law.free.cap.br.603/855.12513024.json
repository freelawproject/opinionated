Hagenau, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   is before the Court on the Debtor's Objection to Claim of Anthony B. Moore (Doc. No. 26). The Court held a hearing on the Objection on April 2, 2019, after which it took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Moore is the Debtor's former spouse as well as a child support creditor in this case. The parties have an extensive history of litigation in both state court and this Court. Debtor filed this case on January 11, 2019. This is the Debtor's second chapter 13 bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Debtor previously filed case number 16-57172 on April 25, 2016. After obtaining relief from the automatic stay, Mr. Moore obtained a judgment in the Douglas County Superior Court on July 11, 2016 for child support arrears, reimbursement of medical expenses, and various fees. Mr. Moore filed a proof of claim regarding the domestic support obligation of the Debtor to Mr. Moore. After hearing and based on a state court order in existence at the time, the Court allowed Mr. Moore a priority unsecured claim in the amount of $18,971.84. Order on Motion to Disallow Claim (Doc. No. 70.), entered on October 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Moore appealed the state court order. After a remand, the state court entered an Order After Second Remand on May 17, 2018, in which it recalculated the amounts due and increased the amount of Mr. Moore's claim. Mr. Moore filed an amended proof of claim and, after notice and hearing, the Court modified its prior order and allowed Mr. Moore an unsecured priority claim in the amount of $24,159.61. The claim consisted of the following:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-14\">Child Support Arrears $4,347.00 Uninsured Health Care Expenses $5,749.55 Attorney's Fee $15,571.50 Amount Paid by Debtor ($1,508.44) ___________ TOTAL $24,159.61</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Order Allowing Modified Claim (Doc. No. 102) entered July 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Debtor was unable to propose a workable plan modification to pay Mr. Moore's modified claim. The Chapter 13 Trustee filed a motion to dismiss the case, and the case was dismissed on September 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Moore then returned to state court and filed an Amended Motion for Contempt on November 20, 2018 requesting interest on his domestic support claim pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 7-4-12. The state court held a hearing on Mr. Moore's amended motion for contempt on January 15, 2019, after the Debtor filed this case. The state court issued an order on January 18, 2019. The order made several observations but left it to this Court to determine Mr. Moore's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Moore filed a proof of claim for the domestic support obligation owed by the Debtor to him in this case. He amended his claim several times to add and adjust interest he alleges is owed on the claim. Mr. Moore filed his original proof of claim number 1 on January 23, 2019 for $16,205.26. He then filed claim no. a1 on January 25, 2019 for $17,039.87; claim no. a2 on January 30, 2019 for $21,939.60; claim no. a3 on February 6, 2019 for $22,518.40; and claim no. a4 on February 28, 2019 for $26,124.33. Mr. Moore seeks interest at the rate of 6.25% for 2015 - 2018 in the amount of $5,399.28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Debtor objects to Mr. Moore's claim. She contends Mr. Moore's claim should be reduced to reflect the amount of his claim allowed in the Debtor's previous case ($24,159.61) less the amount the Debtor paid on the claim in her prior case ($6,994.74) to reflect a balance of $17,164.87. Debtor contends Mr. Moore is not entitled to interest on his claim and, if allowed, the interest should not be entitled to priority status but be a general unsecured claim. Debtor argues Mr. Moore is estopped from seeking interest now since he did not seek it in Debtor's prior case. Debtor also argues the portion of the claim for attorney's fees should not be entitled to priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court held a hearing on the objection on April 2, 2019. Counsel for the Debtor, David Casey, Mr. Moore, and counsel for the Chapter 13 Trustee, Ryan Williams, were present. After considering the argument of counsel and Mr. Moore, the Court found Mr. Moore is entitled to both pre- and post-petition interest and the interest is to be treated as a priority debt and that the attorney's fees are entitled to priority treatment. The Court took the precise calculation of Mr. Moore's claim under advisement and ordered the parties to submit revised calculations of the interest owed, accounting for the payments made by the Debtor before and during her prior case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Moore filed a calculation on April 8, 2019 (Doc. No. 45). On April 10, 2019, Debtor submitted her calculation (Doc. No. 46). The Chapter 13 Trustee filed a report on April 11, 2019 (Doc. No. 47). The Court entered an order on April 17, 2019 (Doc. No. 52) providing further direction for the calculation of the claim. The parties filed a Joint Stipulation pursuant to the Court's order calculating Mr. Moore's pre-petition claim to be $22,104.00 (Doc. No. 54). After the Court requested the parties divide the claim between principal and interest, Mr. Moore filed a second revision of the calculation of his claim (Doc. No. 55) rejecting the stipulation and proposing his calculation of principal and interest. Debtor responded (Doc. No. 56) with a different proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Objection and responses raise several issues: 1) is Mr. Moore entitled to pre-petition\n   interest; 2) did Mr. Moore waive his interest claim by not raising it in the Debtor's prior case; 3) is Mr. Moore entitled to post-petition interest; 4) if he is entitled to interest, what interest rate applies; 5) is Mr. Moore entitled to a priority claim for attorney's fees; 6) what is the basis for the charges of $175 and $320 included in Mr. Moore's claim; and 7) what is the principal and interest due on the judgment as of the petition date (i.e. Mr. Moore's claim)? The Court considers each of these in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Mr. Moore is Entitled to Pre-Petition Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Moore is entitled to pre-petition interest on his domestic support obligation and the interest is entitled to priority status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The state court order issued on January 18, 2019 discusses interest, but it did not award Mr. Moore interest. Rather, the state court acknowledged it was \"aware\" that Georgia law provides all judgments in Georgia shall bear annual interest. It noted that Mr. Moore \"did not specify the amount of interest accrued thus far, however, it does appear that he is entitled to collect interest on his judgment claim which is something that he can take up with the bankruptcy court when he files his claim under her chapter 13 plan.\" The state court therefore left the question of interest open for this Court to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code provides for interest on DSO claims. Section 101(14A) defines a \"domestic support obligation\" (\"DSO\") as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   a debt that accrues before, on, or after the date of the order for relief in a case under this title,\n   <strong>\n    including interest\n   </strong>\n   that accrues on that debt as provided under applicable nonbankruptcy law notwithstanding any other provision of this title, that is-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    (A)\n   </strong>\n   owed to or recoverable by-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    (i)\n   </strong>\n   a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor or such child's parent, legal guardian, or responsible relative; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    (ii)\n   </strong>\n   a governmental unit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    (B)\n   </strong>\n   in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support (including assistance provided by a governmental unit) of such spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor or such child's parent, without regard to whether such debt is expressly so designated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    (C)\n   </strong>\n   established or subject to establishment before, on, or after the date of the order for relief in a case under this title, by reason of applicable provisions of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    (i)\n   </strong>\n   a separation agreement, divorce decree, or property settlement agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    (ii)\n   </strong>\n   an order of a court of record; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    (iii)\n   </strong>\n   a determination made in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law by a governmental unit; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    (D)\n   </strong>\n   not assigned to a nongovernmental entity, unless that obligation is assigned voluntarily by the spouse, former spouse, child of the debtor, or such child's parent, legal guardian, or responsible relative for the purpose of collecting the debt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14A) (emphasis added).

Mr. Moore is Entitled to Post-Petition Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mr. Moore is entitled to post-petition interest. The plain language of section 101(14A) defines a DSO to include interest accruing under applicable nonbankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    In re Resendiz\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-10603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206152921\">\n    2013 WL 6152921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr.

S.D. Tex. June 22, 2015). The definition encompasses debts that were considered alimony, maintenance or support under prior section 523(a)(5), but it is broader in several respects. It includes both pre-petition and post-petition obligations, and it includes interest that accrues on a debt under applicable nonbankruptcy law, including interest that accrues on or after the date of the order for relief, \"notwithstanding any other provision of this title.\" Section 101(14A) enlarged the concept of a domestic support obligation to define post-petition interest as part of the DSO claim itself. The Bankruptcy Code therefore not only\n   <em>\n    allows\n   </em>\n   but\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   Chapter 13 plans to provide for payment of post-petition interest on DSO claims.\n   <em>\n    Lightfoot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203956211\">\n    2015 WL 3956211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3. This is true despite other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203956211\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Section 502(b)(2) disallows any claim for unmatured interest generally and section 502(b)(5) disallows claims for unmatured DSOs. But section 101(14A) expressly includes interest in the definition of DSO \"notwithstanding any other provision\" of the Code.\n   <em>\n    Lightfoot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203956211\">\n    2015 WL 3956211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. The language \"notwithstanding any other provision of this title\" in section 101(14A) is contained within the clause referring specifically to DSO interest. The explicit inclusion of interest in the definition of DSO saves DSO interest from disallowance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lightfoot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203956211\">\n    2015 WL 3956211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Post-petition interest as it accrues on a DSO becomes part of the DSO debt itself under \u00a7 101(14A) and the accruing post-petition interest is a priority debt that must be paid in full through the confirmed plan consistent with \u00a7 1322(a)(2). Because a debtor must provide for the full payment of all claims entitled to priority under section 507, unless the holder of the claim agrees to a different treatment, and because all claims entitled to priority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   must be paid in full pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), a chapter 13 plan must provide for payment of interest, including post-petition interest, accruing pursuant to nonbankruptcy law on any claims for domestic support obligations.\n   <em>\n    In re Resendiz\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-10603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206152921\">\n    2013 WL 6152921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. Nov. 20, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Further, chapter 13 debtors must pay post-petition interest on DSO claims despite section 1322(b)(10). Section 1322(b)(10), as amended by BAPCPA, states that a chapter 13 plan may \"provide\n   for the payment of interest accruing after the date of the filing of the petition on unsecured claims that are nondischargeable under \u00a7 1328(a)\" but only to the extent that the debtor has disposable income available to pay such interest after making provision for full payment of all allowed claims.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(10). There is no reference to or exception for DSOs in section 1322(b)(10). This new section could be interpreted to preclude the payment of post-petition interest on account of a nondischargeable DSO debt unless the chapter 13 plan provides full payment of all allowed claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But the predicate to \u00a7 1322(b) is that all of its subsections are \"subject to subsection[ ] (a).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). It is subparagraph (2) in \"subsection[ ] (a)\" that mandates that a chapter 13 plan provide for full payment of all claims entitled to priority under \u00a7 507. Paying post-petition interest as part of a DSO claim under \u00a7 101(14A) is therefore required by \u00a7 1322(a)(2) and an exception to the general rule in \u00a7 1322(b)(10) that post-petition interest can be paid on account of a nondischargeable debt only if the chapter 13 debtor has disposable income sufficient to pay all allowed claims in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code support this conclusion. To get a discharge, chapter 13 debtors must certify that all DSOs due during the Chapter 13 case, including amounts due before the petition to the extent provided for by the plan, have been paid.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This certification requirement means that DSOs accruing before\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   after the chapter 13 petition have to be current at the time of certification. \"Amounts payable\" for purposes of the new certification in \u00a7 1328(a) also includes interest on a DSO accruing after the petition, which underscores that chapter 13 debtors have to pay accruing post-petition interest through the chapter 13 plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Debtors can separately classify a DSO, including all interest that accrues under nonbankruptcy law after the petition, for payment in full. For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re Resendiz\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-10603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206152921\">\n    2013 WL 6152921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D. Tex. Nov. 20, 2013), the debtor proposed a chapter 13 plan that provided a 5% dividend to the general unsecured class and included a child support arrearage claim in the amount of $10,973.13, to be paid at 6% interest. The chapter 13 trustee did not recommend confirmation because, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(10), in order to pay interest on a non-dischargeable unsecured claim the debtor must propose a 100% repayment plan. The general unsecured class in the plan totaled $195,210.33, and a 100% repayment plan was not feasible. The court found, notwithstanding 1322(b)(10), the plan had to provide for the payment of any interest accruing pursuant to nonbankruptcy law on DSO claims and the debtor acted in good faith and proposed a plan that was confirmable. The court also noted a fresh start is the ultimate goal for any debtor in bankruptcy and, if the debtor completed his chapter 13 plan but still owed interest on child support arrearage (a claim that could result in jail time), he would not receive a fresh start.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Interest, as it \"matures\" after the petition on a DSO debt, becomes part of the DSO debt itself under \u00a7 101(14A) \"notwithstanding\" any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, post-petition interest on Mr. Moore's DSO claim is allowed and Debtor's plan must provide for the payment of interest accruing pursuant to nonbankruptcy law on his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Mr. Moore did Not Waive His Interest Claim by Not Raising It in Debtor's Prior Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mr. Moore did not seek interest in the Debtor's prior chapter 13 case, but he\n   is entitled to both pre- and post-petition interest on his DSO claim and he may seek it in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code provides interest on DSOs accrues automatically and is non dischargeable, and a creditor may pursue interest on a DSO claim even after the debtor completes her chapter 13 plan. Once confirmed, the treatment and payment of the domestic support obligation under the plan is res judicata, as long as due process was satisfied. Lynne F.

She contends paying the interest would result in substantial and unreasonable hardship to her because she is a stay-at-home mother of a special needs child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court recognizes that, under Georgia law, it has discretion in determining whether to apply, waive, or reduce the amount of interest owed. The Court declines to exercise its discretion to waive or reduce the amount of interest owed here because the criteria set out in the statute have not been met. Debtor has not provided any explanation for the nonpayment of child support, other than stating that she cannot afford to pay it. That is not what the statute contemplates, and the Court finds this factor weighs against waiving or reducing the amount of interest owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, Debtor argues paying the interest would result in substantial and unreasonable hardship. The state court, which has had the opportunity to observe both parties through lengthy litigation, has not found that to be the case. The state court has never indicated the Debtor should be given any special dispensation when it comes to paying Mr. Moore. For example, the state court could have declined to award Mr. Moore attorney's fees and could have exercised its discretion to reduce the amount owed to him, but it did not. The Court has read all of the state court orders presented in this and the Debtor's prior case and does not find the Debtor to be entitled to any special relief. Accordingly,\n   the Court finds the second factor weighs against waiving or reducing the amount of interest owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The third factor (applying, waiving, or reducing the interest would enhance or detract from the parent's current ability to pay child support, including the consideration of the regularity of payments made for current child support of those dependents for whom support is owed) is not applicable here. No ongoing child support is required of the Debtor since the children have reached the age of majority. The fourth factor (the waiver or reduction of interest would result in substantial and unreasonable hardship to the parent to whom interest is owed) does favor the Debtor as there is no evidence Mr. Moore would be placed in substantial and unreasonable hardship if he did not receive interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On balance, the Court finds, pursuant to Georgia law, Mr. Moore is entitled to 7% interest on his DSO claim and the Court will not exercise its discretion to modify the date on which interest began to accrue and will not waive or reduce the past due interest owed on his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Mr. Moore is Entitled to a Priority Claim for Attorney's Fees that Were Previously Awarded\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court awarded Mr. Moore attorney's fees in Debtor's prior case. In the Order on Motion to Disallow Claim (Doc. No. 70.), entered on October 14, 2016 and reiterated in the Order Allowing Modified Claim (Doc.

Under federal law, collateral estoppel applies when the following elements are met: 1) the issue in the prior action and the issue in the bankruptcy court are identical; 2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; 3) the determination of the issue in the prior action was a critical and necessary part of the judgment in the litigation; and 4) the burden of persuasion in the later proceeding is not significantly heavier than the burden of persuasion in the initial action.\n   <em>\n    Bush v.

Debtor does\n   not contend that she did not receive notice in her prior bankruptcy case, nor does she claim she was afforded less than a full right to participate in the adjudication of Mr. Moore's proof of claim in that case. In fact, Debtor was represented by an attorney in her prior bankruptcy case, filed an objection to Mr. Moore's proof of claim and responses to Mr. Moore's papers, and participated in a hearing on her objection to Mr. Moore's claim. The Court carefully reviewed the pleadings and the arguments of parties and determined that attorney's fees were a part of Mr. Moore's unsecured priority claim (Doc. No. 70). The Court finds that the issue of attorney's fees was actually litigated in the prior case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Further, determining attorney's fees were part of Mr. Moore's allowed priority claim was a critical and necessary part of the Court's calculation in the Order on Motion to Disallow Claim (Doc.

These expenses were already included in the 2015 Douglas County order that awarded Mr. Moore $15,571.50 in attorney's fees and costs. Mr. Moore also seeks to recover $322 for costs incurred in the proceedings he initiated after the Debtor's prior bankruptcy case was dismissed. He contends the state court awarded him these fees in the order it issued on January 18, 2019. The order, however, did not award Mr. Moore these costs and it could not have because Debtor had already refiled bankruptcy and had a pending bankruptcy case. The state court order merely observed that Mr. Moore may have incurred court costs. Accordingly, the Court finds Mr. Moore may not include these fees in his proof of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    g.

The Debtor's calculation accrued interest on the original balance without an adjustment for payments made. Mr. Moore similarly did not adjust the calculation of interest each time a payment was made but made yearly adjustments. Neither party applied the payments to interest first. The Court has therefore calculated Mr. Moore's claim as set out in Exhibit A. Each payment made by the Debtor was applied to interest first then to principal, and the interest accrual was adjusted with each payment. The Court determines Mr. Moore holds a claim of $22,192.01 consisting of unpaid pre-petition principal of $21,522.36 and unpaid pre-petition interest of $669.65.
