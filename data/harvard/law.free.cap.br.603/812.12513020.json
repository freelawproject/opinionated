The meeting of creditors was first scheduled for February 14. ECF No. 7. The chapter 13 trustee held the meeting of creditors and concluded it that day. Five days later the trustee objected to confirmation of the plan in part because, based on the debtors' testimony at the meeting of creditors and the Internal Revenue Service's proof of claim, the trustee determined that the debtors \"might not have filed all tax returns required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201308\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" ECF No. 24, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court ordered the parties to brief whether the debtors' 2018 income-tax returns were among those that the debtors were required to file before the date on which the meeting of creditors was first scheduled to be held, and, if so, whether the court can confirm the debt-adjustment plan in this case notwithstanding the debtors' failure to file those returns by the statutory deadline. The trustee and the debtors both filed briefs, and after a hearing, the court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Essentially the same issue has arisen in several other cases filed in early 2019. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    In re Perkins\n   </em>\n   , No. 19-20633 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. filed Jan. 24, 2019);\n   <em>\n    In re Skurski\n   </em>\n   , No. 19-20074 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. filed Jan. 3, 2019). In each such case the trustee held and closed the meeting of creditors on the date on which it was first scheduled to be held and promptly objected to confirmation based at least in part on non-filed returns for 2018 that were not yet due to be filed under applicable nonbankruptcy law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The \"first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

The conclusion\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   draws from applicable nonbankruptcy law, however, is open to question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The nonbankruptcy law most applicable here is the Internal Revenue Code (title 26 of the U.S. Code), which generally uses variants of \"make\" to refer to an individual's duty to file a return at all for a taxable period and variants of \"file\" to refer to an individual's obligation to submit a return to the Internal Revenue Service by some deadline. For example, the Internal Revenue Code provides that, subject to certain exceptions, \"[r]eturns with respect to income taxes ... shall be\n   <strong>\n    made\n   </strong>\n   by ... [e]very individual having for the taxable year gross income which equals or exceeds\" a statutorily specified \"exemption amount\" and that such returns \"\n   <strong>\n    made\n   </strong>\n   on the basis of the calendar year shall be\n   <strong>\n    filed\n   </strong>\n   on or before the 15th day of April following the close of the calendar year\".\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206012\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) &amp; 6072(a) (emphasis added). The Internal Revenue Code similarly uses \"make\" and \"file\" in provisions concerning other kinds of returns that may be required of an individual. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206012\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6019 (\"Any individual who in any calendar year makes any transfer by gift other than\" a transfer of a kind specified in subsection (1), (2), or (3) \"shall make a return for such year with respect to the gift tax imposed by subtitle B.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206012\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6075(b)(1) (\"Returns made under section 6019 ... shall be filed on or before the 15th day of April following the close of the calendar year.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Read against this tax-law backdrop, \u00a7 1308(a)'s past-tense use of \"file\" in its middle clause suggests that it covers only those returns that the debtor was required to\n   <strong>\n    file\n   </strong>\n   before the date on which the meeting of creditors was first scheduled to be held (and not, as\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   holds, all returns that the debtor was required to\n   <strong>\n    make\n   </strong>\n   for the specified prepetition periods, without regard to whether the debtor was required to file them before that date). This reading of \u00a7 1308(a) is consistent with contemporaneous additions to the Bankruptcy Code that distinguish, for example, among tax returns (1) \"required under applicable law\", i.e., that must be \"\n   <strong>\n    made\n   </strong>\n   \" for a taxable period; (2) \"due\" by some \"due date for\n   <strong>\n    filing\n   </strong>\n   such return\"; and (3) actually \"\n   <strong>\n    filed\n   </strong>\n   with the taxing authority\". See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(A)(i), (f)(1), (f)(2) &amp; (j)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, this reading holds even where the applicable nonbankruptcy law is state or local law (that is, where \u00a7 1308(a) requires a debtor to file state or local returns). Section 1308(a) is a provision of the Bankruptcy Code that requires an individual debtor to file certain tax returns with appropriate tax authorities by a specified date. Such a provision is best read in harmony with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that require an individual taxpayer to file certain tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service-the appropriate authority with respect to returns that an individual must make and file under federal law-by a specified date. Accordingly, the best reading of \u00a7 1308(a), as informed by federal-tax-law usage, is that it requires a debtor in a chapter 13 case to file only those returns that are due to be filed before the date on which the meeting of creditors is first scheduled to be held, whether the returns at issue are federal, state, or local returns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   's contrary reading of \u00a7 1308(a), which construes \"filed\" to mean the duty to make a return, accelerates the deadline by which a chapter 13 debtor who files a petition early in the calendar year must file an income-tax return for the prior year.\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   's reading thus requires a surprising deviation from the principle that the Bankruptcy Code generally takes rights and obligations created by nonbankruptcy law as it finds them, including deadlines for filing tax returns. Such a deviation should be disfavored unless compellingly justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In determining the meaning of \u00a7 1308(a), the court also looks beyond its language to \"the specific context in which that language is used\", including, most obviously, to \u00a7 1308's other provisions.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p340\">\n    519 U.S. at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p340\">\n    117 S.Ct. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1308(b)(1) allows the trustee to \"hold open\" the meeting of creditors \"for a reasonable period of time to allow the debtor an additional period of time to file any ... returns\" required by \u00a7 1308(a) that the debtor did not file before the first date on which the meeting of creditors was scheduled to be held. And \u00a7 1308(b)(2) provides that, under limited circumstances, \"the court may extend the filing period established by the trustee under paragraph (1)\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The length of the \"additional period of time\" that the trustee may allow under \u00a7 1308(b)(1) is limited based on whether a non-filed return required by \u00a7 1308(a) was past due when the debtor filed the petition under chapter 13:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [S]uch additional period of time shall not extend beyond-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (A) for any return that is past due as of the date of the filing of the petition, the date that is 120 days after the date of that meeting; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (B) for any return that is not past due as of the date of the filing of the petition, the later of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (i) the date that is 120 days after the date of that meeting; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (ii) the date on which the return is due under the last automatic extension of time for filing that return to which the debtor is entitled, and for which request is timely made, in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00a7 1308(b)(1).

Under such circumstances, the debtor arrives at the first meeting of creditors having failed to file a tax return that became due under nonbankruptcy law before that meeting but was\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   due under nonbankruptcy law when the debtor filed the petition. That unfiled tax return is covered by \u00a7 1308(a), and \u00a7 1308(b)(1)(B) -rather than \u00a7 1308(b)(1)(A) -limits the trustee's power to allow the debtor more time to file that return by holding open the meeting of creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This reading, though, may render \u00a7 1308(b)(1)(B)(ii) superfluous. That clause of subparagraph (B) provides that the trustee may allow the debtor more time to file a return that was not past due when the petition was filed by holding open the meeting of creditors to \"the date on which the return is due under the last automatic extension of time for filing that return to which the debtor is entitled, and for which request is timely made\". If \u00a7 1308(a) only requires the filing of returns due under nonbankruptcy law before the date on which the meeting of the creditors is first scheduled to be held, then it arguably does\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   require the filing of a return for which the general filing deadline falls before that date\n   <strong>\n    if\n   </strong>\n   the return is not due until on or after that date because the debtor obtained an automatic extension of the time for filing that return.

The NBRC also proposed, as a \"safety valve\", allowing the court to extend the return-filing deadline where \"the debtor has made a good faith effort to get returns prepared and filed, but for unanticipated reasons beyond the debtor's control (delay in receiving necessary information from tax authorities or incapacitating injury, for example) has been unable to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 963 &amp; 965.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Between the publication of the NBRC's final report and the enactment of the 2005 Act, members of Congress introduced numerous bills (all of which failed) to impose the requirement that chapter 13 debtors file prepetition tax returns as a condition of plan confirmation. From the first, these bills proposed vesting the trustee with discretion to continue the meeting of creditors \"to allow the debtor additional time to file any unfiled returns\", as the NBRC recommended. E.g., H.R. 3150 \u00a7 517(b)(1), reported in H.R. Rep. No. 105-540, at 111 &amp; n.131 (1998) (citing NBRC,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 961-65). These bills also uniformly offered a safety valve of sorts, proposing, for example, that the court be permitted to \"extend the deadlines set by the trustee\" where \"the failure to file the returns as required is because of circumstances beyond the control of the debtor,\" though only \"upon notice and hearing[ ] and order entered before the lapse of [the] deadline\". See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; see also Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, H.R. 833, 106th Cong. \u00a7 816(b)(1) (as introduced in House, Feb. 24, 1999); Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001, H.R. 333, 107th Cong. \u00a7 716(b)(1) (as introduced in House, Jan. 31, 2001). The basic substance, if not the precise language, of these proposals was codified in \u00a7 1308(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Where these failed bills differ most significantly is in the language they propose for \u00a7 1308(a). The earliest of these bills would have created \u00a7 1308(a) with the NBRC's suggested lookback period but without the conditional middle clause present in \u00a7 1308(a) as ultimately enacted and at issue here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   On or before the day prior to the day on which the first meeting of the creditors is convened under section 341(a) of this title, the debtor shall have filed with appropriate tax authorities all tax returns for all taxable periods ending in the 6-year period ending on the date of filing of the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   H.R. 3150 \u00a7 517(b)(1). A subsequent measure contained the same language but with a reduced (three-year) lookback period. H.R. 833 \u00a7 816(b)(1). Finally, a bill introduced in 2001 in the 107th Congress included both a four-year lookback period and, for the first time, a conditional middle clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Not later than the day before the date on which the meeting of the creditors is first scheduled to be held under section 341(a),\n   <strong>\n    if the debtor was required to file a tax return under applicable nonbankruptcy law\n   </strong>\n   , the debtor shall file with appropriate tax authorities all tax\n   returns for all taxable periods ending during the 4-year period ending on the date of the filing of the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   H.R. 333 \u00a7 716(b)(1) (emphasis added). This language remained unaltered in subsequent measures, including the 2005 Act, and was codified in \u00a7 1308(a). See Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2003, H.R. 975, 108th Cong. \u00a7 716(b)(1) (as introduced in House, Feb. 27, 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Legislative materials suggest that the addition of \u00a7 1308(a)'s conditional clause limited its scope. For example, in April 1999 the House Judiciary Committee reported on a pending bill that included \u00a7 1308(a) without the conditional clause, construing it to require \"a chapter 13 debtor to file\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   Federal, State, and local tax returns for the [applicable] period preceding the filing of the case on or before the first meeting of creditors.\" H.R. Rep. No. 106-123, pt. 1, at 162 (emphasis added) (reporting H.R. 833 \u00a7 816(a) &amp; (b)). But in July 2002 a conference committee formed to reconcile versions of a measure passed by the House and the Senate that both proposed to codify \u00a7 1308(a)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   the conditional clause construed the provision \"to require a chapter 13 debtor file all\n   <strong>\n    applicable\n   </strong>\n   Federal, state, and local tax returns .... by the date on which the meeting of creditors is first scheduled\". H.R. Rep. No. 107-617, at 247 (Conf. Rep.) (emphasis added) (reporting H.R. 333 \u00a7 716(a) &amp; (b)). The conference report states, \"This provision requires a chapter 13 debtor to be\n   <strong>\n    current\n   </strong>\n   on the filing of tax returns for the [applicable] period preceding the filing of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Reports on later measures, including the 2005 Act, similarly describe \u00a7 1308(a) prior to its enactment. See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 108-40, pt. 1, at 208 (2003) (reporting H.R. 975 \u00a7 716(a) &amp; (b)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Less than 2 weeks before the 2005 Act became law, the House Judiciary Committee \"report[ed] favorably thereon,\" describing section 716(a) &amp; (b) of the Act, the enactment of which created \u00a7 1325(a)(9) and \u00a7 1308, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Under current law, a debtor may enjoy the benefits of chapter 13 even if delinquent in the filing of tax returns. Section 716 of the Act responds to this problem. Subsection (a) amends section 1325(a) of the Bankruptcy Code to require a chapter 13 debtor to file all applicable Federal, state, and local tax returns as a condition of confirmation as required by section 1308 (as added by section 716(b)). Section 716(b) adds section 1308 to chapter 13 to require a chapter 13 debtor\n   <strong>\n    to be current on the filing of tax returns\n   </strong>\n   for the four-year period preceding the filing of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 109-31, at 1 &amp; 104 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The House Judiciary Committee's description of \u00a7 1325(a)(9) and \u00a7 1308 is consistent with construing those provisions to refer only to returns that nonbankruptcy law requires the debtor to have filed before the first meeting of creditors. Through the end of this long legislative process the provisions were ultimately directed at the \"problem\" of debtors \"enjoy[ing] the benefits of chapter 13 even if\n   <strong>\n    delinquent\n   </strong>\n   in the filing of tax returns\" by \"requir[ing] a chapter 13 debtor to be\n   <strong>\n    current\n   </strong>\n   on the filing of tax returns for the four-year period preceding the filing of the case\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). As\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   observes, its reading of \u00a7 1308 cannot be harmonized fully with the \"stated intentions\" of Congress, which \"appear to be directed at debtors who are\n   <em>\n    delinquent\n   </em>\n   in filing tax returns, not to debtors whose reason for not filing by the date specified in \u00a7 1308 is because the tax code deadline\n   has not yet arrived.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2597530\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/354/258/\">\n    354 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   264 ; see also\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2597530\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/354/258/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2597530\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/354/258/\">\n    at 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It ... appears that Congress wanted to punish those debtors who were delinquent in filing tax returns, by withholding confirmation until they did so.\"). The more restrictive reading of \u00a7 1308(a) resolves this dissonance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The House Judiciary Committee's report also notes: \"A number of provisions in the act would require debtors to have filed tax returns before a bankruptcy case may continue. Those provisions would help States identify potential claims in bankruptcy cases where they may be owed delinquent taxes.\" H.R. Rep. No. 109-31, at 43-44.\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   takes from this passage that, in enacting \u00a7 1308, \"Congress appears to have wanted to make sure tax returns were filed in order to assist state taxing authorities in determining whether they had claims for delinquent taxes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2597530\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/354/258/\">\n    354 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   260-61 &amp; 264. It is difficult to discern what this passage says about \u00a7 1308 specifically, however, as it seems to refer, quite vaguely, to numerous provisions of the 2005 Act that require debtors to file tax returns before a bankruptcy case may continue. See, e.g., Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act \u00a7\u00a7 436(a) &amp; 442(a), 119 Stat. at 112-13, 115-16 (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(I) &amp; 1116(6)(A) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   One such provision amended \u00a7 521 by adding subsection (j), empowering taxing authorities to compel debtors to file delinquent tax returns that come due postpetition, without regard to whether \u00a7 1308(a) requires the filing of the same returns as a condition of plan confirmation. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201112\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 720. Section 521(j) states that, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of [title 11],\" the court must dismiss or convert a case \"if the debtor fails to file a tax return that becomes due after the commencement of the case or to properly obtain an extension of the due date for filing such return,\" the taxing authority requests dismissal or conversion based on that failure, and \"the debtor does not file the required return or obtain the [referenced] extension ... within 90 days\". \u00a7 521(j)(1) &amp; (2). Given \u00a7 521(j), reading \u00a7 1308(a) not to apply to returns that nonbankruptcy law requires the debtor to file with appropriate tax authorities on or after the date on which the meeting of creditors is first scheduled to be held does not detract from the apparent intentions of Congress \"to assist state taxing authorities\" and \"create a strong incentive for debtors\" to file delinquent tax returns. See\n   <em>\n    French\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2597530\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/354/258/\">\n    354 B.R. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court overrules the trustee's objection to plan confirmation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9) to the extent based on the debtors' failure to file tax returns that were due to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service on or after the date on which the meeting of creditors was first scheduled to be held.
