The Court is not deciding the Motion in its entirety. Rather, the Court's ruling today covers eight of the 26 Bucket One Customers (as defined herein) where the factual record is most developed and hopefully should offer some general guidance for the other Customers (as defined herein) going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When the Debtors filed their motion to approve use of cash collateral [ECF No. 10 ] back in November 2018, they received more than 40 objections and responses from customers (collectively, the \"Customers\" and each a \"Customer\") claiming ownership interests in raw metals and other assets that the Debtors believe constitute property of the estate. In January, the Court entered an order establishing uniform procedures to resolve such ownership disputes in an efficient and systematic way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 395. Consistent with such procedures, the Debtors and Senior Lenders\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   grouped the Customers into different \"buckets\" and filed this Motion to address the claims made by the Customers in so-called Bucket One.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mar. 21, 2019 Hr'g Tr. at 32:8-10 [ECF No. 872 ] (\"The debtor lenders [sic] would like to bring forward dispositive motions on certain issues-we've been talking about buckets, concurrently while discovery is going on.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the Debtors, Bucket One is comprised of Customers who sold raw materials to the Debtors pursuant to the Debtors' \"Standard Terms and General Operating Conditions,\" which are attached as Exhibit B (with respect to the Debtor formerly known as RMC) and Exhibit C (with respect to the Debtor formerly known as RMC2) to the Amended Declaration of Scott Avila in Support of the Motion (the \"Avila Declaration\" or \"Avila Decl.\") [ECF No. 1005 ].\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. Broadly, the Debtors and the Bucket One Customers disagree as to whether the terms signed by the Bucket One Customers (the \"Executed Terms\") provide for a purchase and sale or a bailment of the Bucket One Customers' metals. The Debtors argue that the Executed Terms unambiguously evidence a purchase and sale and that no extrinsic evidence need be or even can be considered. The Bucket One Customers argue that the contracts contain elements of both sale and bailment, requiring the Court to look at the parties'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   course of dealing. The Bucket One Customers further posit that the Debtors' course of dealing with each of them evidences bailment relationships. The Bucket One Customers submitted supporting evidence in varying degrees, with some submitting no evidence at all.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Alex Morningstar Corp.'s Joinder in \"Bucket 1\" Customers' Joint Opposition to Debtors' and Senior Lenders' Joint Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 1090 ] (attaching a declaration from their principal describing course of dealing with RMC and supporting documentation in the form of transaction documents from a typical sale)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Joinder of Pyropure, Inc. d/b/a Pyromet in \"Bucket 1\" Claimants' Response to and Brief Opposing Joint Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 1083 ] (stating their intent to join in the Joint Response to Debtors' and the Senior Lenders' Joint Statement of Mutual Undisputed Facts (the \"Joint Response\") [ECF No. 1081 ], but offering no declaration, exhibits, or any other evidentiary support).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Notwithstanding the Debtors' claim that all 26 Bucket One Customers signed \"standard\" terms, there are actually multiple iterations of such terms, with some Bucket One Customers having signed no terms at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Avila Decl., Composite Ex. D. Cognizant of this issue, the Court has reviewed Composite Exhibit D to identify Bucket One Customers who are similarly situated and where there is a sufficiently developed factual record for a ruling. Based on that review, the Court has separated out for a ruling today those Bucket One Customers for whom the Debtors have submitted a complete set of Executed Terms with RMC. These eight Customers-a group that the Court will refer to as the \"Silo One Customers\"-are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Alex Morningstar Corp. d/b/a Morningstar's;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Bay Area Metals;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Brilliant Jewelers / MJJ Inc.;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Geib Refining Corp.;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Mitchell Levine (Erie Management Partners, LLC) (Plat/Co.);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Noble Metal Services, Inc.;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Pyropure, Inc. d/b/a Pyromet; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Texas EZPAWN, L.P.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Silo One Customers do not have identical Executed Terms, but any differences in such terms are immaterial for purposes of today's ruling. For the avoidance of doubt, today's ruling does not encompass Bucket One Customers for whom the Debtors did not attach a complete set of Executed Terms with RMC or any Executed Terms at all. Nor does it encompass Bucket One Customers whose Executed Terms pertain to RMC2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Rule 7065-1 (the \"SUF\") [ECF No. 939 ], which relies on the Avila Declaration for evidentiary support. In the SUF, the Debtors and Senior Lenders explain how customers from all over the United States and the Western Hemisphere shipped unrefined material, primarily containing gold and silver, to the Debtors for refining, and how the Debtors would then refine this material and produce refined silver and gold bars and casting grains.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUF \u00b6 15 (citing Avila Decl. \u00b6 5).

Nor did any of the Silo One Customers provide affidavits claiming that they had insufficient information to dispute Debtors' facts, as required by Rule 56(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Even though many Silo One Customers failed to submit appropriate evidence, the one thing that they did provide was the Joint Response. But the Joint Response does not change the result here. In response to the Debtors' summary of their refining process as set forth in the SUF, the Silo One Customers do not dispute the central facts relied upon by the Debtors. The Joint Response states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The Customers do not dispute the general description of the refining process set forth in No. 17 ; however the Customers dispute the contentions in No. 17 to the extent the Debtors and the Senior Lenders contend that Debtors had the right to move a Customer's goods from assay testing into refining absent the Customer's express agreement, negotiated and reached on a lot-by-lot basis, to do so. The Customers also dispute the contention regarding the sale or transfer of Refined Product to the mint to the extent the Debtors and Senior Lenders contend that there could or was any such sale of a given Customer's refined metal absent such Customer's express agreement, negotiated and reached on a case by case basis, for such sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Joint Response \u00b6 17. Likewise, in response to Debtors 'position that they cannot identify the raw materials delivered by Customers after they were commingled with other lots for refining and during and after the dissolution process, the Silo One Customers respond:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The Customers dispute the contentions in No. 18 to the extent the Debtors and Senior Lenders contend that the raw material delivered by a customer could not be identified as the goods of that customer after comingling [sic] but before the goods were actually put into the refining process; the contentions in No. 18 are otherwise not disputed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Joint Response \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Thus the Silo One Customers do not, at any point, dispute the fact that their raw metals were commingled with other Customers' raw metals after commencement of the refining process. Nor do the Silo One Customers dispute that they delivered to the Debtors varying lots for refinement-different metals that went through an assay process to determine their level of purity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Response \u00b6 15 (\"The Customers do not dispute that the Debtors refined precious metals, primarily gold and silver; that Customers shipped unrefined material to Debtors for refining; nor that Debtors refined the materials and produced bars and casting grains.\"), \u00b6 17 (\"The Customers do not dispute that, [after raw materials were received by the Debtors, they were assigned lot numbers, weighed, melted, sampled for assay testing and put into the refining process, generally on the same day].\").
