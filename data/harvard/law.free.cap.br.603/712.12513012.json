WILES, UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is the motion (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Remand Motion\n   </strong>\n   \") of the plaintiff Stanley Waleski to remand this legal malpractice proceeding to the Court of Common Pleas in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, which is where the action originally was filed. Waleski asks, in the alternative, that this Court abstain from hearing his claims. The Remand Motion is opposed by defendants Montgomery, McCracken, Walker &amp; Rhoades, LLP (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Montgomery Firm\n   </strong>\n   \"), Leonard A. Busby (a current partner of the Montgomery Firm), and Natalie D. Ramsey (a former partner of the Montgomery Firm).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Waleski alleges that during the bankruptcy cases of Tronox Incorporated and its affiliates the defendants committed legal malpractice in their representation of Mr. Waleski and a class of other persons who had been exposed to chemicals (primarily creosote) emitted from a plant located in Avoca, Pennsylvania (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Avoca Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n   \"). Most of the claims are based on allegations that the defendants should have ensured that the Avoca Plaintiffs' recoveries in the bankruptcy case were not diluted by the allowance of claims filed on behalf of persons who alleged injuries based on creosote emissions from a different Tronox-related plant located in Mississippi. Mr. Waleski also alleges that the defendants should have objected to the settlement of a fraudulent transfer claim, the proceeds of which were used to fund payments to tort victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The action filed by Mr. Waleski was removed to federal court and was later transferred to this Court. Mr. Waleski now contends that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding. I disagree. The alleged wrongs committed by the defendants involved the performance of bankruptcy-specific tasks and the assertion of bankruptcy-specific objections and rights, and the dispute between the parties did not exist - and could not have existed - outside of the context of the Tronox bankruptcy cases. The dispute also implicates the integrity of the bankruptcy process and in certain respects requires the interpretation of prior orders and rulings of this Court. I therefore find that I have subject matter jurisdiction. I also decline to abstain from hearing Mr. Waleski's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 11, 2018, Waleski filed his complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The following facts are taken from the complaint and are assumed true only for purposes of the motion that is before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Avoca Plaintiffs' Claims and the Montgomery Firm's Services\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff, Stanley Waleski, is a resident of Pennsylvania who resides in Luzerne County. He filed this action on behalf of himself and a class of Avoca Plaintiffs that is alleged to have approximately 4,300 members. The Montgomery Firm is a Pennsylvania limited liability partnership, and the individual defendants are citizens of Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 2005, the Avoca Plaintiffs began initiating lawsuits in the Court of Common Pleas in Luzerne County, through attorneys they hired for the state-court litigation. In January 2009, however - before the claims in the Pennsylvania actions were adjudicated - Tronox and various affiliated companies filed voluntary chapter 11 petitions. The Pennsylvania cases were automatically stayed by the bankruptcy filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Avoca Plaintiffs' state-court attorneys retained the Montgomery Firm in January 2009 to represent the interests of the Avoca Plaintiffs in the Tronox bankruptcy case. The terms of the retention were memorialized in a contingent fee agreement. The agreement provided that the Montgomery Firm would \"represent the interests of the [Avoca Plaintiffs] in the bankruptcy proceedings of Tronox, Incorporated, and all related entities, now pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 09-10156.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 27. According to the plaintiff, one of the particular tasks entrusted to the Montgomery Firm was \"to take steps to protect against any intrusion\" from \"potential claims from property owners in Mississippi who were represented by an aggressive lawyer from that state.\"\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sometime later, the Montgomery Firm also undertook to represent Michael E. Carroll, one of the Avoca Plaintiffs who served as a member of the official creditors' committee. The complaint alleges that in the course of that representation, while \"[a]cting in [their] official capacity as bankruptcy court-approved counsel for [ ] Carroll,\" the defendants \"took responsibility for drafting trust documents.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. The purpose of the trust was to compensate victims of exposure to various contaminants and to satisfy various environmental liabilities. The trust documents established separate sub-funds for various types of claims and contemplated that the assets in each sub-fund would be distributed\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   to the claimants who held the designated types of claims. More particularly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Fund A was established for the benefit of Allowed Asbestos Claims, Allowed Future Tort Claims, and Allowed Unaccounted-for Tort Claims;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Fund B was established for the benefit of Allowed Indirect Environmental Claims;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Fund C was established for the benefit of Allowed Property Damage Claims; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Fund D was established for the benefit of Allowed Non-Asbestos Toxic Exposure Claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Avoca Plaintiffs, as victims of creosote exposure, held claims that fell into category D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trust documents also included Trust Distribution Procedures that outlined the process by which claims could be made against the trust and the ways in which allowed claim amounts would be calculated.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Ex. D, Form of the Tort Claims Trust Distribution Procedures, Plan Supplement [Dkt. 2343] at 63. The trust documents, including the Trust Distribution Procedures, were incorporated into the confirmed plan of reorganization (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Plan\n   </strong>\n   \") in the Tronox cases and were approved by Judge Gropper of this Court in November 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Confirmation Order [Dkt. No. 2567] \u00b6 85. Both the Plan and the Confirmation Order provided that this Court retained jurisdiction over all matters arising out of the Tronox bankruptcy case, including the jurisdiction to \"hear and determine disputes arising in connection with the interpretation, implementation or enforcement of the Plan or the Confirmation Order, including disputes arising under agreements, documents or instruments executed in connection with the Plan.\" Plan, Article XI;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Confirmation Order \u00b6 159.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The complaint alleges that the defendants sought to charge the Tronox estate for the services they provided in connection with the drafting of the trust documents and the Trust Distribution Procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 54. The confirmed Plan explicitly acknowledged the role of both Carroll and the Defendants in the case and approved an award of compensation in the amount of $200,000. Subparagraph E of Article XII of the Plan noted the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Tronox recognizes that Creditors' Committee member Michael E. Carroll contributed substantially to the formulation and development of the Plan and in connection with the support of Holders of Tort Claims for the Plan. Accordingly, Tronox agrees that, on the Effective Date, subject to supporting documentation being provided to counsel to each of Tronox, the Backstop Parties and the Creditors' Committee, Tronox shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of Mr. Carroll's counsel, Montgomery, McCracken, Walker &amp; Rhoads, LLP, for services rendered and to be rendered in connection therewith up to a maximum of $200,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plan, Art. XII (E);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Confirmation Order [Dkt. No. 2567] \u00b6 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Subsequent Events\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendants purported to end their representation of the Avoca Plaintiffs shortly after the confirmation of the Plan, though the complaint alleges that the Avoca Plaintiffs and their state-court attorneys did not consent to that termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 57. At that time, there were strong doubts as to whether there would be significant distributions from the trust to tort claimants. This is because the trust was to be funded mainly by a share of proceeds from a pending fraudulent transfer litigation, and that litigation had not yet been resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A few years later, the fate of the trust - and that of the tort claimants - significantly\n   brightened. In November 2014, the District Court approved a settlement payment of $5.15 billion into the Tronox estate. That settlement followed a lengthy trial of certain fraudulent transfer claims in the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tronox Inc. v. Kerr-McGee (In re Tronox Inc.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666732\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/503/239/#p248\">\n    503 B.R. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248-49 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2013). The confirmed Plan provided that 12% of the litigation proceeds would be allocated to the tort victim trust, and so the trust received approximately $599 million of the settlement proceeds. Most of the trust assets (84.53%) ultimately were allocated to Fund D for the benefit of holders of Allowed Non-Asbestos Toxic Exposure Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   One term of the settlement of the fraudulent transfer claims was a requirement that the District Court issue a permanent injunction that would bar tort claimants from asserting claims against Tronox-related entities (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Injunction\n   </strong>\n   \"), thereby effectively requiring them to look to the trust for compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tronox Inc. v. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (In re Tronox Inc.)\n   </em>\n   , Case. No. 14-cv-5495 (KBF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205825308\">\n    2014 WL 5825308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. November 1, 2014). The District Court approved the settlement and issued the Injunction. In doing so, the District Court also overruled objections from certain of the Mississippi claimants that the $5.15 billion fraudulent transfer settlement payment was too low and that the alleged poor quality of\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   legal representation should defeat the settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Other Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In April 2015, the trustee of the tort victim trust requested further instructions from this Court concerning the handling of the Mississippi claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion of Tort Claims Trustee, Garretson Resolution Group, Inc. for Instructions [Dkt. No. 3030]. The Mississippi claims (like the Avoca Plaintiffs' claims) were based on alleged exposures to creosote. The Trustee's motion was prompted by complaints by the Avoca Plaintiffs that the Mississippi claims had originally been filed as \"nuisance\" claims and that they should be treated only as \"Category C\" property damage claims for purposes of the trust, and not as \"Category D\" non-asbestos toxic exposure claims. They also complained that a large number of Mississippi claims had been filed as an impermissible \"group\" proof of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In June 2015, this Court granted the request for instructions. The Court held that the Mississippi Claimants were entitled to assert \"Category \"D\" claims and that the Trustee had properly allowed those claims. The Court also held that the Avoca Plaintiffs lacked standing to complain about the \"group\" proof of claim, and that in any event that the objection to the filing of the \"group\" claim was without merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion as to Tort Claims Trustee's Motion for Instructions [Dkt. No. 3046] at 15-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In September 2015, the Avoca Plaintiffs moved to reinstate their pre-petition claims in Pennsylvania state court (which were stayed when Tronox filed for bankruptcy) to the active docket, seeking further recoveries from an entity that had formerly been the ultimate parent of certain Tronox debtors. In February 2016, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that the Avoca Plaintiffs' suit was in violation of the Injunction that the District Court had issued.\n   <em>\n    Tronox Inc. v. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (In re Tronox Inc.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259601\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/549/21/#p50\">\n    549 B.R. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50-51 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). The District Court ordered the Avoca Plaintiffs to dismiss the pending Pennsylvania actions with prejudice, and otherwise enjoined them from pursuing claims that had been released as part of the settlement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259601\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/549/21/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259601\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/549/21/#p50\">\n    at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Proceeding that is Now Before this Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In April 2018, Mr. Waleski filed the instant suit against the Montgomery Firm and the two individual defendants. The complaint seeks approximately $620 million in damages plus statutory interest and costs. Mr. Waleski contends that the defendants fell short of their professional obligations to the Avoca Plaintiffs and that, as a result, the Avoca Plaintiffs received smaller recoveries on account of their tort claims than they otherwise would have received. More particularly, he has made the following criticisms of the actions (or inactions) of the defendants conduct during the course of the Tronox cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Waleski complains that after the Montgomery Firm agreed to represent the Avoca Plaintiffs in the Tronox bankruptcy, it also entered into the representation of Michael E. Carroll in his capacity as a member of the Unsecured Creditors' Committee, and thereafter served as \"bankruptcy court-approved counsel\" for Carroll.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 53. Mr. Waleski contends that this representation created a conflict of interest that required the defendants to act in the interests of all creditors and not just in the interest of the Avoca Plaintiffs. There is no allegation that this representation was unknown to the Avoca Plaintiffs at the time, and at oral argument Mr. Waleski's counsel conceded that Mr. Carroll himself was a member of the Avoca Plaintiff class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 17, 2019 Hr'g Tr. 18:2-7, 15-22. However, Mr. Waleski's counsel asserted at oral argument that the Montgomery Firm had not provided a sufficient explanation, to the Avoca Plaintiffs, of the potential consequences of the firm's representation of Mr. Carroll.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259601\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/549/21/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Waleski contends that the Montgomery Firm, in its capacity as counsel to Mr. Carroll, assisted with the drafting of the Trust Distribution Procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 58. He asserts that the Montgomery Firm should have drafted procedures that would have separately classified the Avoca Plaintiffs' claims and that would have provided better treatment of the Avoca Plaintiffs' claims in comparison to other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Waleski asserts that the defendants should have objected to the \"omnibus\" proof of claim filed on behalf of the Mississippi claimants, and contends that if they had done so on a timely basis the claim would have been disallowed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 62, 73. The complaint argues that this Court's 2015 decision regarding the group proof of claim should be interpreted as merely holding that the Avoca Plaintiffs no longer had standing to raise the issue in 2015, and not as a ruling on the merits of the objection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Waleski contends that the defendants should have objected to the $5.15 billion settlement of the fraudulent transfer litigation on the ground that it was not sufficient to ensure full payment of all of the Avoca Plaintiffs' claims, and that if such an objection had been filed then such full payment could and would have been obtained.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 67, 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Mr. Waleski's suit was removed by the defendants to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Mr. Waleski sought to remand the case back to state court, and the defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to the Southern District of New York. The District Court for Middle District of Pennsylvania granted the transfer motion and declined to decide the Remand Motion so that it could instead be resolved by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order,\n   <em>\n    Waleski v.

The drafting of the trust procedures, which addressed the respective rights of entire classes of tort and environmental creditors, was an integral part of a bankruptcy plan, and was born out of bankruptcy law and bankruptcy proceedings and the need (in the context of those proceedings) to classify claims and to provide mechanisms for their resolution.

For example, the complaint alleges that a different outcome would have been possible if the defendants had objected to the Mississippi \"omnibus\" claim, and it further alleges that this Court's prior ruling on this issue was merely a holding that the Avoca Plaintiffs lost standing to object to the claims once the Plan was confirmed.

The Magistrate who recommend that this action be transferred to this Court correctly recognized that in these respects the underlying claims will \"involve analyzing and potentially questioning the bankruptcy court's own resolution of the Avoca Plaintiffs' objections, and the distribution that the Avoca Plaintiffs eventually received.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report and Recommendation,\n   <em>\n    Waleski v.

However, it is fundamental to the bankruptcy process that similarly situated creditors are treated similarly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11 U.S.C. \u00b6 1122(a) (providing that, subject to subsection (b), \"a plan may place a claim or interest in a particular class only if such claim or interest is substantially similar to the other claims or interests of such class\");\n   <em>\n    In re Ames Dep't Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9262969\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/306/43/#p54\">\n    306 B.R. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54 (Bankr.

S.D.N.Y. 1991) (refusing a movant's request to treat a claim in a manner that \"would violate the principle that all similarly situated creditors should share equally\"). The gist of Mr. Waleski's claims is that the equal treatment of the Mississippi claims under the confirmed plan and under the approved trust procedures - and also under this\n   Court's 2015 order - were not the products of fundamental justice, or of the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, but instead were only the results of bad lawyering. Just as a bankruptcy court has \"arising in\" jurisdiction where claims implicate the integrity of sales processes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re HRNC Dissolution Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205299468\">\n    2015 WL 5299468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6, so too does it have \"arising in\" jurisdiction where claims implicate the integrity of the confirmation process and of the fairness and propriety of the allocations of available assets among similarly situated creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   These points, taken together, make clear that \"[i]t is somewhat disingenuous for [the Avoca Plaintiffs] to attempt to pry these claims out of their bankruptcy setting.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Southmark Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11785392,11775052\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/925/\">\n    163 F.3d at 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Waleski's counsel urges the Court to limit\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   and its progeny to cases in which claims are made against estate fiduciaries. This would be unavailing, as noted above, because the complaint itself alleges that the defendants drafted trust procedures on behalf of the estate as court-approved counsel. In any event, I do not find that factor to be controlling. I find for the reasons stated above that the Court's \"arising in\" jurisdiction over a malpractice claim should be based on the circumstances giving rise to the claim and the extent to which the claim is integrally related to the bankruptcy process, and should not be based solely on who the defendant is and who the defendant primarily represented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Waleski similarly argues that there is no \"arising in\" jurisdiction because an attorney's duties to a client are based on state law and because the malpractice claim is asserted under state law. A similar contention was rejected by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703346,3770287\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/346/\">\n    613 F.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"the determinative issue\" is not whether the professional's duty to a client had its origin in state law, but instead \"whether claims that appear to be based in state law are really an extension of the proceedings already before the bankruptcy court\"). The determination of whether \"arising in\" jurisdiction exists should be based on the facts that allegedly gave rise to the claim. As noted above, the alleged errors and misdeeds in this case all involved bankruptcy-specific matters and could only have arisen \"in\" the bankruptcy context. The claims also implicate the integrity of the orders and creditor treatments approved by this Court in the Tronox bankruptcy cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   It is true that the mere fact that conduct took place during a bankruptcy case is not enough to provide \"arising in\" jurisdiction. Waleski has cited, for example, to a number of decisions that involved conduct that occurred during a bankruptcy case but did not involve the performance of bankruptcy-specific tasks and/or that did not challenge the outcomes of a bankruptcy case in ways that implicated the integrity of the bankruptcy process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown Media Corp. v.

That might be a powerful factor if the contention were that this Court has jurisdiction only because the matter allegedly is \"related to\" the Tronox cases. Here, however, the contention is that the claims arose \"in\" the Tronox case. \"A court's jurisdiction 'does not evaporate with the closing of a bankruptcy case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sterling Vision, Inc. v.

It is the subject matter of the claims, and not the timing of the lawsuit, that determines whether \"arising in\" jurisdiction exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Waleski argues that malpractice cases frequently are decided by a different court than the one in which the malpractice allegedly occurred. That may be true, but the issue presently before me is whether this Court has jurisdiction, and not whether another court would be precluded from hearing the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the Defendants have met their burden to show that federal subject matter jurisdiction exists over Waleski's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pullman Co. v.

To be sure, this conclusion does not mean that every malpractice claim made by a creditor against a professional in connection with a bankruptcy case automatically falls within the ambit of a bankruptcy court's jurisdiction. It is the nature of the claims asserted here, and the actions and orders on which they are based, that give rise to this Court's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Waleski has also argued that this Court should abstain from hearing his claims and should allow them to move forward in the Pennsylvania state court. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   So-called \"mandatory abstention\" rules plainly do not apply. Section 1334(c)(2) of title 28 provides, in applicable part, that the court \"shall abstain\" from hearing a claim \"related to a case under title 11 but not arising under title 11 or arising in a case under title 11\" if the claim could not otherwise have been heard in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). Because \"arising in\" jurisdiction exists over the plaintiff's claims, mandatory abstention is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Under section 1334(c)(1), this Court has the authority and the discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a proceeding \"in the interest of justice or in the interest of comity with State courts or respect for State law[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

I simply note that if there is a right to a jury trial then such a jury trial could be held before this Court if the parties were to consent to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Alternatively, the reference could be withdrawn and the District Court could conduct the jury trial if that were necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, an order will be issued denying the Remand Motion and denying the request for abstention. The parties are directed to negotiate a scheduling order that will govern how this action will proceed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Defendants at one point argued that Waleski's claims are \"related to\" the prior bankruptcy cases but their counsel withdrew that contention at oral argument and acknowledged that the defendants' sole jurisdictional argument is that the underlying claims \"arose in\" the Tronox bankruptcy cases.
