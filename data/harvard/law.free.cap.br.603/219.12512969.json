Cruickshank, the plaintiff and chapter 7 trustee of the bankruptcy estate of Blast\n   Fitness Group, LLC (\"BFG\"), seeks damages and injunctive relief against over forty named defendants including Harold R. Dixon, who controlled BFG, and dozens of unnamed John Doe defendants. The trustee has pleaded facts which, if true, demonstrate the implementation of a plan by Mr. Dixon and other defendants he controlled to deprive, divert, and transfer valuable assets and profit opportunities from BFG, ultimately resulting in BFG's filing of a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on January 26, 2016, at which time its debts exceeded $ 16 million. This adversary proceeding was commenced two years after the petition date on January 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Dixon has filed a motion to dismiss 19 of the 23 counts against him for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), per Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Mr. Dixon seeks dismissal of count I (constructive fraudulent transfer under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B) ), count II (actual fraudulent transfer under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A) ), count III (constructive fraudulent transfer under Massachusetts Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"MFTA\") \u00a7 5(a)(2)), count IV (constructive fraudulent transfer under MFTA \u00a7 6(a)), count V (actual fraudulent transfer under MFTA \u00a7 5(a)(1)), count VI (turnover under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 542(b) ), count VII (\"turnover\" under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 550 ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   count VIII (unjust enrichment), count X (statutory reach and apply/ Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 550 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20214%2C%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    Mass.

He does not seek dismissal of the remaining counts against him for breach of fiduciary duty and theft of corporate opportunity (count XXVI), corporate waste (count XXVII), breach of duty to preserve assets, deepening insolvency (count XXVIII) and costs (XXX). He does not address count XV (breach of fiduciary duty) in his motion to dismiss, and I will not address that count here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the outset, I note that the trustee does not contest dismissal of counts VI, VIII, XVII, XX, XXI, XXIII or XXIX.

Mr. Borghi operated various Work Out World (\"WOW\") health clubs with Tony Beninati and, when Mr. Beninati died, with his widow, Elizabeth Beninati. \u00b6 71. Mr. Borghi allowed Mr. Dixon to learn about the discount fitness center business by giving him access to the offices and proprietary information of WOW. \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 14, 2011, CapeCapital LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company (\"CapeCapital\"), formed BFG, acting through Mr. Dixon. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 74. BFG is also a Massachusetts limited liability company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   CapeCapital, a defendant in this adversary proceeding, was the sole manager of BFG, and Mr. Dixon, in turn, was the sole manager and a member of CapeCapital. \u00b6 3. At its peak, BFG owned and operated over sixty fitness clubs bearing its name throughout the United States. (Intro., p. 2). At all relevant times, BFG acted at the direction of CapeCapital and Mr. Dixon, who held himself out as CEO of BFG. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 92. BFG owned, entirely or partially, seventeen subsidiaries through which it operated its business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6 53. Fitness clubs at different locations were often operated through separate BFG subsidiaries, and those subsidiaries were often the actual tenants under the applicable leases\n   for the premises. \u00b6\u00b6 251-52, 255-56. At all times relevant to the claims and causes of action alleged in the complaint, BFG was insolvent and insufficiently capitalized. \u00b6\u00b6 310-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2011, Messrs. Dixon and Borghi were operating various health clubs in New England using the WOW trade name, which triggered a dispute with Ms. Beninati. \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, 79. Mr. Dixon, Mr. Borghi and BFG hired Mr. Dixon's longtime personal lawyer at the law firm of Goodwin Procter LLP (\"Goodwin\"), a defendant in this action, to represent them in negotiations with Ms. Beninati in April 2011. \u00b6 80. Negotiations failed, and Ms. Beninati commenced a Massachusetts state court lawsuit against Mr. Dixon, Mr. Borghi and BFG on May 24, 2012, seeking millions of dollars in damages. \u00b6\u00b6 79, 376. Goodwin represented Mr. Dixon, BFG and Mr. Borghi in that litigation. \u00b6\u00b6 107, 376. In July 2014, the state court entered judgment against Messrs. Dixon and Borghi. \u00b6\u00b6 88, 315. Final judgment against them in excess of $ 4.5 million entered on January 9, 2015. \u00b6\u00b6 90, 317.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The Bally Transaction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2011, Goodwin performed additional legal work for BFG, including in connection with BFG's acquisition and transfer of fitness clubs, the formation of various limited liability companies (LLCs) ancillary to those acquisitions and transfers and the drafting of corporate and transactional documents. \u00b6\u00b6 102-03, 105-07. In 2012, at the time the Beninati dispute was active, BFG was engaged in negotiations with Bally Total Fitness Inc. to purchase from it thirty-nine work-out clubs and certain real estate. \u00b6 105. Goodwin and two of its attorneys, who are also defendants (collectively the \"Goodwin Defendants\"), acted as counsel to BFG and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Blast Fitness Acquisition, LLC (\"Blast Acquisition\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   in that transaction, and in that capacity participated in drafting an asset purchase agreement dated April 10, 2012. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 110, 113. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, BFG was to receive three pieces of commercial real estate from Bally located in Maryland Heights, Missouri, West Hartford, Connecticut and Irving, Texas which were to be \"sold pursuant to the terms of a separate purchase agreement ... for an aggregate purchase price of $ 1,000,000 to an entity identified by [BFG] prior to Closing.\" \u00b6\u00b6 62-63, 118. Three of the thirty-nine work-out clubs proposed to be purchased by BFG (through Blast Acquisition) operated at these locations. \u00b6\u00b6 114, 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On or prior to April 12, 2012, Mr. Dixon planned to designate entities not owned by BFG to take title to the Bally real estate. \u00b6\u00b6 131-133. On April 25, 2012, he formed CapeCapital Maryland Heights, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company, CapeCapital West Hartford, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company, and CapeCapital Irving, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, all of which were managed by Mr. Dixon and effectively owned by him (collectively, the \"Cape Real Estate Entities\"). \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20, 22, 62, 145, 152, 157, 164. None of these entities was owned by BFG. \u00b6\u00b6 62, 163-64. The Cape Real Estate Entities are defendants in this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To raise part of the cash needed to complete the Bally transaction, the members of BFG agreed to sell a preferred membership interest in BFG to the Dixon Family Limited Partnership (an affiliate of Dixon and also a defendant in this action). \u00b6\u00b6 138-39. The Goodwin Defendants drafted and presented to BFG and its members\n   a member consent dated April 27, 2012, which provided in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   WHEREAS, the Members and Managers [of BFG] are seeking to raise additional capital for the Company for purposes including, but not limited [sic], financing the growth of the Company's business through the acquisition, from Bally Total Fitness Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\"Bally\") and certain of ts [sic] affiliates, of operating assets\n   <strong>\n    and real property associated with additional health club facilities (the \"Bally Acquisition\") by a direct subsidiary of the Company.\n   </strong>\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=736%20N.E.2d%20373\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This consent was presented to BFG's members at a time when Mr. Dixon and the Goodwin Defendants were already planning to transfer the Bally real estate to entities not owned by BFG. \u00b6 140. Members of BFG, including Mr. Borghi, relied on the member consent when they approved the admission of the Dixon Family Limited Partnership as a member of BFG and allowed the Bally transaction to move forward. \u00b6 142. They did so believing that BFG would receive the Bally real estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086275\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/592/#p594\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to emails exchanged between Goodwin attorneys and Bally's counsel on April 12, 2012, the Goodwin Defendants knew by that date that Mr. Dixon wanted to designate entities not owned by BFG to take title to the Bally real estate. \u00b6\u00b6 131-133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Bally transaction closed on April 30, 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and on or by that date, Bally had sold the Bally real estate, worth over $ 4 million, to Mr. Dixon's LLCs, the Cape Real Estate Entities, for approximately $ 1 million. \u00b6\u00b6 62, 146, 153, 158. Mr. Dixon used BFG funds to subsidize his purchase of the Bally real estate. \u00b6\u00b6 63, 146, 153, 158, 178. Following the Cape Real Estate Entities' acquisition of the real estate, CapeCapital and Mr. Dixon directed BFG and/or its subsidiaries to enter into leases with the Cape Real Estate Entities and to make \"potentially over-market\" lease payments to them for the BFG clubs operating at the three Dixon-controlled properties at a time when BFG was insolvent, enabling Mr. Dixon to receive rent payments from BFG at inflated rates. \u00b6\u00b6 63, 166, 181-83.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the direction of Mr. Dixon, the Cape Real Estate Entities sold the properties to third parties in separate transactions on December 31, 2013, June 26, 2014 and December 31, 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 148, 151, 154, 156, 159, 161, for prices significantly in excess of their purchase prices, with the proceeds being distributed to Mr. Dixon or to unknown John Doe defendants. \u00b6\u00b6 148, 149, 154, 155, 159, 160. The Cape Real Estate Entities breached their lease agreements with BFG and/or its subsidiaries by terminating these leases prematurely to facilitate the sale of the Bally real estate, and Mr. Dixon and CapeCapital directed the closing of clubs at those locations for that purpose. \u00b6\u00b6 150, 156, 161, 184.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

Lexfit, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company, and Newfit, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, both managed by Mr. Dixon and/or CapeCapital,\n   were two of these entities. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, 103, 273. Both are defendants in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 6, 2012, Mr. Dixon, CapeCapital and another defendant transferred sixteen of BFG's more profitable fitness clubs to Lexfit for no or nominal consideration. \u00b6\u00b6 274, 276. On January 30, 2013, Mr. Dixon, CapeCapital and another defendant transferred an additional eight of BFG's more profitable clubs to Newfit, including a club located in Bridgeview, Illinois. \u00b6 283-84. BFG did not receive full consideration for these transfers. \u00b6 285. Also on January 30, 2013, Lexfit transferred eight of the clubs received from BFG in the December 2012 transaction to Newfit for less than full consideration. \u00b6\u00b6 289, 291, 293. On a date not specified in the complaint, Mr. Dixon and another defendant claimed they had provided a $ 1 million cash infusion to BFG for the acquisition of the Bridgeview club in a separate transaction which they later recharacterized as a loan. \u00b6 297.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

On or about December 24, 2012, the Dixons conveyed, for no or nominal consideration, real property located at 25 Green Lane, Weston, Massachusetts to Michael J.

On or around December 24, 2012, Mr. and Ms. Dixon conveyed real property located at 120 Point Isabella Road, Barnstable, Massachusetts to Ms. Dixon, individually, for no or nominal consideration. \u00b6 337. On May 12, 2015, Mr. and Ms. Dixon transferred real property located at 63 Cart Path Road, Weston, Massachusetts to Mr. Craffey, as trustee of 63 Cart Path Road Nominee Trust, for no or nominal consideration (the four above named \"GST\" trusts and the two nominee trusts shall be collectively referred to as the \"Dixon trusts\"). \u00b6 338.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     7.

At the direction of Mr. Dixon and CapeCapital, BFG would shut down a profitable club, transfer the club's assets-owned by a particular subsidiary of BFG-to one of its other wholly owned subsidiaries and leave the now asset-less subsidiary with its liabilities. \u00b6\u00b6 247, 255, 262. The transferred assets included, membership lists, club equipment, cash, receivables in the form of electronic funds transfers for scheduled membership payments, which were drawn from members' accounts, and other assets. \u00b6 255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A large number of BFG's creditors are landlords who leased space to wholly-owned entities of BFG. \u00b6 248. The landlords relied on guaranties from BFG, third party guarantors, or other obligors under the leases. \u00b6 249. BFG purchased workout clubs from sellers (such as Bally), assumed the sellers' obligations under existing leases and often breached its obligations to remove the sellers as obligors under the leases. \u00b6\u00b6 250, 359. When clubs were shut down, the subsidiary, which was the actual tenant under the lease, would stop making rent payments to the landlord. \u00b6 256. The landlord would sue the tenant, only to find that the assets of the tenant had been transferred to another subsidiary of BFG. \u00b6 257. Landlords, guarantors, and obligors, including Bally, then pursued fraudulent transfer, indemnification and other claims against BFG and others. \u00b6\u00b6 198, 232, 257, 359-60. A large number of the claims in BFG's bankruptcy case arose in this manner. \u00b6 257. With respect to one closed fitness center located in Irving Park, Illinois, Mr. Dixon and another defendant \"just took the money from the equipment for themselves,\" leaving third party guarantors with no assets to satisfy the guaranties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6 363.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   From 2014 to 2016, BFG was involved in numerous lawsuits commenced by landlords and others for unpaid rents and other lease defaults. \u00b6\u00b6 186, 198-199, 231-33, 261.

Fraudulent Transfer Claims Generally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In his complaint, the trustee alleges numerous fraudulent transfers involving multiple defendants, including Mr. Dixon. In counts I through V, he asserts claims against Mr. Dixon and other defendants under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A) and (B) (counts II and I, respectively) which permit a trustee to avoid actual and constructive fraudulent transfers, and under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 544(b) (counts III, IV and V) which permits a trustee to \"avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding [an allowed unsecured claim]....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The \"applicable law\" here is the Massachusetts Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"MUFTA\"), Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 109A. Pursuant to MUFTA \u00a7\u00a7 5(a)(2) and 6(a), the trustee seeks avoidance of constructive fraudulent transfers (counts III and IV) and pursuant to MUFTA \u00a7 5(a)(1), he seeks avoidance of transfers committed with actual fraudulent intent (count V).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trustee fails to identify which transfers he seeks to avoid in the respective fraudulent transfer counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Dixon asserts that counts I through V should be dismissed because the trustee has failed to allege that BFG transferred any property to him. The trustee responds that he has sufficiently alleged that Mr. Dixon was a direct transferee of BFG's assets, a subsequent transferee of other transfers, and that Mr. Dixon is also liable as a \"transferor\" of his personal assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As stated above, the complaint does not set forth which of the numerous alleged fraudulent transfers are applicable to specific counts in the complaint or to specific defendants. The trustee's opposition to Mr. Dixon's motion to dismiss provides clarification. The transfers the trustee seeks to avoid, in which Mr. Dixon was involved, consist of 1) BFG's transfer of its right to acquire the Bally real estate; 2) BFG's payment to Mr. Dixon of executive compensation; 3) BFG's transfer of gym equipment and proceeds to Mr. Dixon; and 4) transfers made (or obligations incurred) by BFG resulting from Mr. Dixon's recharacterization of his investment in BFG as a loan. Additionally, the trustee seeks to hold Mr. Dixon liable as a subsequent transferee of real estate sale proceeds he received from the Cape Real Estate Entities, above-market rent payments made by BFG (or its subsidiaries) to those entities, and payments from Mr. Eskandarian resulting from transfers of BFG's profitable clubs to Lexfit and Newfit. Lastly, the trustee asserts fraudulent transfer claims against Mr. Dixon as a transferor of his personal assets to his wife and the Dixon trusts.

With respect to the Bally real estate, BFG's alleged transfer of its right to acquire the properties took place in 2012, well before the two year \"reach back\" period under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548. Although I will consider the voidability of that transfer with reference to the MUFTA, it cannot form the basis of a fraudulent transfer claim under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548 due to the temporal restrictions of the statute. With respect to the other alleged direct transfers, I find that the trustee has not pleaded sufficient facts to support plausible avoidance claims under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548 or the MUFTA. The trustee has pleaded no facts concerning the dates or amounts of compensation allegedly received by Mr. Dixon from BFG or its subsidiaries and has provided no dates or amounts of the alleged transfers of gym equipment to Mr. Dixon. Although he alleged facts about Mr. Dixon's involvement in transferring assets among BFG subsidiaries, he alleged only conclusory statements that Mr. Dixon directly received proceeds and gym equipment. Likewise, the trustee has provided no details or substance to support his allegations that, in connection with the Bridgeview club acquisition, Mr. Dixon \"recharacterized\" a cash infusion in BFG as a loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to each of the foregoing, he relies on vague and conclusory statements which are insufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss. Accordingly, I will not consider those claims in connection with any fraudulent transfer count in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The trustee's allegations concerning Mr. Dixon's receipt of real estate sale proceeds from the Cape Real Estate Entities and his receipt of above-market rent payments made by BFG to those entities emanate from the original 2012 transfer of BFG's rights in the Bally real estate which took place outside the two year \"reach back\" period under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548. I will discuss below Mr. Dixon's status as a transferee of those transfers under the MUFTA, which has a four year \"reach back\" period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, \u00a7 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   With respect to the trustee's allegations that BFG transferred profitable clubs for little or no consideration to Lexfit and Newfit, some of which were later sold to Mr. Eskandarian with Mr. Dixon receiving annual payments of $ 500,000, the trustee relies in his opposition to the motion to dismiss on the provisions of the MUFTA, not Code \u00a7 548. I will discuss those transfers below with respect to the MUFTA counts. Moreover, the trustee did not reference Code \u00a7 548 in his opposition to the motion to dismiss. Accordingly, I will enter an order allowing Mr. Dixon's motion to dismiss counts I and II against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

Based upon the language of the member consent and asset purchase agreement referenced in the complaint as well as the allegations that BFG paid for the real estate but never acquired it, the trustee has asserted a plausible claim that, in April of 2012, BFG had a contractual right to acquire the Bally real estate through a wholly-owned subsidiary and that such right constituted an \"asset\" of BFG as defined in MUFTA \u00a7 2. Under the MUFTA's broad definition of \"transfer,\" which includes \"direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary\" transfers of an asset or an interest in an asset, the trustee has also sufficiently alleged that BFG transferred its right to acquire the Bally real estate to the Cape Real Estate Entities, which were not owned by BFG, and did so for the benefit of Mr. Dixon who controlled those entities. The complaint also sufficiently alleges that no consideration was received by BFG as a result of these transfers, that the Bally real estate was worth $ 4 million at the time of the conveyances, and that BFG paid the purchase price even though the Cape Real Estate Entities actually acquired the properties. Accordingly, I find sufficient allegations that BFG did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfers. Finally, the complaint further alleges that BFG was, at all times, insolvent and insufficiently capitalized. In particular, the transfer of BFG's rights in the Bally real estate occurred during BFG's negotiations with Ms. Beninati and in the month prior to her commencing litigation against BFG seeking millions of dollars in damages. By the date of the transfers, BFG plausibly should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay when due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The complaint states a plausible claim for constructive fraudulent transfer under MUFTA \u00a7 5(a)(2) and 6(a) with respect to the transfer of BFG's rights in the Bally real estate to the Cape Real Estate Entities. As the trustee has also pleaded that Mr. Dixon controlled the Cape Real Estate Entities, the trustee has also sufficiently pleaded that Mr. Dixon was the party \"for whose benefit [the] transfer was made\" under MUFTA \u00a7 9(b)(1) and Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 550(a)(1). \" 'The party who forces a debtor to make a transfer is almost always 'the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made ....' \"\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

The complaint contains no allegations concerning the rent amounts charged, the amounts or dates of the rent payments made by BFG (or its subsidiaries), or why the leases should be considered above-market.

Although the trustee argues in his brief that the claims against the Dixon trusts are \"derived from\" the fraudulent transfers of Mr. Dixon when he was \"misappropriating money and property stolen from [BFG],\" the complaint's allegations do not support that contention. There are no allegations in the complaint that Mr. Dixon used any funds or property received directly or indirectly from BFG to acquire, gain equity in, or improve the Weston and Barnstable real estate he conveyed in 2012 and 2015. Moreover, the trustee failed to sufficiently plead that Mr. Dixon received compensation from BFG in any amount during the periods in question.

To the extent the trustee relies on the broad definition of \"debtor\" in MUFTA \u00a7 2 as someone who is \"liable on a claim,\" I interpret that term in the context of this adversary proceeding to mean the debtor in bankruptcy, BFG. The trustee does not yet have a judgment against any defendant in this adversary proceeding and thus no defendant is yet \"liable\" on the trustee's claims. BFG, on the other hand, is currently liable for millions of dollars of third party creditor claims. To permit the trustee to seek avoidance of transfers made by persons who\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be liable on a claim because they are named defendants in an adversary proceeding would constitute an expansion of the trustee's powers beyond that contemplated by Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 544(b) and 548(a) (the trustee may avoid a transfer of \"an interest of the debtor in property\") and 704(a)(1) (the trustee shall \"collect and reduce to money the property of the estate ....\").

The trustee has sufficiently supported his claims with specific allegations concerning Mr. Dixon's pervasive control over the Cape Real Estate Entities, Lexfit, Newfit, and CapeCapital (and their control over BFG), all of which were managed by Mr. Dixon directly and/or by CapeCapital, of which he was the sole manager and a member.
