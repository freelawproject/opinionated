In other words, Comcast sought to have its claim treated as fully secured and paid in full. The Network contested this election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under the Network's Plan, Comcast Lender's tangible collateral-cash, accounts receivable, furniture, fixtures, and equipment-was to be abandoned or sold. (ECF No. 1041 at 6 ).

Comcast Lender's intangible collateral-the Comcast Affiliation Agreement-would remain with the Network. (ECF No. 1041 at 6 ). The Network argued that Comcast could not make an \u00a7 1111(b) election because the Affiliation Agreement was of \"inconsequential value.\" (ECF No. 1040 at 7 ). The Court agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To value the Affiliation Agreement, the Court used a discounted cash flow analysis-the method proposed by both parties' experts. (ECF No. 715 at 82 ). The Court projected the Network's net income through 2032, discounted it to present value, and apportioned it among the Network's intangible assets in proportion to the revenue that each asset would generate each year.\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Reg'l Sports Network, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    886 F.3d at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Using the discounted cash flow method, the Court determined that the value of the Affiliation Agreement, as of the effective date of the Plan, was $54,274,740.00. (ECF No. 715 at 92 ). However, the Court adopted the holding of\n   <em>\n    In re Stembridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042408,9167085\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/383/\">\n    394 F.3d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388 (5th Cir. 2004), and valued the collateral as of the petition date.\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Reg'l Sports Network, L.P.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    886 F.3d at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In choosing the petition date, the Court \"apportioned income to agreements that did not exist as of the petition date based on the probability that such agreements would come to fruition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Court assumed a 100% likelihood that Comcast would close its merger with Time Warner Cable, which provided that Time Warner Cable would carry the Network by April 1, 2016, and the Court also assumed, with varying degrees of probability, that other carriage agreements with programming distributers, such as Dish and Suddenlink, would also agree to carry the Network. (ECF No. 715 at 89-90 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In evaluating the Affiliation Agreement as of the petition date, this Court applied a 9.5% discount rate, used by both experts, to the $54,274,740.00 effective-date valuation. (ECF No. 715 at 92 ). It then deducted the Team's waived media-rights fees from the Network's income in the period between the petition and the effective date, concluding that the Affiliation Agreement was of inconsequential value. (ECF No. 715 at 94 (\"As a result, I find that the value of the Comcast contract, as of the petition date, was zero.\")). \"Because a creditor cannot make an \u00a7 1111(b) election as to collateral of 'inconsequential value,' Comcast was unable to have its claim treated as fully secured.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Reg'l Sports Network, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    886 F.3d at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Comcast appealed the Court's decision to the District Court.

Section 506(a)(1) essentially boils down to two considerations: (i) the purpose of the Affiliation Agreement's valuation, and (ii) the Network's proposed use or disposition of the Affiliation Agreement under the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    I. What was the purpose of the Affiliation Agreement's valuation?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under the Plan, the Network proposed to retain the Affiliation Agreement. Before the Plan was confirmed, Comcast made an \u00a7 1111(b) election, asking to have its claim be treated as fully secured and paid in full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to retain the Affiliation Agreement and confirm the Plan, the Network invoked the Code's cram-down provision, \u00a7 1129(b). The Fifth Circuit highlighted \u00a7 1129(b)'s application in the context of \u00a7 506(a). It stated that often \u00a7 506 is used in conjunction with other provisions of the Code, including \u00a7 1129(b), \"which requires valuation of collateral in the context of plan confirmation when the debtor retains possession of the collateral.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Reg'l Sports Network, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    886 F.3d at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[I]t is \u00a7 506 that instructs the court on how to make the initial valuation, before the collateral's present value is calculated under \u00a7 1129.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \" Section 1129 merely uses that value to set a floor for what sum the creditor must receive in deferred cash payments while the debtor retains possession of the collateral.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    at 529-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This Court found that the petition date was the proper point of valuation under the facts of this case. (ECF No. 715 at 80 ). This Court's finding remains undisturbed under the Fifth Circuit's remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In choosing to follow the flexibility approach to valuation, the Fifth Circuit highlighted that in order to decide the appropriate date for valuation, courts must \"take into account the development of the proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Reg'l Sports Network, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    886 F.3d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Comcast's conduct throughout the bankruptcy proceedings informed the Court's decision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 715 at 80 (finding the petition date reasonable because a flexible approach requires the Court to determine \"a fair date and a date that really takes into account the realities of the case ....\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Comcast and the Network entered into the Affiliation Agreement in 2010, approximately three years before various Comcast entities filed an involuntary Chapter 11 petition against the Network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Reg'l Sports Network, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    886 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   526 ; (ECF No. 1041 at 4 ). As of the petition date, the Affiliation Agreement had in fact generated some revenue, but according to the Network \"not nearly enough to pay the amount owed ... to the Teams to license their media rights, let alone cover the Network's operations.\" (ECF No. 1040 at 4 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In filing the involuntary Chapter 11 against the Network, Comcast alleged it was under \"the belief that the chapter 11 process would permit the Network to reorganize, thus preserving the Network's value and the jobs of many employees.\" (ECF No. 326 at 1 ). As part of that belief, Comcast offered to purchase the Network and pay all debts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 715 at 80 (\"This case commenced on Comcast's representations that all creditors would be paid in full, and that there would be money left over for equity.\")). Comcast's assurances created a focus in the case, bringing to the forefront both the Affiliation Agreement with the Network and the media-rights agreements with the Teams both of which were at issue in the case. However, Comcast's assurances never came to fruition. On March 17, 2014, Comcast determined it would not bid to acquire the Network. (ECF No. 326 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 792 at 107 (\"Comcast ... changed its course of conduct and decided that, rather than having an outcome that it had assured us in the beginning of the case would be one where every creditor was paid in full, including the Teams, and that it would make that purchase, altered it and changed course in the middle of the case.\")). If the Court had chosen the effective date as the proper point of valuation, it would have ignored the realities of the case-the Affiliation Agreement had a proposed use or disposition on the date the Network entered bankruptcy, and its proposed use or disposition changed as a consequence of Comcast's actions or inactions. Thus, in order for the Court to \"take into account the development of the proceedings\" it must look to the petition date as the proper point of valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    II. What was the Network's proposed use or disposition of the Affiliation Agreement?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Affiliation Agreement between Comcast Cable Communications, LLC, and the Network was originally made so that \"Comcast would carry the Network on its cable systems through 2032, in exchange for a monthly fee based on the number of Comcast subscribers.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Reg'l Sports Network, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    886 F.3d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 526. The Fifth Circuit noted that \"[u]nder the Plan, the Network [would] be able to use\n   the Affiliation Agreement to generate revenue free and clear of the previously outstanding media-rights fees, as the Teams [had] agreed to waive them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516451\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/523/#p526\">\n    at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
