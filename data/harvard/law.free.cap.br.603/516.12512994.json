(POC# 7)\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 139] (the \"Motion\") filed by Coralee Edwards (the \"Debtor\") and the initial response thereto [ECF No. 145] filed by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\"). After the February 11, 2019 hearing, at the Court's direction, Wells Fargo filed a supplemental response to the Motion at ECF No. 168 and the Debtor filed a reply to the supplemental response at ECF No. 170. Without Court authorization, Wells Fargo then filed a second supplemental response at ECF No. 171, responding to the Debtor's reply at ECF No. 170.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In July 2013, with the assistance of counsel, the Debtor filed a voluntary chapter 13 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wells Fargo timely filed proof of claim number 7-2 in the total amount of $ 132,331.91. The claim is secured by a mortgage on the Debtor's principal residence. Wells Fargo's proof of claim reflects prepetition arrearages in the amount of $ 15,846.30 and ongoing mortgage payments in the amount of $ 1,045.03 per month. The Debtor did not file an objection to Wells Fargo's claim. As detailed below, the Debtor treated the claim through a confirmed chapter 13 plan. In July 2018, after five years without missing a plan payment, the Debtor satisfied all conditions of the confirmed plan. There is no dispute that the Debtor paid all prepetition arrearages owed to Wells Fargo. ECF Nos. 132 and 144. However, the Debtor and Wells Fargo dispute whether the Debtor is current with post-petition mortgage payments consistent with section\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   1322(b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to confirming a plan, the Debtor attempted to modify Wells Fargo's secured claim through the Court's mortgage modification mediation process. ECF Nos. 18 and 20. The Debtor's initial plan through the Debtor's fifth amended plan provided for adequate protection payments to Wells Fargo in the amount of $ 500.00 per month. ECF Nos. 11, 26, 37, 43, 62, and 74. In April 2014, nine months into the case, the Debtor and Wells Fargo failed to reach an agreement through the mortgage modification mediation. ECF No. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In July 2014, the Debtor filed a sixth amended plan, electing for the first time to cure the prepetition arrearage owed to Wells Fargo and to maintain post-petition mortgage payments consistent with the original documents. ECF No. 80. The Debtor then filed a series of amended plans with the same treatment for Wells Fargo. ECF Nos. 85, 88, and 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2014, the Debtor filed a tenth amended plan [ECF No. 91] (the \"10AP\"). The 10AP provided for cure of all prepetition arrearages and for post-petition mortgage payments to Wells Fargo in the amount of $ 500.00 for months 1 through 12 (to reflect the Debtor's previously paid adequate protection payments) and $ 1,181.29 for months 13 through 60, for a total amount of $ 62,701.92 in post-petition mortgage payments during the period covered by the 10AP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wells Fargo received notice of the 10AP and the hearing thereon, and did not object to its confirmation. After a hearing, on September 29, 2014, the Court confirmed the Debtor's 10AP. ECF No. 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In April 2015, the Debtor filed a motion to modify the 10AP. ECF No. 107. While Wells Fargo received notice of the motion to modify and the hearing thereon, ECF No. 109, the text of the motion to modify did not propose any change to the treatment of Wells Fargo's secured claim. In connection with the motion to modify, the Debtor filed five modified plans. ECF Nos. 106, 110, 111, 112, and 113. Each of these modified plans provided for maintenance of post-petition mortgage payments in the amount of $ 963.57 for months 1 through 22 and $ 1,092.14 for months 23 through 60, for a total amount of $ 62,699.86 in post-petition mortgage payments. This total amount is $ 2.06 less, overall, than the total amount presented in the 10AP. Wells Fargo received notice of each of these modified plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early July 2015, after the hearing on the motion to modify, the Debtor filed a sixth modified plan [ECF No. 114] (the \"6MP\"), which provided for post-petition mortgage payments in the amount of $ 716.69 for months 1 through 22 and $ 1,092.14 for months 23 through 60, for a total amount of $ 57,268.50 in post-petition mortgage payments. This total amount is $ 5,433.42 less than the total amount presented in the 10AP. Wells Fargo received notice of the 6MP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 20, 2015, the Court granted the Debtor's motion to modify and confirmed the 6MP. ECF No. 115. There is no dispute that Wells Fargo received notice of the motion to modify, the hearing thereon, each of the modified plans, including the 6MP, as well as the Court's order granting the Debtor's motion to modify and confirming the 6MP. Wells Fargo did not object to the Debtor's motion to modify or to confirmation of the 6MP. Wells Fargo did not appeal the Court's order confirming the 6MP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 5, 2018, nearly four years after the Court confirmed the 6MP, the chapter 13 trustee filed the notice of plan completion and notice of final cure payment. ECF Nos. 131 and 132. Wells Fargo filed an objection to the trustee's notice of final cure payment, stating that the Debtor is\n   not current on post-petition mortgage payments consistent with section 1322(b)(5). ECF No. 144. In that objection, Wells Fargo asserts that, as of March 15, 2018, the Debtor was delinquent $ 4,810.37 on post-petition mortgage payments. It is unclear why this sum is a few hundred dollars smaller than the difference between the total provided in the 10AP and the total provided in the 6MP. In any case, the amount now claimed unpaid by Wells Fargo is not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 1, 2018, the Debtor received a discharge. ECF No. 147.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the course of the Debtor's plan, Wells Fargo filed five notices of mortgage payment change pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002.1. Based on the parties' briefs, it does not appear that the mortgage payment changes reflected in those notices had any material impact on the dispute now before the Court. Nonetheless, four of the notices of mortgage payment change were filed after the Court confirmed the 6MP. The Debtor did not file motions to modify the 6MP in order to conform to the amounts provided in the notices of payment change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the Motion, among other things, the Debtor asks the Court to deem current the Debtor's post-petition mortgage obligations due to Wells Fargo as of July 2018, the month in which the chapter 13 trustee made the final payment under the 6MP. The Debtor argues that Wells Fargo received notice of the motion to modify, the hearing thereon, each of the modified plans, including the 6MP, and the Court's order granting the motion to modify and confirming the 6MP. Because Wells Fargo failed to object to confirmation of the 6MP or appeal the Court's order confirming the 6MP, the Debtor argues that the 6MP is\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and that Wells Fargo is bound by the terms of the 6MP. The Debtor relies on section 1327(a) and\n   <em>\n    United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor also claims that she was not required to file an objection to Wells Fargo's proof of claim prior to confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, Wells Fargo argues that the Debtor is not current with post-petition mortgage obligations consistent with section 1322(b)(5) and asks the Court to order that the post-petition delinquency of $ 4,810.37 is valid and enforceable against her. Wells Fargo argues that its timely filed proof of claim, which the Debtor never objected to, is prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of its allowed claim. Wells Fargo also argues that the 6MP violates section 1322(b)(2) by modifying its allowed claim secured by a mortgage on the Debtor's principal residence. Wells Fargo relies on\n   <em>\n    Universal Am. Mort. Co. v. Bateman (In re Bateman)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9120643,9113431\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/821/\">\n    331 F.3d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2003).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before the February 11, 2019 hearing on the Motion, counsel who represented the Debtor through each and every step of this chapter 13 case, from filing the voluntary petition through confirmation of the 6MP and the filing of the present Motion, filed a motion to withdraw based on irreconcilable differences. The Court set the motion to withdraw for hearing on February 11, 2019 to be heard along with the Motion. Because the Debtor appeared at the February 11, 2019 hearing with new counsel, the Court permitted former counsel to withdraw, ECF No. 169, and new counsel to argue the Motion. When asked about the delinquency on post-petition mortgage payments resulting from the terms of the 6MP, former counsel stated that the relevant portion of the 6MP included a \"scriveners error,\" meaning that certain of the payment amounts shown in the 6MP were unintentionally changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 1322(b) permits the debtor to include certain terms in a chapter 13 plan. Section 1322(b) provides, in relevant part, that a plan may:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) modify the rights of holders of secured claims,\n   <em>\n    other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence\n   </em>\n   , ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (5) notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, provide for the curing of any default within a reasonable time and maintenance of payments while the case is pending on any unsecured claim or secured claim on which the last payment is due after the date on which the final payment under the plan is due[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (emphasis added). While section 1322(b)(5) permits a debtor to cure prepetition arrearages and maintain post-petition mortgage payments under a plan, section 1322(b)(2) prohibits any other modification of a homestead mortgagee's rights in the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A homestead mortgagee's rights in a chapter 13 plan typically are determined by the timely filing of a proof of claim and the claims objection process. Pursuant to section 502(a), a timely filed proof of claim \"is deemed allowed, unless a party in interest ... objects[.]\" Although section 502(a) does not provide a deadline for a party in interest to file an objection to a creditor's claim, such an objection must be filed prior to confirmation of the plan.\n   <em>\n    In re Bateman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9120643,9113431\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/821/\">\n    331 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   827 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Justice Oaks II, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6119784,10541173\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/898/1544/\">\n    898 F.2d 1544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1553 (11th Cir. 1990) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Starling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11202278\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/251/908/#p909\">\n    251 B.R. 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909-10 (Bankr.

P. 3001(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The order confirming a chapter 13 plan is a final order subject to appeal.\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1327(a) describes the effect of confirmation: \"The provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor\n   is provided for by the plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, has accepted, or has rejected the plan.\" Section 1327(a) thus gives\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect to a confirmed chapter 13 plan. Indeed, the binding effect of section 1327(a) goes beyond that of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . As Collier on Bankruptcy explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [T]he binding effect of a chapter 13 plan extends to any issue actually litigated by the parties and any issue necessarily determined by the confirmation order, including whether the plan complies with sections 1322 and 1325 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Wells Fargo filed a proof of claim, secured only by an interest in real property that is the Debtor's principal residence, providing for prepetition arrearages and post-petition mortgage payments. The Debtor did not object to Wells Fargo's claim. While the Debtor's confirmed 6MP provides for the cure of all prepetition arrearages owed to Wells Fargo, it provides for post-petition mortgage payments in an aggregate amount less than the amount provided in\n   Wells Fargo's allowed claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wells Fargo did not object to confirmation of the 6MP. Wells Fargo did not appeal the Court's order confirming the 6MP. The Debtor satisfied all terms of the 6MP and received a discharge. Pursuant to section 1327(a) and consistent with\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , Wells Fargo is bound by the terms of the 6MP, even though the 6MP violates the anti-modification provision of section 1322(b)(2).\n   <em>\n    In re Passavant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734973\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/444/378/#p385\">\n    444 B.R. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385 (Bankr. S.D. Ohio 2010) (relying on section 1327(a) and\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   in granting a motion to deem post-petition mortgage obligations current, \"even if the banks were correct that the provisions of the Plan ... violated the Code [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , sections 1322(b)(2) and 1328(a)(1) ] ). Wells Fargo is deemed to have been paid all post-petition mortgage payments provided for in, first, the 10AP and, later, the 6MP. In other words, the post-petition delinquency of $ 4,810.37 is unenforceable against the Debtor. \"Upon satisfaction of the plan and completion of the plan's terms, the debtor is discharged of his or her debts and, in theory, faces a future of solvency.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Bateman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9120643,9113431\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/821/\">\n    331 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   826 (citing section 1328).

After the Court confirmed the 6MP, Wells Fargo filed four separate notices of mortgage payment change, consistent with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002.1. On the one hand, it is unclear whether the Debtor had an affirmative duty to further modify the confirmed plan in response to each of the notices of payment change.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had the Debtor done so, the error in the 6MP may have been brought to light. This did not happen. On the other hand, Wells Fargo filed four notices of payment change that indicated monthly payments at odds with the 6MP and what it was actually receiving, and did nothing about it. Wells Fargo slept on its rights to object to the 6MP, to appeal the Court's confirmation order, or to ask the Court to compel modification of the 6MP to match the notices of payment change. Even if the rules of equity apply in this instance, neither party would gain from their application. In the end, the Court finds no reason to diverge from the terms of the 6MP as confirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the forgoing reasons, the Court ORDERS and ADJUDGES as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   1.
