The Sale Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 30, 2009, Old Carco LLC (\"Old Chrysler\") commenced bankruptcy cases by filing voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court in this District. Old Chrysler and New Chrysler entered into a Master Transaction Agreement (the \"MTA\") by which New Chrysler agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets of Old Chrysler.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A-114-A-291. The Bankruptcy Court approved the transaction set forth in the MTA, as amended, and the sale closed on June 10, 2009 (the \"Sale Order\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A-062-A-113. Numerous Alabama state entities, including the Alabama Secretary of State, received notice of the sale, and none chose to object to entry of the Sale Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Service of Sale Hearing, Bankr. Docket No. 930, at p. 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Sale Order authorized the transfer of the purchased assets \"free and clear of all Claims except for Assumed Liabilities\" (as defined in the MTA) and free of successor liability. Sale Order \u00b6 9, A-088. It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Except for the Assumed Liabilities expressly set forth in the Purchase Agreement or described therein or Claims against any Purchased Company, none of the Purchaser, its successors or assigns or any of their respective affiliates shall have any liability for any Claim that (a) arose prior to the Closing Date, (b) relates to the production of vehicles prior to the Closing Date or (c) otherwise is assertable against the Debtors or is related to the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date.... Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not have any successor, derivative or vicarious liabilities of any kind or character for any Claims ... now existing or hereafter arising, asserted or unasserted,\n   fixed or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated. Sale Order \u00b6 35, A-102-A103.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 2.09 of the MTA enumerated, \"for the avoidance of doubt,\" certain \"Excluded Liabilities\" that New Chrysler did not assume.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A-476. They included \"all Product Liability Claims arising from the sale of Products or Inventory prior to the Closing.\" MTA \u00a7 2.09(i), A-133. The MTA broadly defined an excluded Product Liability Claim as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   any Action arising out of, or otherwise relating to in any way in respect of claims for personal injury, wrongful death or property damage resulting from exposure to, or any other warranty claims, refunds, rebates, property damage, product recalls, defective material claims, merchandise returns and/or any similar claims, or any other claim or cause of action, whether such claim is known or unknown or asserted or unasserted with respect to, Products or items purchased, sold, consigned, marketed, stored, delivered, distributed or transported by [Old Chrysler].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   MTA Definitions Addendum, at p. 90, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to MTA, \u00b6 36, A-216. On Nov. 19, 2009, the parties in the bankruptcy proceeding amended section 2.08(h) to the MTA to expand the scope of Assumed Liabilities relating to Product Liability Claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A-292-A-311. As amended, New Chrysler assumed liability for post-closing accidents involving vehicles manufactured and sold by Old Chrysler before the closing, but the assumption expressly excluded liability for punitive damages. Under the amendment (\" Amendment No. 4\"), Assumed Liabilities included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (i) all Product Liability Claims arising from the sale after the Closing of Products or Inventory manufactured by Sellers or their Subsidiaries in whole or in part prior to the Closing and (ii) all Product Liability Claims arising from the sale on or prior to the Closing of motor vehicles ... solely to the extent such Product Liability Claims (A) arise directly from motor vehicle accidents occurring on or after Closing, (B) are not barred by any statute of limitations, (C) are not claims including or related to any alleged exposure to any asbestos-containing material or any other Hazardous Material and (D) do not include any claim for exemplary or punitive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   MTA, Amendment No. 4, \u00b6 1, A-299.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

See\n   </em>\n   Overton Br. at 31, 34. However, the fact that recovery can occur based on mere negligence does not change the punitive nature of the damages.

It states that Assumed Liabilities under the MTA do \"not include any claim for exemplary or punitive damages.\" MTA, Amendment No. 4, \u00b6 1, A-299. Exemplary\n   and punitive damages are legal terms that are commonly used and well-understood. They are damages intended to punish the wrongdoer and deter future wrongdoing, rather than damages designed to compensate a victim. Black's Law Dictionary defines \"punitive damages\" as \"[d]amages awarded in addition to actual damages when the defendant acted with recklessness, malice, or deceit; specifically,\n   <em>\n    damages assessed by way of penalizing the wrongdoer or making an example to others\n   </em>\n   ,\" and \"exemplary damages\" as a synonym. Damages, Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) (emphasis added). Similarly, Merriam-Webster's defines punitive damages as \"damages awarded in excess of compensatory damages or nominal damages\n   <em>\n    to punish a defendant for a gross wrong\n   </em>\n   ,\" and \"exemplary damages\" as a synonym. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2019) (emphasis added). Nor does the lack of a definition of the terms in the MTA render it ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Am. Soc'y of Composers, Authors &amp; Publishers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274786\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/566/#p573\">\n    309 F. Supp. 2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (\"the mere fact that a contractual term is undefined does not render it ambiguous\"). Accordingly, the MTA is unambiguous that claims for \"for exemplary or punitive damages,\" meaning claims intended for damages that are designed to punish and deter wrongdoing, are barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Sale Order And The MTA Bar Claims Under The Alabama Wrongful Death Act.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court then applied settled Alabama law to the terms of the Sale Order and the MTA. As discussed above, damages under the Wrongful Death Act are punitive, and are not compensatory. This type of recovery, punitive or exemplary damages, is barred by the Sale Order and the MTA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTA, Amendment No. 4, \u00b6 1, A-299. The Bankruptcy Court therefore properly concluded that under the terms of the Sale Order and the MTA, Overton's wrongful death claims are barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Public Policy Clause In The MTA Does Not Save Overton's Claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Overton makes a final argument-that a public policy exception in the MTA saves his claims. Amendment 4 provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [i]f any term or other provision of this Amendment is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, then to the maximum extent permitted by Law, all other conditions and provisions of this Amendment shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A-300-A-301. The term \"Law\" is defined as \"any federal, national, international, supranational, state, provincial, local or similar (including of any jurisdiction within or outside the United States) statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, order, requirement or rule of law (including common law).\" A-213. Overton argues that it is against Alabama public policy to bar all wrongful death recovery, and therefore, the \"exemplary or punitive damages\" provision of the MTA cannot be applied to Overton's wrongful death claims. The Court disagrees, and concludes that Overton overstates the scope of Alabama's settled public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To support his argument, Overton cites to several cases noting that Alabama courts have held that insurance contracts cannot exclude punitive damages for wrongful death, thereby eliminating coverage for the underlying claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411099\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/804/1107/#p1109\">\n    804 So. 2d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1109 (Ala. Civ. App. 2001) (\"A standard liability policy that excluded coverage for punitive damages in a wrongful-death case would contravene\n   Alabama law.\");\n   <em>\n    Wingard v. Lansforsakringar AB\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:11-CV-45 (WKW),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205493177\">\n    2013 WL 5493177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (M.D. Ala. Sept. 30, 2013). Overton also points to an Alabama Attorney General advisory opinion to the Insurance-Liability State Departments advising, \"[a]ny administrative ruling which allowed insurance companies to exclude coverage for punitive damages under standard liability policies would be in direct contravention of wrongful death caselaw on the subject, and would therefore be void as against public policy of this state as well.\" A-405-A-407.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   However, public policy must be \"well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.\"\n   <em>\n    United Paperworkers Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v. Misco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600957\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/29/#p43\">\n    484 U.S. 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600957\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/29/#p43\">\n    108 S.Ct. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600957\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/29/#p43\">\n    98 L.Ed.2d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Overton points to no authority, such as Alabama legislation, or relevant caselaw, that expands the rationale he relies on for his public policy exception beyond the insurance context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Overton argues that if the Court does not recognize the public policy exception, it will lead to \"absurd results\" where wrongful death claims in other states are permitted under the terms of the MTA, but barred only for an Alabama resident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Overton Br. at 35. However, as the Bankruptcy Court pointed out, this argument is not new. There have been analogous situations involving federal statutes that preclude the recovery of punitive damages-and a cause of action under Alabama's Wrongful Death Act has been barred. In\n   <em>\n    Painter\n   </em>\n   , the personal representative of a decedent's estate brought an action under the Wrongful Death Act against the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2261942\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/476/943/#p944\">\n    476 F.2d at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The action was dismissed because the Wrongful Death Act was limited to the recovery of punitive damages, and punitive damages could not be recovered against the United States or its agencies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2261942\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/476/943/#p944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Fifth Circuit explained that the result that stems from the unique nature of the damages recoverable under Alabama's Wrongful Death statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   It is altogether anamolous [sic] that similarly situated survivors could maintain this action against the TVA under the law of practically any other state while those who have the misfortune of being relegated to the use of Alabama law are permitted no right of action at all. This lack of uniformity of tort responsibility of a federal institution based on the fortuity of geography is irrational.... The aberration in such cases must find its remedy through an appropriate Congressional waiver of the TVA's immunity to punitive damages or by the creation of some uniform federal right of action,\n   <em>\n    or by Alabama's amendment or reinterpretation of its law.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2261942\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/476/943/#p944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2261942\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/476/943/#p944\">\n    at 944-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Springer v.

Alabama courts have treated the damages awardable under the Alabama Wrongful Death Statute as being solely punitive in nature. We are bound by this judicial construction of the purpose and function underlying Alabama's wrongful death statute and ... conclude that an Alabama wrongful death action may not lie against the TVA.\"). While\n   <em>\n    Painter\n   </em>\n   does not control the analysis here, it is instructive. The result in this case flows from the interpretation by Alabama courts of the nature of the damages recoverable under the Wrongful Death Act.
