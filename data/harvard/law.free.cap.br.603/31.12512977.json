They argue that they had no notice of Ms. Dobos' bankruptcy petition or the avoidance of their judgment lien but timely filed their complaint as soon as they became aware of Ms. Dobos' bankruptcy case. They also contend that the bankruptcy court should have construed Ms. Dobos' motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and considered further evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We agree with Ms. Dobos that the bail bondsmen's judgment has expired, so they can no longer enforce the judgment. Therefore, the court was correct to dismiss their nondischargeability complaint, and we AFFIRM. We publish to explain the effect of bankruptcy law on the duration of a prebankruptcy judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Prepetition events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sometime before 2007, Ms. Dobos was arrested, and the bail bondsmen posted a bond to secure her release from custody. Upon meeting Ms. Dobos, Mr. Kassabian realized that she was a \"risk\" and \"immediately ... revoked her bond and ... took her back to jail.\" He stated that he refunded all of her money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Dobos filed suit against the bail bondsmen in state court, which resulted in a $52,000 judgment for attorneys' fees in favor of the bail bondsmen on January 11, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bail bondsmen recorded the judgment, which created a lien against Ms. Dobos' real property located in Tujunga, California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ms. Dobos' chapter 7 petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Over six years later, on October 25, 2013, Ms. Dobos filed a chapter 7 petition. She scheduled as a secured debt the 2007 judgment debt owed to the bail bondsmen totaling $52,437.98. Her mailing matrix included the bail bondsmen's address stated on the 2007 abstract of judgment and the name and address of the attorney, Marshall E. Rosenbach, who had represented the bail bondsmen during the state court proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. Dobos filed a motion to avoid the bail bondsmen's lien on her residence (\"Motion to Avoid Lien\"). She alleged that the residence was worth $250,000 and was subject to a $125,000 first lien in favor of the Los Angeles Housing Authority. She claimed a $175,000 homestead exemption. She sought avoidance of the bail bondsmen's lien under \u00a7 522(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Dobos served the Motion to Avoid Lien via certified mail on Mr. Rosenbach (as \"Attorneys for Harry Kassabian\") at his Beverly Hills, California address and on the bail bondsmen at the Northridge,\n   California address that was listed on the 2007 abstract of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The bail bondsmen did not oppose the Motion to Avoid Lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The bankruptcy court entered an order (\"Lien Avoidance Order\") granting the motion. Ms. Dobos received her discharge on February 3, 2014, and the bankruptcy court closed her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Over a year later, on September 1, 2015, Mr. Kassabian filed a motion to reopen Ms. Dobos' bankruptcy case (\"Motion to Reopen\"). He claimed that he was not served with the notice of the bankruptcy, the Motion to Avoid Lien, or the Lien Avoidance Order, because the addresses that Ms. Dobos used for him and Mr. Rosenbach, while accurate in 2007, were no longer correct nearly seven years later. He stated that he wanted to file an opposition to the Motion to Avoid Lien, a motion to set aside the Lien Avoidance Order, and a nondischargeability complaint. In the Motion to Reopen, Mr. Kassabian emphasized that the reopening \"lacks independent legal significance and\n   <strong>\n    determines nothing with respect to the merits of the case.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Inexplicably, Mr. Kassabian took no steps to prosecute the Motion to Reopen for more than two years. In January 2018, before the court reopened the case, the bail bondsmen filed their adversary complaint. A clerk's note on the docket sheet indicates that the clerk then told the bail bondsmen's counsel to obtain a hearing on the Motion to Reopen, and counsel did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ms. Dobos did not respond to the Motion to Reopen or appear at the hearing on that motion. The bankruptcy court granted the Motion to Reopen on March 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The adversary proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The adversary complaint, filed January 2, 2018, sought to declare the judgment debt nondischargeable under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2), (3)(B), and (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mr. Kassabian attached his declaration to the adversary complaint. He attested that he did not know that Ms. Dobos had filed a bankruptcy petition and did not receive notice of the Motion to Avoid Lien or Lien Avoidance Order. He stated \"that the address and persons upon whom Ms. Dobos had her motion to remove the judgment lien served are or were not my address.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The complaint did not clearly lay out the bail bondsmen's claims. The key paragraph reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Not only was [Ms. Dobos] to pay for [the bail bondsmen's] services, she was to grant a lien on her house in favor of [the bail bondsmen], but after judgment [the bail bondsmen] also had a judgment lien. [Ms. Dobos] contracted to grant a lien and implied therein is the duty to safeguard the \"res\" which she has not, and obtained the agreement to get the bail bond by fraud by agreeing to all of the terms verbally, with no intent to perform, and manipulating the circumstances to attempt to get out of the contract. [Ms. Dobos] has committed malicious prosecution against [the bail bondsmen]. The duty to hold the property and grant the lien for payment to [the bail bondsmen] was a fiduciary duty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Dobos filed an answer generally denying the principal allegations. She asserted a single affirmative defense: \"This Complaint is barred by the applicable statute of limits [sic] 11 U S C 546 (a).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Three months later, Ms. Dobos filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint\n   (\"Motion to Dismiss\"). She made three arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, she argued that she had properly scheduled the judgment debt and that directing the bankruptcy notice and the Motion to Avoid Lien to the bail bondsmen's 2007 address and their state court attorney was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, she contended that the adversary proceeding was untimely under Rule 4007(c), which requires creditors to file complaints to determine dischargeability of certain debts within sixty days after the first \u00a7 341(a) meeting of creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Third, Ms. Dobos argued that the 2007 judgment was no longer enforceable, because under California Code of Civil Procedure section 683.020, it expired ten years after entry. Ms. Dobos argued that the judgment would have expired on January 11, 2017, but, under \u00a7 108(c), it was extended 101 days during the pendency of her bankruptcy case plus thirty days (for a total of 131 days). Thus, she concluded that the judgment expired on May 18, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The only evidence that Ms. Dobos offered in support of her motion was a declaration of her attorney, Andrew Smyth, authenticating copies of the judgment and documents filed in Ms. Dobos' bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The notice of motion attached to the Motion to Dismiss advised the bail bondsmen that, pursuant to Local Bankruptcy Rule 9013-1, any opposition was due fourteen days prior to the hearing. The bail bondsmen did not timely file an opposition to the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The day before the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the bail bondsmen filed an objection to the motion. They argued that the Motion to Dismiss was actually a motion for summary judgment masquerading as a motion to dismiss. They argued that, if it were treated as a motion to dismiss under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), it was untimely, as such motions must be filed before an answer. Similarly, they argued that a defense, including the statute of limitations, not raised in the answer is waived. They also contended that the court should apply issue preclusion, because the court already ruled on the same issues when granting the Motion to Reopen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The opposition to the Motion to Dismiss did not include Mr. Kassabian's declaration attesting to any fact. Instead, it included a declaration by Michael Kwasigroch, his attorney, which merely attached a copy of the answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The hearing on the Motion to Dismiss and the court's ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the bankruptcy court immediately stated that the opposition to the Motion to Dismiss was untimely and that it would not consider it. In addition, the court said that the arguments raised in the opposition concerning summary judgment \"border[ed] on being frivolous.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It rejected the bail bondsmen's arguments that the Motion to Dismiss was really a summary judgment motion. As for the issue preclusion argument, the court stated that reopening the case was a ministerial act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court further stated that the bail bondsmen failed to put forth any evidence that notice was improper. As such, it could only consider the evidence presented in the Motion to Dismiss. The court concluded that the Motion to Dismiss established that the Motion to Avoid Lien was properly served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court entered an order in Ms. Dobos' favor, granting the Motion to Dismiss. The bail bondsmen timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(b)(1) and (2)(I).

The bankruptcy court could consider the Motion to Dismiss as a motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The bail bondsmen argue that the Motion to Dismiss was untimely because it was filed after Ms. Dobos answered the adversary complaint. They contend that the court should have converted the Motion to Dismiss to a motion for summary judgment and that it erred by denying them the opportunity to submit further facts in response to the summary judgment motion, failing to consider the complaint and Mr. Kassabian's declaration, granting Ms. Dobos summary judgment on insufficient evidence, and granting summary judgment by default. All of these arguments are meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   It is true that a Civil Rule 12(b)(6) motion \"must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.\" Civil Rule 12(b) (made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7012). It is not true, however, that a motion to dismiss filed after the answer must be treated as a summary judgment motion. Rather, the Ninth Circuit has made clear that the court must construe a motion to dismiss filed after an answer as a motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elvig v.

Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 683.020, the last day to renew the judgment was January 11, 2017. The parties have not pointed to any federal or state statute that would \"suspend\" the ten-year period. Thus, the \"end of such period\" for purposes of \u00a7 108(c)(1) was January 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The relevant date under \u00a7 108(c)(2) is thirty days after the bail bondsmen had notice of Ms. Dobos' discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Spirtos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196949,11246598\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1079/\">\n    221 F.3d at 1081-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The period during which [creditor] may renew her judgment does not expire until 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the stay in [debtor's] estate.\"); 2 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 108.04[2] (Richard Levin &amp; Henry J. Sommer eds., 16th ed. rev. 2017) (\"[T]his extension continues not simply until 30 days after the termination of the stay, but until 30 days after\n   <strong>\n    notice\n   </strong>\n   of that termination.\"). We do not know the\n   exact date the bail bondsmen had notice of the discharge, but at the outside, they knew of the discharge by September 1, 2015, when they filed the Motion to Reopen. Therefore, the date specified by \u00a7 108(c)(2) was October 1, 2015, at the latest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Thus, the time by which the bail bondsmen could renew their judgment expired on January 11, 2017. Because the bail bondsmen did not renew their judgment by that date, the judgment expired before they filed their adversary complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wussler v.

Idaho 1997) (calculating \u00a7 108(c)'s effect on the time to renew a California judgment in the same fashion as this decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Ms. Dobos argues that \u00a7 108(c) extended the period for the renewal of the judgment by the duration of her bankruptcy case plus thirty days. This is incorrect. Instead, \u00a7 108(c)(2) extends the deadline to thirty days after notice that the automatic stay terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

BAP 2006) (\"\u00a7 108(c)(1) does not operate without regard to existing nonbankruptcy law to stop the running of any periods of limitation\"). Stated differently, \u00a7 108(c) does not extend deadlines by a certain amount of time; rather, it extends deadlines to a certain date. But Ms. Dobos' error is immaterial. Although her interpretation of \u00a7 108(c) was incorrect, the bail bondsmen's judgment expired under the correct reading of that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The bail bondsmen do not claim that they ever renewed the judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   They only argue that, \"as long as the debt was not barred prior to bankruptcy, state statutes of limitations are ignored in determining dischargeability of a debt.\" They state that \"[t]he renewal of the judgment had not passed when the bankruptcy was filed and so it is alive and well.... Further, the renewal of judgment issue was not raised in the answer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The bail bondsmen are patently mistaken. Their argument implies that, if a judgment debtor seeks bankruptcy protection, a California judgment never expires. They offer no authority for this proposition, and no such authority exists. Section 108(c) delays the expiry of judgments, but only for a fixed period under certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Spirtos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196949,11246598\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1079/\">\n    221 F.3d at 1081-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering \u00a7 108(c) and California Code of Civil Procedure section 683.020 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The only authority they cite in support of their position,\n   <em>\n    Banks v.

There, the Ninth Circuit stated that \"[t]he questions before us are whether the state court action was\n   <strong>\n    timely filed\n   </strong>\n   , and whether the filing of that action,\n   <strong>\n    without reducing it to judgment\n   </strong>\n   , was sufficient to establish a debt ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9486058,9489325\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/263/862/\">\n    263 F.3d at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added). Here, there is no question that the state court action was timely filed and that the claim was reduced to judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The bail bondsmen also contend that Ms. Dobos failed to raise the expiration of the judgment in her answer. But Ms. Dobos denied paragraph 12 of the adversary complaint, which contained the bail bondsmen's general allegations concerning the judgment and incorporated Mr. Kassabian's attached declaration that alleged that Ms. Dobos owed him over $100,000. She also raised the \"statute of\n   limits\" and \u00a7 546 as an affirmative defense. This was less than articulate and cited the wrong statute, but the answer as a whole was more than sufficient to inform the bail bondsmen that she contested the timeliness of the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Accordingly, because the judgment expired long before the bail bondsmen filed their adversary proceeding, they can no longer enforce the debt. The bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing the adversary complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

This argument is frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The bail bondsmen themselves stated, in their Motion to Reopen, that reopening a case has no legal significance.
