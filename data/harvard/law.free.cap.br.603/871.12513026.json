(Docket No. 9.) Appellee Scotiabank de Puerto Rico (\"Scotiabank\") opposes G\u00e1ndara's appeal. (Docket No. 10.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMS\n   </strong>\n   the bankruptcy court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 18, 2018, G\u00e1ndara filed a chapter 13 plan in the bankruptcy court. (Bankr. Docket No. 21.) On November 2, 2018, the bankruptcy court scheduled G\u00e1ndara's confirmation hearing for April 2019. (Bankr. Docket No. 36.) On April 3, 2019, the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of G\u00e1ndara's chapter 13 plan because of her \"failure to appear\" and the \"trustee's unfavorable report,\" which had been filed on March 26, 2019. (Bankr. Docket Nos. 63 and 65.) The bankruptcy court notified G\u00e1ndara that pursuant to Puerto Rico Local Bankruptcy Rule 3015-3(g) (\"Rule 3015-3(g)\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [T]he court may dismiss the case, unless within fourteen (14) days after denial of confirmation: (A) the debtor filed an amended plan; (B) the debtor moves to convert the case to another chapter of the Bankruptcy Code; (C) the debtor requests the court to alter or amend the order denying confirmation pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9023 stating with particularity how the issues that prevented confirmation of the proposed plan have been resolved with the trustee and/or the objecting creditor; or (D) the court orders otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   P.R. Loc. Bankr. R. 3015 -3(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because G\u00e1ndara failed to take any action pursuant to Rule 3015-3(g) during the fourteen-day period, the bankruptcy court dismissed her case\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   on May 7, 2019. (Bankr. Docket No. 70.) On May 8, 2019, G\u00e1ndara filed a motion for reconsideration of the bankruptcy court's dismissal. (Bankr. Docket No. 71.) The bankruptcy court denied G\u00e1ndara's motion \"for the reasons in the opposition filed by Scotiabank, which the [bankruptcy] court adopt[ed],\" on June 4, 2019. (Bankr. Docket Nos. 73 and 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 16, 2019, G\u00e1ndara filed a notice of appeal contesting the bankruptcy court's denial of her motion for reconsideration. (Bankr. Docket No. 82.) G\u00e1ndara contends that the bankruptcy court (1) \"erred in allowing Scotiabank [ ] to have standing to file a Proof of Claim when said party had no claim whatsoever because its claim was time-barred;\" (2) \"erred in not allowing a reasonable time extension ... to reply to Scotiabank [ ] ... due to undersigned health issues;\" and (3) \"erred in not making statements of facts and considerations of law in granting Scotiabank's Motion to Dismiss.\" (Docket No. 9 at p. 6.) The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because the bankruptcy court's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismissal of G\u00e1ndara's case and denial of her motion of reconsideration are final orders, this Court has jurisdiction to hear her appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    In re Witkowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338583\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/523/300/#p305\">\n    523 B.R. 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305 (1st Cir.
