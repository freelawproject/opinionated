INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its May 1, 2019, Order Denying Rehearing (\"the FERC Denial\", the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") made two remarkable statements. First, it said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Wholesale power contracts are not simple run-of-the-mill contracts between two private parties, rather, these contracts, while privately negotiated, implicate the public's interest in the orderly production of plentiful supplies of electricity at just and reasonable rates ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    NextEra Energy, Inc. v. Pac. Gas and Elec. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=167%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C096\">\n    167 FERC \u00b6 61,096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019) at Para 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, it stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"To be clear, the [FERC] neither presumes to sit in judgment of rejection\n   motions nor seeks to arrogate the role of adjudicating bankruptcy proceedings\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620020\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1652/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Para. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The problem is that the first statement, while true, is completely contrary to the congressionally created authority of the bankruptcy court to approve rejection of nearly every kind of executory contract. This includes \"run-of-the-mill\" types, whatever that means, or the other kind, including power purchase agreements and others that implicate the public's interest, but excluding certain types not relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second problem is that FERC, despite its denial, has chosen to interfere with bankruptcy courts' decisions. Without statutory or supreme court authority to support its position, it in fact \"presumes to sit in judgment\" and second-guess - no overrule - decisions of the bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To deal with what it correctly identifies as unsettled law with different court interpretations (one circuit court, one district court and one bankruptcy court now on direct appeal to another circuit court)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   FERC purports to settle the law by announcing its own interpretation of bankruptcy law and decree something found nowhere in the statute it interprets. This is not the way that unsettled law is to be developed. That is the role of the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To this court, FERC's decision was not only unauthorized, but has and continues to have the effect of undermining the function of the bankruptcy court in its role of ensuring that the goals and purposes of bankruptcy law and policy are properly served and properly executed. Despite FERC's lip service to what it describes as \"concurrent jurisdiction\" to carry out differing and perhaps competing policies, the effect of its decision guts and renders meaningless the bankruptcy court's responsibilities in this area of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For this reason, FERC must be stopped and the division and balance of power and authority of the two branches of government restored. Accordingly, and for the reasons that follow, the court declares FERC's decision announcing its concurrent jurisdiction unenforceable in bankruptcy and of no force and effect on the parties before it. If necessary in the future it will enjoin FERC from perpetuating its attempt to exercise power it wholly lacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 10, 2019, the court held a hearing on Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&amp;E Corporation's (collectively, \"Debtors\") Motion For Preliminary Injunction (the \"Motion\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtors were initially seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent FERC from issuing any rulings that would impact rejection of a power purchase agreement (\"PPA\") under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\" Section 365\") and to establish that the bankruptcy court has sole authority over Debtors' rights to reject any of its PPAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PREPETITION EVENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Debtors announced their intent to file for bankruptcy protection on January 14,\n   2019. California law mandated a 15-day notice period before filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Various PPA Counterparties\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   initiated two administrative actions before FERC against Debtors. They were concerned that Debtors would try to reject PPAs in their forthcoming bankruptcy. As a result, they asked FERC to rule that the bankruptcy court and FERC both must approve rejection of a PPA for rejection to have effect. Promptly thereafter, on January 25 and 28, 2019, FERC ruled \"that this Commission and the bankruptcy courts have\n   <em>\n    concurrent jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   to review and address the disposition of wholesale power contracts sought to be rejected through bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    NextEra Energy, Inc. v. Pac. Gas and Elec. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C049\">\n    166 FERC \u00b6 61,049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019) ;\n   <em>\n    Exelon Corp. v. Pac. Gas and Elec. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C053\">\n    166 FERC \u00b6 61,053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Debtors had unsuccessfully opposed those attempts and promptly sought relief in this adversary proceeding on the first day they filed for bankruptcy, January 29, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Debtors listed three causes of action in the Complaint: (1) declaratory relief confirming the bankruptcy court's exclusive jurisdiction under Section 365 ; (2) enforcement of the automatic stay under section 362; and (3) a preliminary and permanent injunction under section 105. The second cause of action sought an order stating that FERC could not proceed with any action against Debtors because the automatic stay was in place. The third cause of action, in case the court found the automatic stay did not apply, was for injunctive relief to ensure that FERC would not take any action that would harm Debtors' rights to reject any of the PPAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. POST-PETITION EVENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 25, 2019, Debtors sought rehearing of the two FERC orders. FERC consolidated the requests for rehearing into one final decision and denied the rehearings on May 1, 2019 in the FERC Denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   FERC and several PPA Counterparties moved to withdraw the reference from this court to the district court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; Debtors opposed the motions. On March 11, 2019, the district court denied the motions to withdraw the reference, ruling this was a core proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   No party appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During the April 10 hearing, the court asked why it could not decide all of the issues presented by the adversary proceeding, particularly because there did not appear to be any material facts in dispute. Promptly after the FERC Denial, the parties filed a stipulation regarding the disposition of this adversary proceeding (\"the May 3 Stipulation\") (Dkt. No. 149). The May 3 Stipulation stated that the parties were unable to reach agreement on terms of a final judgment and that the court could enter final judgment based upon the current record without any further briefing, oral argument, or other evidence, except for the FERC Denial. This allows this court to enter final judgment at this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On May 20, 2019, the United States Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC,\n   </em>\n   587 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620020\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1652/\">\n    139 S.Ct. 1652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20876\">\n    203 L.Ed.2d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019)\n   <em>\n    (\"\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tempnology\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    \").\n   </em>\n   The court preserved the right of a trademark licensee to\n   retain the use of the trademark following the licensor's rejection of the trademark license as an executory contract. The court repeatedly stated basic principles relevant to this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \" Section 365 provides that 'a debtor's rejection of a contract \"constitutes a breach of such contract.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620020\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1652/\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 1657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Rejection of a contract--any contract--in bankruptcy operates not as a rescission but as a breach.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620020\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1652/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 1661.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"Rejection 'constitutes a breach of [an executory] contract,' deemed to occur 'immediately before the date of the filing of the petition' ...

Relevant to\n   <em>\n    Tempnology\n   </em>\n   are intellectual property rights under Section 365(n). Other such provisions are found in Section 365(h)and (i) (purchasers and lessees of real property and timeshare interests). And the trustee is deemed to have assumed (not rejected) obligations for maintenance of capital requirements of a Federal insured depository. Section 365(o).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Outside of Section 365, rejection of collective bargaining agreements are dealt with great particularity in Section 1113.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   From this it is clear that Congress know how to craft special rules for special circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, debtors such as Debtors who are regulated by commissions or other authorities such as FERC must comply with rate change approvals in order to achieve confirmation of Chapter 11 plans. 11.

Consider the following messages from the opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"Today we hold that both Section 365's text and\n   <em>\n    fundamental principles of bankruptcy law\n   </em>\n   command the ...rejection as breach approach.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620020\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1652/\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   And referring in contrast to a trustee's avoidance powers that can be invoked in only narrow circumstances, the court added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    \"...unlike the power of rejection, which may be exercised for any plausible reason.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620020\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1652/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The opinion describes in detail the exceptions (referred to in\n   <em>\n    Mirant\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    )\n   </em>\n   added to Section 365 over several decades to address what and how Congress dealt with specific problems that arose for various\n   reasons, including judicial interpretations. That includes the 1988 amendments to deal with\n   <em>\n    Lubrizol Enterprises v. Richmond Metal Finishers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"325465,6123950\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/756/1043/\">\n    756 F.2d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1985) ) and protect the rights of some, but not all counterparties to rejected intellectual property licenses. All of them deal with various remedies to protect counterparties' rights. Nothing in the opinion has any bearing on what FERC seeks in these bankruptcy cases, with one exception. That is, as the supreme court pointed out:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"...Section 365 does not grant the debtor an exception from all of the burdens that generally applicable law - whether involving contracts of trademarks - impose on property owners.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   What remains following the May 3, 2019 Stipulation is Debtors' request for a declaratory judgment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   confirming the court's exclusive jurisdiction over their right to reject any PPA under Section 365, and further declaring that FERC does not have \"concurrent jurisdiction\" to grant or deny Debtors' rejection of any of their PPAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The enforcement of the automatic stay (Complaint, Court Two) is not an issue because there has been no violation of the stay. The two FERC orders that prompted this adversary proceeding were in response to proceedings brought against Debtors prior to bankruptcy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtors have not filed a single motion to reject, so there is no reason to imagine why FERC would take any action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This is a matter of first impression\n   <strong>\n    :\n   </strong>\n   Is an order issued by a Federal agency purporting to affect (arrogate) a decision by a bankruptcy court in a future bankruptcy case binding on that bankruptcy court or the parties before it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Here are the different ways courts have dealt with this issue in the only reported decisions. None began with FERC issuing orders before the bankruptcy cases were filed as it did here. In\n   <em>\n    Mirant,\n   </em>\n   the court of appeals adhered to the theory the court applies here. Instead of applying the \"business judgment\" test, the court remanded, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"Therefore, upon remand, the district court should consider applying a more rigorous standard to the rejection of the [subject contract]. If the district court decides that a more rigorous standard is required, then it might adopt a standard by which it would authorize rejection of an executory power contract only if the debtor can show that it \"burdens the estate, [ ] that, after careful scrutiny, the equities balance in favor of rejecting\" that power contract, and that rejection of the contract would further the Chapter 11 goal of permitting the successful rehabilitation of debtors.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Mirant,\n   </em>\n   378 F.3d at\n   <em>\n    525\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The district court in\n   <em>\n    Calpine\n   </em>\n   accepted the argument advanced by FERC here. One day before Calpine's bankruptcy, PPA counterparties (including Pacific Gas and Electric Company) commenced a proceeding before FERC to obtain an order requiring Calpine to continue to perform under PPAs. The district court, after several interim steps, concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the motions to reject the energy contracts before it.\n   <em>\n    Calpine\n   </em>\n   at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the\n   <em>\n    FirstEnergy\n   </em>\n   court ruled as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"This Court holds that rejection, including the attendant cessation of performance, does not intrude on FERC's jurisdiction over filed rates. If Plaintiffs were solvent and simply stopped making payments ... the counterparties could not reasonably argue that [the debtors] had somehow modified or abrogated those agreements; they would seek damages for the breaches of those contracts .... Those breaches would lead to claims. If the Plaintiffs then filed bankruptcy, the claims would become claims against the estate. Treatment of those claims are governed by the Bankruptcy Code, including the confirmation of a reorganization plan in ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    In re FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.\n   </em>\n   (Bankr.

It was they, not Debtors, who initiated the controversy, and FERC's disposition, that has caused Debtors to need this declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Here, there is a threatened injury that is certainly impending. While it is true that Debtors have not yet moved to reject any PPAs, they have been under pressure from various sources to move these complex cases along and deal with billions of dollars of wildfire claims and billions of dollars of contractual liabilities. Already the court has granted in part but denied in part their request to extend plan exclusivity under Section 1121(d). This has been with opposition from the two official creditors' committees and the Governor of California pressing for a prompt and viable reorganization. If and when either Debtor moves to reject any PPAs they need to know promptly whether this court will grant or deny such requests. If they are forced to seek a second and possibly dispositive decision from FERC based on FERC's stated policy goals, and not just those found in the Bankruptcy Code, there could be a real and significant impact on the reorganization effort and the millions of Northen Californians adversely affected by it. Under these circumstances there can be no doubt that Debtors have standing right now to invoke this court's authority and jurisdiction to facilitate these reorganization efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   If FERC's view prevails, it could effectively veto the court's decision to permit rejection under the business judgment test. Instead, it would permit rejection only if the affected rate is no longer just and reasonable and as long as the abrogation or modification is necessary to protect the public interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This means a PPA Counterparty who is unable to persuade the bankruptcy court to deny rejection, but able to persuade FERC to do so, will be left with its \"bankruptcy-rejected\" contact (treated as breached, resulting in a pre-petition claim) in place, fully enforceable, the same as an assumed executory contract. In other words, the reorganization goals will be replaced by FERC's public policy goals, giving the PPA Counterparty the same treatment as post-petition administrative claim to be paid in full. This is a quintessential controversy - the clash of two competing policies and goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Ripeness is determined at the time the complaint is filed.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Judicial Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   FERC asserts that judicial estoppel prevents the Debtors from arguing that this court has exclusive jurisdiction over motions to reject due to a prior case where they made arguments to the contrary. The purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial process. The doctrine is invoked when a party makes a representation to a court, that court accepts it, rules in the party's favor, and then the party makes a contrary argument on that same position to the same court or a different court.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   First, a party's later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled. A third consideration is whether the part seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Ah Quin v.

Pfizer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31348\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1358/#p1363\">\n    439 F.3d 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1363 (Fed.Cir.2006) ;\n   <em>\n    E-Pass Techs. v.

Cal. Nov. 4, 2011). In\n   <em>\n    Bonzel\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff had previously successfully argued for remand before the Federal Circuit because there was no substantial patent law question. Then, after that action was dismissed, the plaintiff brought another lawsuit claiming federal patent jurisdiction. The court declined to apply judicial estoppel and noted \"it was questionable whether estoppel could even apply to jurisdictional question.\"\n   <em>\n    E-Pass Techs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205357912\">\n    2011 WL 5357912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7-8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bonzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31348\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1358/#p1363\">\n    439 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1363 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Here, Debtors' assertion of different positions does not warrant the application of judicial estoppel. The primary focus of this lawsuit is this court's exclusive jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and whether it alone or FERC concurrently has authority under Section 365. This is the first and only time the Debtors have been forced to defend the authority of their \"home\" court. No such issue has confronted them before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   More importantly, Debtors are now debtors-in-possession under the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, they are given substantial rights, duties and powers under numerous sections, including Sections 1107 that import the duties of a trustee in Section 1106. It is a fundamental principle of bankruptcy law that a Chapter 11 trustee or debtor-n-possession is considered a new legal entity and as such, has the power to assume or reject most executory contracts under Section 365. It would be inconsistent to this grant of power to inhibit the authority and powers of Debtors because of conduct they took in their individual capacities in which they acted as counterparties to a bankruptcy debtor who was acting adverse to them prior to their bankruptcy cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In addition, while FERC is not bound by the principle of judicial estoppel, it has reversed its own position on the issue of concurrent jurisdiction. In 2006, FERC announced it would follow the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Mirant\n   </em>\n   , which stated that a debtor can reject a PPA that is filed with FERC, without concurrent approval of the rejection by FERC. However, the FERC Denial states that after the\n   <em>\n    Calpine\n   </em>\n   court ruled contrary to\n   <em>\n    Mirant\n   </em>\n   , FERC was no longer obligated to follow the prior reasoning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Accordingly, it is only fair to let Debtors, as Debtors-in-Possession, use all the tools Congress has provided which they did not have prior to their bankruptcy. Judicial estoppel does not prevent the court from deciding the merits of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Automatic Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In the Complaint, Debtors are seeking an order \"pursuant to section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code ... enforcing the automatic stay as to any FERC Action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The automatic stay went into effect on the day of the bankruptcy. Debtors petitioned for rehearing after bankruptcy and FERC responded with the FERC Denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The central issue addressed by FERC in denying rehearing is the same that was decided in the two January, 2019, rulings. No party raised the issue of the automatic stay (see footnote 10) so the court does not infer that the stay was violated or the FERC Denial is void. Nothing else has been brought to the court's attention to show the stay has been violated by any party. If a violation of the stay does occur in the future, either Debtor may move for contempt under Rule 9020. As the automatic stay is already in place, no further order is necessary. Because the court is granting Debtors' request for a Declaratory Judgment (discussed,\n   <em>\n    infra)\n   </em>\n   there is no need to debate and decide whether or nor FERC could act within any Section 362(b)(4) exception.

Declaratory relief on the First Claim will provide the basis for FERC not having the authority to pursue any type of action that supports concurrent jurisdiction over a motion to reject any PPA. There is no need to enjoin anyone or any action now. Count Three of the Complaint will be DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Basis for Declaratory Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Countless courts have noted and accepted the broad scope of FERC's statutory jurisdiction over rates, terms and conditions of wholesale electricity sales and power contracts, including changes to those contracts. That authority has led to the evolution and development of the filed-rate doctrine that provides that a party may claim no rate as a legal right other than the filed rate, whether fixed or accepted by FERC. Not even a court may authorize other terms. All of this is black-letter law that is not in doubt here. The briefs before the court are replete with citations that do not need to be repeated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Thus, because all the parties agree that the Federal Power Act (\"FPA\") means what it says, and FERC can do what it usually does, no purpose would be served by discussing further the filed-rate doctrine or FERC's exclusive jurisdiction over rates and related matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Debtors are entitled to this court's declaratory judgment that (1) FERC does not have concurrent jurisdiction over its decision to permit Debtors to reject (or assume) executory contracts under Section 365 ; and (2) that the FERC Denial and its two prior rulings described above are of no force and effect and are not binding on Debtors in these cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Nothing will happen here until either of the Debtors moves to reject an executory PPA and the affected counterparty opposes that motion. At that time the court will consider the merits of any such motion and\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   consideration implicates public policy interests as well as reorganization goals, those interests can be considered as part of the higher standard for the rejection decision. It may well be that a particular motion seeks rejection of a contractual obligation of the debtor to purchase energy in the future. That likely will involve little if any public interests; on the other hand rejection of a PPA based on some other rights and obligations may trigger a more concrete and demonstrable consequence that may tip the balance the other way. Either way, or whatever set of facts apply, this court can make the assessment consistent with the principles expressed here. There is no need or right for a second inquiry by a separate non-judicial body to be involved. This court will exercise its exclusive jurisdiction as Congress directed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The automatic stay still applies the same way it did on January 29, 2019, when these cases were commenced. If more relief is needed, the court's specific and inherent injunctive powers are available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The motion of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors is GRANTED. If there is no appeal that grant is of no consequence; if there is an appeal, the committee's views should be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Concurrent with this Memorandum Decision the court is issuing its Declaratory Judgment. In a few days it will issue a Certification for Direct Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In the matter of Mirant Corp.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217096,9213974\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/511/\">\n     378 F.3d 511\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (5th Cir. 2004) (\n    <em>\n     \"Mirant\"\n    </em>\n    );\n    <em>\n     In re Calpine Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37870\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/27/\">\n     337 B.R. 27\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (\"\n    <em>\n     Calpine\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     \"\n    </em>\n    );\n    <em>\n     In re FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. v.
