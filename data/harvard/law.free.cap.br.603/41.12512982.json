McNamara, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Introduction\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Interest is the lubricant that keeps the machinery of the United States' financial markets humming. No bank wants to lend its money without some return on its capital. And no borrower expects to receive free funding from its lender. But what about 120.86% interest per year? It's hard to believe that the management of any legitimate United States company would ever agree to pay such an ultra-high rate of interest. It makes no sense. Even a fifth-grader taking an introduction to economics class should know better. But that is what happened in this crazy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bank of Lake Mills, a Wisconsin state chartered bank, agreed to loan $ 550,000 to CMS Facilities Maintenance, Inc. (\"CMS\"), a Colorado-based corporation. CMS executed a Promissory Note promising to repay the balance in Wisconsin within a year. There was a catch: the borrowing came at a significant price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CMS had to pay interest on the loan at the rate of 120.86% per year. The Parties agreed that federal law and Wisconsin law (if not preempted) would govern the validity of the Promissory Note. Federal interstate interest law generally is based on the contract, the location of the state chartered bank, and the place of payment. Wisconsin permits corporations to agree to any interest rate. In the Badger State, there is no such thing as corporate usury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although the reasons are a mystery, another company, Yosemite Management, LLC (\"Yosemite Management\"), stepped in and pledged some of its Colorado real estate as security for CMS' obligation to Bank of Lake Mills under a Deed of Trust. Later, Bank of Lake Mills assigned its rights under the Promissory Note to Defendant, World Business Lenders, LLC (the \"Lender\"). Later still, Yosemite Management sold the encumbered real estate to the Debtor/Plaintiff, Rent-Rite Superkegs West., Ltd. (the \"Debtor\"). The two companies have common management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the Debtor acquired the real estate, it knew about the Deed of Trust, knew that CMS' obligation to Bank of Lake Mills was in default, and knew that the obligation bore interest at an extraordinarily high rate. All of this might have suggested that it would be very unwise to buy the real estate. However, the Debtor went through with the acquisition anyway. Perhaps, not surprisingly, given the quality of its decision-making, the Debtor later declared bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, the Debtor sued the Lender and asserted three causes of action: declaratory judgment under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7001(9) ; claim disallowance under Sections 502 of the Bankruptcy Code ; and equitable subordination under Section 510 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The central thrust of the Debtor's Complaint is that the Promissory Note is usurious and, therefore, invalid. Even though the parties to the Promissory Note agreed to federal law and Wisconsin law (if not preempted), the Debtor contends that the Promissory Note should be governed by Colorado law. Colorado law prohibits interest rates above 45% per annum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It all comes down to the applicable law. If federal law or Wisconsin law governs the Promissory Note, the Lender prevails. On the other hand, if Colorado law governs the Promissory Note, the Debtor wins. This sounds simple. But it is not. The dispute requires the Court to engage in a very complex and difficult choice of law analysis to determine the applicable substantive law. After evaluating various choice of law approaches, the Court ultimately concludes that all paths favor the Lender. The ultra-high interest rate contained in the Promissory Note is permissible under federal law and Wisconsin law. Pleas for fairness and equity cannot rescue the Debtor from the governing law, or its misguided decision-making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction and Venue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction to enter final judgment on all of the issues presented in this Adversary Proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Docket No. 6, the \"Answer.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As the impending trial date loomed near, the parties filed a \"Joint Motion to Continue Trial\" (Docket No. 27, the \"Motion to Continue\"), in which they requested that the Court vacate the trial set for September 11, 2018, establish a schedule for the submission of a statement of undisputed legal facts and legal briefs, and reset the trial for a later date. In the Motion to Continue, the parties seemed to contend, on the one hand, that the Court should decide the legal issues in the case without trial because the \"facts of this case are largely uncontested,\" but also seemed to contend, on the other hand, that the Court might still need to hold a trial on a later date. The Court conducted a hearing on the Motion to Continue. After listening to the parties' positions, the Court denied the Motion to Continue without prejudice. (Docket No. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Later, the parties filed a \"Joint Motion to Vacate Trial.\" (Docket No. 30, the \"Motion to Vacate.\") In the Joint Motion to Vacate, the parties stated: \"[T]he facts of the case are largely uncontested. It is the parties' position that a determination by the Court on the legal principles at issue in the case would resolve the matter without the need for trial.\" Accordingly, the parties submitted \"Amended Stipulated Facts\" (Docket No. 30-1, the \"Stipulated Facts\") and \"Amended Stipulated Exhibits\" (Docket No. 30-2) consisting of Exhibit Nos. 1-8, B, C, D, and H (the \"Exhibits\"). The parties also proposed that they be permitted to submit \"written closing arguments\" in lieu of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Consistent with the parties' requests, the Court entered an \"Order Re: Joint Motion to Vacate Trial\" (Docket No. 32), vacating the trial and stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Submission of Amended Stipulated Facts and Amended Exhibits\n   </em>\n   . The Amended Stipulated Facts (Docket No. 30-1) and Amended Stipulated Exhibits (Docket No. 30-2) submitted by the parties (along with copies of the exhibits hand-delivered to chambers) shall constitute the only evidence upon which the parties shall rely in submission of written arguments, and shall constitute the only evidence for the Court to consider in determining the claims in the Plaintiff's Adversary Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Further, the Court directed the parties to submit their \"written closing arguments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Subsequently, the Debtor filed its \"Final Written Arguments\" (Docket No. 36) and the Lender submitted its \"Argument and Memorandum of Law\" (Docket No. 35) (together, the \"Closing Arguments\"). Both Closing Arguments focused on the applicable choice of law and appeared to suggest that the Court should apply Colorado choice of law principles based upon Colorado case law and Section 187 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws (\"Restatement Section 187\"). Having reviewed the Closing Arguments, the Court determined that neither of the parties addressed certain critical legal issues. Accordingly, the Court ordered the Parties to provide supplemental legal briefs. (Docket No. 37, the \"Order for Additional Briefing.\") Both Parties complied and submitted supplemental legal briefs. (Docket Nos. 39, 40, 41, and 42, the \"Supplemental Legal Briefs\".) Thus, all of the claims and defenses in the Adversary Proceeding are fully submitted and ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Findings of Fact\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based upon the Stipulated Facts and Exhibits, the Court makes the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Promissory Note, Deed of Trust, and Assignment\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On April 19, 2016, CMS executed a \"Business Promissory Note and Security Agreement\" (Ex. 1, the \"Promissory Note\") in favor of Bank of Lake Mills in the original principal amount of $ 550,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   CMS' \"principal place of business\" was listed as \"939 Telluride Street, Aurora, CO,\" while Bank of Lake Mills was identified as an \"FDIC insured, Wisconsin state chartered bank\" located at \"136 E.

CMS agreed to pay principal and interest in the daily amount of $ 3,775.72 starting April 25, 2016, and continuing for one year until the Promissory Note matured on April 24, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, CMS contracted to make the daily payments to Bank of Lake Mills by \"automatic ACH debit\" from a \"Designated Checking Account.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the event of default by CMS, the Promissory Note provided for CMS to also pay Bank of Lake Mill's costs of collection, including attorneys' fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Promissory Note contains a detailed choice of law provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Lender [Bank of Lake Mills] is an FDIC insured, Wisconsin state chartered bank and this Loan Agreement is accepted by [Bank of Lake Mills] in Wisconsin.

As discussed later, the Deed of Trust transaction, which was not conducted at arms-length, seems highly peculiar and ill-advised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In any event, the Deed of Trust expressly grants Bank of Lake Mills a security interest in certain Colorado real property and improvements (the \"Property\"):\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   LOTS 8 THROUGH 31, BLOCK 1, COLFAX SQUARE, AND THE VACATED WEST 10 FEET OF AKRON STREET ADJACENT THERETO, VESTED IN THE OWNER OF SAID LOTS 8 THROUGH 31 BY VIRTUE OF ORDINANCE NO. 61-4 OF THE CITY OF AURORA RECORDED JANUARY 24, 1964 IN BOOK 1492 AT PAGE 240, COUNTY OF ARAPAHOE, STATE OF COLORADO.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Commonly known as 1400 Yosemite Street, Denver, CO 80220.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Property was pledged as security for the \"repayment of\" the Promissory Note including \"performance\" of CMS' obligations under the Promissory Note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Deed of Trust specifically identifies and describes the Promissory Note executed by CMS, including the date, the original principal amount, the payment terms, and the maturity date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, the Deed of Trust also identifies the extraordinarily high per annum interest rate charged on the Promissory Note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, Yosemite Management was fully aware that it was pledging its own Property to secure repayment of an ultra-high interest rate obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Typical of such liens, the Deed of Trust required that the Property be preserved,\n   maintained, and insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, consistent with the main purpose of a mortgage, the Deed of Trust spelled-out rights upon default under the Promissory Note, including foreclosure of the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the Deed of Trust contains its own choice of law provision, which is different than the provision in the Promissory Note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   This Security Instrument shall be governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located.

Accordingly, the Debtor took a credit against the purchase price for amount of the outstanding obligation on the Promissory Note as well another secured debt.

Finally, to secure the Debtor's new obligation to Yosemite Management, the Debtor placed another deed of trust on the Property for the benefit of Yosemite Management.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The new deed of trust recognized the priority of the Deed of Trust granted to Bank of Lake Mills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Debtor is the current owner of the Property, subject to three deeds of trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Notably, the transactions surrounding the Debtor's purchase of the Property were not at arm's length. Thomas S. Wright signed the Purchase and Sale Agreement as both the Manager of Yosemite Management and the President of the Debtor. He also signed the new promissory note and deed of trust as President of the Debtor and for the benefit of Yosemite Management. So, it was very much an inside deal. And, the Debtor was quite aware that the Promissory Note and Deed of Trust encumbered the Property since, among other things, the Debtor's principal executed the Deed of Trust as a Member of Yosemite Management. The Parties did not provide the Court with any evidence concerning the relationship between the Debtor and Yosemite Management. The Court has no idea why the Debtor would purchase the Property knowing that it was encumbered by the Deed of Trust securing payment of the Promissory Note bearing stupendously high interest in excess of 120% per annum. The transaction seems extraordinarily bizarre and ill-advised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Default and Proof of Claim\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   CMS made regular daily payments on the Promissory Note from April 26, 2016, through approximately October 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, CMS incurred \"NSF Fees,\" and its payment history became somewhat spottier throughout the balance of 2016 and early 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   CMS stopped paying altogether after February 15, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, even before the Debtor purchased the Property from Yosemite Management (subject to the Deed of Trust), the Promissory Note had been in default for almost a year. The Debtor knew of the default because it received a purchase price discount and credit for the amount owed on the Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After the Debtor filed for bankruptcy, the Lender submitted a \"Proof of Claim\" (Claim No. 27, the \"Proof of Claim\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   As support for the Proof of Claim, the Lender attached the Promissory Note and Deed of Trust.

The Debtor asserted three related causes of action. In the First Claim for Relief, the Debtor sought a declaration that \"the interest charged under [the Promissory Note] is usurious under C.R.S. \u00a7 5-12-103.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Second Claim for Relief is very similar. The Debtor requested that the Lender's Proof of Claim be disallowed under Section 502(b) and \"pursuant to applicable state law, C.R.S. \u00a7 5-12-103\" because the Lender's \"claim for interest charged on the [Promissory Note] is usurious and in excess of the lawful amount that can be charged.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, in the Third Claim for Relief, the Debtor demanded equitable subordination of the Lender's Proof of Claim under Section 510 on the basis that the Lender's Proof of Claim and conduct were \"usurious,\" \"illegal,\" and \"inequitable\" under Colorado law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor also asserted that the Lender's attempt to recover on the Promissory Note was \"in violation of the Colorado Criminal Code.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its Answer, the Lender denied that the interest rate in the Promissory Note was usurious or illegal under governing Wisconsin law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Debtor's Position in Written Closing Argument\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In all of its claims, the Debtor seeks to disallow or subordinate the Lender's Proof of Claim. Citing COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 5-12-103(1), the Debtor contends that Colorado law \"prohibits interest rates on loans greater than 45%.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Debtor claims that the Promissory Note, which has the crazy interest rate of 120.86% per annum, is illegal and unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With respect to the First and Second Claims for Relief, the Debtor concedes that the text of the Promissory Note contains a Wisconsin choice of law provision. Furthermore, the Debtor acknowledges that \"in Wisconsin, there is no limit on the interest rate chargeable to a corporation or limited liability company.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Debtor argues that the Wisconsin choice of law clause in the Promissory Note is of no moment. First, the Debtor insists that the Court must apply Colorado conflict of law analysis and that Colorado utilizes Restatement Section 187 for such issues. According to the Debtor, the Wisconsin\n   choice of law provision is unenforceable because \"application of Wisconsin law would be contrary to the strong public policy of Colorado\" and \"Wisconsin has no significant relationship to the transaction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, the Debtor proposes that the Court focus on the Deed of Trust instead of the Promissory Note. The Deed of Trust is governed by \"federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located.\" And, the Property is located in Colorado. So, the Debtor reasons that the Deed of Trust prevails over the Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   With respect to the Third Claim for Relief, the Debtor requests equitable subordination under Section 510(c) because the Lender allegedly has engaged in \"inequitable conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The asserted \"inequitable conduct\" is only that the Lender attempted to enforce the Promissory Note. The Debtor claims such enforcement is inequitable because it violates Colorado usury law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, the equitable subordination claim depends entirely on the Court's finding that Colorado usury law applies to the Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Lender's Position in Written Closing Argument\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Lender's initial position was deceptively straightforward: Wisconsin law governs the Promissory Note, and Wisconsin substantive law has no restrictions on interest rates charged to corporate entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put another way, there is no such thing as corporate usury in Wisconsin. While the Lender asks the Court to enforce the choice of law provision in the Promissory Note as written, the Lender nevertheless seemed to concede that Colorado conflict of law analysis and Restatement Section 187 may come into play. If so, the Lender argues that \"Colorado courts have held that the parties may agree to what state law will govern and control the contract\" in a series of decisions about interest rates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Lender contends that there is a strong relationship with Wisconsin because the Promissory Note was \"made in Wisconsin\" and Wisconsin has valid reasons for excepting corporate loans from usury statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Lender also asserts that enforcement of the Promissory Note would not violate any fundamental public policy of Colorado. So, Wisconsin substantive law should be used and such law permits the enforcement of the interest rate because there is no corporate usury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Order for Additional Briefing and the Parties' Positions in Supplemental Briefing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Having considered the Parties' respective legal positions in their written Closing Arguments, the Court concluded that additional legal briefing was necessary to assist the Court in resolving this Adversary Proceeding. Accordingly, the Court issued the Order for Additional Legal Briefing and requested that the Parties address nine legal topics bearing on the applicable choice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In its Supplemental Legal Briefs, the Debtor stuck with its original position that Colorado conflict of law analysis (which adopts Restatement Section 187) should be used for purposes of selecting the proper substantive law governing the Promissory Note. According to the Debtor, the correct applicable substantive law is Colorado\n   law - not Wisconsin law. Further, Colorado substantive law effectively invalidates the interest rate in the Promissory Note because it is usurious. Alternatively, the Debtor also continued to argue that the focus should be on the Deed of Trust (which is governed by Colorado law) rather that the Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Whilst the Debtor remained steadfast, the Lender modified its legal position, at least in part, in its Supplemental Legal Briefs. The Lender now contends that federal statutory law, particularly\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201831\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), or federal common law, governs the issue whether the Promissory Note is usurious. The Lender argues that federal law permits the application of Wisconsin substantive law to the Promissory Note. And, under Wisconsin substantive law, the Promissory Note is not usurious. The Lender also contends that if Colorado choice of law is considered, the proper framework is the Colorado Uniform Commercial Code. Finally, the Lender falls back to its original arguments that (1) the Promissory Note should be construed only under Wisconsin substantive law because of the choice of law clause; and/or (2) even if Restatement Section 187, as adopted in Colorado, should be used for purposes of selecting the proper substantive law governing the Promissory Note, the result is that Wisconsin law is the proper substantive law. And, again, Wisconsin substantive law does not prohibit corporate usury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     Legal Analysis of Interstate Interest Rates\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Importance of Determining the Applicable Substantive Law\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Parties agree on all of the material facts. Thus, this dispute turns on the applicable substantive law.\n   <em>\n    The key legal issue in this Adversary Proceeding is whether the ultra-high interest rate in the Promissory Note - in excess of 120% per annum - is lawful and permissible.\n   </em>\n   The contest depends on the applicable substantive law: Federal law or the State law of either Wisconsin or Colorado. The applicable substantive law matters because it differs. Federal statutory law in the area of banking interest rates principally is derived from State law. Federal common law also depends on State law. And, Wisconsin and Colorado usury laws differ. Wisconsin law is\n   <em>\n    laissez-faire\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   and permits a corporation to borrow money at any interest rate it agrees to.

The main provision governing the interest rates that state banks may charge is 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831d (hereinafter \"DIDA Section 1831d\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 1831d is titled, \"State-chartered insured depository institutions and insured branches of foreign banks,\" and states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (a) Interest Rates\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   In order to prevent discrimination against State-chartered insured depository institutions ... with respect to interest rates, if the applicable rate prescribed in this subsection exceeds the rate such State bank ... would be permitted to charge in the absence of this subsection, such State bank ... may, notwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is hereby preempted for the purposes of this section, take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan ... or upon any note, bill of exchange, or other evidence of debt, interest at a rate of not more than 1 per centum in excess of the discount rate on ninety-day commercial paper in effect at the Federal reserve bank in the Federal reserve district where such State bank ... is located or at the rate allowed by the laws of the State, territory, or district where the bank is located, whichever may be greater.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831d(a). Congress also provided a remedy (similar to Section 86 of the NBA) in the event that a state-chartered insured depository institution charges interest in excess of the Section 1831d(a) permissible interest rate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (b) Interest overcharge; forfeiture, interest payment recovery\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   If the rate prescribed in subsection (a) of this section exceeds the rate such State bank ... would be permitted to charge in the absence of this section, and such State fixed rate is thereby preempted by the rate described in subsection (a) of this section, the taking, receiving, reserving, or charging a greater rate of interest than is allowed by subsection (a) of this section, when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt carries with it ....

As with the NBA, although the DIDA maximum interest rate for state banks usually is\n   <em>\n    derived\n   </em>\n   from state law, it is\n   <em>\n    governed\n   </em>\n   by federal law.

This right to assign also was agreed upon in the Promissory Note, which states: \"This Loan Agreement, or an interest in this Loan Agreement, together with the rights to the Collateral, may be\n   sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed by Lender [Bank of Lake Mills] one or more times.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, Bank of Lake Mills had the power to sell the Promissory Note (which was not usurious when it was originated) to the Lender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The question then becomes whether a promissory note originated by a state bank with a non-usurious interest rate under DIDA Section 1831d somehow can be transformed into a usurious promissory note by virtue of assignment to a non-bank entity. The long-established \"valid-when-made\" rule answers the question. Under that rule, if the interest rate in the original loan agreement was non-usurious, the loan cannot become usurious upon assignment - so, the assignee lawfully may charge interest at the original rate. Multiple United States Supreme Court decisions have adopted the \"valid-when-made\" rule. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Gaither v. Farmers' &amp; Mechs. Bank of Georgetown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1432403\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/26/37/\">\n    26 U.S. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1432403\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/26/37/\">\n    1 Pet. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1432403\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/26/37/\">\n    7 L.Ed. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1828), the Supreme Court stated that \"the rule cannot be doubted, that if the note [is] free from usury, in its origin, no subsequent usurious transactions respecting it, can affect it with the taint of usury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1432403\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/26/37/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1432403\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/26/37/\">\n    at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Such a focus makes little logical sense. Suppose for example that the Lender reassigned the Promissory Note back to Bank of Lake Mills. Presumably, under the Debtor's reasoning, the Promissory Note interest rate would be non-usurious (when\n   originated and held by Bank of Lake Mills), then usurious (when assigned and held by the Lender), then non-usurious once again (when assigned back and held by Bank of Lake Mills). What if the Lender reassigned the Promissory Note to a different Wisconsin state bank? Under the Debtor's rationale, the Promissory Note interest rate would again be non-usurious. Or suppose that the Lender itself originated the loan with an admittedly usurious interest rate. Would assignment to a Wisconsin state bank cure the illegality problem because the Wisconsin state bank later became the holder of the evidence of indebtedness? The Debtor's current-assignee focus would seem to permit such usurious loans to be assigned to Wisconsin state banks and then insulated from usury. The questions are rhetorical but illustrate the hot mess that results from focusing on the current holder rather than the originating lender. The \"valid-when-made\" rule, which focuses on the originating entity, resolves such problems in a clear and concise fashion that has withstood the test of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Arguing against the application of DIDA Section 1831d to non-bank assignees, the Debtor relies almost exclusively on\n   <em>\n    Meade v. Avant of Colorado, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524900\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/1134/\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Colo. 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor correctly quotes certain passages from\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   , which seem, at first blush, to support its argument. For example, the\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   court did state that \"the cause of action provided by \u00a7 1831d(b), does not on its face apply to actions against non-banks ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524900\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/1134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524900\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/1134/\">\n    at 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But while the Court appreciates the Debtor's argument, ultimately the Court determines that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the context of this Adversary Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   , the administrator of the Colorado Uniform Consumer Credit Code brought an enforcement action in state court against two non-bank Delaware corporate entities that had purchased loans originated by a state bank. The administrator asserted that the Delaware corporate defendants violated Colorado's statutory limits on excessive finance and delinquency charges for Colorado consumer loans. The defendants removed the action from state court to federal court, arguing that DIDA Section 1831d \"\n   <em>\n    completely preempted\n   </em>\n   the state law claims at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524900\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/1134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524900\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/1134/\">\n    at 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The administrator contested removal. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   decision concerns only the discrete issue of federal removal jurisdiction by virtue of complete preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   court determined that complete preemption did not apply to the state law claims against the non-bank defendants. Thus, the Court remanded the case back to state court. But, since the\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   decision only involved \"complete preemption,\" the district court did not have occasion to consider whether the claims against the non-bank defendants were defensively preempted by \"express preemption,\" \"conflict preemption,\" or \"field preemption.\" The final holding of\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   is quite limited:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   Whether or not Section 27 [DIDA Section 1831d ] gives rise to a\n   <em>\n    defense\n   </em>\n   of preemption on the merits of Plaintiff's claims, it does not establish complete preemption or permit\n   <em>\n    removal\n   </em>\n   of the Administrator's exclusively state-law claims to federal court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524900\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/1134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524900\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/1134/\">\n    at 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). After making the dispositive ruling requiring remand,\n   the\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   court also referenced the defendants' \"valid-when-made\" argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   [T]he Court agrees ... that these arguments [that the \"valid-when-made\" rule was firmly entrenched] have little, if any, bearing on the issue of complete preemption ....

And, the\n   <em>\n    Meade\n   </em>\n   holding does not foreclose the application of DIDA Section 1831d to assignees of loans originated by state banks. In the end, although the decision is close, the Court concludes that DIDA Section 1823d allows interest to be calculated under substantive Wisconsin law and bars the claims asserted by the Debtor under the Colorado Usury Statute. The Promissory Note interest rate, which is extraordinarily high, is permissible as a matter of federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding, the Court analyzes the other choice of law issues raised by the Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Under Federal Choice of Law Principles, Wisconsin Substantive Law Applies so the Promissory Note Interest Rate Is Permissible\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In its Closing Argument, the Debtor contended that \"[i]n determining a choice of law issue, a federal court must apply the choice of law rules of the jurisdiction in which it is situated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor then argued that \"Colorado utilizes the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws to resolve choice of law issues.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the Debtor proposed that under such Colorado choice of law rules, substantive Colorado usury law should govern the Promissory Note and result in a determination of illegality and unenforceability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Debtor's choice of law analysis is flawed because the Debtor assumed that the Court is sitting in diversity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Promissory Note itself stipulated to \"FEDERAL LAW APPLICABLE TO AN FDIC INSURED INSTITUTION AND TO THE EXTENT NOT PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF WISCONSIN ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Promissory Note never mentions Colorado law. If DIDA Section 1831d does not apply, then, contractually, the Court should look to Wisconsin law and secondarily, the \"place of performance\" which is synonymous with the place of payment. The Promissory Note required CMS to pay \"Bank of Lake Mills, its successors and/or assigns\" the principal amount of $ 550,000 plus interest at the Wisconsin offices of Bank of Lake Mills, \"or at such other location or in such manner as designated by [Bank of Lake Mills].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Wisconsin is the place of performance. There is no evidence that payment was ever made in Colorado.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Thus, under federal choice of law principles as confirmed in\n   <em>\n    Seeman\n   </em>\n   , the Court should apply substantive Wisconsin law (if DIDA Section 1831d does not govern). And, it is undisputed that under substantive Wisconsin law, the interest rate in the Promissory Note is valid. It is not usurious because there is no interest rate cap applicable to corporations in Wisconsin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Under Colorado Choice of Law Principles, Wisconsin Substantive Law Applies, so the Promissory Note Interest Rate Is Permissible\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The Court already has determined that the Promissory Note interest rate is permissible under DIDA Section 1831d, which allows interest to be derived from Wisconsin substantive law. Further, the Court has determined that if DIDA Section 1831d is inapplicable, then federal conflict of laws principles also direct the Court to Wisconsin substantive law. However, the Debtor disagrees and invites the Court to utilize Colorado choice of law analysis. For good measure, the Court examines Colorado conflicts of law under both statutory and common law. In the end, even Colorado choice of law rules dictate that the substantive law of Wisconsin controls the usury question. And, under Wisconsin substantive law, the huge Promissory Note interest rate is just fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Under the Choice of Law Provisions of the Colorado UCC, Wisconsin Substantive Law Applies, so the Promissory Note Interest Rate Is Permissible\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Colorado Uniform Commercial Code (the \"UCC\"), COLO.

REV. STAT. \u00a7 4-1-103(a). Article 3 of the UCC governs negotiable instruments. Under the UCC, a \"negotiable instrument\" means \"an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of\n   money, with or without interest or other charges ....\" COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 4-3-104. Promissory notes typically are classic \"negotiable instruments\" governed by the UCC. COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 4-3-104(e).

Of course, the Act applies to any transaction which takes place in its entirety in a state which has enacted the Act. But the mere fact that suit is brought in a state does not make it appropriate to apply the substantive law of that state. Cases where a relation to the enacting state is not \"appropriate\" include, for example, those where the parties have clearly contracted on the basis of some other law, as where the law of the place of contracting and the law of the place of contemplated performance are the same and are contrary to the law under the Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   COLO.

First, the Debtor argues that the Deed of Trust is not a negotiable instrument governed by the UCC. That is a true - but of no moment. The obligation to pay stems entirely from the Promissory Note. It is the Promissory Note that contains the giant interest rate that the Debtor seeks to eliminate as usury. The Deed of Trust did not obligate CMS to pay anything. In fact, CMS was not even a party to the Deed of Trust; only Yosemite Management was. Second, the Debtor pretends that because the Promissory Note is secured by the Deed of Trust, the Promissory Note somehow is no longer a negotiable instrument subject to the UCC. The argument is contradictory because the Debtor has admitted that the Promissory Note is a negotiable instrument. However, it also is fallacious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Debtor refers to three decisions as supposed support for its position. First, the Debtor cites\n   <em>\n    Uniwest Mortg. Co. v.

Guaranty agreements are not necessarily commercial paper under the UCC. But there is no dispute over a guaranty agreement in this Adversary Proceeding. So,\n   <em>\n    Dadecor Condos.\n   </em>\n   has no relevance. Next, the Debtor points the Court to\n   <em>\n    Resolution Trust Corp. v. 1601 Partners, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3773937\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/796/238/#p240\">\n    796 F.Supp. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (N.D.

In\n   <em>\n    1601 Partners\n   </em>\n   , the promissory note stated that \"the terms, agreements and conditions of the [Deed of Trust] are by reference made a part of this instrument.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3773937\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/796/238/#p240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because of this language, the promissory note became \"subject to or governed by\" another document, the Deed of Trust, so it no longer was an \"unconditional\" promise to pay within the scope of Article 3 of the UCC. But, this Adversary Proceeding is different. The Promissory Note does not incorporate the Deed of Trust. In fact, the Promissory Note does not even mention the Deed of Trust. Instead, the Promissory Note here is an unconditional promise to pay subject to the UCC. Finally, the Debtor notes\n   <em>\n    Horton v.

Although the\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   court does not explain what a \"mortgage note\" is, it relies exclusively on\n   <em>\n    Vogel v. Travelers Indem.

App. 1998). However,\n   <em>\n    Vogel\n   </em>\n   only held that \"[b]ecause the Deed of Trust places a lien on\n   <em>\n    real\n   </em>\n   property, it [the Deed of Trust] is not governed by the UCC.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11838687\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/966/748/#p753\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11838687\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/966/748/#p753\">\n    at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, we arrive back at the uncontroversial proposition that a deed of trust is not subject to the UCC. That does nothing to negate the fact that the Promissory Note is subject to the UCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In the end, the Promissory Note is a negotiable instrument within the ambit of Article 3 of the UCC. Since it is subject to the UCC, the UCC choice of law statute applies. COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 4-1-301 permits the parties broad autonomy to select the governing substantive law for a negotiable instrument so long as there is a reasonable relationship. There certainly was a reasonable relationship with Wisconsin since Wisconsin is where Bank of Lake Mills is located and the Promissory Note was accepted. Further, and perhaps most importantly, Wisconsin is the place of payment. Under these circumstances, the Colorado UCC requires that the parties' selection of Wisconsin law as the governing substantive law must be honored. And, under Wisconsin law, the interest rate in the Promissory Note is valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Under General Colorado Choice of Law Principles, Wisconsin Substantive Law Applies so the Promissory Note Interest Rate Is Permissible\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Having already ruled against the Debtor's choice of law position on multiple grounds (DIDA Section 1831d, federal choice of law, and the Colorado UCC), the Court is not obligated to consider general Colorado choice of law principles.

D. Colo. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The Debtor makes no serious argument for the Restatement Section 187(2)(a) exception to the Parties' chosen law. Clearly, Wisconsin has a substantial relationship to the parties and the Promissory Note transaction. As previously noted, Bank of Lake Mills is a Wisconsin chartered bank located in Lake Mills, Wisconsin. The Promissory Note states that it \"is accepted by [Bank of Lake Mills] in Wisconsin.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, it provides that the place of payment is in Wisconsin (\"or at such other location or in such manner as designated by [Bank of Lake Mills]\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is quite enough.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10349166\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/876/112/\">\n    876 P.2d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding reasonable basis for applying New York law where, even though neither party was presently located in New York, defendant was previously headquartered in New York).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Thus, the Debtor centers its argument on the Restatement Section 187(2)(b) exception to the parties' chosen law. There are three main elements to that exception as applied to this Adversary Proceeding: (1) Colorado must have a \"materially greater interest\" than Wisconsin in the substantive law governing interest rates; (2) the application of Wisconsin substantive law governing interest rates must be \"contrary to a fundamental policy\" of Colorado; and (3) Colorado would be the chosen substantive law \"in the absence of an effective choice by the parties.\" To override the Parties' agreement to apply Wisconsin substantive law, the Debtor must demonstrate that all three elements of the exception are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The Debtor failed to establish that Colorado has a \"materially greater interest\" than Wisconsin in the substantive law governing interest rates. Again, there were two parties to the Promissory Note: Bank of Lake Mills and CMS. Bank of Lake Mills is based in Wisconsin, while CMS listed a Colorado address. So, there is equal balance in terms of the location of Bank of Lake Mills and CMS. But, the Promissory Note contains two other provisions that shift the center of gravity to Wisconsin. Bank of Lake Mills accepted the Promissory Note in Wisconsin. The Debtor acknowledges that \"the [Promissory] Note was made in Wisconsin.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, perhaps most importantly of all, CMS agreed to pay in Wisconsin. So, Wisconsin is the \"place of payment\" under the Promissory Note. Notably, except for referring to Colorado as the location of CMS, the\n   Promissory Note contains no reference to Colorado whatsoever. Based upon the Promissory Note itself, the Court assesses that Wisconsin has a \"materially greater interest\" than Colorado in the substantive law governing interest rates and usury. The Debtor really has only one thing going for it in the \"materially greater interest\" equation. Yosemite Management executed the Deed of Trust pledging the Colorado Property as security for the repayment of the debt evidenced by the Promissory Note. However, the main issue in this Adversary Case is whether the Promissory Note constitutes a valid and enforceable debt. The Debtor's attack is on the interest rate contained in the Promissory Note. The Deed of Trust has no bearing on that issue. Thus, the Debtor fails to show Colorado has a \"materially greater interest\" than Wisconsin on interest rates and usury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196207\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/494/534/#p541\">\n    494 B.R. at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the Bank failed to demonstrate how any interest of Colorado is materially greater than California's interest ....\"). The Restatement Section 187(2)(b) exception collapses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Debtor also fails to prove that application of Wisconsin substantive law concerning interest rates is \"contrary to a fundamental policy\" of Colorado. Clearly, Wisconsin and Colorado have contrary or different policies: Colorado has intervened in the market to establish a 45% interest cap on commercial transactions; Wisconsin has taken a hands-off approach, allowing corporations to use their own judgment and contract for any interest rate they wish. However, the question is not whether Wisconsin substantive law is merely contrary to a policy of Colorado. And, the question also is not whether Colorado has a policy against usury. Instead, the issue is whether\n   <em>\n    the application\n   </em>\n   of Wisconsin law would be contrary to a\n   <em>\n    fundamental\n   </em>\n   policy of Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Is corporate usury protection under COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 5-12-103 a fundamental policy of Colorado? Certainly, Colorado enacted the Colorado Usury Statute. But, surely, not every Colorado statute qualifies as a fundamental policy of Colorado.\n   <em>\n    Continental Mortg. Investors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9557345\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/395/507/#p509\">\n    395 So.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509 (Fla. 1981) (\"We do not think that the mere fact that there exists in Florida a usury statute ... establishes a strong public policy against such conduct in this state where interstate loans are concerned.\") The text of the Colorado Usury Statute does not expressly identify it as a \"fundamental policy.\" The Colorado Usury Statute is located in Title 5 of the Colorado Revised Statutes. Most of that title is directed to the Colorado Consumer Credit Code. COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 5-1-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Colorado Consumer Credit Code does contain a section identifying \"underlying purposes and policies\" to protect consumers. COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 5-1-102(2). But, none of those purposes and policies is directed to corporate usury and the need to protect corporations from bad judgments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dikeou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958720\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/928/1286/#p1293\">\n    928 P.2d at 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing \"the distinct differences between the consumer loan and nonconsumer loan settings\" and declining to find any policy benefit in applying consumer protections to nonconsumer transactions under the Colorado Usury Statute especially where the debtor was not an \"unsophisticated borrower\"). The Debtor has not provided the Court with any definitive case law, legislative history, or other materials suggesting that the Colorado Usury Statute, especially as applied to corporations, is of any particularly great importance to the State of Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The best the Debtor can offer for the fundamental policy argument is snippets from two cases. In\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"378797\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/236/683/#p691\">\n    236 F.Supp. at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the district court stated: \"[T]he [Colorado] legislature's condemnation of usury is manifest. The Colorado public policy\n   pronouncements against retention of usurious interest have been strong.\" The\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   court did not identify any specific support for its \"strong\" \"public policy\" conclusion. Restatement Section 187(2) choice of law was not at issue. So, the\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   court did not assess whether the application of another State's law would violate a\n   <em>\n    fundamental\n   </em>\n   policy of Colorado. The Debtor also cites a passage from\n   <em>\n    Tucker v. R.A.

Since every law is an expression of the public policy of the state, some higher threshold is needed to prevent the forum's law from being applied in every case. A strict construction of the public policy exception was felt necessary to prevent the whole field of conflicts of law from collapsing in on itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20N.E.%20198\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20N.E.%20198\">\n    at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Seizing onto the appellate court's statement that proscriptions against usury were \"examples of the kind of public policies that for a state court to countenance such activities would in Justice Cardozo's words, 'violate some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of morals, some deep-seated tradition of the commonweal,' \" the Debtor concludes that the application of Wisconsin interest rate law would violate a fundamental policy of Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The Debtor's argument has some allure. But the issue in\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   was very different from this Adversary Case. In\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , the central question was whether a New Mexico court could enforce an indemnification clause. Neither usury nor Colorado policies had anything to do with the case. So, any passing mention of usury is no more than dicta. Further, in\n   <em>\n    Loucks\n   </em>\n   , the decision cited for support by the\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   court, usury also was not an issue. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Loucks\n   </em>\n   involved only the question of whether a federal court could assume jurisdiction over and enforce a Massachusetts statute providing for the payment of damages resulting from negligence where the victim of the negligence was a New York resident traveling through Massachusetts. Again, any passing mention of usury is of no real moment. The decision did not involve either usury or Colorado policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Thus, although another close call, the Court determines that the Debtor failed to show that application of Wisconsin interest rate law in a commercial transaction with a Wisconsin state chartered bank would violate Colorado fundamental policy. Indeed, Colorado courts historically have allowed the application of the law of other States in similar circumstances. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Baxter v.

Regarding the \"place of negotiation of the contract,\" neither the Debtor nor the Lender presented the Court with any evidence concerning the location for contract negotiations. So, that factor cannot be weighed in the analysis. The \"place of performance\" of the Promissory Note is Wisconsin. That is because the Promissory\n   Note designates Wisconsin as the place for payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 4-3-111 (stating that \"an instrument is payable at the place of payment stated in the instrument\"). With respect to the \"location of the subject matter of the contract,\" neither the Debtor nor the Lender offered the Court any evidence about the subject matter of the Promissory Note. All the Court knows for sure is that CMS borrowed $ 550,000 from Bank of Lake Mills for \"business purposes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is unaware of the business of CMS or where such business was conducted. The Court is in the dark concerning how the funds were used; except that the Court can surmise that, because the Property was owned by Yosemite Management, not CMS, the loan proceeds were not used to purchase the Property pledged under the Deed of Trust. The Court does not know the relationship between CMS and Yosemite Management. Ultimately, the Court cannot weigh the \"subject matter of the contract\" because of the lack of evidence. Finally, respecting \"domicil, residence ..., place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties,\" the Court has limited information that results in a wash. The original lender is a state bank chartered in Wisconsin and its offices are located in Wisconsin. The Lender is from New York. The Court has not been advised concerning the residence and place of incorporation of CMS, but CMS listed its \"principal place of business\" as Colorado. The Debtor is from Colorado. Considering all of the Restatement Section 188(2) factors for which there is evidence, it is clear that the balance tips toward selection of Wisconsin law as the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law in the Promissory Note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     The Debtor's Focus on the Deed of Trust in Misplaced\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The predicate for the bankruptcy claims (under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 510 ) asserted\n   in the Complaint is that the Promissory Note is usurious under the Colorado Usury Statute. In the Complaint, the Debtor alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   \u2022 \"the WBL Note is usurious on its face, providing for a default interest rate of 130.363% per annum\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   \u2022 \"The WBL Note provided for a default interest rate of 130.363%\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   \u2022 \"Pursuant to the usurious terms of the WBL Note....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   \u2022 \"Based on this usurious interest rate, the Borrower and Guarantors subject to the WBL Note would be forced to pay WBL a total amount that included interest well exceeding the legal limit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   \u2022 \"The filing of the foreclosure and the WBL Proof of Claim constitute an attempt to collect a usurious debt and present a justiciable dispute\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   \u2022 \"WBL's claim for interest charged on the WBL Note is usurious in excess of the lawful amount that can be charged\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   \u2022 \"the WBL Note was usurious ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The Debtor's claims refer specifically to the Colorado Usury Statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, the relief requested flows from the assertion of usury. In the First Claim for Relief, the Debtor asks that the Court make \"a declaration that the interest charged under said note [Promissory Note] is usurious\" and, as a result of such declaration, also declare \"the extent, priority, and validity\" of [the Lender's] lien. In the Second Claim for Relief, the Debtor asks the Court to completely disallow the Lender's Proof of Claim based on usury. Finally, in the Third Claim for Relief, the Debtor desires equitable subordination of the Lender's Proof of Claim because the Lender \"sought to collect from and have [the Debtor] pay a greater rate of interest than is allowed by Colorado law and [the Lender] knew that the WBL Note was usurious ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Given the foregoing, the Court has focused on the Promissory Note and whether the Promissory Note is usurious. To make that decision, the critical issue is the applicable law governing the Promissory Note. But, in its Closing Argument and Supplemental Legal Briefs, the Debtor has tried to shift ground and argue about the Deed of Trust. For example, the Debtor suggests that that the Lender's Proof of Claim is \"pursuant to\n   <em>\n    a Deed of Trust bearing an interest rate\n   </em>\n   in excess of Colorado usury laws.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   From this premise, the Debtor emphasizes that the Deed of Trust involves the Colorado Property. And, the Debtor repeatedly points out that the Deed of Trust includes an express Colorado choice of law provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The Court does not accept the Debtor's misdirection. The Deed of Trust does not bear any interest rate and cannot be usurious. The Promissory Note and the Deed of Trust are two different legal documents serving distinct purposes. The Promissory Note is a promise to pay. And, only the Promissory Note contains an interest rate. As already explained, the Promissory Note is a negotiable instrument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 4-3-104(a) (\" 'negotiable instrument' means an unconditional promise to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges\"). It is also an \"evidence of debt.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-38-100.3(8) (\" 'Evidence of debt' means a writing that evidences a promise to pay ... such as a\n   promissory note ....\"). For reasons that the Court cannot fathom, CMS agreed to borrow $ 550,000 from the Bank of Lake Mills and repay such principal plus interest at the incredibly high rate of 120.86% per annum. The Debtor has raised the issue of whether the Promissory Note interest rate is usurious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The Deed of Trust is something altogether different. It is not an independent promise to pay. It does not contain a separate interest rate. The Deed of Trust is only a security device by which a party, Yosemite Management, pledged its own real property to secure the monetary obligation evidenced by the Promissory Note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-38-100.3(7) (\" 'Deed of trust' means a security instrument containing a grant to a public trustee together with a power of sale.\") Further, the Deed of Trust governs the process of foreclosure. Naturally, deeds of trust are governed by local law where real property is located and subject to foreclosure. So, as is typical, since Yosemite Management pledged the Property located in Colorado, the Deed of Trust is governed by Colorado law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   But, that does not mean that somehow the choice of law in the Deed of Trust can be used to transmogrify the choice of law in the Promissory Note as the Debtor seems to imply. Consider a typical large credit facility in the United States. A national bank based in California loans $ 1 billion to a large company headquartered in Colorado but with ten manufacturing facilities in ten different States. One promissory note is executed by the Colorado borrower providing for application of California law (because the national bank is based in California). As security, the Colorado borrower executes ten deeds of trust (1 for each of its ten manufacturing facilities in ten different States). Because the deeds of trust involve real property, each of the deeds of trust will be governed by the local law applicable where each manufacturing facility is located. But the deeds of trust cannot be used to change the choice of law in the promissory note. Instead, the validity of the promissory note can only be governed by a single applicable law as selected in the promissory note. The ten different laws in the ten different deeds of trust have no bearing on the validity of the promissory note or its choice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   So it is in this case. CMS executed the Promissory Note, governed by federal or Wisconsin law (if not preempted), in favor of Bank of Lake Mills. The Promissory Note is the evidence of the debt. Any usury attack can only challenge the Promissory Note. The Deed of Trust solely served to provide some security by pledging the Colorado Property. The Deed of Trust cannot be usurious. So, the choice of law in the Deed of Trust has no bearing on whether the Promissory Note is usurious. Thus, the Court focuses on the Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   It is, as the Court has stated, a complete mystery why Yosemite Management, which was not the borrower under the Promissory Note, voluntarily agreed to pledge its Property under the Deed of Trust to secure payment of the Promissory Note. Given the rate of interest under the Promissory Note, that decision seems like a gross deviation from sound business judgment. And, the Court has no idea why the Debtor decided to purchase the Property from Yosemite Management knowing all along that it was subject to the Deed of Trust and that CMS had defaulted on the Promissory Note. That transaction appears ill-advised at best and virtually insane at worst. But whatever shenanigans Yosemite Management and the Debtor were engaged in is beside the point. The\n   Court assesses usury based on the Promissory Note, not based on the Deed of Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n    <em>\n     Legal Conclusions\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   No matter which choice of law approach is utilized (DIDA Section 1831d, federal common law, Colorado UCC, or Colorado general common law principles under Restatement Section 187 and 188 ), all roads lead to Wisconsin as the proper substantive law governing the Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Debtor Fails on its First Claim for Relief: Declaratory Judgment\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   In its First Claim for Relief, the Debtor sought a declaration that \"the interest charged under [the Promissory Note] is usurious under C.R.S. \u00a7 5-12-103.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor characterized the cause of action as for \"Declaratory Judgment\" and also cited Fed.

Thus, the Debtor bears the higher burden of proof applicable for non-insider equitable subordination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The Debtor seeks equitable subordination of the Lender's Proof of Claim \"due to [Lender's] inequitable conduct in seeking to collect from the Property and have Rent-Rite pay a greater rate of interest\n   than is allowed by Colorado law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Debtor, the Lender's effort to enforce the Promissory Note terms is \"imbued with bad faith and illegality.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor failed to present evidence demonstrating any of the requirements for imposition of the equitable subordination remedy. There is no showing that the Lender's filing of the Proof of Claim based upon the Promissory Note and secured by the Deed of Trust on the Property is tantamount to fraud, illegality, or breach of fiduciary duties. CMS contractually agreed to the extraordinarily high interest rate. Yosemite Management pledged the Property as security for such debt under the Promissory Note. Later, the Debtor purchased the Property from Yosemite Management. At the time, the Debtor was aware that the Property was encumbered by the Deed of Trust securing the Promissory Note. And, the Debtor knew that the Promissory Note was in default. In fact, the Debtor received the benefit of a price reduction because of such default. In retrospect, the Debtor's decision to buy the Property knowing that it was encumbered by a defaulted Promissory Note bearing 120.86% interest per annum appears insane. The Court cannot fathom any reason why CMS agreed to the Promissory Note in the first place, why Yosemite Management voluntarily pledged the Property to secure the debt, or why the Debtor acquired the Property under such circumstances. Clearly, CMS, Yosemite Management, and the Debtor made bad decisions. But that does not mean that Bank of Lake Mills or the Lender engaged in inequitable conduct. The Lender only seeks what it is entitled to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII.\n    <em>\n     Order and Judgment\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that the Debtor failed to establish that the super-high interest rate contained in the Promissory Note is usurious. Accordingly, the Debtor is not entitled to a declaratory judgment or equitable subordination of the Lender's Proof of Claim. The Lender ultimately satisfied its burden for allowance of the Proof of Claim\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   against the Property.

Worldcom, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9487432\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/263/1205/#p1211\">\n     263 F.3d 1205\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1211 (10th Cir. 2001). In\n    <em>\n     Mauldin\n    </em>\n    , the appellate court only determined that \"neither party argue[d] that the contracts [were] subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\"; so, the appellate panel did not consider the issue.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9487432\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/263/1205/#p1211\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9487432\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/263/1205/#p1211\">\n     at 1211\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The\n    <em>\n     Mauldin\n    </em>\n    court did not determine that there was a waiver of a preemption argument by reason of its not being identified in a pleading.\n    <em>\n     Hansen v. Harper Excavating, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206757\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/1216/#p1221\">\n     641 F.3d 1216\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1221 (10th Cir. 2011) is similar. In that case, the Tenth Circuit noted that \"ordinary preemption\" is a \"federal defense\"; however, the appellate panel did not characterize preemption as an affirmative defense that must be made in a pleading or be deemed waived.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-315\">\n    In the absence of binding appellate precedent, the Court is reticent to decide the DIDA Section 1831d issue based on waiver. First, preemption is not identified among the \"avoidance or affirmative defenses\" listed in Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1), as incorporated by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7008. Second, the Complaint refers to (and effectively incorporates) the Promissory Note, which refers to \"federal law\": \"Lender [the Bank of Lake Mills] is an FDIC insured, Wisconsin state chartered bank .... CONSEQUENTLY, THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY FEDERAL LAW APPLICABLE TO AN FDIC INSURED INSTITUTION AND TO THE EXTENT NOT PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.\" Thus, DIDA Section 1831d is the applicable \"federal law\" referenced in the Promissory Note. Third, in the Proof of Claim, the Debtor attached the Promissory Note. Fourth, in its Answer, the Lender asserted as an \"Affirmative Defense\" that \"the laws of the State of Wisconsin ... govern the rate of interest on the Note\" as well as asserting that the \"Note speaks for itself.\" And, in this case, DIDA Section 1831d depends on the same \"laws of the State of Wisconsin.\" Finally, the Lender argued in its Supplemental Legal Briefs that DIDA Section 1831d governs the usury issue. Thus, the Court rejects the waiver argument whilst noting that the Lender should have been clearer in its Answer and legal briefing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"59\">\n   <p id=\"p-316\">\n    Docket No. 36 at 6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"60\">\n   <p id=\"p-317\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543361,6126146\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/839/203/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"61\">\n   <p id=\"p-318\">\n    Compl. \u00b6 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"62\">\n   <p id=\"p-319\">\n    Compl.

Neither the Debtor nor the Lender argued that Restatement Section 195 governs the choice of law issues in this Adversary Proceeding. The Court concurs, since Restatement Section 195 applies only \"in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties,\" while in the Promissory Note, the Parties did agree to a specific applicable law. Furthermore, Restatement Section 195 provides that in the absence of an effective choice of law, the contract will be governed by \"the local law of the state where the contract requires that repayment be made, unless ... some other state has a more significant relationship .... to the transaction and the parties ....\" As already explained, Wisconsin is the place of payment and also has the most significant relationship to the Promissory Note. So, Restatement Section 195 offers no aid for the Debtor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-340\">\n    In its Supplemental Legal Brief, the Debtor made an argument for the application of Restatement Section 203. That Section states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-341\">\n    The validity of a contract will be sustained against a charge of usury if it provides for a rate of interest that is permissible in a state to which the contract has a substantial relationship and is not greatly in excess of the rate permitted by the general usury law of the state of the otherwise applicable law under the rule of \u00a7 188.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-342\">\n    Since Restatement Section 203 is directed specifically at usury (which is at the heart of this Adversary Proceeding), the Court assumed that Section was most relevant. But neither the Debtor nor the Lender focused on it very much. In any event, Restatement Section 203 results in the selection of Wisconsin law. That is because CMS and Bank of Lake Mills chose Wisconsin law, the Promissory Note has a substantial relationship with Wisconsin, and the high interest rate is not in excess of the rate permitted in Wisconsin. Also, as explained previously, Wisconsin law is the applicable law under a Restatement Section 188 analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"83\">\n   <p id=\"p-343\">\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 24, 25, 27, 28, 32, and 36.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"84\">\n   <p id=\"p-344\">\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 28, and 32.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"85\">\n   <p id=\"p-345\">\n    Compl. \u00b6 36.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"86\">\n   <p id=\"p-346\">\n    Docket No. 36 at 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"87\">\n   <p id=\"p-347\">\n    Compl. at 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"88\">\n   <p id=\"p-348\">\n    Compl. at 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"89\">\n   <p id=\"p-349\">\n    Docket No. 36 at 10.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"90\">\n   <p id=\"p-350\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543361,6126146\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/839/203/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
