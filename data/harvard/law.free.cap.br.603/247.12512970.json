White (the \"Trustee\"), the plaintiff in this adversary proceeding and trustee in the underlying Chapter 7 bankruptcy case filed by Steven C. Lloyd (the \"Debtor\"), requiring the Trustee to show cause as to why the adversary proceeding should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. If the claims brought by the Trustee against Michael T. Gaffney (\"Gaffney\"), the Debtor's former attorney, are property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Trustee has standing to prosecute them and the matter is properly before this Court. If the claims do not fall within the bankruptcy estate, however, the Trustee does not have standing to pursue them and the adversary proceeding must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    FACTS AND POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2015, the Debtor sought Gaffney's professional assistance after a judgment creditor had obtained an attachment on the Debtor's residence. Seeking to protect a lot of undeveloped land in Maine, the Debtor and his wife (allegedly acting on Gaffney's advice) transferred their interest in that property to a trust, of which the Debtor's two children and his son-in-law were the beneficiaries. Shortly thereafter, in June 2016, and with the assistance of a\n   different attorney, the Debtor commenced the underlying bankruptcy case by filing a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Not surprisingly, the Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against the trust to recover the property as a fraudulent transfer pursuant to \u00a7 548 of the Code. That action was eventually resolved through settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Trustee then commenced the present adversary proceeding against Gaffney. In the complaint, the Trustee raises several claims, each premised on the Trustee's allegation that Gaffney committed malpractice when he advised the Debtor to transfer the Maine property (together, the \"malpractice claims\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following an unsuccessful attempt to have the District Court withdraw its reference of the case to this Court, Gaffney filed an answer and the Court set the matter for a pretrial hearing. At the conclusion of that hearing, the Court issued an order requiring the Trustee to show cause as to why the adversary proceeding should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, as it appeared from the allegations in the complaint that the alleged malpractice claims (to the extent they are viable) arose postpetition. Both parties were given an opportunity to brief the relevant issues. Following a non-evidentiary hearing, the Court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Trustee maintains that the malpractice claims are property of the bankruptcy estate both because they had accrued under state law at the time the bankruptcy case was filed and because the claims are \"sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past and so little entangled with the [Debtor's] ability to make an unencumbered fresh start that [they] should be regarded as 'property' [of the estate].\"\n   <em>\n    Segal v. Rochelle,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    382 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    86 S.Ct. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181838\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/382/375/#p380\">\n    15 L.Ed.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). According to the Trustee, the transfer of the Maine property harmed the Debtor by exposing him \"to claims from creditors that he had engaged in fraud and had violated the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, G.L. ch. 109A.\" Further, the Trustee argues, the Debtor was aware of that harm prepetition as evidenced by a statement signed by the Debtor after retaining bankruptcy counsel in which the Debtor indicated that he understood \"that the bankruptcy trustee will likely view this conveyance as a fraudulent transfer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gaffney argues that the claims are not property of the bankruptcy estate because the claims (if any) arose postpetition. Discounting the impact of the signed statement acknowledging the likelihood that the Trustee would view the transfer as fraudulent, Gaffney notes instead that the Debtor did not list a potential malpractice claim or any other claims against Gaffney in his bankruptcy schedules, nor did the Debtor testify to the possible existence of the malpractice claims at the meeting of creditors. Gaffney further contends that the Debtor was not harmed - the Debtor could not have claimed an exemption in the Maine property even if he had not transferred it, and he received a discharge without challenge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (allowing for the denial of a debtor's bankruptcy discharge based on a prepetition transfer made with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[S]tanding is a 'threshold question in every federal case, determining the\n   power of the court to entertain the suit,' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Eldorado Canyon Prop., LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5889507\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/505/598/#p600\">\n    505 B.R. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600 (1st Cir.
