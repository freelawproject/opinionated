INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Danny Hanna (\"the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Debtor\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \") filed a Chapter 13 petition on January 23, 2017 (\"the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Petition Date\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \") [Main Case Doc. No. 1]. On May 9, 2017, DMM Group, Inc. (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DMM\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \") initiated the pending adversary proceeding against the Debtor [Adv. Doc. No. 1]. Prior to the Debtor's filing of his Chapter 13 petition, DMM extended a loan of $150,000.00 to the Debtor's 100%-owned company, a debt that the Debtor personally guaranteed. DMM requests this Court to enter a judgment for the amount of the unpaid loan, plus attorneys' fees and costs, as a nondischargeable debt for which the Debtor is liable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court held a one-day trial in this adversary proceeding on May 29, 2019. The Court then took the matter under advisement. On July 1, 2019, this Court held a brief hearing to announce orally on the record that it had decided to grant the relief sought by DMM. The Court indicated that it would eventually issue written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, together with a judgment, explaining its decision. However, the Court informed the parties that it would refrain from entering its written findings and conclusions, plus the judgment, until after DMM had proven up its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The Court instructed DMM's counsel to submit his fee bills to counsel for the Debtor by no later than noon on July 3, 2019, and also instructed the Debtor's counsel to file a certificate by no later than 5:00 p.m. on July 10, 2019 setting forth whether the Debtor objected to the amount of the fees and expenses requested by DMM. The Court further stated that if, and only if, the Debtor filed an objection would this Court hold a separate evidentiary hearing requiring DMM to prove up its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DMM's counsel did, in fact, timely submit his firm's fee bills, which reflect that the DMM's fees and expenses total $19,031.79. [Adv. Doc. No. 42]. The deadline of July 10, 2019 for the Debtor to file a certificate objecting to this amount has expired, and the Debtor has lodged no objection. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Debtor agrees that the amount of $19,031.79 is a reasonable amount for DMM to recover from the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Now that the issue of reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses has been determined, the Court proceeds to issue these written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to Rule 7052 explaining why it has decided to grant the relief requested by DMM and enter a judgment declaring that $219,535.47, the outstanding amount owed under the loan documents (including unpaid principal, accrued unpaid interest, attorneys' fees and expenses) is a nondischargeable obligation owed by the Debtor. To the extent that any finding of fact is construed as a conclusion of law, it is adopted as such; and to the extent that any conclusion of law is construed as a finding of fact, it is adopted as such. The Court reserves the right to make additional findings and conclusions as this Court deems appropriate or as may be requested by either of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. The Debtor is a former principal of Blackwolf Security Group, LLC (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Blackwolf\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"). Blackwolf's headquarters was in the Woodlands, Texas, and it was in the security business-i.e. providing security to various corporations and organizations. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 10:17:24 - 10:17:35 a.m., 2:53:38 - 2:54:14 p.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. DMM is owned entirely by Dale Mohn (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mohn\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"). [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:47:54 - 1:48:06 p.m.]. Mohn is the sole decision-maker for DMM, whose business\n   involves security consulting and making investments, which includes extending loans. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:47:54 - 1:48:06 p.m., 1:49:28 - 1:49:32 p.m., 2:20:22-2:20:46 p.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   3. Patrick Magill (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Magill\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \") is an accountant who has referred business to DMM in the past. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:49:25 - 1:49:42 p.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   4. Magill also provided accounting services to Blackwolf. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:49:42 - 1:49:54 p.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   5. Magill suggested to Mohn that DMM might want to provide financing to Blackwolf, and a meeting was subsequently arranged. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:49:35 - 1:49:42 p.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   6. In early June of 2016, Mohn met with the Debtor, Magill, and Catherine Carriger (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carriger\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"). [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:48:46 - 1:49:03 p.m.]. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce the parties and to discuss a possible loan from DMM to Blackwolf. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:49:03 - 1:49:42 p.m.]. At this meeting, Mohn met the Debtor and Carriger for the first time. The Debtor informed Mohn that Carriger was in the process of obtaining a security permit and setting up her own minority-owned company in Dallas-Blackwolf SG, LLC (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SG\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \")-to maximize the potential of securing a large contract with the U.S. Department of Labor. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 2:54:48 - 2:55:07 p.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   7. This meeting lasted approximately ninety minutes. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:52:03 - 1:52:08 p.m.]. The Debtor did much of the speaking and expressly represented to Mohn that Blackwolf was expanding its operations with a Dallas office and was planning to start a training business in Dallas. [Joint Pretrial Statement, Adv. Doc. No. 35, Stipulated Fact Nos. 12b and 12g, page 7 of 13]. The Debtor further represented to Mohn that Blackwolf and SG needed a $150,000.00 loan to expand their respective businesses in Dallas. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:50:41 -1:51:17 p.m.]. Indeed, the Debtor expressly told Mohn that if DMM would extend financing of $150,000.00, all of the loan proceeds would be used solely to expand business operations in Dallas and that no loan proceeds would be used to pay Hanna or Carriger or for any non-business related purpose. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 2:00:10 - 2:00:50 p.m.]; [ Joint Pretrial Statement, Adv. Doc. No. 35, Stipulated Fact No. 12a, page 7 of 13]. The Debtor also informed Mohn that Blackwolf anticipated an increase in profits of approximately fifteen percent given the business in its pipeline. [ Joint Pretrial Statement, Adv. Doc. No. 35, Stipulated Fact No. 12e, page 7 of 13]. The Debtor also reviewed Blackwolf's balance sheet in order to acquaint Mohn with Blackwolf's financial condition at the time. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:50:17 - 1:50:27 p.m.]. However, the Debtor did not allow Mohn to take a copy of this balance sheet with him once the meeting adjourned because Mohn had not signed a non-disclosure agreement. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:50:25 - 1:50:32\n   p.m., 2:22:30 - 2:23:07 p.m.]. Based upon the financial statements that Mohn reviewed during the meeting, he tentatively concluded that Blackwolf and SG were viable operating entities to which DMM might extend financing. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 2:24:00 - 2:24:07 p.m.]. At this initial meeting, Mohn also asked some questions about Blackwolf, including whether the company was involved in any legal proceedings at the time. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:51:26 - 1:51:38 p.m.]. The Debtor responded that it was not-which was a truthful statement at that time. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:51:38 - 1:51:43 p.m.]. When the meeting was concluded, Mohn made no decision to provide the requested financing. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:51:18-1:51:25 p.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   8. In late August of 2016, the Debtor and Mohn met again to discuss the possibility of DMM extending a loan to Blackwolf and SG. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:52:29 - 1:52:41 p.m.]. Mohn also met Matt Antkowiak (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Antkowiak\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \") at this meeting. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 2:27:40 - 2:27:57 p.m.]. Antkowiak was Blackwolf's quality manager, compliance officer, and operations manager who would be responsible for opening and running Blackwolf's Dallas office and obtaining contracts with the Department of Labor. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 10:18:49 - 10:19:16 a.m., 10:45:56 - 10:46:18 a.m., 2:28:00 - 2:28:17 p.m.]. Paul Cherry (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cherry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"), a CPA and colleague of Magill, also attended this meeting. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:52:29 - 1:52:53 p.m.]. When the meeting was concluded, Mohn decided to provide the requested financing. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 2:31:44 - 2:31:57 p.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   9. On or about August 22, 2016, Blackwolf's account at Spirit of Texas Bank was frozen and the Spirit of Texas Bank commenced legal proceedings against Blackwolf, the Debtor, and Carriger. [Plaintiff's Ex. 28, BS 117-127]. This lawsuit was styled: Cause No. 2016-56225,\n   <em>\n    Spirit of Texas Bank SSB v. Blackwolf Security Group LLC, Danny B. Hanna, and Catherine G. Carriger,\n   </em>\n   in the 113th Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas (\"the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State Court Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"). [Plaintiff's Ex. 28, BS 117-127]. The Debtor did not disclose these facts to Mohn at this time. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 11:00:08 - 11:00:27 a.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   10. On or about August 30, 2016, Blackwolf failed to make scheduled payroll to its employees. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 10:36:20 - 10:36:31 a.m.]. The Debtor did not disclose this fact to Mohn at this time. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 10:35:10 - 10:35:30 a.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   11. At this point in time, the Debtor became very concerned about the continued viability of Blackwolf. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 11:08:18 - 11:08:23 a.m.]. Indeed, at trial, the Debtor testified that at this point, Blackwolf was in \"survival mode\"-as opposed to the \"expansion mode\" frame of mind that he had conveyed to Mohn at the meeting in June. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 11:08:18 -\n   11:08:23 a.m.]. The Debtor did not inform Mohn about Blackwolf's failure to make scheduled payroll or about the Debtor's view that Blackwolf was in \"survival mode.\" [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 11:08:51 - 11:09:32 a.m., 2:02:58 - 2:03:08 p.m.]. As already noted in Finding of Fact No. 9, at some point after the meeting among the Debtor, Antkowiak, Cherry, and Mohn in late August of 2016, Mohn, on behalf of DMM, and in reliance upon the Debtor's representations that Blackwolf would use loan proceeds solely to fund expansion in Dallas, made the decision to provide a $150,000.00 loan to Blackwolf and SG to fund their Dallas expansion. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 2:01:50 - 2:01:56 p.m.]. Mohn decided that DMM would provide the financing without doing any further due diligence or requesting any further financial statements from Blackwolf and SG. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 2:26:38 - 2:27:00 p.m.]. Mohn insisted, however, that the Debtor and Carriger personally guarantee the loan. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 1:57:06 - 1:57:30 p.m.]; [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Ex. 2, BS 005-013]. Accordingly, on September 28, 2016, Blackwolf and SG, through their respective managing members (i.e. the Debtor and Carriger) executed that one certain promissory note in the original principal amount of $150,000.00 payable to DMM (\"the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Note\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"); and the Debtor and Carriger, in their individual capacities, executed a guaranty agreement (\"the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Guaranty\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \") guaranteeing payment of the Note. [Joint Pretrial Statement, Adv. Doc. No. 35, Stipulated Fact No. 4, page 6 of 13]. The Note and the Guaranty were unsecured obligations; DMM did not take a security interest in any assets. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Ex. 1, BS 001-004; Plaintiff's Ex. 2, BS 005-015]. The Note expressly required that Blackwolf provide notice of any litigation or dispute threatened against or affecting Blackwolf. [Plaintiff's Ex. 1, BS 002]. Despite this language, the Debtor never disclosed to Mohn the existence of the State Court Lawsuit. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 2:01:58 - 2:02:10 p.m., 2:02:35 - 2:02:49 p.m.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   12. Upon execution of the Note and the Guaranty, DMM delivered a check for $150,000.00 to Blackwolf. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 10:23:15 - 10:23:43 a.m., 11:54:02 - 11:54:38 a.m.]; [Joint Pretrial Statement, Adv. Doc. No. 35, Stipulated Fact No. 6, page 6 of 13]. This check was deposited into Blackwolf's operating account at Cadence Bank on September 30, 2016. [Plaintiff's Ex. 14, BS 059]. As of the close of business on September 30, 2016, the balance in Blackwolf's account was $186,234.78. [Plaintiff's Ex. 15, BS 071]. Stated differently, just prior to the deposit of the $150,000.00 of loan proceeds, Blackwolf had $36,234.78 of cash on hand. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Ex. 15, BS 071].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   13. Upon receipt of the $150,000.00, Blackwolf very quickly used approximately $36,684.25 to pay past due payroll, and another $41,495.00 to make current payroll. [Plaintiff's Ex. 15, BS 066-085]; [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr at 10:32:35 - 10:32:52 a.m.]. Additionally, the Debtor and Carriger used $3,700.27\n   of these corporate funds to make the following expenditures on behalf of themselves:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   a. $9.19 at a corner store on September 29, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   b. $30.30 at a bar/restaurant (Canyon Creek) on September 29, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   c. $70.34 at a liquor store (Vic's Liquor) on September 29, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   d. $175.00 at a spa (Shag Spa and Salons) on September 29, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   e. $100.08 at a bakery (Crave Bakeshop) on September 30, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   f. $113.57 at a restaurant (Chili's) on September 30, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   g. $203.00 on a cash withdrawal on October 1, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   h. $19.50 at a movie theater (Cinemark) on October 1, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   i. $57.10 at a grocery store (HEB) on October 1, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   j. $169.96 at a restaurant (Babin's Seafood House) on October 1, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   k. $449.23 at a sunglasses store (Sunglass Hut) on October 1, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   l. $ 159.18 at a restaurant (Grotto Ristorante) on October 2, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   m. $311.20 at a clothing store (Vineyard Vines) on October 2, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   n. $512.33 at a clothing store (Vineyard Vines) on October 2, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   o. $772.40 at a clothing store (Nordstrom Rack) on October 2, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   p. $40.00 at a hair salon (Bio Blow Dry Bar) on October 4, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   q. $280.00 at a hair salon (Bio Blow Dry Bar) on October 4, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   r. $129.56 at a grocery store (HEB) on October 4, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   s. $24.70 at a gas station (Shell) on October 6, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   t. $73.63 on dry cleaning (MW Cleaners) on October 6, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [Plaintiff's Ex. 15, BS 066-085].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   14.

In\n   <em>\n    Stern,\n   </em>\n   which involved a core proceeding brought by the debtor under 28 \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C), the Supreme Court held that a bankruptcy court \"lacked the constitutional authority to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor's proof of claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,4332163\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/462/\">\n    564 U.S. at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Description of the Debt that DMM Asserts Should Not to Be Discharged\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   At the outset, it is important to define which debt DMM seeks to prevent from being discharged. First, the Debtor executed the Guaranty that guarantees repayment of any amounts owed by Blackwolf under the Note. Thus, because the principal balance of the Note that Blackwolf did not pay is $150,000.00, the Debtor has personal liability for this amount, plus accrued unpaid interest and all other amounts owed under the Note.

The contract between Blackwolf and DMM-i.e. the Note-was understood to be for a loan by which Blackwolf would expand its Dallas operation. [Finding of Fact No. 7 ]. Yet, DMM presented clear and unequivocal evidence that the Debtor (and Carriger) used all of the loan proceeds for their own personal benefit and for payment of Blackwolf's expenses that had nothing to do with expansion of operations in Dallas. [Finding of Fact Nos. 13-14]. Indeed, the Debtor presented no evidence that he directly used any of DMM's loan to expand Blackwolf's Dallas operations. [Finding of Fact No. 15 ]. The Debtor's rapid use of the loan funds for personal and corporate purposes that had nothing to do with expansion in Dallas and his subsequent failure to answer Mohn's communications indicate that the Debtor, well before he executed the Note and the Guaranty on September 28, 2016, had no intention of using the funds to expand the Dallas operation or pay back the loan according to the terms of the Note and the Guaranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Furthermore, the Debtor deliberately failed to disclose Blackwolf's involvement in the State Court Lawsuit. [Finding of Fact No. 9 ]. This point is underscored by the fact that the Debtor asked his attorney about the status of the State Court Lawsuit after the Debtor told Mohn that Blackwolf was not involved in any legal proceedings in the early June 2016 meeting. [Finding of Fact Nos. 7, 16]. The State Court Lawsuit was filed on or about August 22, 2016. [Finding of Fact No. 9 ]. The Debtor did not disclose to Mohn Blackwolf's involvement in the State Court Lawsuit before the loan proceeds were disbursed on September 28, 2016. [Finding of Fact Nos. 9, 12]. Yet, the Note required that Blackwolf provide notice of any litigation or dispute threatened against or affecting Blackwolf. [Finding of Fact No. 11 ]. Therefore, Blackwolf had a duty to tell inform DMM about any litigation or dispute threatened against or affecting Blackwolf. Because silence can constitute fraudulent misrepresentation when one has a duty to speak,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Debtor fraudulently misrepresented material facts concerning the status of Blackwolf's involvement in the State Court Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In response to DMM's allegations, the Debtor contends that he believed the litigation would have no effect on Blackwolf and that he always intended to repay the loan, but circumstances beyond his control prevented him from doing so. [Tape Recording, May 29, 2019, Tr. at 11:57:37 a.m. - 12:03:02 p.m.]. The Debtor's testimony does not reflect his actions, and this Court simply does not believe him. Indeed, the Debtor expressly asked his attorney about the status of the State Court Lawsuit. [Finding of Fact No. 16 ]. This would not have occurred if he was positive the lawsuit would not affect Blackwolf. Furthermore, the Debtor indicated that the matter required immediate attention, demonstrating his perception of the lawsuit's significance. [Finding of Fact No. 16 ]. Moreover, the Debtor's failure to communicate at all with Mohn upon the failure to make timely payments under the Note was well within his control. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 17 ]. If the Debtor was intent on repaying the loan, he would have been\n   more communicative and forthright with Mohn. Dodging calls and emails and quickly filing bankruptcy indicates the Debtor did not intend to repay the loan at the time the first payment came due.

The Debtor argues that he did not describe a past or current fact, which in turn leads him to assert that DMM has failed to satisfy its burden of proving past or current facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   This Court disagrees. The Debtor accepted the loan proceeds on September 28, 2016, knowing full well that he and Carriger would-within a few days-use all the loan funds to pay for personal items and corporate expenses having nothing to do with expanding Blackwolf's business in Dallas. [Finding of Fact Nos. 13, 14]. After all, the Debtor-without any disclosure whatsoever to DMM for the five weeks between the commencement of the State Court Lawsuit and the loan disbursement on September 28, 2016-knew that: (1) the State Court Lawsuit existed; (2) Blackwolf was in default on its employee payroll; and (3) Blackwolf was in \"survival mode\" due to a lack of cash flow. [Finding of Fact Nos. 9-11]. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that the Debtor's representations made about the use of the loan proceeds for expansion in Dallas were representations that the Debtor had no intention of performing as promised at the time Blackwolf accepted the $150,000.00 from DMM. DMM has therefore satisfied its burden in this respect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Case law supports this conclusion.

[Finding of Fact No. 7 ]. Instead, the Debtor used the loan proceeds of $150,000.00 to pay for his own personal expenses and corporate expenses of Blackwolf totally unrelated to the Dallas expansion. [Finding of Fact Nos. 13, 14]. Indeed, not one dime was spent on Dallas expansion efforts. [Finding of Fact No. 15 ]. This is because contrary to what the Debtor repeatedly represented to Mohn in his communications with him prior to the September 28, 2106 loan closing, the Debtor did not intend for Blackwolf's loan to be used for Blackwolf's Dallas operations at the time the loan proceeds were disbursed. Rather, at the time the loan proceeds were disbursed, he intended that any loan proceeds advanced under the Note would be used for his own and Carriger's personal expenses and coming current with Blackwolf's pre-existing debts, not the least of which was its past-due payroll. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 13-15]. Indeed, this is why the Debtor did not return any of Mohn's attempts at communication when the first payment on the Note became due, but was not paid. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 17 ]. This is also why the Debtor, prior to the loan closing of September 28, 2016, did not make disclosure about: (1) the existence of the State Court Lawsuit; (2) Blackwolf's existing default on its own payroll; (3) that Blackwolf was in a \"survival mode\" as opposed to an \"expansion mode\"; and (4) his intention, plus Carriger's intention, to use some of the loan proceeds for personal luxury items.

The Debtor most assuredly did not want DMM to know that all loan proceeds would be used for Blackwolf's backpay and the Debtor and Carriger's personal expenses, as the Debtor knew that DMM would not advance funds under the Note if it knew that the loan proceeds would be used for something other than the purpose of expanding business operations in Dallas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Under all of these circumstances, the Court finds that in the first instance, the\n   Debtor's representation that Blackwolf was not in litigation was a false statement about a current fact because on the date of the loan closing-September 28, 2016-Blackwolf was a defendant in the State Court Lawsuit. [Finding of Fact No. 9 ]. Hence, DMM has met its burden to prove a current fact. Moreover, as of the date of the loan closing, the Debtor knew that Blackwolf was in default to its own employees and was in a \"survival mode,\" and yet he deliberately failed to disclose these current facts to Mohn that would have corrected the false impression that Mohn had on that day that Blackwolf was in sound financial shape and that the loan proceeds would be used solely for business expansion purposes in Dallas. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 6-7, 10-12]. This Court finds that the Debtor's silence about these current facts satisfies this second element of section 523(a)(2)(A) for false representations. Indeed, like the debtor in\n   <em>\n    Jacobson,\n   </em>\n   the Debtor here immediately spent the loan proceeds by paying for items other than what DMM believed the loan proceeds would be used for based upon the Debtor's express representations. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 7 ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Thus, for all of the above-referenced reasons, this Court concludes that DMM has satisfied its burden and finds that the Debtor's representations described past or current facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    DMM Relied Upon the Debtor's False Representations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The next element to obtain a judgment that a debt is nondischargeable for false representations is the necessity that DMM relied on the Debtor's representations.\n   <em>\n    Field v.

[\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact Nos. 7-9, 11]. And, in fact, DMM has proven that at the time the loan proceeds were disbursed, the Debtor failed to disclose the existence of the State Court Lawsuit or that Blackwolf was in survival mode and was not going to use the funds for expansion into Dallas, but rather to pay past-due corporate debts, existing corporate debts unrelated to Dallas expansion, and the personal expenses of the Debtor and Carriger. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact Nos. 14-15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Under all of these circumstances, the Court finds that DMM justifiably relied upon the representations that the Debtor made orally to Mohn at the meeting in early June of 2016, the meeting in late August of 2016, and the silence between the late August of 2016 meeting and September 28, 2016, when the loan funds were disbursed. It was not readily apparent or obvious to Mohn that the representations were false; he had no reason to believe that the Debtor was lying to him about Blackwolf being in good financial standing or was not involved in any litigation or dispute threatened against or affecting it. There were simply no \"red flags\"-to use the language of\n   <em>\n    Third Coast Bank\n   </em>\n   -that would have required DMM to further investigate whether the Debtor's representations-namely, that all loan proceeds would be used for expansion in Dallas-might be inaccurate and therefore should not have been relied upon. Moreover, Magill had previously referred prospective borrowers to DMM [ Finding of Fact No. 3 ], and there is no evidence that DMM had experienced any issues of dishonesty or lack of integrity with these individuals. Here, DMM had a track record with Magill's referred borrowers that gave it some level of comfort about the Debtor that it otherwise might not have had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Under all of these circumstances, the Court finds that DMM has met its burden of showing that it justifiably relied upon the Debtor's representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The Debtor's Conduct Caused Damage to DMM\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   There is no question that the Debtor's conduct caused damage to DMM. Not only did the Debtor deprive DMM of the funds it loaned to Blackwolf by deliberately remaining silent about Blackwolf's poor financial condition and involvement in the State Court Lawsuit and signing loan documents containing provisions with which he had no intention of complying; the Debtor also deprived DMM from recovering the $150,000.00 it loaned to Blackwolf or any of the interest that accrued on the loan. [Finding of Fact No. 18 ]. But for the skullduggerous actions of the borrower's principal-i.e., the Debtor-DMM would have suffered no harm. Therefore, the Debtor undeniably caused damage to DMM.\n   <em>\n    In re Kroh,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11937546\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/88/972/#p984\">\n    88 B.R. at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Bank has been damaged in the amount of the unpaid balance on each note, the interest accrued on the notes, and the attorney's fees incurred.

To obtain a judgment that a debt is nondischargeable for false pretenses, the creditor must show the following: (1) the debtor engaged in conduct \"wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes [such as] deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane[ry] or overreaching;\" (2) scienter or intent; (3) causation; and (4) damages.\n   <em>\n    Novartis Corp. v.

[\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 18 ]. In early June of 2016, the Debtor and Magill first met with Mohn to discuss funding Blackwolf and SG's expansion into Dallas. [Finding of Fact No. 7 ]. Importantly, the Debtor only indicated the need for financing for Blackwolf and SG's expansion [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ], not for Blackwolf's previously incurred debts or for luxury items for the Debtor and Carriger. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 13-14]. Yet, while DMM was considering funding Blackwolf's expansion during late August and September of 2016, Blackwolf was in survival mode, did not make timely payroll to its employees, and was sued in the State Court Lawsuit; meanwhile, the Debtor said absolutely nothing to DMM about these facts. [Finding of Fact Nos. 9-11]. The Debtor had a duty to disclose to DMM after Blackwolf's involvement in the State Court Lawsuit that it was involved in the State Court Lawsuit given that Mohn had asked the Debtor if Blackwolf was involved in legal proceedings at the first meeting in early June and the Debtor answered that it was not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Finding of Fact No. 7 ]. The Debtor also had a duty to disclose that Blackwolf had not made payroll and was in \"survival mode\" after leading Mohn to believe that\n   the loan proceeds would be used only for expansion and that Blackwolf was in a favorable financial position.

The Debtor's conduct was dishonest and harmed DMM because: (1) DMM did not have an opportunity to weigh whether it wanted to make the loan given the adverse change in Blackwolf's financial position; (2) DMM did not have an opportunity to weigh whether it wanted to make the loan given Blackwolf's involvement in the State Court Lawsuit; and (3) DMM did not know Blackwolf was in the woeful cash flow position that it was when DMM disbursed the loan proceeds. [Finding of Fact Nos. 9-12]. Stated differently, the Debtor's deceitful conduct during late August and September of 2016 deprived DMM of its right to know the intended purpose of the loan and how much risk was actually associated with the loan-all of which eventually resulted in DMM being duped into advancing $150,000.00 as an unsecured loan that has never been repaid.

Here, the Debtor's sophistication, business acumen, and long-term experience in the security business underscore that he was fully aware of his wrongful intentions and that he knew exactly what he was doing when he led DMM to believe that the loan proceeds would be used for Blackwolf and SG's Dallas expansion and that Blackwolf was in good financial standing and was not involved in any legal proceedings at the time the loan proceeds were disbursed.

[Finding of Fact Nos. 7-12]. Viewed in the aggregate, this Court finds that these circumstances present a picture of deceptive conduct by the Debtor, indicating on his part a clear intent to deceive DMM.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hurst,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37853\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/125/#p131\">\n    337 B.R. at 133-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating, when holding the debt made by the debtor nondischargeable for false pretenses, that \"[i]ntent to deceive is present if a debtor intends or has reason to expect a creditor to act, or to refrain from action, in reliance upon the debtor's misrepresentation; a result is intended if a debtor either acts with desire to cause it or acts believing that there is a substantial certainty that the result will follow from his conduct.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   This Court finds that the Debtor knew the intended use of the loan proceeds and the incorrect perception Mohn had about Blackwolf's financial standing and involvement in the State Court Lawsuit. The Debtor knew that he had represented to Mohn at the initial meeting in June of 2016 that the funds would be used solely for Blackwolf and SG's Dallas expansion. [Finding of Fact No. 7 ]. Further, the Debtor knew that Mohn had inquired about Blackwolf's involvement in any legal proceedings and the Debtor had told Mohn Blackwolf was not involved in any lawsuits [Finding of Fact No. 9 ], so Mohn continued to believe Blackwolf was not involved in any such proceedings when that was in fact not true; indeed, the State Court Lawsuit was begun in August of 2016. [Finding of Fact Nos. 9, 12]. Though the Debtor knew of Mohn's incorrect impressions\n   about Blackwolf prior to the loan being disbursed, the Debtor did not make any attempt to correct these impressions, which he had a legal duty to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Selenberg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270644,12276775\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/393/\">\n    856 F.3d at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Debtor's failure to correct Mohn's false impressions about Blackwolf unquestionably shows an intent to deceive DMM. Further, the Debtor's willingness to sign the Note-which expressly contained a provision that Blackwolf would provide DMM with notice of any litigation [Finding of Fact No. 11 ]-while he remained silent about the State Court Lawsuit is yet another indication of his intent to deceive. The Debtor therefore knew, or is charged with having known, that he was making misrepresentations to DMM concerning Blackwolf's financial standing and involvement in the State Court Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   For all of the reasons set forth above, this Court finds that DMM has met its burden in establishing that the Debtor had scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Debtor's Actions Caused DMM to Lose its Property Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   When discussing DMM's false representation claim above in the section on false representations, this Court noted that DMM had to demonstrate its justifiable reliance on the representations made by the Debtor. DMM does not bear such a burden in its claim for false pretenses. As one court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   With respect to [justifiable reliance], it is not meaningful to examine into the \"justifiable reliance\" of a creditor in the case of fraudulent or deceitful conduct involving non-disclosure or concealment. But \"reliance\" in classic fraud is, in reality, nothing more nor less than the element of causation, since it is the creditor's reliance which provides the causal link between the debtor's false representation and the creditor's damage. Thus, in a case involving false pretenses or fraud based upon the debtor's non-disclosure or concealment, classic reliance cannot and need not be proved, but the creditor must nevertheless establish a causal link between the debtor's misconduct and the creditor's injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    In re Luppino,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1299576\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/221/693/#p701\">\n    221 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   701 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bentley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163407\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/531/671/#p688\">\n    531 B.R. at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Fraud by non-disclosure is a subcategory of fraud because, where a party has a duty to disclose, the non-disclosure may be as misleading as a positive misrepresentation of facts.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Schlumberger Tech.

Without knowledge of these pertinent facts, DMM had no idea that its loan would not be repaid at all. Moreover, although the court in\n   <em>\n    Luppino\n   </em>\n   suggests that there is no need to examine DMM's justifiable reliance in this suit, there is no question that a reasonable and prudent lender would not lend money to a company similarly situated to Blackwolf while knowing all of the facts that the Debtor failed to disclose. Stated differently, but for the Debtor's non-disclosure of the material facts mentioned above, DMM would not have extended the loan to Blackwolf. In sum, it is clear that the Debtor's misconduct caused DMM: (1) to provide funding of $150,000.00 that it would not have otherwise\n   provided; and (2) to then subsequently fail to recover any of its loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The Debtor's Conduct Caused Damage to DMM\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As previously discussed herein, there is no question that the Debtor's conduct caused damage to DMM. The Debtor deprived DMM of the $150,000.00 of proceeds disbursed under the Note, and also deprived DMM of the accrued unpaid interest due thereunder, by accepting loan funds that he had no intention of repaying [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 13, 17-18]. But for the skullduggerous actions described above of the borrower's principal-i.e., the Debtor-DMM would have suffered no harm. Therefore, the Debtor undeniably caused damage to DMM.\n   <em>\n    In re Kroh,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11937546\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/88/972/#p984\">\n    88 B.R. at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Bank has been damaged in the amount of the unpaid balance on each note, the interest accrued on the notes, and the attorney's fees incurred.

Accordingly, the Court finds that debt incurred by the Debtor by virtue of his execution of the Guaranty-which totals all amounts owed under the Note (including unpaid principal of $150,000.00, accrued, unpaid, interest, and attorneys' fees and expenses)-was incurred through false pretenses, which in turn leads this Court to conclude that this amount is a nondischargeable obligation.

First, the Guaranty that the Debtor signed promises to pay DMM:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   (a) within two (2) business days after the date Lender notifies Guarantors in the manner herein provided of Borrower(s) failure to pay the Indebtedness at maturity or otherwise and at the place specified in the Note for payment, the full amount of the unpaid Indebtedness and (b)\n   <strong>\n    Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees and all court costs incurred by Lender in enforcing or protecting any of Lender's rights, remedies or recourses under this Guaranty.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   [Pl. 's Ex. No. 2 at 1 ] (Emphasis added). Second, the Note contains language expressly authorizing the payment of any attorneys' fees and costs incurred by DMM in collecting the amounts due under the Note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, or is collected in whole or in part by suit or through probate, bankruptcy or other legal proceedings of any kind, the Company(s) agrees to pay, in addition to all other sums payable hereunder, all costs and expenses of collection, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   [ Pl.'s Ex. No. 1 at 2 ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Because: (1) the Debtor guaranteed all of the indebtedness made under the Note; (2) the Note provides that Blackwolf must pay DMM's attorneys' fees if DMM has to collect the balance made under the Note through an attorney; (3) the Guaranty provides that the Debtor should pay DMM's attorneys' fees if DMM has to retain an attorney to enforce the Guaranty; and (4) DMM has, in fact, had to retain a law firm to collect the amounts under the Note and enforce the Guaranty, there is no question that the Debtor is contractually liable to DMM for the attorneys' fees, court costs,\n   and expenses that DMM has incurred in the prosecution of this adversary proceeding. Aside from the above-referenced provisions, both the Note and the Guaranty contain provisions expressly setting forth that the laws of the state of Texas govern these two agreements. This is important because section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code expressly sets forth that: \"A person may recover reasonable attorney's fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to the amount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for ... an oral or written contract.\" Thus, because: (1) the Debtor personally guaranteed the Note; (2) both the Note and the Guaranty contain provisions allowing for recovery of attorneys' fees; and (3) an express Texas statute provides for the recovery of attorneys' fees for claims under a written contract, this Court concludes that DMM is entitled to its reasonable attorneys' fees for successfully prosecuting this adversary proceeding because there is both a contractual and statutory basis for obtaining such relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   This Court has the authority to determine just exactly what amount of fees is reasonable.

Specifically, this counsel very credibly testified that the total expenses sought by DMM are $1,759.79, almost all of which represents deposition costs made by DMM-an expense which this Court finds to be both necessary and reasonable as part of DMM's prosecution of this adversary proceeding. Counsel also testified that the total attorneys' fees for prosecuting this adversary proceeding were $25,610.50, but that his law firm gave a discount to DMM of $8,338.50-resulting in total attorneys' fees of $17,272.00. The Court has reviewed the fee bills introduced into evidence by DMM's counsel, and finds that these bills comply with U.S. Trustee guidelines and applicable law. Specifically, these fee bills describe in detail the services that were rendered, the date that the services were rendered, the person rendering the service, the hourly rate of the person rendering the service, and the value of the service. The Court finds that all of the services that were rendered were reasonable and necessary at the time that they were rendered. Moreover, there is no question that the services rendered by DMM's counsel resulted in an excellent result for DMM; this Court is entering a judgment that the Debtor owes DMM a nondischargeable amount of $219,535.47. Further, this Court finds that the hourly rates of the two attorneys and one legal assistant who provided services to DMM were not only very reasonable, but they are below market rate given the experience and competence of these attorneys and legal assistant (See\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Cas.

Given these rates and their experience, plus the fact that a discount of almost 33% was given, this Court finds that the amount of $19,031.79 is an eminently reasonable amount for fees and expenses in DMM's prosecution of this suit against the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Tegeler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511875\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/586/598/#p707\">\n    586 B.R. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707 (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Ritz,\n   </em>\n   567 B.R. at 772.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   As already noted, this amount is nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Cohen.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Post-Judgment Interest on the Total Amount of Attorneys' Fees and Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The Court will also order the Debtor to pay post-judgment interest on the total amount of attorneys' fees and expenses awarded to DMM.

Thus, it is possible that more than one basis under \u00a7 523(a) applies to the same set of facts. That is exactly what has happened in the suit at bar. DMM has introduced ample evidence necessary to prove false pretenses and false representations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) ; stated differently, DMM has met its burden by a preponderance of the evidence. The Court makes this conclusion even viewing the facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the Debtor. Indeed, to use the Supreme Court's very apt language, the evidence has shown that the Debtor most definitely is not an \"honest but unfortunate debtor\" deserving of a discharge of this particular debt.\n   <em>\n    Grogan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223600\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/279/#p286\">\n    498 U.S. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121506\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/111/654/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   In sum, the Debtor, through his execution of the Guaranty and his conduct associated with obtaining the loan for Blackwolf, is liable to DMM in the following amounts, all of which constitute nondischargeable obligations: (1) the unpaid principal amount of $150,000.00 owed under the Note; (2) accrued pre-judgment unpaid interest of $50,503.68 owed under the Note as of the date set forth below; (3) attorneys' fees and expenses of $19,031.79; and (4) post-judgment interest of 1.97% per annum (accruing from the date set forth below until all of the above referenced amounts are paid in full).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   A judgment consistent with these Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law will be entered on the docket simultaneously herewith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Any reference to \"the Code\" refers to the United States Bankruptcy Code, and any reference to any section refers to a section in 11 U.S.C., which is the United States Bankruptcy Code, unless otherwise noted.

The Court made findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record and approved this amount. Finally, the Court reiterates what it stated on the record at the July 1, 2019 hearing: namely, that the Debtor's decision not to object to the reasonableness of DMM's fees and expenses in no way constitutes any waiver of the Debtor's right to appeal the judgment that this Court is entering that the Debtor is liable to DMM for the nondischargeable amount of $219,535.47, which figure includes attorneys' fees and expenses of $19,031.79.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    The Debtor testified that this service was for a Blackwolf employee time-management application.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    The Debtor testified that this service was for a Blackwolf vehicle that needed cleaning.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    The Court notes that this payroll is separate and distinct from the payrolls listed in Finding of Fact No. 14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    There is no question that: (1) the loan was in the amount of $150,00.00; (2) DMM actually wrote a check payable to Blackwolf; (3) all of the $150,000.00 proceeds were used within one week; and (4) none of these proceeds were used for expansion in Dallas. What is unclear is this: the documentation introduced into evidence at trial shows total use of proceeds of $140,142.42-which means that $9,857.58 are unaccounted for. Although DMM, which clearly has the burden, has failed to show exactly how the remaining $9,857.58 proceeds were used, DMM has nevertheless proven that none of the loan proceeds were used for expansion in Dallas; and it is this point that is key for proving the misrepresentation necessary to successfully obtain relief under section 523(a)(2)(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    After trial, in a separate hearing on solely the issue of reasonableness of attorneys' fees, a third witness testified: Jeremy Masten, one of DMM's attorneys.
