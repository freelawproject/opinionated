Black, UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on the Chapter 7 Trustee's Objection to the Debtor's claim of exemption (the \"Trustee's Objection\") (ECF No. 19), the Debtor's Motion to Compel Trustee to Abandon His Interest in Debtor's Residence (the \"Debtor's Motion\") (ECF No. 30), and responses related to both filings. The Debtor in this case filed a voluntary Chapter 7 petition on January 3, 2019 and filed his required schedules on January 24, 2019. On his Schedule C, the Debtor claimed an exemption in real property owned as tenants by the entireties (\"TbE\") to which the Chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Trustee\") has objected. In response to the Trustee's Objection, the Debtor seeks an Order compelling the Trustee to abandon the property as burdensome or of inconsequential value to the estate. The Court held a hearing on this matter on May 20, 2019 during which it heard oral argument from counsel and took the matter under advisement. Having reviewed and considered the record in this case, the Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case are largely undisputed. The Debtor claimed an exemption in real property owned as tenants by the entireties in the amount of $ 368,020 on his Schedule C pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B). (Stipulation, ECF No. 34, \u00b6 10; Sched. C, ECF No. 15, at 13.) Although the parties have provided conflicting values for the property-the Debtor values the property at $ 575,000 (Stipulation, ECF No. 34, \u00b6 4) while the Trustee notes that the tax-assessed value is only $ 558,300 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5)-the Debtor's exemption is large enough to exempt any equity in the property remaining after accounting for Suntrust Bank's first deed of trust in the amount of $ 206,979. (Sched. D, ECF No. 15, at 19.) Additionally, the parties agree that the property is subject to at least two IRS tax liens for the amounts of\n   $ 88,237.32 and $ 723,761.25 owed by the Debtor only, and not his non-filing spouse. (Stipulation, ECF No. 34, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Notably, the Debtor is not liable on any unsecured debts or tax claims jointly with his wife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(ECF No. 19.) At the hearing on this matter, it became clear that the Trustee seeks to sell the property for the benefit of the IRS. To do so under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h), however, he acknowledged that he would need to negotiate with the IRS to \"carve out\" a portion of sale proceeds for the benefit of the Debtor's unsecured creditors. The Trustee confirmed at oral argument that he has no such deal at the moment. In response, the Debtor argues that\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   did not involve a debtor in bankruptcy and that a trustee in bankruptcy may not use the \"special collection powers of the IRS\" to administer property held as tenants by the entireties. (Response, ECF No. 27, \u00b6 18.) The Debtor further notes that even if the IRS agrees to a \"carve-out,\" any sale will not benefit the Debtor's bankruptcy estate. Thus, he argues that the Court should not allow administration of the property and should instead compel the Trustee to abandon it under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court must therefore determine (1) whether the Debtor may exempt property held as TbE under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   where a tax lien has attached to the property for liabilities owed only by the individual debtor, and (2) whether the property at issue is burdensome or inconsequential to the estate even in light of the Trustee's proposed carve-out such that the Court should compel the Trustee to abandon it under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction of this matter by virtue of the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 157(a) and the delegation made to this Court by Order from the District Court on December 6, 1994, and Rule 3 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia.

As discussed below, however, the Trustee in this case seeks to sell the property, in part, for the benefit of an individual debtor's unsecured creditors, not creditors to which his spouse is jointly indebted. In fact, no such joint creditors exist.

Thus, to ensure the sale benefits the estate, the Trustee proposes to negotiate a carve-out with the IRS allowing him to pay a certain amount of the proceeds to unsecured creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Fourth Circuit has allowed a \"carve-out\" for the benefit of unsecured creditors in the past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reeves v.

In\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   , the joint debtors exempted their interest in real property similarly over-encumbered by a tax lien. When the trustee moved to sell the property, he did so subject to an agreement with the IRS to carve out 30% of the proceeds to pay administrative and unsecured claims. Notably, the carve-out agreement provided that the debtors would receive a dollar-for-dollar credit on their IRS lien for any amount paid to unsecured creditors. The Fourth Circuit noted that \"the carve-out operates to assign equity in the Debtors' Residence for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , unsecured creditors), thus justifying the Trustee's action in selling Debtors' Residence as opposed to abandoning it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817658\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/546/235/#p241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817658\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/546/235/#p241\">\n    at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Reading\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   through the lens of\n   <em>\n    Sumy\n   </em>\n   , a trustee could presumably carve out a portion of proceeds from the sale of fully encumbered TbE property for the benefit of joint unsecured creditors. Here, however, the Trustee seeks to side-step traditional TbE protections for the benefit of individual unsecured creditors. According to him, once the Court sustains his objection, the subsequent sale of the property would sever the TbE ownership and the Trustee could use the proceeds from the Debtor's interest in the property to satisfy the IRS debt or, in the case of a carve-out, debt owed to the individual unsecured creditors of the Debtor alone. In effect, the Trustee argues that once the Court sustains his objection, he is free to administer TbE property for the benefit of any of the Debtor's unsecured creditors, even those to which his spouse is not indebted. To the extent that he seeks to pay the Debtor's individual unsecured creditors, the Trustee is trying to use the unique power granted to the Sovereign under\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   and the federal tax lien statute to do through the back door what he cannot do through the front. The proposed carve-out does not benefit joint unsecured creditors who could otherwise reach TbE property under state law but is instead intended to circumvent the protections afforded TbE owners of property to pay individual creditors. Such a carve-out would eliminate the rights of the non-debtor spouse and the TbE protections of \u00a7 522(b) and Virginia law. The Court finds it unlikely that the Supreme Court intended\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   to be telescoped to such an extent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court believes it cannot sustain the Trustee's objection to the Debtor's claimed exemption for the purpose of paying individual unsecured creditors. \"[I]n\n   <em>\n    Sumy\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit held that if there were\n   <em>\n    actual creditors\n   </em>\n   that under a non-bankruptcy law could reach the debtor's tenant by the entirety interest in the property, objection to that exemption would be sustained\n   <em>\n    but only to the extent of the claims of such actual creditors\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Conrad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342508\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/555/514/\">\n    555 B.R. at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second emphasis added).

As discussed above, the Trustee may sell TbE property under \u00a7 363(h) only where the benefit to the estate outweighs the harm to any non-debtor co-owner of the property. Because the Debtor's exemptions protect the property from administration for the benefit of the Debtor's individual unsecured creditors, any proposed sale of the property-which is over-encumbered by a Deed of Trust and IRS tax liens-would not benefit general unsecured creditors in this case and would instead create significant harm to the co-owner of the property.

Also notable is the fact that the carve-out takes this case out of the \"now almost universally recognized [rule] that where the [bankruptcy] estate has no equity in the property, abandonment is virtually always appropriate because no unsecured creditor could benefit from the administration.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 241. Two things separate this case from\n    <em>\n     Reeves\n    </em>\n    . First, there was no indication one way or the other in\n    <em>\n     Reeves\n    </em>\n    as to whether individual, as opposed to joint creditors, were paid.

He then argued that because a debtor may exempt property owned as a tenancy by the entireties from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to \u00a7 522(b)(2)(B) only to the extent that the property is \"exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law,\" the holding in\n    <em>\n     Craft\n    </em>\n    effectively disallows the exemption of entireties property.
