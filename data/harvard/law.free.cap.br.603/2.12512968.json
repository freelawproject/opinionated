Debtor was present at the hearing and Ferrero appeared by telephone. The\n   <em>\n    Order Granting Request to Appear at Hearing by Telephone and Giving Notice of Scope of Hearing\n   </em>\n   is incorporated by reference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since that Order, both Debtor and Ferrero submitted additional statements and documentation for the Court's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   IWILLSAVEYOURHOME.COM is an unincorporated business owned and operated by Ferrero. Debtor contacted Ferrero in September 2018 for assistance to avoid the loss of her home after it was scheduled to be sold at a foreclosure sale. Documents from Ferrero to Debtor include a conditional guarantee that Debtor will not lose her home or be evicted. In an email dated September 30, 2018 with the subject line \"Oct 1st - STOP THE SALE PAPERS - Amanda &amp; Otis Boatwright,\" Ferrero provided Debtor completed documents needed to initiate a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in South Carolina. Ferrero instructed Debtor to review and sign the documents and informed her of the filing fee and the Court's address for filing. Debtor filed the petition the next day, resulting in Case No. 18-05014-hb. On November 6, 2018, that case was dismissed with prejudice for one year as to any reorganization chapter for failure to file Schedules and Statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In late January 2019, Debtor informed Ferrero that her home was again subject to a foreclosure sale. On February 3, 2019, he provided her completed bankruptcy forms to again stop the sale by filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Debtor filed this case the next day, which was dismissed on February 6, 2019, for violation of the prior prejudice order. Neither petition disclosed Ferrero's involvement nor indicated that he assisted Debtor with preparing a bankruptcy petition. No\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Petition Preparer's Notice, Declaration, and Signature\n   </em>\n   (Official Form 119) was completed for filing by Ferrero. Rather, Debtor's bankruptcy petitions were completed to indicate she was filing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 12, 2019, Debtor informed Ferrero of a Rule to Show Cause hearing scheduled by the Court as a result of the filings and he advised by text \"U [sic] don't have to go to that Amanda.\" As a result of Debtor's repeat filings, the prejudice period barring her from refiling under any reorganization chapter was extended to January 6, 2020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Debtor paid Ferrero a total of $6,000.00 in installments that began in September 2018. Ferrero asserts any failure by Debtor to realize any benefit from his services was because she failed to provide documents to proceed with a loan modification. The Court gave Ferrero an opportunity to detail the work performed for Debtor in exchange for the $6,000.00 in fees and to provide evidence of valuable services. From the record it is not clear what work, if any, Ferrero performed for Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABLE LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 1334(b).

The evidence provided does not support this assertion. Ferrero received money from Debtor to save her home from foreclosure. Twice he assisted Debtor with the filing of bankruptcy cases to prevent the sale of her home. Ferrero prepared bankruptcy forms for Debtor and instructed her to file Chapter 13 cases. He also advised her not to attend a hearing. Ferrero's conduct indicates that he served as a BPP for Debtor as defined by \u00a7 110(a)(1) and gave legal advice contrary to \u00a7 110(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ferrero further violated \u00a7 110 by: (i) failing to sign the prepared documents and provide his name and address ( \u00a7 110(b)(1) ); (ii) failing to include on each document prepared for filing with the Court the Social Security number of Ferrero or an officer, principal, or responsible person for IWILLSAVEYOURHOME.COM ( \u00a7 110(c) ); and (iii) failing to supply the required sworn declaration to Debtor that is to be filed with the petition ( \u00a7 110(b)(2) ). Ferrero also failed to disclose any fee received from Debtor within 12 months before filing of either case and has failed to show what valuable service he provided in exchange for amounts paid.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20110\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2) &amp; (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Debtor paid Ferrero $6,000.00 for services that began in September 2018. Because of Ferrero's violations of \u00a7 110(b), (c), (e), and (h), and because the record supports a finding that the fees are in excess of the value of any services rendered during the 12-month period immediately\n   preceding the date of the filing of the petition, Ferrero's fees are subject to disallowance, forfeiture, and immediate turnover to the bankruptcy trustee.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20110\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(3)(A) &amp; (B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the bankruptcy case has been dismissed and the trustee discharged, the Court will order turnover of the funds to the United States Trustee for appropriate distribution, to be received on behalf of any bankruptcy trustee. The Court retains jurisdiction to resolve any further requests that may be filed regarding distribution of that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that pursuant to \u00a7 110(h)(3)(A) and (B), Sean C.
