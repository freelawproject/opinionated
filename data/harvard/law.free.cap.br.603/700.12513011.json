The Chapter 11 Trustee of TS Employment, Inc. (\"TSE\" or \"Debtor\"), plaintiff, James S. Feltman (\"Trustee\"), filed an opposition to the Motion. (\"Trustee Opposition,\" ECF Doc. # 23.) Defendants filed a reply. (ECF Doc. # 25.)

For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that the Second Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges that the Defendants were non-statutory insiders, and, therefore, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Trustee commenced the adversary proceeding against the Defendants here, who were TSE's former accountants. Defendants allegedly caused TSE and its creditors to lose more than $100 million before TSE filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2015. (Second Amended Complaint \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 5, 2018, the Trustee filed an initial complaint (\"Initial Complaint,\" ECF Doc. # 1) against the Defendants. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Trustee's claims are barred by the\n   <em>\n    Wagoner\n   </em>\n   rule. (\"First Motion to Dismiss,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ECF Doc. # 8.) The Court granted the First Motion to Dismiss, concluding that the complaint did not sufficiently support an inference that Defendants fell within the non-statutory insider exception to the\n   <em>\n    Wagoner\n   </em>\n   rule.\n   <em>\n    Kossoff\n   </em>\n   , 597 B.R. at 552 [hereinafter\n   <em>\n    Prior Opinion\n   </em>\n   ]. The Court also rejected the Trustee's argument that the adverse interest exception applied. The dismissal of the Initial Complaint was without prejudice and the Trustee was allowed to amend the Initial Complaint to allege additional facts demonstrating that Defendants \"acted effectively as TSE's CFO, Treasurer or other senior finance and accounting personnel, who made important accounting decisions that facilitated the massive fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 28, 2019, the Trustee filed the Second Amended Complaint, and on May 14, 2019, the Defendants again moved to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Statement of Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Until its bankruptcy, TSE served as the professional employer organization (\"PEO\") for Corporate Resource Services, Inc. (\"CRS\") and its subsidiaries (\"CRS Subsidiaries\" and, together with CRS, \"CRS Debtors\"). The CRS Debtors were publicly traded companies. As the PEO, TSE was the employer of record for hundreds of thousands of temporary workers supplied under the CRS Debtors' contracts with their customers. (Second Amended Complaint \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CRS experienced dramatic growth from 2010 to 2015 by offering its customers competitive pricing and financing options. CRS's ability to rapidly expand its business largely depended on purported financial accommodations made by TSE, including the forgiveness or deferral of more than $70 million owed to TSE under its PEO agreement with CRS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   TSE never had the capital or liquidity needed to make financial accommodations to CRS. TSE \"financed\" its accommodations to CRS by failing to pay federal employment taxes for TSE employees that were supplied to CRS customers. Moreover, most of TSE's funds were commingled with those of its affiliate, Tri-State Employment Service, Inc. (\"Tri-State\"), where tens of millions of dollars were used for purposes unrelated to TSE. As a result, TSE ultimately failed to pay more than $100 million (exclusive of interest and penalties) in federal employment tax obligations, as well as other non-tax obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Defendants' actions hid this reality from the outside world, thus permitting TSE to continue to amass unpaid liabilities while its corporate life was wrongfully prolonged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   From 2011 forward, TSE was insolvent and engaged in an unsustainable and under-capitalized business. TSE had no chief financial officer or treasurer to carry out its core financial and accounting operations. Instead, these functions were performed by Defendants, who allegedly exercised direct, complete, and virtually exclusive control over the financial reporting systems and internal accounting functions of TSE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Second Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Trustee attempts to cure the insufficiency in the Initial Complaint by alleging the following new allegations in the Second Amended Complaint to support the inference that Defendants were non-statutory insiders: (1) \"[a]t all relevant times, TSE did not have a CFO or Treasurer\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37); (2) \"Defendants also interfaced independently and directly with TSE's auditor ... [and] were the source of the information needed for TSE's auditors to perform those audits\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41); (3) \"Defendants exercised direct, complete,\n   and virtually exclusive control over the financial reporting systems, tax and internal accounting functions of TSE and fulfilled the roles ordinarily carried out by a company's senior internal financial and accounting personnel\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38); (4) \"Defendants acted with autonomy, and their conduct was their own\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39); (5) \"Defendants ... exerted unfettered influence over decisions that affected the Debtor's finances and operations\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39); (6) \"Defendants ... decided how to account for the Debtor's business activities\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40); and (7) \"TSE was operated in a manner that concealed a multi-year scheme to defraud the United States Treasury by systematically misreporting payroll tax obligations. This fraudulent and coordinated scheme required carefully managed financial reporting and false tax reporting activities which were performed and overseen by Irvin (\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ) Kossoff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, Defendants argue that the Trustee repeated allegations found in the Initial Complaint and failed to plausibly plead \"additional facts that can be alleged in good faith demonstrating that these Defendants acted effectively as TSE's CFO, Treasurer or other senior finance and accounting personnel ....\" (Motion \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that the allegations that they exercised total control over TSE's internal accounting functions, acted with complete autonomy, and exerted unfettered influence over decisions that affected the Debtor's operations are entirely conclusory. Defendants therefore contend that these allegations are not entitled to credit on a motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that the allegation that they functioned as TSE's management is inconsistent with the Trustee's separate allegation, remaining from the Initial Complaint, that TSE's and Tri-State's owner, Robert Cassera (\"Cassera\"), totally controlled TSE and was the mastermind of the subject fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the complaint does not allege the necessary degree of control over the Debtor's affairs to be considered an insider, even if, as the Trustee alleges, Defendants controlled TSE's internal accounting functions. In support of this point, they argue that the alleged control is not the same as \"dictat[ing] corporate policy and the disposition of corporate assets\" particularly where, as here, the complaint alleges that TSE was controlled by Cassera. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable here by Rule 7012 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, a complaint need only allege \"enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaughn v.

Rather than acting as outside advisors to TSE, the Trustee alleges that the Defendants \"exercised decisionmaking (\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ) authority over financial matters involving TSE, Tri-State, and other Cassera businesses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)

The\n   <em>\n    Wagoner\n   </em>\n   rule was not fashioned to encourage otherwise statutory insiders to eschew official titles as a means to evade potential liability. Thus, the logical question for the Court to address is whether Defendants can be considered insiders who could not assert the\n   <em>\n    Wagoner\n   </em>\n   rule as a defense if they stood accused of the same misconduct\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   had the title of CFO or Treasurer. The Defendants' counsel effectively conceded that it is the lack of formal title that prevents a finding of insider status, rather than allegations that Defendants had sufficient control over the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, case law concerning the non-statutory insider exception clearly states that it is\n   <em>\n    control\n   </em>\n   over the Debtor, rather than formal title, that determines whether Defendants can assert the\n   <em>\n    Wagoner\n   </em>\n   rule as a defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re PHS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414791\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/581/16/#p30\">\n    581 B.R. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If a defendant with no title is found to be a control person, then he is an insider.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Furthermore, courts consider that \"actual management of the Debtor's affairs equals control\" in determining insider status.\n   <em>\n    In re ABC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11302874\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/190/672/\">\n    190 B.R. at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Courts have defined actual management as control over \"the debtor's personnel or contract decisions, production schedules or\n   <em>\n    accounts payable.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    In re Chas P. Young Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6500814\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/145/131/#p137\">\n    145 B.R. 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1992) (emphasis added). The Second Amended Complaint alleges that \"Defendants ... filed quarterly payroll tax returns which underreported TSE's payroll tax liability during the first, second and third quarters of each of 2012, 2013, and 2014. As a result, TSE was able to 'defer' recognition and payment of those taxes until the fourth quarter of each year, and Tri-State and Cassera would have access to significant amounts of cash in the interim.\" (Second Amended Complaint \u00b6 54.) By allegedly underreporting TSE's payroll tax liabilities, Defendants plausibly reduced the accounts payable of TSE on several occasions. Such actions support the conclusion that Defendants indeed exercised a degree of actual management of the Debtor's affairs requisite for a finding of insider status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants argue the allegations that Defendants exercised total control over TSE's internal accounting functions and acted with autonomy while exerting unfettered influence over decisions that affected the Debtor's finances and operations are entirely conclusory, and therefore not entitled to credit. (Motion \u00b6 28.) Defendants cite to case law reaffirming the well-established principle that this Court is not bound to accept conclusory statements as factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p557\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p557\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Court rejects Defendants' argument that the allegations of Defendants' control in the Second Amended Complaint are impermissibly conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Rather than submitting a \"legal conclusion couched as a factional allegation,\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Trustee has asserted numerous facts that support the contention that Defendants acted as the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   chief financial officer by controlling the accounting and reporting functions of TSE. The Trustee supports these allegations with examples of Defendants' conduct that indicate Defendants exercised control of TSE's accounting and financial functions in the manner expected from a CFO. The Second Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants (1) recorded a year-end intercompany general ledger entry that shifted and later reversed a $67 million federal payroll liability; (2) prepared all federal and state income taxes for TSE, including compiling all the necessary underlying financial information; (3) liaised directly with TSE's outside auditors; and (4) made and back-dated a series of large journal entries during the filing of the TSE bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-43, 60.) More importantly, they provide case-specific context for the Court to reasonably infer the plausibility of the other allegations for which Defendants stand accused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    More Than One Party May Be Considered in Control of the Debtor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants further argue that because the Initial Complaint alleged that Cassera \"exerted total control\" over TSE and was the \"mastermind of the alleged fraud,\" the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint that \"Defendants exercised direct, complete, and virtually exclusive control over the financial reporting systems ... \" are inconsistent and contradictory to the Initial Complaint and should therefore be discarded. (Motion \u00b6\u00b6 34-40.) The Trustee does not dispute that Cassera exercised control over TSE by ownership of the business. However, this does not mean that other individuals or entities did not also control key aspects of the business. To the contrary, courts routinely find one party to be an insider, notwithstanding another party's control over a debtor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re PHS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414791\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/581/16/#p30\">\n    581 B.R. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting argument that defendant could not be insider because of CEO's control of the debtor);\n   <em>\n    In re Bernard L. Madoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188430\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/458/87/#p122\">\n    458 B.R. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that complaint adequately alleged defendants in senior management positions were insiders for imputation purposes, notwithstanding defendants' contentions that Bernard Madoff controlled all aspects of the fraud). Similarly, here, although Cassera may have been in total control of TSE, Defendants still could have exercised control over the financial reporting systems and accounting decisions, and acted with complete autonomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Therefore, given the early stage of this litigation and the nature of the allegations alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, the Court concludes that the Trustee is entitled to proceed with this case. Defendants dispute many of the facts alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, but a motion to dismiss is not the place to test the veracity of the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   Defendants shall answer the Second Amended Complaint on or before July 22, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   A separate order will be entered scheduling a Case Management Conference.
