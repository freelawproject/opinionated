Phillips and Tammy R. Phillips, a Professional Corporation (jointly, \"Creditors\"), obtained an $8,250 judgment against debtor, Kevan Gilman. Under California law, they were entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in obtaining and collecting this amount, and the state court awarded them about $100,000 in prepetition fees. Apparently other state court fee requests were pending or are anticipated as they asserted that total state court fees approximate $1,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this chapter 7 case, they obtained a determination that Debtor was not entitled to a discharge. They also actively litigated issues in the main case itself. The bankruptcy court determined that they were entitled to an award of reasonable fees in connection with this activity. Creditors requested approximately $750,000 in fees arising from main case activity and $1,400,000 in fees in the adversary proceeding. They also requested costs. The bankruptcy court awarded $137,907.66 and $166,453.58, respectively, in fees and costs. This appeal arises from the reduced awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Given that proportionality is not a hallmark of Creditors' approach, the appeals before us raise a multitude of issues. We address the appeals in three documents that we file concurrently. In this opinion, we address an issue of first impression that was a partial basis for fee reduction in both the main case and the adversary proceeding: the applicability of CCP \u00a7 685.080,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which creates a two-year deadline for requesting fees incurred in collection activities, and \u00a7 108(c)(2), which tolls the time for certain actions during the pendency of a bankruptcy case. We conclude the bankruptcy court correctly found CCP \u00a7 685.080 applicable to these requests for an award of postpetition fees and unaffected by \u00a7 108(c). Accordingly, we discern no error in the reduction of the requested fees on this basis and AFFIRM the bankruptcy court's orders in this regard. In separate, unpublished decisions, we address the bankruptcy court's further reduction of the requested fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2011, Debtor filed a chapter 7 petition and scheduled his debt to Creditors. He also scheduled an ownership interest in real property in Van Nuys, California and, in relation to this real property, claimed an enhanced homestead exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Creditors actively participated in the bankruptcy case. They filed an adversary proceeding and obtained a judgment under \u00a7 727 that denied Debtor a discharge. During the course of this litigation and four years after filing the adversary proceeding, they filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings as to an attorneys' fees claim for relief, seeking a determination that they were entitled to recover fees\n   and costs incurred in the discharge litigation; but they did not seek an immediate award of fees. The bankruptcy court granted the motion and specified that the adversary litigation was enforcement of a judgment for purposes of CCP \u00a7 685.040. As Creditors did not request it, the order did not rule on the appropriateness of any specific fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Through litigation in the main case, Creditors also successfully blocked Debtor's request for a homestead exemption enhancement. Litigation continues on their attempt to block the entirety of Debtor's asserted homestead exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Having prevailed (in part) on their exemption objection, Creditors filed a motion in the main case under CCP \u00a7 685.040 and other theories to recover their attorneys' fees and costs. They requested a lodestar award of $756,425 plus other costs. All of the requested fees and costs were incurred postpetition and in the bankruptcy proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the meantime and after denial of Debtor's discharge, Creditors filed a motion in the adversary proceeding and requested an award of $1,400,000 in attorneys' fees plus other costs associated with the adversary proceeding under CCP \u00a7 685.040.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After a hearing, the bankruptcy court entered memorandum decisions and separate orders granting in part and denying in part the two CCP \u00a7 685.040 motions. It awarded Creditors $134,214.50 in fees and $3,693.16 in costs in the main case and $162,613.60 in fees and $3,839.98 in costs in the adversary proceeding. In determining these reductions, it found that $322,000.05 of the fees in the main case and $942,154 of the fees in the adversary proceeding were time-barred and subject to disallowance under CCP \u00a7 685.080.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Creditors timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(b)(2)(B).

In doing so, the bankruptcy court enforced CCP \u00a7 685.080. Creditors argue, on appeal, that CCP \u00a7 685.080 is not applicable to their fee request for a variety of reasons and that \u00a7 108(c) tolled the application of the two year period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We begin with their first position; we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 685.040. Under CCP \u00a7 685.040, attorneys' fees are collectible only when otherwise provided by law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516238\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/812/#p828\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, neither party disputes that the statute supporting the $8,250 judgment, the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Act, allows a prevailing party to collect fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Neither we nor the parties located a case discussing the intersection of CCP \u00a7 685.040 and \u00a7 108(c). The Ninth Circuit, however, has applied CCP \u00a7 685.040 in a federal diversity case. Federal diversity litigants may invoke CCP \u00a7 685.040 through Civil Rule 69, which applies in bankruptcy proceedings through Rule 7069.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carnes v.

R. Bankr. P. 7069. CCP \u00a7 685.040 is not, however, without limitations. As the Ninth Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Carnes v. Zamani\n   </em>\n   : \"Because their right to recover post-judgment attorney fees is dependent on [ CCP \u00a7 685.040 ], the Carneses were required to comply with the timeliness requirements for post-judgment attorney fee motions set forth in the [California Enforcement of Judgments Law].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2914437\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/1057/#p1060\">\n    488 F.3d at 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit noted that these requirements include CCP \u00a7 685.080.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2914437\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/1057/#p1060\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CCP \u00a7 685.080 limits the amount that a judgment creditor may otherwise recover under CCP \u00a7 685.040 : \"The judgment creditor may claim costs authorized by [ CCP \u00a7] 685.040 by noticed motion. The motion shall be made before the judgment is satisfied in full, but not later than two years after the costs have been incurred.\" Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 685.080(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its ruling, the bankruptcy court concluded that CCP \u00a7 685.040 applied and that, under CCP \u00a7 685.080, only fees incurred within two years of the fee motions were eligible for allowance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Creditors first argue that the statute's \"two-year provision\" is purely procedural state law and thus does not apply in a federal bankruptcy court. They try to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Carnes\n   </em>\n   by saying that it involved application of Civil Rule 69, while the present case involves Civil Rule 54 motions for prevailing on the merits. But Civil Rule 54, made applicable in bankruptcy cases by Rule 7054, does not provide an independent basis for an award of attorneys' fees following success in a \u00a7 727 action or an objection to exemptions. Similarly, neither \u00a7 727 nor any other provision of the Code or Rules include a relevant, statutory fee-shifting provision, and Civil Rule 54 awards attorneys' fees only when a judgment, statute, or rule so provides. Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For that matter, Creditors never told the bankruptcy court they were relying on Civil Rule 54. In their main case motion, Creditors never discussed Civil Rule 54 ; they relied on CCP \u00a7\u00a7 685.040 and 685.080, the common fund doctrine, and the private attorney general doctrine. So too in the adversary proceeding motion, they sought fees solely under CCP \u00a7 685.040. Creditors again made this clear in their main case reply paper filed with the bankruptcy court: \"Plaintiffs claim fees under [CCP] 685.040.\" Bk Dkt No. 510 at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   So we\n   reject Creditors' suggestion that they moved under Civil Rule 54 and that\n   <em>\n    Carnes\n   </em>\n   is thus distinguishable. They did not; it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, Creditors suggest that the two-year look-back provision would not begin to run until the denial of discharge. They reason: a chapter 7 debtor is presumptively entitled to a discharge; a judgment creditor must prevail in a non-dischargeability proceeding to avoid that result; if the judgment creditor fails, then the debt and associated right to enforcement costs, is discharged; as a result, because the denial of discharge is an independent precondition to an award of fees, the two-year period begins to run from the denial of discharge. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In their motions, Creditors claimed they were seeking fees under CCP \u00a7 685.040 (i.e., collecting their state court judgment), not for seeking denial of discharge or for excepting their claim from the discharge injunction; and the bankruptcy court concluded fees were warranted because Creditors' collection activities were compensable under CCP \u00a7 685.040. On appeal Creditors would now have us treat the\n   <em>\n    denial of discharge\n   </em>\n   as the CCP \u00a7 685.040 judgment. But this is inapt; they are entitled to fees only because they incurred the fees in the adversary proceeding and main case in an attempt to collect the statute court judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Third, Creditors argue that equitable tolling, federal preemption, and the rule against interpreting statutes to permit mischief or absurdity apply. None of these arguments are persuasive. They cite no caselaw saying that equitable tolling applies to CCP \u00a7 685.080.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And they argue no\n   facts that justify a conclusion that the bankruptcy court erred in refusing to apply the doctrine. They twice refer to preemption. The first time, they state that \u00a7 108(c) preempts CCP \u00a7 685.080's two-year limitation. But this is not quite accurate. As discussed below, \u00a7 108(c) does not apply to the present circumstances, so whether it preempts CCP \u00a7 685.080 is immaterial. That said, when \u00a7 108(c) does apply, it does \"not operate without regard to existing nonbankruptcy law to stop the running of any periods of limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Smith (In re Smith)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8448611\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/352/702/#p706\">\n    352 B.R. 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (9th Cir.

As the plain language of \u00a7 108(c) states, the prepetition statute of limitations expires the later of either the end of the period or 30 days after termination of the stay.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20108\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The second time they refer to preemption is in a heading, but they do not elaborate on it any further. Last, the bankruptcy court's decision does not lead to mischief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Fourth, Creditors argue that the bankruptcy court inconsistently \"derided\" them for filing numerous discovery and sanctions motions while simultaneously holding that, under CCP \u00a7 685.080, they needed to file their fee requests earlier. We disagree: each type of motion relies on a different source of authority; as a result, each motion is constrained by that particular controlling authority's limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Fifth, Creditors perfunctorily state that judicial estoppel, equitable estoppel, and quasi-estoppel apply, but they either provide no analysis for these points or repeat arguments that we have already addressed. We consider them no further.\n   <em>\n    Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of California v. Wu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053395\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/483/#p487\">\n    626 F.3d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 487 (9th Cir. 2010) (\"[W]e won't consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in appellant's opening brief. Applying this standard, we've refused to address claims that were only argued in passing or that were bare assertions ... with no supporting argument.\") (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Last, in connection with the adversary proceeding, Creditors argue that Debtor was required to plead the time limitation as an affirmative defense because it is in the nature of a statute of limitations and a limitations defense is forfeited if not timely raised. Again, we disagree. Creditors cite no authority holding that CCP \u00a7 685.080's time limitation is forfeitable. To the contrary, the time limitations are built into the statute itself and are more properly read as an element of recovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2914437\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/1057/#p1060\">\n    488 F.3d at 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because their right to recover post-judgment\n   attorney fees is dependent on [ CCP \u00a7 685.040 ], the Carneses were required to comply with the timeliness requirements for post-judgment attorney fee motions set forth in the [California Enforcement of Judgments Law].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, Creditors rely on CCP \u00a7 685.040 to recover attorneys' fees. But CCP \u00a7 685.080 limits the reach of CCP \u00a7 685.040 to attorneys' fees incurred within two years. So says California law; and, according to the Ninth Circuit, this limitation applies in federal courts when a movant invokes CCP \u00a7 685.040. Accordingly, in the absence of \u00a7 108(c) tolling, the bankruptcy court appropriately disallowed recovery of fees and costs incurred more than two years before the motions were filed.

The applicable nonbankruptcy law is CCP \u00a7\u00a7 685.040 and 685.080. Under CCP \u00a7 685.040, a judgment creditor \"is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs\" of collecting a judgment, including, as here, attorneys' fees. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 685.040. CCP \u00a7 685.080 also limits the amount that a judgment creditor may otherwise recover under CCP \u00a7 685.040 by imposing two time limits: \"The judgment creditor may claim costs authorized by [ CCP \u00a7] 685.040 by noticed motion. The motion must be made before the judgment is satisfied in full, but not later than two years after the costs have been incurred.\" Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 685.080(a). In \u00a7 108(c)'s terms, CCP \u00a7 685.080 fixes a period in which a judgment creditor may commence a claim for collection costs against the debtor. So the first three elements of \u00a7 108(c) are present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The fourth and fifth elements, however, have not been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Creditors filed their CCP \u00a7 685.080 motions with the bankruptcy court, thereby\n   affirmatively invoking the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction and asking it for relief. This was appropriate as all requested fees relate to postpetition activity before the bankruptcy court and related to the bankruptcy case.
