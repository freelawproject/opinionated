(\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 139, 140;\n   <em>\n    Answer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 139, 140, 142.)

The payment to BNP Paribas does not affect the amount of the transfers. At most, it makes BNP Paribas rather than Legacy the initial transferee of transfers that are otherwise fraudulent. Liability is not, however, limited to recovery from the initial transferee. A trustee may also recover an avoided fraudulent transfer from the entity for whose benefit the transfer was made,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and any subsequent transferee.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).

I promised that I would select a basket of stocks that would closely mimic the price movements of the Standard &amp; Poors index. I promised that I would opportunistically time those purchases and would be out of the market intermittently, investing client funds during these periods in United States Government-issued securities, such as United States Treasury bills. In addition, I promised that as part of the [SSC strategy], I would hedge the investments I made in the basket of common stocks by using client funds to buy and sell option contracts related to those stocks, thereby limiting potential client losses caused by unpredictable changes in stock prices. In fact, I never made those investments I promised to clients, who believed they were invested with me in the [SSC strategy].\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    (Madoff Allocution at 25:25-26:18.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    As Madoff never invested in securities on behalf of his IA clients (which included Legacy), the securities positions listed on the BLMIS account statements were fictitious, and redemptions were paid from a commingled bank account containing the deposits of all IA customers:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    The essence of my scheme was that I represented to clients and prospective clients who wished to open investment advisory and individual trading accounts with me that I would invest their money in shares of common stock, options, and other securities of large well-known corporations, and upon request, would return to them their profits and principal. Those representations were false for many years. Up until I was arrested on December 11, 2008, I never invested these funds in the securities, as I had promised. Instead, those funds were deposited in a bank account at Chase Manhattan Bank. When clients wished to receive the profits they believed they had earned with me or to redeem their principal, I used the money in the Chase Manhattan bank account that belonged to them or other clients to pay the requested funds.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24:9-22.)

To cover up the fraud, Madoff and BLMIS generated trade confirmations and account statements containing \"bogus transactions and positions.\" (Madoff Allocution at 27:9-13;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    DiPascali Allocution at 47:16-22 (\"On a regular basis I used hindsight to file historical prices on stocks then I used those prices to post purchase of [sic] sales to customer accounts as if they had been executed in realtime.

Madoff admitted to operating a Ponzi scheme, (Madoff Allocution at 23:15-16), failing to invest customer funds as promised, (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24:9-17), paying redemption requests with customer deposits, (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24:18-22) and issuing bogus customer statements and trade confirmations to conceal the fraud. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 27:9-19.) DiPascali also admitted that BLMIS performed no securities trades as promised to customers, (DiPascali Allocution at 46:9-25) and posted fictitious \"gains\" in customer accounts and statements. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 47:16-22.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Legacy nonetheless challenges this conclusion. During the course of its operations, BLMIS also purchased U.S. Treasury Bills (\"T-Bills\") from third-party brokers such as Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers with customer deposits not needed to pay redemptions, (\n    <em>\n     Transcript of Deposition of Bernard L.

(\n    <em>\n     Legacy\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brief\n    </em>\n    at 8-10.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The purchase of T-Bills did not transform BLMIS into a legitimate enterprise or prohibit the Trustee's reliance on the Ponzi scheme presumption. Ponzi scheme operators often engage in some legitimate transactions but if the legitimate transactions further the scheme or are funded by the scheme they are part of the scheme.

He had to pay redemptions and profits to or for the benefit of customers like Legacy to further the scheme. If BLMIS did not pay redemptions or profits on request, its aura of success would evaporate, new investments would dry up and the scheme would collapse. The use of the funds he stole from BLMIS's customers to purchase T-Bills was an integral part of the scheme; it enabled BLMIS to earn more interest to pay more redemptions for a longer time and keep the scheme running.

In determining the amount of the deposit to be credited to the transferee account, the Trustee followed the same methodology. First, he computed the actual balance in the transferor account under the Net Investment method. Second, he gave the transferee account a credit up to the amount of the actual balance and ignored the amount of any purported transfer to the extent it exceeded the actual balance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sagor v.

(\n    <em>\n     See Transfers Stipulation\n    </em>\n    , Ex. A, at 7.) In computing the balance at the time of the transfer, the Trustee assumed that the Ponzi scheme was in full force throughout the life of the Montpellier account. Hence, he ignored trading profits appearing on Montpellier's monthly statements. If, however, the Ponzi scheme began after the Montpellier account was\n    opened, pre-scheme trading profits would have been real instead of fictitious. In that case, the balance in the Montpellier BLMIS account at the time of the transfer to Legacy would have been greater, the amount of the transfer to Legacy would have been greater and the amount of Legacy's liability for fictitious profits would be smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The Montpellier BLMIS account was opened on March 16, 1992, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ), which may have been before the Ponzi scheme began. The evidence submitted on this issue is confusing. Madoff stated in his allocution that \"[t]o the best of my recollection, my fraud began in the early 1990s.\" (Madoff Allocution at 25:12-13.) At his December 2016 deposition, Madoff for the most part stuck with 1992 as the year that the Ponzi scheme began, (Madoff 12/20/16 Dep. Tr. at 19:14-17; 26:20-23), but added that 1992 was a \"ballpark number\" and the Ponzi scheme began \"during the Gulf War situation.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20:1-4.) During his April 2017 deposition, Madoff declared that although his Ponzi scheme \"began in 92,\" BLMIS performed \"some transactions\" for its IA customers \"through 1993.\" (\n    <em>\n     Transcript of Deposition of Bernard L. Madoff\n    </em>\n    , dated April 26, 2017 (\"Madoff 4/26/17 Dep. Tr.\")\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    at 91:7-12;\n    <em>\n     accord id\n    </em>\n    . at 12:1-4.) Moreover, while Madoff never said that trades occurred in 1994, he answered in the affirmative to a question that referenced 1994 as a timeframe for when BLMIS was still performing some trades. (\n    <em>\n     See id\n    </em>\n    . at 92:9-12 (\"Q.... [Y]ou testified earlier today that you were doing the split strike trades until late 1993 or early 1994?\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    A. Right.\");\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    at 17:20-18:2.) Other former BLMIS employees, however, fixed the onset of the Ponzi scheme to a much earlier date. DiPascali stated that he realized that BLMIS was not trading securities in the \"late '80s or early '90s,\" (DiPascali Allocution at 46:9-17), and David Kugel allocuted that, \"beginning in the early 70s,\" he helped create \"fake, backdated trades based on historical stock prices\" that were \"executed only on paper.\" (\n    <em>\n     Transcript of Nov. 21, 2011 Hr'g in United States v. Kugel\n    </em>\n    , No. 10 Cr. 228 (LTS) (\"Kugel Allocution\") at 32:4-14.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Legacy, it is possible that the Ponzi scheme did not begin until sometime in 1994 and any prior trades and profits derived from those trades in the Montpellier account were real. The Court cannot determine as a matter of law the date when the Ponzi scheme began and hence, the actual balance transferred from Montpellier to Legacy is a genuine issue of disputed fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     2. T-Bills Allocated to Customers\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Although BLMIS' purchase of T-Bills does not affect the conclusion that BLMIS was operated as a Ponzi scheme for the purposes of the Ponzi scheme presumption, a related but separate question is whether the profits made by a BLMIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    customer such as Legacy from actual T-Bill purchases allocated to its BLMIS account during the Ponzi scheme were real rather than fictitious and, therefore, increased the account balance and decreased the amount of fictitious profits. Legacy matched five such transactions to its own BLMIS account,\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    but a discussion of just one illustrates its point. On May 9, 2002, BLMIS purchased approximately $100 million worth of T-Bills, due July 25, 2002, from Morgan Stanley. (\n    <em>\n     Mayer Declaration\n    </em>\n    , Ex. 2.) According to BLMIS's records, a corresponding trade confirmation sent to Legacy showed that BLMIS sold Legacy approximately $12.4 million worth of the same T-Bills on May 20, 2002, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , Ex. 3), and the transaction also appeared on Legacy's May 2002 BLMIS account statement. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , Ex. 4.) BLMIS's records then indicated that Legacy sold the same T-Bills back to BLMIS on July 19, 2002, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , Exs. 5, 6), and BLMIS sold the original $100 million of T-Bills back to Morgan Stanley on July 25, 2002. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , Ex. 7.) According to Legacy's monthly customer statements, it earned approximately $35,000.00 in profit from that buy-sell transaction. Legacy argues as a factual matter that BLMIS allocated actual T-Bill purchases to its account, and as a legal matter, the profits from the T-Bill transactions reduced its potential liability for fictitious profits.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The parties dispute whether the T-Bills that appeared in the trade confirmations and monthly statements were real or, alternatively, were fictitious like the equity securities in the same statements and unrelated to the actual T-Bills purchases by BLMIS from third-party brokers. The proof offered by the parties was mixed. During his allocution, Madoff described the SSC strategy, which included the timed purchases of T-Bills, and said that none of the transactions took place in the customers' accounts. At his deposition, however, he answered a series of questions indicating that he purchased the T-Bills for the customers and those purchases were reflected on the BLMIS customer statements:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    Q.

These discrepancies and the relationship, if any, between BLMIS's purchase of T-Bills from brokers and the apparent resale of a portion of those purchases to customers like Legacy raise factual issues that the Court cannot resolve on this motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    This does not necessarily mean that the disputed factual issue regarding the allocation of actual T-Bill purchases to Legacy's\n    account is material. The Court in\n    <em>\n     Wing v. Layton\n    </em>\n    referred to the oft-cited opinion of Circuit Judge Posner in\n    <em>\n     Scholes v.

There, the Ponzi-scheme fraudster (\"Douglas\") promised investors returns from commodities trading.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 752. Although Douglas engaged in some commodities trades, most of the money raised from investors was used to pay the returns promised to earlier investors.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Douglas's scheme lasted two years, he was arrested for fraud, and a receiver was appointed.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The receiver commenced fraudulent conveyance actions under state law against Phillips, a net winner investor in Douglas's Ponzi scheme.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 753, 755.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Like the defendant in\n    <em>\n     Wing v. Layton\n    </em>\n    , Phillips argued that he was entitled to keep the profits derived from legitimate trades. Rejecting Phillips's argument, Judge Posner opined that profits earned with other people's money are not legitimate:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n    It is no answer that some or for that matter all of Phillips's profit may have come from \"legitimate\" trades made by the corporations. They are not legitimate. The money used for the trades came from investors gulled by fraudulent representations. Phillips was one of those investors, and it may seem \"only fair\" that he should be entitled to the profits on trades made with his money. That would be true as between him and Douglas or Douglas's corporations. It is not true as between him and either the creditors of or the other investors in the corporations. He should not be permitted to benefit from a fraud at their expense merely because he was not himself to blame for the fraud.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 757 ;\n    <em>\n     accord\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Slatkin\n    </em>\n    , 525 F.3d at 815 (\"Although the Johnsons argue that there is a question of fact as to whether the purported profits they received were from 'legitimate' investments made by Slatkin, in truth none of the trades made by Slatkin were 'legitimate' because the money used for the trades came from investors gulled by Slatkin's fraudulent representations.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    This case illustrates Judge Posner's point. Legacy was a substantial net winner. Its withdrawals exceeded its deposits by over $86 million. Even if Legacy received the benefits of Montpellier's early trades and the T-Bill profits realized from purchases made with its own principal deposits, it still received tens of millions of dollars of fictitious profits resulting from imaginary equity trades paid with other customers' funds. Once Legacy exhausted the net equity in its account, BLMIS necessarily used other investors' property to make the profitable T-Bill trades for which Legacy demands credit. I question the logic of this argument, but the parties did not address it and I do not decide it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Antecedent Debt\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Finally, Legacy argues that it provided \"value\" within the meaning of section 548(c) because the transfers from BLMIS satisfied antecedent debts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(2)(A) (\"value\" includes the satisfaction of an antecedent debt of the debtor). As a victim of the fraud, Legacy had numerous statutory and common law claims against BLMIS and Madoff. Legacy maintains that the withdrawals from its BLMIS account satisfied BLMIS's liability to Legacy arising from BLMIS's fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims under state law, and because Legacy was entitled to the securities that appeared on its customer statements under the New York Uniform Commercial Code.

The Trustee's motion for summary judgment is otherwise denied. The Court has considered the parties' other arguments and concludes that they lack merit or are mooted by the disposition of the motion. The Trustee is directed to settle an order on notice that sets forth the established facts. The parties are also directed to schedule a conference with chambers to fix a trial date.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-131\">\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Transcript of Aug. 11, 2009 Hr'g in United States v.
