JACOBVITZ, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Debtor, Jama E. Fontaine, seeks sanctions against HSBC Bank USA, National Association as Trustee for Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-8 (\"HSBC Bank-Trustee\") for alleged willful violations of the automatic stay and for alleged violations of the discharge injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held a final, evidentiary hearing on the Sanctions Motions, followed by closing arguments on a later date, and took the Sanctions Motions under advisement. Debtor asserts that HSBC Bank-Trustee violated the automatic stay by obtaining a foreclosure judgment after Debtor filed her voluntary bankruptcy petition, and that HSBC Bank-Trustee's failure to correct the stay violation after learning of Debtor's bankruptcy filing is a continued, willful violation of the automatic stay entitling the Debtor to actual and punitive damages. Debtor also contends that HSBC Bank-Trustee's collection efforts following the termination of the automatic stay violated the discharge injunction, entitling the Debtor to additional sanctions. HSBC Bank-Trustee asserts that the entry of the foreclosure judgment\n   shortly after Debtor filed her bankruptcy petition was a mere ministerial act that did not violate the automatic stay. Alternatively, if the Court determines that HSBC Bank-Trustee violated the automatic stay, HSBC Bank-Trustee urges the Court to apply the doctrine of laches to bar the Debtor from recovering any damages. HSBC Bank-Trustee also asserts that its continuing efforts to foreclose its mortgage after the Debtor received a discharge did not violate the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After considering the evidence and counsel's arguments, the applicable Bankruptcy Code sections, and relevant case law, the Court finds and concludes that 1) the entry of the foreclosure judgment after the Debtor filed her voluntary petition commencing her bankruptcy case violated the automatic stay and is, therefore, void; 2) HSBC Bank-Trustee willfully violated the automatic stay; 3) laches does not bar the Debtor from recovering actual damages for willful violation of the automatic stay; 4) Debtor's actual damages are limited to the attorney's fees she incurred in pursuing the Stay Violation Motion in her bankruptcy case; 5) punitive damages for willful violation of the automatic stay are not warranted; and 6) HSBC Bank-Trustee's collection efforts after the Debtor received a discharge did not violate the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on December 12, 2012. Debtor scheduled a residence at 616 Paper Flower Pl NE, Albuquerque, NM 87111 (the \"Property\") on Schedule A, with a value of $ 948,000, subject to a pending foreclosure suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1. Debtor listed \"HSBC Bank USA NA\" as a secured creditor on Schedule D.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On December 12, 2012, notice of the Debtor's bankruptcy filing and the date of the meeting of creditors was sent to all scheduled creditors, including HSBC Bank-Trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the Debtor filed her bankruptcy petition, HSBC Bank-Trustee filed a foreclosure action against the Debtor in the Second Judicial District Court, as Case No. CV 2010 10579 (the \"State Court Action\") seeking to foreclose its mortgage lien against the Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit A. The prepetition Complaint for Foreclosure included a request for an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   judgment against the Debtor for any deficiency following the foreclosure of the Property if the proceeds from the sale were insufficient to satisfy the debt to HSBC Bank-Trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 7. On November 27, 2012, at a hearing in the State Court Action, Judge Beatrice J. Brickhouse in an oral ruling granted HSBC Bank-Trustee's motion for summary judgment for foreclosure of the Property. The Debtor and Mr. Cowgill were left with the impression that they would not have to leave the Property immediately based on comments from counsel for HSBC Bank-Trustee's that the foreclosure process is slow and that it would take some time for HSBC Bank-Trustee to complete the foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a result of Judge Brickhouse's ruling, HSBC Bank-Trustee prepared a Summary, Stipulated, and Default Judgment, Decree of Foreclosure, and Appointment of Special Master (\"Foreclosure Judgment\"), and sent it to the Debtor for review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit GG (Letter dated December 4, 2012 from Castle Stawiarski, LLC to the Debtor enclosing proposed orders resulting from the November 28, 2012 hearing in the State Court Action).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor objected to the form of the Foreclosure Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit C (noting Debtor's objection). HSBC Bank-Trustee submitted the Foreclosure Judgment to the state court, noting that the Debtor objected to the form of judgment, before the Debtor filed her bankruptcy petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The seven-page Foreclosure Judgment was entered in the State Court Action on December 13, 2012, one day after the Debtor filed her voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Foreclosure Judgment includes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff shall have an in personam judgment against Defendant Jama Fontaine, individually, in the amount of $ 938,006.62, as of September 26, 2011, plus interest thereafter ta the rate of 6.375% per year, until the date of Special Master's sale, plus costs of sale, including Special Master's fee of $ 321.00, plus any additional attorney fees and costs actually expended from the date of this judgment until the date of the Special Master's sale, plus those additional amounts, if any, which Plaintiff will be required to pay prior to termination of this action for property taxes and insurance premiums or any other cost of upkeep of the property of any sort. The entire judgment amount, as described herein, is secured by a mortgage upon the above described property and constitutes a first lien on the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Foreclosure Judgment, \u00b6 B (Exhibit C).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As of the date the Foreclosure Judgment was entered in the State Court Action, HSBC Bank-Trustee had not received notice of the Debtor's bankruptcy filing. Debtor received a copy of the Foreclosure Judgment on December 14, 2012. On the same date, Erenio Gutierrez, Jr., Debtor's bankruptcy counsel, filed a Notice of Automatic Stay in the State Court Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 15, 2013, HSBC Bank-Trustee filed a Motion for Annulment of the Automatic Stay and for Abandonment (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Bankruptcy Rule 4001) (the \"Stay Motion\"), requesting the Court to annul the automatic stay with respect to the Debtor and the Debtor's bankruptcy estate and to enter an order abandoning the Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 17 The Debtor, on her own behalf and not through her bankruptcy counsel, filed an objection to the Stay Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19. At the preliminary hearing on the Stay Motion, held March 18, 2013, the Debtor appeared without her counsel of record and complained that she had received the Foreclosure Judgment two days after she filed her bankruptcy petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel for HSBC Bank-Trustee stated on the record that it no longer wished to pursue its request for annulment of the automatic\n   stay, and that, because a ruling on HSBC Bank-Trustee's request for foreclosure was made before the Debtor filed her bankruptcy petition, HSBC Bank-Trustee would be satisfied with simple termination of the automatic stay. The Court explained the following on the record of the preliminary hearing: 1) to the extent the automatic stay applied it would terminate when the Debtor's bankruptcy case is closed and will be replaced by the discharge injunction; and 2) the Debtor could raise the issue of the effect of the automatic stay on the entry of the Foreclosure Judgment in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Debtor received a discharge on March 19, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 22. A final decree was entered and the Debtor's bankruptcy case was closed on the same date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the Debtor's bankruptcy case was closed, HSBC Bank-Trustee scheduled a foreclosure sale of the Property for June 7, 2013 based on the Foreclosure Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 8. The foreclosure sale was postponed and rescheduled at least three times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After receiving the first notice of sale, the Debtor and her partner, John Cowgill, met with attorney N. Ana Garner on May 30, 2013 for about an hour. On July 10, 2013, just prior to the foreclosure sale scheduled for July 12, 2013, Debtor's counsel, N. Ana Garner, sent an email on behalf of the Debtor to counsel for HSBC Bank-Trustee asserting that the Foreclosure Judgment was void because its entry after the date of the bankruptcy filing violated the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 4. Ms. Garner attached to the email a copy of a published bankruptcy court decision in support of her position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, HSBC Bank-Trustee acting through its then counsel, agreed to postpone the foreclosure sale to allow the Debtor more time to remove her personal property from the Property and to discuss resolution of the case, but stated that he strongly disagreed with her position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 5. HSBC Bank-Trustee's counsel asserted that relevant case law establishes that ministerial acts do not violate the automatic stay, and that the entry of a judgment that had already been granted before the Debtor filed her bankruptcy petition is a ministerial act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Debtor did not pursue her position that the Foreclosure Judgment was void because it was entered in violation of the automatic stay in the State Court Action. The Debtor and Mr. Cowgill testified that, at the time, in June of 2013, Debtor accepted counsel for HSBC Bank-Trustee's explanation that the Foreclosure Judgment did not violate the automatic stay because she knew that HSBC Bank-Trustee's counsel was an experienced bankruptcy practitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For several years, Debtor and Mr. Cowgill filed motions in the State Court Action attempting to vacate the Foreclosure Judgment on grounds that HSBC Bank-Trustee lacked standing to enforce the note and mortgage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Notice of Objection to Plaintiff Filing Report and Account of Sale by Special Master, challenging HSBC Bank-Trustee's standing - Exhibit J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Debtor continued to receive notices from HSBC Bank-Trustee and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. after the Debtor received a discharge. In April of 2014, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. sent the Debtor notice concerning the renewal of hazard insurance for the Property (\"Hazard Insurance Notice\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 16. The Hazard Insurance\n   Notice states that the lender purchased the policy on behalf of the Debtor because the lender did not receive proof of acceptable insurance from the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Page three of the Hazard Insurance Notice, in smaller print, contains the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to inform you that, as your account servicer, we are attempting to collect a debt, and any information obtained will be used for that purpose. However, if you have received a discharge from bankruptcy, and the account was not reaffirmed in the bankruptcy case, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will only exercise its rights against the property and is not attempting any act to collect the discharged debt from you personally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To the Debtor, the notice looked like an invoice, another bill she would ultimately be required to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Over two years later, in the fall of 2015, again relying on the Foreclosure Judgment, HSBC Bank-Trustee scheduled another foreclosure sale of the Property to take place on October 6, 2015 (the \"October 2015 Sale\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 9. The evidence does not show the reason for the delay. By that time, the reported interest accrued on the Foreclosure Judgment was $ 240,993.82.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The special master filed a report of the October 2015 Sale reporting that HSBC Bank-Trustee made the best and highest bid for the Property in the sum of $ 576,415.47.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 11. But for a reason not in evidence the sale was not consummated. Another year passed. HSBC Bank-Trustee scheduled another foreclosure sale of the Property to take place on October 25, 2016 (the \"October 2016 Sale\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 10. By that time, the reported interest accrued on the Foreclosure Judgment was $ 304,068.34.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The special master filed a report of the October 2016 Sale reporting that HSBC Bank-Trustee made the best and highest bid for the Property in the sum of $ 509,200.76.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   HSBC Bank-Trustee prepared an order confirming the October 2016 Sale that included the following provision: \"No deficiency judgment shall be entered without an evidentiary hearing, with actual service upon and notice thereof to Defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 14. For a reason not in evidence that order confirming sale was never entered in the State Court Action. Two years later, on October 29, 2018, counsel for HSBC Bank-Trustee submitted to Debtor's counsel, Ms. Gardner, another proposed order confirming the October 2016 Sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 15. The proposed order confirming sale states that the judgment is an \"in rem\" judgment, and expressly provides that \"no deficiency judgment shall be sought.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    The Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 15, 2018, the Debtor appealed an Order Denying Defendant Fontaine's Emergency Motion Under Rule 1-060B(4) to Reopen Final Judgment and All Judgments due to Plaintiff's Lack of Standing; and Postpone Future Hearings and Orders until this Motion is Heard in the Interests of Judicial Economy, entered in the State Court Action on December 14, 2017 (\"State Court Order Denying Rule 60 Motion\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Appeal - Exhibit L. Debtor never filed a direct appeal of the Foreclosure Judgment. The State Court Order Denying Rule 60 Motion noted that the Foreclosure Judgment had been entered more than five years earlier, that the Defendant nevertheless persisted in challenging HSBC Bank-Trustee's right to foreclose the Property, and that, \"[w]hile the Court understands that this matter is obviously of great importance to the Defendant, the Court finds no valid basis to set aside a five year old Judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On\n   appeal, the Debtor continued to assert that HSBC Bank-Trustee lacked standing to foreclose the Property, but did not assert that the Foreclosure Judgment was void because it was entered in violation of the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibits M and O. Debtor was not successful on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit P - Memorandum Opinion entered July 19, 2019, affirming the State Court Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Debtor's Reactions to HSBC Bank-Trustee's Efforts to Foreclose the Property\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Debtor, who has had a long career as a real estate broker, was very upset and shocked when she received the Foreclosure Judgment after she had filed her bankruptcy case. She felt \"sick\" because the Foreclosure Judgment indicated to her that she was not only responsible for $ 938,000 in principal, but for accruing interest. She was \"devastated\" when she received the notice of the sale for the Property. Because HSBC Bank-Trustee had filed a motion to annul the automatic stay, the Debtor and Mr. Cowgill thought HSBC Bank-Trustee would have to vacate the Foreclosure Judgment and obtain a new judgment after the bankruptcy case was over. Every time she received a notice from HSBC Bank-Trustee or other document filed in the State Court Action the reported interest on the debt continued to grow.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Exhibits 10, 11, 12. The Debtor testified that receiving these papers caused her to feel the stress both emotionally and physically; she did not want to get up and experienced depression and anxiety. She sought treatment through Chinese medicine, energy treatments, and massage therapy treatments. The Debtor does not have any records or bills from those treatments. The Debtor testified that eventually, the ongoing State Court Action caused her so much stress that she moved to Santa Fe and took another job with the realty company with less responsibility and lower pay. She lived in Santa Fe for five years, and resided in five different places. She currently resides in Albuquerque.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   John Cowgill is the Debtor's domestic partner. He and the Debtor have lived together since 2007. Mr. Cowgill assisted the Debtor with her defense of the State Court Action and was added as a defendant to the State Court Action. Mr. Cowgill is not an attorney. After doing some research on his own, he determined that he could purchase some, but not all, of the rights in the Property, so he purported to buy the right of possession, right of enjoyment, and right of exclusion, without obtaining title to the Property. He views those rights as common law rights to the Property that grant him an encumbrance on the title. He also assisted the Debtor in recording several documents in the records of the Bernalillo County Clerk purporting to create security interests in the Property. Eventually the state court entered an order prohibiting Mr. Cowgill from filing any more documents in the State Court Action on behalf of the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 1. He was permitted to file documents in the State court Action on his own behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Reopening Debtor's Bankruptcy Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 1, 2018, more than five years after the Debtor's bankruptcy case was closed, just shortly after the New Mexico Court of Appeals affirmed the State Court Order Denying Rule 60 Motion, Debtor sought to reopen her bankruptcy case to seek remedies for HSBC Bank-Trustee's alleged violation of the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 27. The Debtor testified that she did not become aware of a potential problem with entry of the Foreclosure Judgment violating the automatic stay until she contacted a mortgage company in the spring or early summer of 2018 as part of her efforts to redeem the Property. This Court reopened the Debtor's bankruptcy\n   case on August 8, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 28. The Debtor filed a motion to enforce the automatic stay and for sanctions for willful violation of the automatic stay on August 21, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 30. The Debtor also sought to reinstate the automatic stay, which the Court denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 41 and Docket No. 43. The Court permitted the Debtor to include in her motion a request for sanctions for violation of the discharge injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 56. From 2013, when the Debtor first consulted with Ms. Garner upon receipt of the first notice of sale of the Property, through the trial of this contested matter, the Debtor has incurred attorney's fees totaling $ 22,596.20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   HSBC Bank-Trustee never sought to vacate the Foreclosure Judgment in the State Court Action, and never obtained a new judgment for foreclosure after the Debtor received her discharge and the automatic stay terminated by operation of law upon the closing of the bankruptcy case. HSBC Bank-Trustee continued to rely on the Foreclosure Judgment, and its belief that its entry was a ministerial act that did not violate the discharge injunction, to schedule the foreclosure sale of the Property. To date HSBC Bank-Trustee has not taken possession of the Property. HSBC Bank-Trustee has not taken any efforts to collect a deficiency judgment from the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A.

The state court judge therefore had to determine whether it was appropriate to enter the Foreclosure Judgment notwithstanding the Debtor's refusal to approve it. The judge had to review the Foreclosure Judgment to make sure it was consistent with her oral ruling and to determine whether any provisions in the judgment not expressly included in the oral ruling were appropriate. There is no evidence that the seven-page Foreclosure Judgment containing detailed provisions governing the foreclosure merely reduced the state court judge's oral ruling granting summary judgment to writing verbatim. Further, the judge had discretion to revise her ruling before signing or approving the Foreclosure Judgment. There is no evidence that the judge signed or approved the Foreclosure Judgment for entry prior to commencement of the bankruptcy case.

Debtor waited over five years before pursuing her claim for willful violation of the automatic stay. The Debtor knew that there was a legal basis to assert that the entry of the Foreclosure Judgment violated the automatic stay as early as 2013. She complained to the Court at the preliminary stay hearing that she received the Foreclosure Judgment two days after she filed her bankruptcy. The Debtor's possible misunderstanding of the law, or acceptance of HSBC Bank-Trustee's explanation that the entry of the Foreclosure Judgment was merely ministerial act that did not violate the automatic stay, is no excuse for failing to assert her claims for willful violation of the automatic stay until after she lost her appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At the very least, the Debtor knew by June of 2013 that some case law supported her position that the Foreclosure Judgment violated the automatic stay and was void. Debtor's counsel asserted that position to HSBC Bank-Trustee's counsel and provided case law to support it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 4. Nevertheless, the Debtor chose not to pursue her argument that the Foreclosure Judgment violated the automatic stay until after the Debtor exhausted her efforts to overturn the Foreclosure Judgment on appeal based on HSBC Bank-Trustee's alleged lack of standing. The Court finds that the Debtor's explanation that she did not understand there was a potential problem with the Foreclosure Judgment until spring of 2018 when she was attempting to obtain a loan to redeem the Property not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   However, even though Debtor's delay in asserting her claims was inexcusable, HSBC Bank-Trustee has failed to demonstrate material prejudice resulting from the delay. HSBC Bank-Trustee itself is to blame for much of the harm.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202827\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/546/#p556\">\n    497 B.R. at 556-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that defendant, by deciding to rest on its judgment and insisting on its validity rather\n   than vacating the judgment and resuming its action against the debtor after the conclusion of the debtor's Chapter 7 case, had only itself to blame for any prejudice). Like the creditor in\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   , HSBC Bank-Trustee continued to rely on the Foreclosure Judgment in scheduling the foreclosure sales for the Property, assuming the risk that its \"ministerial act\" argument might not carry the day. By abandoning its request to annul the automatic stay, HSBC Bank-Trustee never obtained a ruling that the Foreclosure Judgment was valid. It easily could have (and should have) sought a comfort order from this Court determining whether the stay applied to the Foreclosure Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j) (\"On request of a party in interest, the court shall issue an order under subsection (c) confirming that the automatic stay has been terminated.\"). Failing an order from this Court determining that the automatic stay did not apply to the entry of the Foreclosure Judgment, HSBC Bank-Trustee should have obtained a new Foreclosure Judgment in the State Court Action after the Debtor received a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   HSBC Bank-Trustee's only argument that the Debtor's delay caused it prejudice is that HSBC Bank-Trustee was forced to pay advanced property taxes and purchase homeowner's insurance. It is unclear form the evidence why HSBC Bank-Trustee conducted and rescheduled the foreclosure sale several times over a period of many years. That delay appears unrelated to the Debtor's delay in seeking damages for a willful violation of the stay. Further, there is nothing in the record to explain why HSBC Bank-Trustee took no action to foreclose the Property during the state court appeal. There is no evidence of a stay pending appeal. HSBC Bank-Trustee would have had to defend the appeal regardless of whether the Debtor had asserted that the Foreclosure Judgment was void in the State Court Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   HSBC Bank-Trustee has failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by Debtor's delay in asserting her claim for willful violation of the automatic stay. To the contrary, HSBC Bank-Trustee is largely responsible for any prejudice it suffered by risking the validity of the Foreclosure Judgment and delaying its efforts to foreclose the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   4.

Debtor's arguments on appeal were limited to standing. She would have made those arguments and incurred those expenses regardless of whether HSBC Bank-Trustee had obtained a new post-petition foreclosure judgment and the Debtor had appealed that judgment on standing grounds. The description for the fees incurred in June of 2017 and October of 2017 are insufficient for the Court to determine what they were for and whether they were necessitated by the stay violation. Debtor did not reopen her bankruptcy case until August of 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The fees incurred in June of 2013 appear to relate to the email communications with HSBC Trustee's then counsel regarding the applicability of the automatic stay.

Even though the Debtor indicated she sought herbal treatment, and massage to alleviate her stress, Debtor did not provide any evidence to quantify her damages. The Debtor's generalized complaints of \"devastation\" and feeling depressed are insufficient\n   to sustain an award of actual damages for emotional distress. Further, the Debtor had counsel. Had she consulted her lawyer, she could have been reassured that the discharge insulates her from any personal liability on the debt.

HSBC Bank-Trustee is a sophisticated creditor familiar with bankruptcy and the broad reach of the automatic stay. It persisted in relying on the Foreclosure Judgment to schedule foreclosure sales of the Property even though it knew or should have known there was a risk that its Foreclosure Judgment may be declared void and without effect. Even so, HSBC Bank-Trustee had some case law to support its position that the post-petition entry of the Foreclosure Judgment following the pre-petition grant of summary judgment constituted a ministerial act not subject to the automatic stay. There is no binding Tenth Circuit case law or case law within the District of New Mexico to the contrary. HSBC Bank-Trustee's conduct falls short of acting with such reckless disregard of the law that punitive damages are warranted. In addition, at the time the Foreclosure Judgment was submitted to the judge in the State Court Action, HSBC Bank-Trustee had no notice that the Debtor had filed a bankruptcy case. HSBC Bank-Trustee did not act with specific intent to violate the automatic stay. The Debtor, on the other hand, knew that the state court had granted HSBC Bank-Trustee's motion for summary judgment. She refused to approve the form of the Foreclosure Judgment and, instead filed her Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. She then waited many years to assert a claim for willful violation of the stay. Under these circumstances, the Court declines to grant the Debtor punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   B.

Although that language suggests that HSBC Bank-Trustee could later seek to obtain a deficiency judgment, that order was never entered in the State Court Action. The proposed Order Confirming Sale submitted to Debtor's counsel on October 29, 2018 expressly provided that no deficiency judgment will be sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 15. The post-discharge notices sent to the Debtor informing the Debtor that renewal hazard insurance had been purchased on the Property were informational and did not demand payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Best v. Nationstar Mortg. LLC (In re Best)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350637\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/540/1/#p11\">\n    540 B.R. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11 (1st Cir. BAP 2015) (\"Statements of an\n   informational nature, even if they include a payoff amount, are generally not actionable if they do not demand payment.\") (citation omitted). In addition, the notices included an explanation, albeit in fine print, that the creditor \"will only exercise its rights against the property and is not attempting any act to collect the discharged debt from you personally.\" Exhibit 16 and Exhibit 17. These notices fall short of coercing the Debtor to pay a debt and did not violate the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Debtor's motion for damages for willful violation of the automatic stay will be granted, in part. HSBC Bank-Trustee willfully violated the automatic stay, and its Foreclosure Judgment, entered after the Debtor filed her bankruptcy petition, is void. HSBC Bank-Trustee must obtain a new judgment for foreclosure in the State Court Action before it may continue to foreclose its interest in the Property. Debtor is entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in pursuing her Stay Violation Motion as actual damages for HSBC Bank-Trustee's willful stay violation. Debtor's motion for contempt for violation of the discharge injunction will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court entered the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Memorandum Opinion in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr. P 9014 and 7052.
