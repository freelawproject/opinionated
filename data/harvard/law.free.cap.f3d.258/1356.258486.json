Yanco is the widow of William Yanco, who served as a public safety officer with the Wellesley, Massachusetts police force. Following her husband\u2019s death by suicide, Ms. Yanco submitted a claim to the Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance (\u201cBJA\u201d) seeking death benefits under the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits Act of 1976 (the \u201cBenefits Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), Pub.L. No. 94-430, 90 Stat. 1346 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3796-3796c (1994)). After BJA denied her claim, Ms. Yanco brought suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">In due course, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>administrative record. After considering the motions, the Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgment in favor of the government and dismissed Ms. Yanco\u2019s complaint. The court ruled that recovery under the Benefits Act was barred because Officer Yanco had not died as the result of a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the statute, as interpreted by BJA regulations. <em>Yanco v. United States, </em>45 Fed. Cl. 782, 792-93 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The Benefits Act provides a onetime cash payment to survivors of public safety officers who die in the line of duty. Section 3796(a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">In any case in which the Bureau of Justice Assistance ... determines, under regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the Bureau shall pay a benefit of $100,000 ... as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">(1) if there is no surviving child of such officer, to the surviving spouse of such officer;</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">(2) if there is a surviving child or children and a surviving spouse, one-half to the surviving child or children of such officer in equal shares and one-half to the surviving spouse;</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">(3) if there is no surviving spouse, to the child or children of such officer in equal shares; or</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">(4) if none of the above, to the parent or parents of such officer in equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a) (1994). For a survivor or survivors to qualify for the payment, the public safety officer (1) must have suffered a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the Act, (2) the injury must have been suffered \u201cin the line of duty,\u201d and (3) the death must have been \u201cthe direct and proximate result\u201d of the personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">Section 3796a sets forth specific restrictions upon entitlement. It provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">No benefit shall be paid under this sub-chapter\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">(1) if the death or catastrophic injury was caused by the intentional misconduct of the public safety officer or by such officer\u2019s intention to bring about his death or catastrophic injury;</p>\n<p id=\"b813-18\">(2) if the public safety officer was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of his death or catastrophic injury;</p>\n<p id=\"b813-19\">(3) if the public safety officer was performing his duties in a grossly negligent manner at the time of his death or catastrophic injury;</p>\n<p id=\"b813-20\">(4) to any individual who would otherwise be entitled to a benefit under this subchapter if such individual\u2019s actions were a substantial contributing factor to the death or catastrophic injury of the public safety officer; or</p>\n<p id=\"b813-21\">(5) to any individual employed in a capacity other than a civilian capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-22\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796a (1994). Among other things, \u00a7 3796a prohibits the payment of benefits to the dependents of an officer who intentionally brings about his or her own death.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-23\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796c(a), BJA is \u201cauthorized to establish regulations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>procedures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.\u201d Pursuant to this authority, regulations have been promulgated to implement the Benefits Act. In the regulations, \u201cpersonal injury\u201d is defined as \u201cany traumatic injury, as well as diseases which are caused by or result from such injury, but not occupational diseases.\u201d 28 C.F.R \u00a7 32.2(e) (1997). \u201cTraumatic Injury\u201d is defined as \u201ca wound or the condition of the body caused by external force, including injuries inflicted by bullets, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects or other physical blows, chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious diseases, radiation, and bacteria, but excluding stress and strain.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(g) (1997). Thus, the regulations exclude stress and strain from the definition of \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. William Yanco was a member of the Wellesley, Massachusetts police force from 1971 until his death in 1992. He served as a Safety Officer, a Drug Abuse Resistance Education Officer, and a Youth Officer. In all three positions he designed programs to promote child health and safety and prevent juvenile delinquency. <em>Yanco, </em>45 Fed. Cl. at 783. As part of his authorized duties as a Youth Officer, Officer Yanco counseled troubled children and their families, often in their homes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">On May 28, 1992, the mother of a ten-year old boy whom Officer Yanco was counseling accused Officer Yanco of engaging in sexually inappropriate behavior with the boy. Officer Yanco immediately reported the allegation to his supervisor, and there ensued investigations by the Internal Affairs Office of the Wellesley Police Department, the Wellesley Department of Social Services, and the District Attorney of Norfolk County, Massachusetts. <em>Id. </em>at 784. The accusation and resulting investigations drew significant media attention. <em>Id. </em>Each investigation concluded that Officer Yanco did not engage in any misconduct, and at the time of his death, Officer Yanco was aware of the results of at least two of the investigations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">In the wake of the allegation against him, Officer Yanco \u201cappeared acutely distressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He \u201csuffered pervasive mood disturbances that resulted in crying spells, loss of sleep, appetite and the capacity for enjoyment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ms. Yanco urged her husband to seek professional help, but he refused. <em>Id. </em>at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">On June 22, 1992, Officer Yanco left work early, leaving on his computer a note for his wife and another note for his children. At about 2:00 p.m., he telephoned the Police Department from his home. While on the phone, he fatally shot himself. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Following her husband\u2019s death, Ms. Yanco applied to the Town of Wellesley Retirement Board for pension benefits, basing her claim on the ground that her husband\u2019s death had occurred in the line of duty. <em>Id. </em>A psychologist and a psychiatrist submitted reports in support of the claim, stating that Officer Yanco\u2019s suicide was causally related to his work as a police officer. <em>Id. </em>Based on these reports, on August 26, 1993, the Board held that Officer Yanco had died in the line of duty, entitling his widow to benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 785-86. The Massachusetts Division of Public Retirement Administration affirmed the Wellesley Retirement Board\u2019s decision on September 20, 1993, and awarded state pension benefits to Ms. Yanco. <em>Id. </em>at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>On June 9, 1993, Ms. Yanco filed a claim for death benefits with the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits Act Office (\u201cPSOBO\u201d), a unit of BJA. PSOBO denied her claim on October 26, 1993, and Ms. Yanco filed a notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>In accordance with BJA regulations, the matter was referred to a Hearing Officer, who received evidence and held a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 6, 1995, the Hearing Officer rendered a decision in which he determined that Officer Yanco\u2019s suicide was the result of an injury sustained in the line of duty, entitling his widow to benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 787. In reaching his decision, the Hearing Officer concluded: \u201cOfficer Yanco\u2019s post traumatic stress disorder and major depression qualify as personal injuries. That is, they were traumatic injuries, wounds inflicted upon his mind, triggered by the allegation of sexual misconduct, an external force.\u201d He also concluded that Officer Yanco\u2019s impaired mental state rendered his suicide unintentional. On review, however, the Director of BJA reversed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a decision dated February 18, 1997, the Director concluded that the term \u201ctraumatic injury\u201d in BJA\u2019s implementing regulations does not encompass stress. As a result, the Director stated: \u201cOfficer Yanco\u2019s \u2018injury\u2019 is not encompassed within the definition of \u2018personal injury,\u2019 and is therefore not cognizable under the [Benefits] Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. The Director also concluded that Officer Yanco\u2019s death was not sustained \u201cin the line of duty,\u201d as required by \u00a7 3796(a), because, when Officer Yanco shot himself, he was not performing an action which he was \u201cobligated or authorized by rule, regulations, condition of employment or service, or law to perform.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(c)(1) (1997); <em>see also Yanco </em>45 Fed. Cl. at 788. The Director further concluded that, even if Officer Yanco\u2019s death could be viewed as a result of traumatic injury, benefits would not be payable to Ms. Yanco because of the prohibition in the Benefits Act against paying benefits when an officer\u2019s death is intentional. <em>Yanco, </em>45 Fed. Cl. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AfN\">Ms. Yanco timely filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims to challenge BJA\u2019s denial of her claim under the Benefits Act. As noted above, in due course, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment based upon the administrative record. In considering the summary judgment motions, the court accorded deference under <em>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), to BJA\u2019s construction of the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a). <em>Id. </em>at 792. The court concluded that Ms. Yanco had not carried her burden of establishing that BJA\u2019s determination that post traumatic stress disorder and depression were encompassed by the exclusionary language \u201cstress and strain\u201d in 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(g) was unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Because, in its regulations, BJA has interpreted \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as excluding \u201cstress and strain,\u201d the court concluded that Officer Yanco\u2019s death by suicide did not result from a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>Id. </em>The court therefore granted summary judgment in favor of the government and denied Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>Yanco\u2019s motion, thereby upholding BJA\u2019s denial of Ms. Yanco\u2019s claim for death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">We have jurisdiction over Ms. Yanco\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Judicial review of BJA\u2019s denial of a claim for death benefits under the Benefits Act is limited to three inquiries: (1) whether there has been substantial compliance with statutory requirements and with the requirements of implementing regulations; (2) whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the government officials involved; and (3) whether the decision denying the claim is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chacon v. United States, </em>48 F.3d 508, 511 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Ms. Yanco\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that, in denying her claim under the Act, BJA misapplied the statute. She contends that the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a) includes mental injuries, such as post traumatic stress disorder and depression, and that the Court of Federal Claims therefore erred in according <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BJA regulations at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 32.2(e) and 32.2(g) which define \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to exclude stress and strain. Ms. Yanco\u2019s argument that these regulations are contrary to the Benefits Act presents an issue of statutory construction, a matter of law that we review <em>de novo. Doyon, Ltd. v. United States, </em>214 F.3d 1309, 1314 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">\u201c[Administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for <em>Chevron </em>deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 2171, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). Congress has expressly delegated to BJA the task of promulgating regulations to implement the Benefits Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796c(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(c). The regulations at issue in this case, those set forth at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 32.2(e) and 32.2(g), were promulgated in the exercise of that authority. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.1 (1997). BJA\u2019s implementing regulations thus qualify for <em>Chevron </em>deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">Under <em>Chevron, </em>two questions must be addressed. The first is \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear,\u201d both the court and the agency involved \u201cmust give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If, however, the court determines that \u201cthe statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">The \u201cprecise question at issue\u201d in this case is whether the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a) includes mental strain.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Yanco recognizes that \u201cpersonal injury\u201d is not defined in the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>She argues, however, that Congress has effectively spoken to the meaning of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d because the term has a common meaning that includes mental strain. <em>See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, </em>503 U.S. 318, 322, 112 S.Ct. 1344, 117 L.Ed.2d 581 (\u201cWhere Congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under ... the common law, a court must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.\u201d) (citing <em>Kelley v. S. Pac. Co., </em>419 U.S. 318, 322-323, 95 S.Ct. 472, 42 L.Ed.2d 498 (1974)). She contends that this common meaning is used in state workmen\u2019s compensation laws and in connection with veterans\u2019 benefits. Thus, she points to the Massachusetts workmen\u2019s compensation law for its inclusion of mental injuries as work related personal injuries. <em>See In re Fitzgibbons\u2019 Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 373 N.E.2d 1174, 1177 (1978) (concluding that the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d permits compensation in cases involving mental disabilities causally connected to mental trauma or shock arising out of any aspect of employment). She also points to 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304(f) (1997), a regulation promulgated by the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to its authority under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 (1994). Under \u00a7 3.304(f), post traumatic stress disorder may qualify as a service-connected injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">We are not persuaded by Ms. Yanco\u2019s arguments. To begin with, it appears that, as far as state workmen\u2019s compensation laws are concerned, the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d may or may not be limited to physical injuries. <em>See, e.g., Demars v. Rickel, </em>223 Kan. 374, 573 P.2d 1036, 1040 (1978) (holding that \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the Kansas workmen\u2019s compensation law requires a change in the physical structure of the body); <em>see also Swan v. Williamson, </em>74 Idaho 32, 257 P.2d 552, 555 (1953) (holding that \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of Iowa\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation law requires violence to the physical structure of the body). Even Massachusetts, a state that does include mental injuries as part of its workmen\u2019s compensation scheme, only includes \u201cmental and nervous disorders arising out of employment where such injuries are the result of physical trauma, no matter how slight the impact.\u201d <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019, </em>373 N.E.2d at 1177.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, analogous regulatory schemes, such as the one relating to veterans\u2019 benefits, are simply representative of one possible reading of the term \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that Congress has not \u201cdirectly spoken\u201d to the question of whether the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a) includes mental strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Turning to the second prong of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, we must determine whether BJA\u2019s decision to define \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as \u201cany traumatic injury,\u201d 28 C.F.R \u00a7 32.2(e), and then to exclude from the definition of \u201ctraumatic injury\u201d stress and strain, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(g), represents \u201ca permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. For the following reasons, we conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">In originally promulgating the definitional regulations that are at issue here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (\u201cLEAA\u201d), BJA\u2019s predecessor, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">LEAA believes that the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in the House Judiciary Committee Reports manifests the Committee\u2019s intent to limit coverage to deaths caused by traumatic injuries. The Report language is consistent with the following definition of \u201ctrauma[:]\u201d ... \u201can injury caused by rough contact with a physical object; accidental or inflicted wound.\u201d The regulations, accordingly, have defined \u201ctraumatic injury\u201d to mean \u201ca wound or other condition of the body caused by external force, including injuries inflicted by bullets, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects or other physical blows, chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious diseases, radiation and bacteria, but excluding stress and strain.\u201d ... Deaths caused by traumatic injuries do not therefore include deaths directly attributable to exertion or stress encountered in the performance of duty, unless that stress resulted in or was caused by a traumatic injury that was a substantial factor in the officer\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">42 Fed. Reg. 23,260 (May 6,1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The legislative history supports the definition of the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in the regulations. The House Judiciary Committee Reports to which LEAA refers, House Reports Nos. 94-1031 and 94-1032 94th. Cong.2d Sess., both contain the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">[I]t is the Committee\u2019s intent that the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d shall include all injuries to the body which are inflicted by an outside force, whether or not it is accompanied by physical impact, as well as diseases which are caused by or result from such injuries, but not diseases which arise merely out of the performance of duty. In other words, deaths from occupational diseases alone are not within the purview of this legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">H.R.Rep. No. 94-1031, at 4; H.R.Rep. No. 94-1032, at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">In the Senate, the bill that was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee provided a death benefit to the survivor or survivors of an officer who died in the line of duty from \u201cinjuries directly and proximately caused by a criminal act or an apparent criminal act.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-816, 94th Cong.2d Sess. at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2504. However, an amendment was introduced on the Senate floor, substituting \u201cas the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty\u201d for the more limited \u201ccriminal act\u201d language. Speaking in support of the amendment, Senator McClellan stated that the bill \u201cis not health insurance; but it does provide for payment if an officer is killed in the line of duty, either by accident or by willful assault by a criminal.\u201d 122 Cong. Rec. S11837-38 (daily ed. July 19, 1976) (statement of Sen. McClellan). The amendment passed, and its language was incorporated into the final version of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">The legislative history makes it clear that Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Benefits Act was to provide a death benefit for the survivor or survivors of a law enforcement officer who dies as the result of what one would understand to be some kind of a physical assault or trauma to the body. Thus, the statements in the House Reports that are quoted above refer to \u201cinjuries to the body which are inflicted by an outside force.\u201d In short, the legislative history points away from an intent on the part of Congress to have the statutory term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d include mental strain. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>thus conclude that the regulations at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 32.2(e) and 32.2(g) which define the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d so as to exclude stress and strain represent, in the words of <em>Chevron, </em>a \u201cpermissible construction of the statute.\u201d We therefore reject Ms. Yanco\u2019s challenge to the regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The only question that remains is whether the decision of the BJA that Officer Yanco\u2019s suicide was the result of \u201cstress and strain\u201d within the meaning of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(g) is supported by substantial evidence. There is abundant evidence in the administrative record that it was mental strain that led Officer Yanco to take his life. The record includes the written statement of Ms. Yanco and her hearing testimony. Ms. Yanco stated that, after the allegation was made against him, her husband withdrew from his family and became irritable and depressed. (\u201cI would awaken during the night and find him gone from our bed. He would be down in the family room on the couch just staring into space or openly weeping.\u201d) The record also includes the written statements and hearing testimony of two mental health experts, Dr. James C. Beck and Dr. Laurie W. Raymond. Dr. Beck and Dr. Raymond concluded that, at the time of his death, Officer Yanco was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and depression. BJA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Ms. Yanco makes two additional arguments. As noted above, the Director of BJA concluded that Officer Yanco was not acting \u201cin the line of duty,\u201d as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a) when he took his life. The Director also concluded that, even if Officer Yanco\u2019s death could be viewed as the result of \u201ctraumatic injury\u201d within the meaning of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(g), benefits would not be payable to Ms. Yanco because of the prohibition in the Benefits Act against paying benefits when an officer\u2019s death is intentional. Ms. Yanco challenges the Director\u2019s conclusion that Officer Yanco was not acting in the line of duty when he took his life. She also asserts that the Director acted arbitrarily and capriciously in reversing the Hearing Officer\u2019s determination that Officer Yanco lacked the intent to bring about his death. The issues of acting in the line of duty and intent only are relevant, however, if a law enforcement officer dies as the result of a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3796(a) and 3796a. As discussed above, Officer Yanco did not die as the result of such an injury. Ms. Yanco\u2019s additional arguments are thus unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Court of Federal Claims granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>summary judgment in favor of the government and thereby sustaining BJA\u2019s denial of Ms. Yanco\u2019s claim for death benefits under the Benefits Act is</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-5\">. A claimant may request BJA to reconsider its finding of ineligibility. Upon request for reconsideration, BJA will provide the claimant with the opportunity for an oral hearing before a Hearing Officer. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-10\">. Pursuant to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.24(h)(1) (1997), the Director of BJA \"may, on his or her own motion, review a determination made by a Hearing Officer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\">. We use the term \"mental strain\" to include stress, strain, post traumatic stress disorder, and depression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\">. In its decision sustaining BJA's denial of Ms. Yanco\u2019s claim, the Court of Federal Claims noted: \"In the Hearing Officer\u2019s determination, he notes that the workmen's compensation laws of approximately 30 states compensate for mental injuries. The reasonable conclusion to be drawn from this assertion is that approximately 20 states do not compensate for mental injuries.\u201d 45 Fed.Cl. at 792 n. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\">. Our conclusion is consistent with <em>Smykowski v. United States, </em>227 Ct.Cl. 284, 647 F.2d 1103 (1981). That case involved a claim under the Benefits Act by the survivors of a police officer who collapsed and died as the result of a heart attack immediately following a struggle with an individual whom he was seeking to place in custody. The officer did not suffer any direct physical injuries from the struggle, however. The Court of Claims determined that the officer had not died as the result of a \"traumatic injury,\" as defined in the regulations. It therefore sustained the denial of the claim for death benefits under the Act. Although the appellants in <em>Smykowski </em>did not challenge the validity of the regulations defining \"personal injury,\u201d the court\u2019s observation about the regulations is worth noting: \"Claimants do not take issue with the agency's position excluding stress, strain, and heart disorders from the coverage of the Act, exclusions which, in any event, are amply justified by the statutory language, legislative history, and medical statistics.\u201d 647 F.2d at 1105 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
