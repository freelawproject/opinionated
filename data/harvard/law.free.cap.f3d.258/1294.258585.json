Gately, and Michelle Jo Evans (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims that dismissed their complaint for lack of standing. <em>Am. Fed\u2019n Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO v. United States, </em>46 Fed. Cl. 586 (2000) (\u201cAFGE\u201d). The court determined that Appellants lack standing to challenge a cost comparison analysis of the Defense Logistics Agency (\u201cDLA\u201d) because their interests do not come within the zone of interests protected by either the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act (\u201cFAIR\u201d), P.L. No. 105-270, 112 Stat. 2382 (1998), re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number><em>printed in </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 (Historical and Statutory Notes), or 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462 (1994). Because we determine that Appellants lack standing under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1), we affirm the decision of the Court of Federal Claims, but on a different ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The FAIR requires executive agencies to identify the activities they perform that are not \u201cinherently governmental functions.\u201d FAIR, \u00a7 2(a). Each year, the head of each agency must submit a list to the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) of all such activities (a \u201cFAIR list\u201d). <em>Id. </em>The FAIR also requires that when an agency considers contracting with a private sector source for the performance of such an activity, it must select the source using a competitive process that includes a \u201crealistic and fair\u201d cost comparison analysis. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2(d), (e). The FAIR provides that certain parties, including employees of an organization within an executive agency that is performing or that might perform the activity, as well as labor organizations that include such employees in their membership, may bring an administrative challenge to the \u201comission of [the] particular activity from, or [the] inclusion of [the] particular activity on, a [FAIR] list.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Since a date prior to the enactment of the FAIR, OMB Circular No. A-76 (\u201cOMB A-76\u201d) has governed the performance of commercial activities by executive agencies. OMB A-76 reflects the view that \u201cthe [g]overnment should not compete with its citizens\u201d and that \u201cit has been and continues to be the general policy of the [government to rely on commercial sources to supply the products and services the [government needs.\u201d OMB A-76 provides that \u201cthe [government shall not start or carry on any activity to provide a commercial product or service if the product or service can be procured more economically from a commercial source.\u201d OMB A-76 requires agencies to perform cost comparison analyses to determine whether a commercial product or service should be provided by the agency or by a private sector source. In performing a cost comparison analysis, the agency is to compare the bid of the private sector source with the cost of providing the good or service with government facilities and personnel (the agency\u2019s \u201cMost Efficient Organization\u201d or \u201cMEO\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> OMB A-76 provides for the administrative review of cost comparison decisions, and permits federal employees who would be affected by the decision, as well as their representatives, to seek such review. The provisions of OMB A-76 are consistent with the FAIR and OMB A-76 has remained in effect since enactment of the FAIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">On April 30, 1999, the DLA issued a solicitation for bids for the performance of defense material distribution services (\u201cdepot services\u201d) at the Defense Distribution Depot in Barstow, California. The solicitation was issued in support of a cost comparison study conducted under OMB A-76. The cost comparison study was designed to determine whether the depot services could be performed more economically by a private sector source or by the DLA\u2019s MEO.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>The DLA determined that EG&amp;G Logistics, Inc. (\u201cEG&amp;G\u201d) won the competition among private sector sources because EG&amp;G had submitted the lowest-priced, technically acceptable proposal. Accordingly, the DLA proceeded to compare EG&amp;G\u2019s bid to that of the MEO. While this comparison process was pending, Congress enacted the FAIR. Pursuant to the FAIR, the DLA listed the depot services on its FAIR list.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">On January 5, 2000, the DLA determined that EG&amp;G\u2019s bid was about $2.5 million lower than the MEO\u2019s; accordingly, the DLA tentatively decided to contract out the depot services to EG&amp;G. Appellants William J. Gately and Michelle Jo Evans are federal employees who allege that they will be part of the MEO if the depot services are performed by the DLA but will be displaced if the depot services are contracted out to EG&amp;G. The union appellants represent Mr. Gately and Ms. Evans and other similarly situated federal employees. Pursuant to OMB A-76, Appellants and EG&amp;G submitted administrative appeals of the cost comparison decision to the DLA Appeal Authority. As a result of these appeals, the cost comparison was recalculated, but EG&amp;G\u2019s bid remained lower than that of the MEO by about $2.2 million. Accordingly, the Appeal Authority upheld the tentative decision to award the contract to EG&amp;G.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Appellants filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims to challenge the Appeal Authority\u2019s decision. Appellants argued that the DLA had failed to conduct a proper price comparison as required by OMB A-76, by \u00a7 2(e) of the FAIR, and by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Appellants do not have standing to challenge the cost comparison decision in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">The court considered whether Appellants have standing under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1), which gives the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over bid protest cases. <em>AFGE, </em>46 Fed. Cl. at 591. The relevant language in that statute provides that the court has \u201cjurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) (Supp. V 1999). Because the statute does not define an \u201cinterested party,\u201d the court looked to its legislative history to determine whether Congress intended the term to include federal employees such as Appellants. <em>AFGE, </em>46 Fed. Cl. at 592-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">The court noted that, prior to the enactment of \u00a7 1491(b)(1), the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over only pre-award bid protest cases, while federal district courts had jurisdiction over post-award bid protest cases. <em>Id. </em>at 592-93. The court determined that the prior jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims was based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a) and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>fore, was limited to claims \u201c \u2018founded upon ... any express or implied contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a) (1994)). Thus, \u201c[disappointed bidders were the only parties who had standing to bring a bid protest\u201d in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Id. </em>The court determined that the prior jurisdiction of the district courts was based on the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702-706. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Scanwell Labs., Inc. v. Shaffer, </em>424 F.2d 859 (D.C.Cir.1970) (holding that a disappointed bidder could challenge the award of a government contract in a district court pursuant to the APA)). The court noted that standing under the APA is governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, which confers standing on \u201c \u2018a person ... adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (1994)). The court stated that \u201c[t]he requirements for establishing standing under the APA are well settled. Claimants ... must demonstrate that: (1) they have suffered sufficient \u2018injury-in-fact;\u2019 (2) that the injury is \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to the agency\u2019s decision and is \u2018likely to be redressed by a favorable decision;\u2019 and (3) that the interests sought to be protected are \u2018arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute ... in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595 (quoting <em>Nat\u2019l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>522 U.S. 479, 488, 118 S.Ct. 927, 140 L.Ed.2d 1 (1998) (third alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The court determined that one purpose behind \u00a7 1491(b)(1) was to give the Court of Federal Claims and the district courts concurrent jurisdiction over all bid protest cases, so that \u201cboth courts [could] hear \u2018the full range of cases previously subject to review in either system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593 (quoting 142 Cong. Rec. S11849 (daily ed. Sept. 30, 1996) (statement of Sen. Levin)). The court therefore reasoned that \u201cinterested parties\u201d in \u00a7 1491(b)(1) should be interpreted as including everyone \u201cwho had standing in either court under each forum\u2019s [prior] jurisdiction over bid protest cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 595. Thus, although Appellants would not have had standing under \u00a7 1491(a), the court reasoned that they might have standing under \u00a7 1491(b)(1) if they \u201cwould have had standing in [a] federal district court under the APA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The court proceeded to apply to the Appellants the three-part test for standing under the APA. The court did not decide whether Appellants meet the \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d or \u201ctraceability\u201d prongs because it determined that they are not within the zone of interests that either the FAIR or 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462 are designed to protect. <em>Id. </em>at 597-600. The court concluded that Appellants \u201ccannot establish standing under the APA and therefore are not \u2018interested parties\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 1491(b)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 600. The court therefore granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss Appellants\u2019 complaint for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Appellants appeal the dismissal to this \u2022 court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">\u201cWhether a party has standing to sue is a question that this court reviews <em>de novo.\u201d Prima Tek II, L.L.C. v. A-Roo Co., </em>222 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed.Cir.2000). The precise question presented by this appeal, whether federal employees or their union representatives have standing to challenge an executive agency cost comparison decision in the Court of Federal Claims, is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>Our analysis begins with the language of the statute on which the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims is based:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">(b)(1) Both the Unites [sic] States Court of Federal Claims and the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement. Both the United States Court of Federal Claims and the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to entertain such an action without regard to whether suit is instituted before or after the contract is awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">(2) To afford relief in such an action, the courts may award any relief that the court considers proper, including declaratory and injunctive relief except that any monetary relief shall be limited to bid preparation and proposal costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">(3) In exercising jurisdiction under this subsection, the courts shall give due regard to the interests of national defense and national security and the need for expeditious resolution of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">(4) In any action under this subsection, the courts shall review the agency\u2019s decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b). As recognized by the parties and by the Court of Federal Claims, the statute confers standing on \u201can interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency,\u201d but does not further define who is encompassed by the term \u201cinterested party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Appellants argue that the term should be construed according, to its ordinary dictionary definition, and that they are \u201cinterested parties\u201d because they sfand to lose their jobs if the depot services are contracted out to EG&amp;G. Alternatively, Appellants argue that \u201cinterested party\u201d should be interpreted as encompassing parties who satisfy the APA requirements for standing, and that they satisfy those requirements because they fall within the zone of interests protected by OMB A-76 and the FAIR.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">The government argues that \u201cinterested party\u201d should be construed in accordance with a related statute, the Competition in Contracting Act (\u201cCICA\u201d), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551-56. The CICA governs the bid protest jurisdiction of the General Accounting Office (\u201cGAO\u201d), and defines the term \u201cinterested party\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">The term \u201cinterested party\u201d, with respect to a contract or a solicitation or other request for offers .... means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(2) (Supp. IV1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">Because the plain language of the statute does not resolve this issue, we look to the legislative history of \u00a7 1491(b)(1) for an indication of congressional intent. <em>See, e.g., Toibb v. Radloff, </em>501 U.S. 157, 162, 111 S.Ct. 2197, 115 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991). The statute was enacted as part of the Administrative Disputes Resolution Act of 1996 (\u201cADRA\u201d), P.L. No. 104-320, 110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>Stat. 3870 (1996). Senator Cohen, who offered the bid protest provision at issue as an amendment to the pending ADRA legislation, described the provision as \u201cexpand[ing] the bid protest jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d 142 Cong. Rec. S11848 (daily ed. Sept. 30, 1996) (statement of Sen. Cohen). He explained that, without the legislation, the court only had jurisdiction over pre-award bid protests and that the bill would give the court \u201cboth pre and post-award jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He noted that <em>Scanwell </em>\u201cheld that a contractor can challenge a Federal contract award in Federal district court under the [APA],\u201d and described problems he saw with the concurrent jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims and district courts over bid protests. <em>Id. </em>He explained that the bid protest provision included a sunset clause which would repeal the \u201cdistrict courts\u2019 <em>Scanwell </em>jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Senator Levin, who, together with Senator Grassley, had introduced the ADRA legislation, commented on the problems of concurrent jurisdiction over bid protests, and remarked that the Acquisition Law Advisory Panel had recommended that there should be only one forum for bid protests. <em>Id. </em>at S11849 (statement of Sen. Levin). He described the bid protest provision of the ADRA as \u201cconsolidat[ing] the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims and the district courts,\u201d such that before the sunset provision took effect, \u201c[e]ach court system would exercise jurisdiction over the full range of bid protest cases previously subject to review in either system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Then, after the sunset provision took effect, \u201cthe jurisdiction of the district courts would terminate, and the Court of Federal Claims would exercise exclusive judicial jurisdiction over procurement protests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at SI1849-50. <em>See also </em>H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-841, at 10 (1996) (\u201cIt is the intention ... to give the Court of Federal Claims exclusive jurisdiction over the full range of procurement protest cases previously subject to review in the federal district courts and the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">This legislative history indicates that Congress intended to confer on the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction previously exercised only by district courts under <em>Scanwell. </em>The question is what Congress meant when it referred to <em>\u201cScanwell </em>jurisdiction.\u201d As discussed above, prior to the ADRA, the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over only pre-award protests, while, under <em>Scanwell, </em>the district courts had jurisdiction over post-award protests. The ADRA gave the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over post-award protests. Thus, the ADRA clearly conferred the Court of Federal Claims with <em>\u201cScanwell </em>jurisdiction\u201d inasmuch as it permitted the Court of Federal Claims to hear post-award protests. Moreover, while pre-ADRA protests brought in the Court of Federal Claims were governed by a narrow standard of review, <em>see Keco Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>203 Ct.Cl. 566, 492 F.2d 1200, 1203-04 (1974), the ADRA expressly made the APA standard of review applicable to all bid protest actions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4). <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324, 1331-33 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The issue presented by this appeal, however, is whether Congress intended to expand the class of parties who can bring bid protest actions in the Court of Federal Claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the one hand, Congress could have intended the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>Federal Claims\u2019 <em>\u201cScanwell </em>jurisdiction\u201d to encompass complaints brought by disappointed bidders only. The vast majority of cases brought pursuant to <em>Scanwell </em>were brought by disappointed bidders. <em>Scan-well </em>itself involved a disappointed bidder, and the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has characterized <em>Scanwell </em>as holding \u201cthat a disappointed bidder on a government contract was a person aggrieved under the APA and had standing to seek a limited review of the contract award.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Eng\u2019g Co. v. Richardson, </em>512 F.2d 573, 579 (D.C.Cir.1975). <em>See also Free Air Corp. v. FCC, </em>130 F.3d 447, 450 (D.C.Cir.1997) (describing <em>Scanwell </em>and other cases as holding that \u201csufficiently viable runners-up in a procurement process have standing to allege that an illegality in the process caused the contract to go to someone else\u201d). This court also has described <em>Scanwell </em>standing narrowly. <em>Southfork Sys., Inc. v. United States, </em>141 F.3d 1124 (Fed.Cir.1998) (\u201cThe essence of \u2018the <em>Scan-well </em>doctrine,\u2019 which Congress intended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(3) to make applicable to the Claims Court, is that an unsuccessful bidder has standing to challenge a proposed contract award____\u201d). Thus, in conferring the Court of Federal Claims with <em>\u201cScanwell </em>jurisdiction,\u201d Congress may have intended the court to exercise jurisdiction over disputes brought by disappointed bidders only.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On the other hand, because <em>Scanwell </em>itself is based on the APA, Congress could have intended to give the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over any contract dispute that could be brought under the APA. Because the language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 is quite broad,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> parties other than actual or prospective bidders might be able to bring suit. <em>See, e.g., Ballerina Pen Co. v. Kun-zig, </em>433 F.2d 1204 (D.C.Cir.1970) (determining that an incumbent contractor had standing to challenge an agency\u2019s award of a contract to the National Industries for the Blind under the APA even though it was not a disappointed bidder because the agency had not awarded the contract through the traditional bid system).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">In resolving this issue, we are guided by the principle that waivers of sovereign immunity, such as that set forth in \u00a7 1491(b)(1), are to be construed narrowly. <em>See, e.g., McMahon v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 25, 27, 72 S.Ct. 17, 96 L.Ed. 26 (1951) (\u201c[Statutes which waive immunity of the United States from suit are to be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign.\u201d). With that principle in mind, we interpret the references in the legislative history to the <em>\u201cScanwell </em>jurisdiction\u201d of the district courts as references to the district courts% jurisdiction over bid protest cases brought under the APA by disappointed bidders, like the plaintiff in <em>Scanwell. </em>This interpretation is supported by the legislative history of the ADRA, which describes <em>Scanwell </em>as permitting \u201ca <em>contractor </em>to challenge a Federal contract award.\u201d 142 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>Cong. Rec. S11848 (statement of Sen. Cohen) (emphasis added). It also is supported by the narrow reading courts have given standing under <em>Scanwell, </em>as discussed above. When construed in this manner, the legislative history of \u00a7 1491(b)(1) suggests that Congress intended standing under the statute to be limited to disappointed bidders.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The language chosen by Congress, while not unambiguous, supports this construction. When defining standing under \u00a7 1491(b)(1), Congress did not use the broad language of the APA, \u201c[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. In addition, Congress did not explicitly invoke the APA standing requirements, although it did explicitly invoke the APA standard of review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4) (\u201cIn any action under this subsection, the courts shall review the agency\u2019s decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5.\u201d). We therefore are not convinced that Congress, when using the term \u201cinterested party\u201d to define those who can bring suit under \u00a7 1491(b)(1), intended to confer standing on anyone who might have standing under the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The term Congress did choose to define standing under \u00a7 1491(b), \u201cinterested party,\u201d is a term that is used in another statute that applies to government contract disputes, the CICA. As set forth above, the CICA explicitly defines that term as \u201can actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.\u201d 81 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(2). Section 3551, by its own terms, applies only to contract disputes decided by the Comptroller General of the GAO pursuant to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551-56. However, the fact that Congress used the same term in \u00a7 1491(b) as it did in the CICA suggests that Congress intended the same standing requirements that apply to protests brought under the CICA to apply to actions brought under \u00a7 1491(b)(1). We therefore construe the term \u201cinterested party\u201d in \u00a7 1491(b)(1) in accordance with the CICA, and hold that standing under \u00a7 1491(b)(1) is limited to actual or prospective bidders or offerors whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract. This construction is consistent with the legislative history of \u00a7 1491(b)(1), which, as discussed above, indicates that Congress intended to extend the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims to include post-award bid protest cases brought under the APA by disappointed bidders, such as the plaintiff in <em>Scanwell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Because Appellants here are not actual or prospective bidders or offerors, they do not have standing to challenge the DLA\u2019s cost comparison analysis or its decision to award the depot services contract to EG&amp;G.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing Appellants\u2019 claim for lack of standing is</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\">.

In deciding that issue, we stated that we were not required to \"resolve whether the 1996 amendments [to the statute] have liberalized the standing requirements by adopting the APA standard,\u201d because we determined that the bidder had \"an economic interest\u201d in the contract award and, therefore, satisfied even \"the more stringent ... standard\u201d of the CICA. <em>Id. </em>at 1335. <em>Impresa </em>therefore did not resolve the question before us today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b801-11\">.
