J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-bL\">The appellant was arrested without a warrant between 1:15 and 1:30 a.m. (rep.tr. p. 46:20-22) for violation of Vehicle Code section 23102, driving under the influence of alcoholic liquor, a misdemeanor. At 2:35 a.m. she had been partially booked at Lincoln Heights jail but refused to be fingerprinted or photographed until she could talk to her attorney. He arrived at 2:45 a.m. but the police refused to let him talk to her on the ground that the booking had not been completed. She was confined in an isolation cell until the police relayed to her a message from her attorney advising her to be fingerprinted and photographed. Eventually, after much delay, she said she did not wish to see her attorney. She was not released until 5:30 a.m. Neither the defendant nor her attorney requested an opportunity to have a blood test taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The refusal of the police to let appellant\u2019s attorney talk to her until she was fingerprinted and photographed was a violation of Pen. Code section 825 which provides in part: \u201cAfter such arrest, any attorney at law entitled to practice in the courts of record of California, may, at the request of the prisoner or any relative of such prisoner, visit the person so arrested. Any officer having charge of the prisoner so arrested who willfully refuses or neglects to allow such attorney to visit a prisoner is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d Nothing is said in the section about the attorney having to wait until the booking is finished. That the police were wrong is clear from <em>People </em>v. <em>Stroble </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 615 [226 P.2d 330] affirmed 343 U.S. 181 [72 S.Ct. 599, 96 L.Ed. 872], where an attorney was denied the right to see his client from 1:43 to 9:30 p.m. while the client was being questioned by the district attorney. However, that is not the whole story. In the <em>Stroble </em>case our Supreme Court said (p. 617): \u201cIt is true, as defendant points out, that the record discloses that representatives of the People, prior to the trial, were guilty of flagrant misconduct. Such misconduct, however reprehensible, does not appear, under the extraordinary circumstances of this case, to have materially affected the regularity of defendant\u2019s trial and conviction; and it is not the function of this court to reverse a judgment solely as a rebuke to \u2018law enforcement\u2019 officers for their own lawless acts, and improper administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 881\">*Supp. 881</page-number>tion of law, independent of the trial which resulted in that judgment. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The fact that neither the defendant nor her attorney made any request to have a doctor or other competent person come to the jail to give the defendant a blood test brings this case within <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 633 [24 Cal.Rptr. 633] where the court said, pp. 636-637: \u201cFurthermore, it does not appear that appellant suffered any prejudice by the delay in getting out of jail <em>re </em>procuring evidence to establish his sobriety for all that he needed to do was to call his own doctor and have him come to the jail to examine him. While it may be true that it would have been more convenient for appellant to go out on bail to seek a physician, mere convenience is not the test. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Newbern, </em>55 Cal.2d 508 [11 Cal.Rptr. 551, 360 P.2d 47], is misplaced for in that case the court pointed out (p. 513) that \u2018a proper and timely request\u2019 to call his physician was made. Here, appellant under the facts as disclosed by the petition, never requested that a physician be called to administer a blood alcohol test. Under these circumstances, it can hardly be said that appellant was denied a reasonable opportunity to obtain evidence for his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">This <em>Evans </em>case is significant on one other point involved here. At p. 636 the court said: \u201cThe appellant\u2019s condition of inebriation allowed the officer discretion in refusing to release appellant immediately on bail if, in his official capacity, to do so would endanger the appellant or society (cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 849).  An intoxicated person need not be released on bail <em>eo instante (McClanahan </em>v. State, 232 Ind. 567 [112 N.E.2d 575, 577]; <em>Sheffield </em>v. <em>Reece, </em>201 Miss. 133 [28 So.2d 745, 746]).\u201d  In view of the foregoing the trial court was right in deciding this case on the ground that no prejudice is shown in the denial of appellant\u2019s right to see her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Huls, J., and Smith, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied June 6, 1963, and the following opinion was then rendered:</p>\n<author id=\"b905-12\">THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"Akl\">The petition of appellant for a rehearing after judgment of this court on appeal or, in the alternative, petition for certification of cause to the District Court of Appeal, in the above entitled case, having been filed and having been duly considered,</p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 882\">*Supp. 882</page-number>Said petitions are hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Memo.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">There is a vast difference between a request to the police for a doctor and a desire, unexpressed to the police, to have one. Police departments have no duty to act on the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Huls, Acting P. J., and Smith, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
