The adulteries relied on were alleged to have been committed with an unknown man while defendant was living apart from complainant, and to prove the charge complainant relied on the testimony of detectives, who, although claiming to have seen defendant\u2019s alleged paramour on several occasions, were unable to identify or trace him. For defendant was offered, testimony of neighbors, people of repute, who would have been likely to have seen the occurrences, had they occurred, who negatived the probability of such occurrences. It also appeared that an employee of the Commonwealth Edison Company lived in the apartment below that of defendant, and was in the habit of going in and out of the building at all hours of the night. This witness testified that he did not see the man who according to the detectives was in the habit of visiting defendant.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b650-7\" pgmap=\"650\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b650-8\" pgmap=\"650\">1.
