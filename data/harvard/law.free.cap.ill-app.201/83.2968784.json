Bailment, \u00a7 26<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction on measure of damages for negligent injury to personal property erroneous. In an action by the owner of a barge to recover damages for injury to it, alleged to be due to negligence in unloading it and in failing to pump water from it by the consignee of a shipment of crushed rock, an instruction that the measure of damages, if the jury should find for plaintiff, was the difference between the fair cash value of the barge before and after the alleged injury, held erroneous where it appeared that the barge had been repaired.</headnotes><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AUg\" pgmap=\"126\">The only evidence concerning the\" measure of damages was testimony of the value of the barge when it was delivered to defendant and its value after it was unloaded; an objection to this evidence as not the proper measure of damages was overruled. The court instructed th\u00e9 jury that the measure of damages, if the jury should find for plaintiff, was the difference between the fair cash value of the barge before and after the alleged injury. Error was assigned on the admission of evidence on the measure of damages and the instruction on that question. The evidence shows that the barge had been repaired. Plaintiff\u2019s fourth instruction informed the jury that where personal property is placed in the hands of a bailee in good condition and is returned in a damaged condition, then the law presumes that the injury was due to the negligence of the bailee, and the owner would be entitled to recover unless the bailee has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it exercised such care as was reasonably necessary to care for the property.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-5\" pgmap=\"126\">L.

Bailment, \u00a7 28*\u2014what is measure of damages for injury to personal property. The correct measure of damages for an injury to personal property, where the same can be repaired, is the necessary cost of making the repairs and the value of the use of such property while the owner is necessarily deprived of it, while it is undergoing repair.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b127-5\" pgmap=\"127\">3.
