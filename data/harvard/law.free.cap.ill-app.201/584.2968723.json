The contract sued on was ended by efflux of time, and the amount of the judgment was admitted to be due to plaintiff thereon, but defendant sought to recoup on the ground of the unseaworthy boats furnished by plaintiff, one of which sank in the Chicago Biver, defendant alleging loss thereby of garbage boxes, as well as the expense of removing the obstruction.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b626-10\" pgmap=\"626\">Samuel A.

In an action to recover on a contract between an individual and a municipality for the disposition of garbage by means of water transportation, where it is admitted that a certain sum is due plaintiff on the contract, defendant cannot recoup on the ground that the sinking of an unseaworthy boat caused an obstruction whose removal caused defendant expense, where it appears that the sinking took place in a navigable river, since defendant could not have been compelled to remove the obstruction, and cannot enforce a claim against plaintiff for expense incurred in voluntarily performing a duty not cast upon it by law.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
