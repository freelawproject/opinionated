From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\" pgmap=\"319\">Plaintiff boarded a car of defendant at Peoria, Illinois, to be conveyed to Mackinaw. The car was well filled. Some of the witnesses said there were no vacant seats and others that there were. Plaintiff said she saw none. After the car had gone a short distance it came to a stop, and the evidence tended to show that when it started again it did so with a jerk, although there was quite a sharp conflict in the evidence on that point. Whatever the facts were as to the suddenness with which the ear was started, plaintiff was jerked, was thrown, or fell down to the floor of the car. There was a conflict in the evidence in regard to whether she came to a sitting posture or was prostrate upon the floor. She was assisted to arise and accepted a proffered seat and continued her journey to her home town, where she alighted from the car and walked to her home, about four blocks. The next day she went to church and Sunday school, where she says her neck and hips hurt her severely. From there she went to a doctor\u2019s office and was advised to put a hot water bottle on her hips and hot applications on her neck, which she did with good results, but she claimed that she suffered considerable pain as well as other ill results of the fall for several weeks. The extent of her injuries was also seriously contested. She brought this suit later, charging in the first count of her declaration that defendant negligently managed and operated its car and particularly that it negligently and violently started its car; and in the second count, that the car was crowded with passengers and that while she was attempting to get a seat defendant violently, carelessly and negligently started its car suddenly and -with great force and threw her down. She secured a verdict and judgment for $3,375.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-5\" pgmap=\"319\">Prettyman, Velde &amp; Prettyman and George W.

Negligence, \u00a7 204*\u2014when direction of verdict erroneous. Where a count in a declaration in an action for personal injuries limits the denial of contributory negligence to the instant of the injury, an instruction directing a verdict for the plaintiff on proof of the allegations in such count by a preponderance of the evidence is erroneous, as a plaintiff must negative contributory negligence in getting into the position in which he was when injured.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b320-9\" pgmap=\"320\">4. Negligence, \u00a7 208*\u2014when instruction ignoring contributory negligence erroneous.

Negligence, \u00a7 228*\u2014when instruction on due care erroneous.

Evidence, \u00a7 437<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when sufficient basis shown for hypothetical question. In an action for personal injuries, evidence that the plaintiff suffered from pain in the hips, held sufficient on which to base a hypothetical question in which \u201cpain in the buttocks\" was mentioned as an element of damage.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b321-6\" pgmap=\"321\">9. Evidence, \u00a7 436*\u2014what facts may be assumed in hypothetical question. In an action for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff while traveling on the defendant\u2019s railway train, an objection to a hypothetical question put to an expert witness for the plaintiff on cross-examination, assuming that the injury was caused by an automobile accident, concerning which there was nothing in the evidence, but which examining counsel advised the court they expected to prove, held improperly overruled, as in such case any fact which in the sound discretion of the court is pertinent to the inquiry, whether the same has been testified to or not, may be assumed in a hypothetical question to test the accuracy, learning or skill of the witness. \u2022</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b321-7\" pgmap=\"321\">10.
