In an action to recover for the death of a boy fourteen years of age, by reason of injuries sustained by being run over by a heavy truck, evidence examined and held to show that the driver of the truck was not negligent.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-3\" pgmap=\"595\">There have been three trials of this cause, in two of which the jury disagreed. Four disinterested eyewitnesses testified substantially that the loaded truck was going south on Union avenue at a moderate rate of speed; that it was making considerable noise; that deceased was walking south on Union avenue on the west sidewalk between 33rd and 34th streets; that as the truck approached, the boy ran out in the street in a southeasterly direction, and for about ten feet ran alongside the truck behind the front wheels, then caught hold of it near its center on the right side and hung there a short time, and then, seeming to lose his hold, fell down in front of the rear wheel, which passed over him. Testimony of these witnesses was unanimous that the front part of the truck had passed deceased when he left the curb, and that he was at no time in front of the front wheels of the truck after he got out in the street, and that the point where he grabbed hold of the truck was behind the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-4\" pgmap=\"595\">The chauffeur gave substantially similar testimony. There was no testimony in direct conflict with that adduced by defendant, though three witnesses gave testimony from which it was sought to be inferred that deceased was in front of the truck when struck.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-5\" pgmap=\"595\">Miller, Gorham &amp; Wales, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-6\" pgmap=\"595\">Charles W.
