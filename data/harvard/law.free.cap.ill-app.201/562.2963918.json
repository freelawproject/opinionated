From a judgment for plaintiff of $7,500, defendant appeals. This case has been tried five times, and has been heard twice in this court (154 Ill. App. 537; 191 Ill. App. 372). The verdict of the jury resulting in the judgment appealed from was for $15,000, which by remittitur was reduced to $7,500. The facts are fully stated in the opinion in 154 Ill. App. 557, with the exception of an opinion by the late Dr. John B. Murphy, negativing any causal connection between the accident and a later diseased condition of plaintiff\u2019s ovaries, necessitating the performance of an operation known as ovariotomy.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-11\" pgmap=\"604\">Samuel A.
