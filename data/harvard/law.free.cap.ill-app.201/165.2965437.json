It .is unnecessary to set out in a petition by an administrator for leave to sell real estate to pay debts an estimate of the amount of just claims to be presented, where all claims not filed are barred because more than one year has expired between the date of the granting of letters of administration and the filing of the petition.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-12\" pgmap=\"208\">3.

Executors and administrators, \u00a7 41<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014how appointment of administrator may be attacked. The granting of letters of administration to a person is conclusive of his authority as administrator until set aside or annulled in a direct proceeding, and it consequently cannot be attacked in a proceeding by the administrator to sell real estate to pay debts, as such latter proceeding is collateral to that for the appointment of an administrator.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b209-5\" pgmap=\"209\">7. Executors and administrators\u2014when nonresidents properly served by publication of notice and mailing of notices. Nonresident parties to a proceeding by an administrator to obtain leave to sell real estate to pay debts who are duly served by publication and the mailing of notices in conformity with statute are properly served, and it is unnecessary that the known attorneys of such parties be notified of such proceeding.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b209-6\" pgmap=\"209\">8. Executors and administrators, \u00a7 426*\u2014when decree in proceeding by administrator to obtain leave to sell land to pay debts sufficient. A decree in a proceeding by an administrator to obtain leave to sell real estate to pay debts which was in the language of the statute, held not open to objection because it found that the deceased died \u201chaving claim or title to the premises sought to be sold,\u201d and did not find the actual title to the lands he died seized of.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
