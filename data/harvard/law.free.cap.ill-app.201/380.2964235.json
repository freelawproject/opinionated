From a judgment for plaintiffs, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-9\" pgmap=\"422\">The evidence showed that on May 1, 1905, the defendant leased the described premises for the term of five years from Emma B. and William II. Brown at a rental of $145 per month, payable monthly in advance on the first day of each month. The lease contained a provision for an extension for a like term, upon the same terms and conditions, upon a written notice being-given by the lessee on or before March 1, 1910.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-10\" pgmap=\"422\">On March 3, 1910, an extension of the lease for five years from May 1, 1910, was executed by the parties. There was no further extension of the lease. On June 18, 1914, William H. Brown, who had become sole owner of the premises, made a lease of the premises to plaintiffs at $225 per month, to begin May 1, 1915, the day that the extension of defendant\u2019s lease expired.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-11\" pgmap=\"422(68) 423(37)\">Emma Brown was the mother of William II. Brown. She died June 11, 1914. The contention of defendant was that in a conversation with him, Mrs. Brown told him that he might continue in possession of the premises after the expiration of his extension, as long as she lived, and that the suit should have been brought in the name of William H. Brown, the present owner, and not by his lessees. The court sustained an objection to the offer made by defendant to prove the conversation between Mrs. Brown and himself, waiving the requirement of notice in writing by the lessee.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b423-8\" pgmap=\"423\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b423-9\" pgmap=\"423\">1.
