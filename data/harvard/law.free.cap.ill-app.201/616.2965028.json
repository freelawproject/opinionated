Weydert, petitioner, against the City of Chicago, William Hale Thompson, mayor, Thomas O\u2019Connor, fire marshal, and Percy B. Coffin, Charles E. Frazier and Joseph P. Geary, civil service commissioners, respondents, and a similar petition by Michael Moon, petitioner, against the same respondents, both in the Circuit Court of Cook county, both praying to be reinstated in the office of captain in the fire department of the respondent city. From judgments awarding the writ in each case as prayed, respondents appeal.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-10\" pgmap=\"658\">The two causes were consolidated for hearing on one set of briefs on motion of respondents.

Mandamus, \u00a7 139<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what prayers for relief cannot he combined in petition. A petition for mandamus praying for dual relief, such as the restoration of a member of the fire department of a city and for an award of salary, is obnoxious to a general demurrer, since prayers for such relief cannot be combined in such a petition.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b659-7\" pgmap=\"659\">2. Civil service, \u00a7 30*\u2014what does not give discharged employee additional claim to reinstatement. In a petition for mandamus by a former captain in the fire department of a city, where it appears that after being retired for disability petitioner was restored t\u00f3 his rank and afterwards discharged, the fact that petitioner was a pensioner while suffering the disability contracted in the service gives him no additional claim to reinstatement either in office or on the pension roll after discharge.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b659-8\" pgmap=\"659\">3. Civil service, \u00a7 10*\u2014what employees may he discharged without trial. Captains of the fire department of a city who are not civil service employees may be discharged at any time without charges or a trial before the Civil Service Board.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b659-9\" pgmap=\"659\">4. Civil service, \u00a7 27*\u2014when petition for mandamus for reinstatement insufficient. A petition for mandamus seeking reinstatement in office which fails to plead the ordinance creating the office is obnoxious to demurrer, since unless it is first established that the office sought, exists either by statute or ordinance, the party seeking it has no standing in a court of law.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b659-3\" pgmap=\"659\">Bauer-&amp; Donoghue, for appellees.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b659-10\" pgmap=\"659\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
