Assault and battery, \u00a7 22<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014When exemplary damages authorized. When an assault and battery is made wantonly and wilfully, or maliciously, or with undue violence, exemplary damages are authorized.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b221-5\" pgmap=\"221\">5. Assault and battery, \u00a7 1*\u2014when malice is inferred. Malice is inferred where an assault and battery is committed with a reckless disregard of the rights of the person assaulted.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b221-6\" pgmap=\"221\">6. Assault and battery, \u00a7 15*\u2014when justification for assault question for jury. In an action for assault and battery upon one attempting to enter a field of the defendant, the question whether the defendant\u2019s being scratched by barbed wire while the plaintiff was attempting' to open a gate amounted to an assault upon the defendant justifying the latter\u2019s assault, held for the jury.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b221-7\" pgmap=\"221\">7. Assault and battery, \u00a7 22*\u2014when evidence of financial resources of defendant admissible. Where the defendant, in an action for assault and battery, struck the plaintiff on the head with a pitch fork while he was attempting to enter a field which he had leased from the defendant, evidence held to tend to show wantonness and maliciousness on the part of the defendant, so as to render the admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s financial resources proper on the question of exemplary damages.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A8B\" pgmap=\"221\">8. Instructions, \u00a7 159*\u2014when instruction not erroneous.

Instructions, \u00a7 110*\u2014when erroneous as inapplicable to pleadings. An instruction permitting a recovery for the amount of a physician\u2019s bill, which the plaintiff had not paid but which he had become liable for, is erroneous where the declaration contains no allegation that the plaintiff became liable for any such damages.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b221-13\" pgmap=\"221\">10. Damages, \u00a7 190*\u2014when must be proved by direct and positive evidence.

Error in an instruction stating that damages may be allowed for the amount of a doctor\u2019s bill incurred by the plaintiff but not paid, there being no allegation in the complaint covering such item, may be cured by ordering a remittitur of such amount, where it is definitely shown by the evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b222-4\" pgmap=\"222\">13. Assault and battery, \u00a7 17<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction as to insufficiency of evidence to support plea of justification proper. In an action for assault and battery, an instruction that there was no evidence to support the defendant\u2019s plea of justification on the ground that the plaintiff was unlawfully attempting to enter the defendant\u2019s field, held proper on the evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b222-5\" pgmap=\"222\">14. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1560*\u2014when refusal of instructions harmless error. Where a party litigant offers an unreasonable number of instructions, judgment will not be reversed for an error in refusing to give some of them if, upon consideration of those given, it can be seen that the jury were fully informed as to the law of the case.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b222-6\" pgmap=\"222\">15. Assault and battery, \u00a7 13*\u2014when evidence of prior threats inadmissible.
