Railroads\u2014when liable for personal injuries resulting from frightening of horses. A railroad is responsible for personal injuries caused by the frightening of horses by unnecessary noises made in the negligent and reckless running of trains, or when such noises are made in a wanton, wilful or malicious manner in disregard of a traveler\u2019s right on the highway.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AbY\" pgmap=\"122\">3.

In an action for personal injuries alleged to have resulted from the plaintiff\u2019s horse becoming frightened by steam blown from a railroad locomotive, an objection to a question, addressed to an expert witness, as to whether, in his experience, the amount of steam, which was shown by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony to have been blown out was any more than ordinarily necessary in the operation of trains, where it becomes necessary to blow off steam frequently, held properly sustained, since it could not be known on what the answer of the witness would be based, as that would depend on how much of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence he had heard and his recollection and construction thereof.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-3\" pgmap=\"122\">Thomas J.

Trial, \u00a7 91<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when general objection to question put to witness insufficient. In an action for personal injuries, on the issue as to whether steam had been negligently blown off from the defendant\u2019s engine at a certain time and place, a general objection to questions put to the engineer as to the condition of the pipes and engine with reference to the necessity of blowing off steam in order to successfully operate the engine, and as to his recollection with respect to the condition of the engine for proper and safe use at the time in question, and as to the quality of the water taken into the engine shortly prior thereto, held improperly sustained.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b123-5\" pgmap=\"123\">6.
