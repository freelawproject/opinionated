From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.,</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-8\" pgmap=\"563\">August 24, 1907, plaintiff, then a young woman, in company with a young man visited the \u201cWhite City,\u201d an amusement park located in Chicago, for an evening\u2019s entertainment. In the park there was a contrivance known as the \u201cWhizz,\u201d which consisted principally of a chute starting from a height of about twenty-two feet and descending in curves and bumps to the ground, where the patron landed on a hair mattress covered with heavy duck canvas. The mattress was inclosed by frames to which it was securely fastened. A person desiring to slide down the chute was admitted through a gate, upon the payment of a fee. Plaintiff, after watching for some time several persons coming down the chute and landing on the mattress, paid the admission fee, slid down the chute, and as she landed on the mattress her left ankle was severely sprained. The negligence charged in the second count was that the covering of the mattress was torn, ripped, loose, unfastened, and dangerous and unsuitable.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-9\" pgmap=\"563\">Brickwood &amp; Brickwood and Thornton &amp; Chahcellor, for appellant.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-4\" pgmap=\"564\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-5\" pgmap=\"564\">1. Negligence, \u00a7 187<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to show that appliance in amusement park; is defective. In an action for injuries sustained by one sliding down an amusement device known as a \u201cWhizz,\u201d consisting of an inclined chute at the bottom of which was a mattress designed to receive patrons, evidence held to justify a finding that the covering of the mattress was torn and that the plaintiff\u2019s foot was caught therein and her ankle sprained.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-6\" pgmap=\"564\">2. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1699*\u2014when error in refusal to direct verdict for defendant waived. WThere, at the close of all the evidence introduced in an action for negligence, the defendant moved for a directed verdict of not guilty but did not renew a motion made at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case to find the defendant not guilty on a particular count, held that the failure to renew the motion waived any error in refusing to grant it.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-7\" pgmap=\"564\">3. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1520*\u2014when refusal of court to direct verdict on one count is harmless error. Where there is evidence sufficient to sustain a verdict for the plaintiff on one count of a declaration, the refusal of the court to direct a verdict for the defendant on another count is harmless, even though erroneous.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-8\" pgmap=\"564\">4. Evidence, \u00a7 171*\u2014when admissions against interest admissible. In an action for personal injuries, admissions against interest of the plaintiff made after the accident are admissible.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-9\" pgmap=\"564\">5. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1491*\u2014when exclusion of admissions of party harmless error. Where, in a personal injury action, a witness for the defendant was permitted without objection to testify as to what the plaintiff said after the accident, and the record failed to show that the defendant offered to prove any further admissions by the plaintiff, held that the defendant could not complain of a prior ruling excluding testimony as to the plaintiff\u2019s admission.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-10\" pgmap=\"564(69) 565(32)\">6. Negligence, \u00a7 205*\u2014when instruction not insufficient. An instruction in a personal injury action to the effect that the plaintiff was not bound to prove her case beyond a reasonable doubt but only by a preponderance of the evidence, that if the evidence bearing upon the case preponderated in her favor, although but slightly, it would be sufficient for the jury to find in her favor, held not open to the objection that the plaintiff\u2019s case was not defined, that the jury were left to determine what evidence bore upon it and that it left out altogether the defendant\u2019s case. .</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ABO\" pgmap=\"564\">Edward J.

An instruction in a personal injury action which told the jury that if they believed from the evidence that the plaintiff had proven the allegation of certain counts of the declaration by a preponderance of the evidence, and that she had suffered and sustained injuries in the manner charged in such counts and that she was in the exercise of ordinary care and free from negligence, they should find the defendant guilty, held not open to the objection that the jury were left to determine what the allegations of such counts were.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b565-5\" pgmap=\"565\">8. Negligence, \u00a7 88*\u2014when doctrine of assumed risk inapplicable.
