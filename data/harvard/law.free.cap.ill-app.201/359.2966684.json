Gay, defendant, to recover for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff while riding in a taxicab belonging to the defendant. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-9\" pgmap=\"401(218) 402(17)\">Defendant insisted that the chauffeur of the taxicab was not acting within the scope of his employment and on his master\u2019s business at the time of the accident. He admitted that Small was employed by the week to run the machine in the nighttime, and that it was his duty to go where the business required. He also admitted that when he left on a trip he authorized Small to go ahead with the business, and that while his hours were from two o\u2019clock in the afternoon to two o\u2019clock in the morning, he some nights ran until three and at times up to four, o\u2019clock in the morning, and that he would accept what was earned. The taxicab office was in the defendant\u2019s hotel and whoever answered the telephone calls in the hotel had authority to take the call. Plaintiff, by telephone from Lyons, called the hotel for the taxicab about 2 a. m. and the taxicab appeared to have been sent in response to the call. Small stated he went with the machine to Lyons for a ride without being called by telephone, and that he was going to keep the fare collected and not pay it to defendant. Small employed a lawyer to prosecute a claim against the defendant for injuries he sustained at the time of the accident, and received one hundred dollars from the hands of his attorney.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-7\" pgmap=\"402\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-8\" pgmap=\"402\">1.
