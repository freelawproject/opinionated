B. Dennis, plaintiff, against Charles B. Jones, Dudley G. Hayes, and George Hoffman, defendants, on a joint promissory note of the defendants. From a judgment against him, the other defendants not having been served, Charles B. Jones appeals.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-10\" pgmap=\"145(100) 146(76)\">The plaintiff brought suit as indorsee of the payee for accrued interest. After the introduction of the note in evidence by plaintiff, appellant called plaintiff as a witness. He testified that he did not know the makers but that he bought the note after his bankers had investigated them; that he did not ask the payee what it was given for but that the payee told him it was given for some of his mausoleum interests; that he paid $1,500 in cash and transferred $3,000 of stock at 50 cents on the dollar for the note on July 16, 1913. One of the joint makers of the note testified that in a conversation with plaintiff a few weeks before the trial, plaintiff told him that he held the note as collateral security for a loan. Appellant introduced in evidence a contract between the payee and the appellant under which the payee agreed to procure certain mausoleum rights for a corporation to be organized, and which was the consideration for the note sued upon, and other notes.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b146-8\" pgmap=\"146\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b146-9\" pgmap=\"146\">1. Pleading, \u00a7 432<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when data of note need not be proved as alleged. Where, in an action for interest on. a promissory note, the declaration correctly alleged the date on which such interest accrued, held that the date of the note, laid under a videlicet, need not be proved as alleged.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b146-10\" pgmap=\"146\">2. Bills and notes, \u00a7 56*\u2014when failure to perform contract does not constitute failure of consideration for note. Failure of the payee of a note to perform a contract, the promise to perform which was alleged by one of the makers to have been the consideration for which the note was made, held not a defense to an action thereon, against a maker, by a holder in good faith before maturity, where it was not alleged that the contract had been canceled'or attempted to be canceled.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b146-11\" pgmap=\"146\">3. Bills and notes, \u00a7 448*\u2014when evidence sufficient to show that plaintiff is an indorsee in good faith before maturity.

In an action by an indorsee before maturity of a negotiable promissory note against a maker thereof held that though the plaintiff held the note merely as collateral security for a loan made to the payee, that would not be a defense unless the plaintiff knew of or had notice of such facts as would put a reasonably prudent man on inquiry concerning defenses to the note.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-5\" pgmap=\"146\">Andrews &amp; Real and Archibald Cattell, for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-6\" pgmap=\"146\">John B.
