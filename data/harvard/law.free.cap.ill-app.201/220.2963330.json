From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-9\" pgmap=\"262\">The plaintiff was a miner in the employ of defendant. At the time in question he was acting as a helper to a timberman, whose duty it was to place timbers in the mines to support the roof where necessary. At a certain place in the mine some workmen discovered what they considered a dangerous place in the roof and reported it to the mine boss. When plaintiff next went into the mine, the night boss directed him and the timberman with whom he was working to go to the place in question and \u201ctimber\u201d it. They went to the place directed. Before they began to work they looked for, but found no examiner\u2019s mark to indicate a dangerous condition. They then pulled down some loose rock, and prepared to timber the roof. While they were there working, some loose rock and slate fell upon plaintiff, and he was painfully injured. His hip was dislocated, his head, shoulder, side and knee were bruised, and he was injured internally. _ He was laid up for three months.- Three years later, at the time of the trial, he was still suffering from his injuries.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-10\" pgmap=\"262\">W.
