In order to maintain a writ of error to review a judgment or decree, the plaintiff in error must be either a party to the record, or sustain some mutual or successive relationship to the subject-matter of the litigation or the parties, out of which arises the right, duty or privilege to have the judgment reviewed, or he must have some direct or collateral interest injuriously affected by the judgment upon which to rest a right to a review.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-6\" pgmap=\"619\">2.
