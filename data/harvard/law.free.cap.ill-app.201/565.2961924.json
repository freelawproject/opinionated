Prom a judgment for plaintiff for $3,000, defendant appeals. '</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A64\" pgmap=\"608\">It appeared that after being employed in the forge room for four or five days deceased became unconscious and died in half an hour. Plaintiff claimed that death was due to heat exhaustion. Deceased\u2019s duties were to feed coke into one of the furnaces and to insert and take out steel billets. The evidence tended to show that the temperature of the room was from 85 to 90 degrees at the time deceased became unconscious. The evidence as to whether devices could have been adopted to reduce the heat was conflicting. There was evidence that just before deceased\u2019s death a flow from his mouth had the odor of whisky, and that a partly filled-flask of whisky was found in his pocket. The evidence also tended to show that at that time deceased had been drinking, and that a temperature of from 85 to 90 degrees would only -slightly affect the health of a normal man. The verdict of the coroner\u2019s jury was that death was due to \u201corganic heart disease, combined with insolation,\u201d but the doctor testified that \u201cthe cause of death was apoplexy, which is a hardening of the arteries and the rupture of a blood vessel in the cranium.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-5\" pgmap=\"608\">H.
