The parties agreed that plaintiff should give defendant credit on the note for such payment in controversy and that defendant should pay the balance due on the note. The defendant sent plaintiff a check inclosed in a letter, which plainly informed plaintiff that according.to defendant\u2019s understanding, the check was in full for the balance due on the note. Plaintiff accepted this check, cashed it, and indorsed the amount of it on the back of the note as so much paid. Later his attorney wrote to defendant that there was still due a certain amount on the note, and that if he did not pay that amount he would be sued, and that if he was sued the-amount to be credited would not be allowed. He did not pay it, and plaintiff began suit.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b268-8\" pgmap=\"268\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b268-9\" pgmap=\"268\">1.
