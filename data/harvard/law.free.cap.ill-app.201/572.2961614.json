From a judgment for plaintiff of $2,000, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-9\" pgmap=\"614(190) 615(79)\">The accident took place at the comer of 12th street and Halsted street. Plaintiff was fifty-seven years of age, and had been accustomed to driving in that neighborhood for four years. He knew of the track in Halsted street and that cars ran frequently in both directions, and that a car might be coming along there at any time. He had been driving this same automobile for four years. At the time, he was moving along 12th street at a speed of about seven miles an hour, and his car was in good condition and equipped with brakes. He said he could have stopped within fourteen feet. There was a single track in Halsted street, the east rail of which was about five feet west of the center line of the street. A wagon road ran along the east side of the track. There were no buildings south of 12th street and east of Halsted except at the extreme northeast corner of the block. This accident happened near the northwest corner. The testimony showed that from a point on 12th street at least three hundred and fifty feet east of Halsted there was a clear, practically unobstructed view across the vacant block. It was also established without contradiction that the east rail of the car track was five feet west of the center line of the street and approximately thirty-eight feet from the east line of Halsted street. Plaintiff testified that from the time he was one hundred feet from the\" track he did not look to see whether a car was coming or not.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b615-7\" pgmap=\"615\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b615-8\" pgmap=\"615\">1.

In an action where the defense is that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in attempting to cross a street car track with his automobile without ascertaining in sufficient season whether cars were approaching, the question of contributory negligence is to be determined by the situation when plaintiff was at such a distance before going on the track that he could control his machine and avoid the danger, rather than by probabilities.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b615-10\" pgmap=\"615\">3.
