Estates, \u00a7 3<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when estate not vested. Where by will property was left to trustees to collect rents and profits and pay off all indebtedness and then to pay the income thereof equally among the testator\u2019s children living at such time, and to the heirs of such child as may have died, the portion which would have gone to him had he been living, and it was further provided by such will that the amount of an advancement made and to be made to one of the testator\u2019s grandsons should, if not repaid by him, be deducted from any money that might eventually go to his father, and the father died before the debts of the estate were paid and thus did not become entitled to any of the proceeds of the income thereof, a decree finding that the amount of such advancement and also a debt owing by the grandson\u2019s father to the estate, together with a debt owing by the grandson\u2019s brothers and sisters to the trustees for money advanced them, were chargeable against and ordering that they be deducted pro rata from the shares of the rents and profits accruing to such grandchildren, held erroneous and reversed and remanded with directions to set off against each heir\u2019s distributive portion the amount of his indebtedness, since such grandchildren, though designated in the will as heirs of the father, took not as such by inheritance, but under their grandfather\u2019s will, the father having but a contingent life estate, in the rents and profits, which never became vested in him.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\" pgmap=\"86\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Ford county; the Hon.
