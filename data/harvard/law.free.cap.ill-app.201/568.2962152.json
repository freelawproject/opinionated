Where a witness is testifying in regard to an account composed of about six hundred items, each of which was originally represented by a voucher, from which the item was entered in books of account, it is not error to permit the witness to use in his testimony a computation and tabulation made up from such vouchers and not from the books, and for use at the trial, where the amount due plaintiff is merely a matter of computation and where all the vouchers and books are in evidence.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-5\" pgmap=\"610\">Appeal from the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.

Held, that under such circumstances defendant was bound by the contract and could not repudiate it.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b611-6\" pgmap=\"611\">3.
