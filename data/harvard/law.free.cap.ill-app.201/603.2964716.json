Cann et al., complainants, against Leslie C. Hughes et a,l., defendants, and cross-bill by Leslie C. Hughes et al., complainants, against Jacob Glos et al., defendants, in the Circuit Court of Cook county.

Hughes et al. appeal.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-9\" pgmap=\"645(167) 646(16)\">The bill sought a partition between complainants and defendants, who were tenants in common, and also the removal of the tax title of defendant Glos as a cloud on their title. The proper pleadings were filed by all parties, and the cause stood at issue and referred to a master, but before any hearings took place, condemnation proceedings were instituted in which the rights of all parties were adjudicated, and an order was made that the sum of $665.44, the amount found to be due defendant Glos, be paid to the county treasurer for his benefit. The cross-bill set up the facts in the original bill, including the money found due and ordered to be paid to defendant Glos, and prayed for the distribution and payment of such amount to the parties entitled thereto. Defendant Glos answered, denying complainants\u2019 title and every material averment in the bill, which by interpretation included a denial of complainants \u2019 right to the money in the hands of the treasurer. The decree found that in equity, defendant Bios was entitled to the money.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-8\" pgmap=\"646\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-9\" pgmap=\"646\">1.
