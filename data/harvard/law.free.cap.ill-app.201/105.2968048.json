Where an objector to executors\u2019 accounts was examined as a witness on behalf of the executors as to what occurred when he gave a certain note to the testatrix, cross-examination, by his counsel, as to whether the testatrix assented to the surrender to him of one of his notes, held proper, as the executors had made him their witness as to such matter, but that the question was objectionable in form as calling for a conclusion.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b148-5\" pgmap=\"148\">2.

In proceedings on objections to an executors\u2019 report, an objector\u2019s contentions that an executor has no right to deduct from the amount due a distributee any sum that may be due from the distributee to the estate, and that the statute of limitations was a defense to a note against the estate claimed to be due it, of which estate he was a distributee, held untenable on the facts.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b148-7\" pgmap=\"148\">4. Executors and administrators, \u00a7 532*\u2014when executors properly not charged with interest. Where a delay by executors in filing their report was caused by an objector thereto, in not paying a claim he owed the estate, held that the executors were properly not charged with interest.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b148-8\" pgmap=\"148\">5.
