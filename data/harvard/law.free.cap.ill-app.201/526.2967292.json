A letter written by the plaintiff to the defendant, held to be an order for lithographic advertising hangers, which was not accepted by the defendant and was not a confirmation of an oral contract previously entered into by the parties, as it contained essential terms and stipulations, such as that time was of the essence of the contract and that the hangers as produced by the defendant must be perfect and to the entire satisfaction of the plaintiff, which terms the plaintiff had not contended were contained in the oral contract, and further that the oral contract, claimed to have been entered into by the plaintiff with a solicitor of the defendant, contained terms so essentially different from and more burdensome on the defendant than those contained in a bid previously submitted by the defendant to the plaintiff as to render it improbable that it was in fact ever entered into by the parties.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-3\" pgmap=\"569\">P.
