Where, in an action on a fire insurance policy on household furniture, the preponderance of the evidence showed that the agent of the insurer knew that the furniture was in a house other than that stated in the policy at the time it was written, and that the insurer, after the loss, sent an adjuster to make out proofs of loss for the insured, held that the knowledge of the agent as to the location of the property was the knowledge of the insurer and that a recovery could be had.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b364-9\" pgmap=\"364\">2.

Where a fire insurance agent was told by the insured that the location of household furniture already insured had been changed to a new location, and at the request of the insured raised the amount of the policy to cover additional furniture purchased by the insured, held that in an action for loss under a renewal policy of insurance in another company, written by the same agent, in which the furniture was described as being in the original location, that evidence of the change made in the old policy was incompetent, though harmless error, but that what was said to the agent as to the location of the furniture when the alteration of the old policy was made was competent on the question of knowledge by the agent as to the change of location.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-4\" pgmap=\"364\">Seymour Edgerton and Wilson, Warren &amp; Child for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-5\" pgmap=\"364\">John P.
