Considerable uncertainty exists about the scope of this provision. In the most detailed analysis provided by a lower court to date, three judges offered three different views on how to define the \"manner\" of implementing a death sentence and where to locate the relevant \"law of the State.\" See\n  <em>\n   In re Federal Bureau of Prisons' Execution Protocol Cases\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20F.3d%20106\">\n   955 F.3d 106\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 108 (CADC 2020) (\n  <em>\n   per curiam\n  </em>\n  ) (\"Each member of the panel takes a different view of what the FDPA requires\"). Thus far, this Court has declined to provide definitive guidance on these important questions. See\n  <em>\n   Barr\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Roane\n  </em>\n  , 589 U. S. ----,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12628553\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/140/353/\">\n   140 S.Ct. 353\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12628553,12629683\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/205/379/\">\n   205 L.Ed.2d 379\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2019) (application for stay or vacatur denied);\n </opinion>\n <p id=\"p-8\">\n  <em>\n   Bourgeois\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Barr\n  </em>\n  , --- U.S. ----, --- S.Ct. ----, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2020),\n  <em>\n   ante\n  </em>\n  , p. ----,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%203492763\">\n   2020 WL 3492763\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (cert. denied).\n </p>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  Because these questions are not adequately presented for our review in the pending case, I agree with this Court's decision to deny a stay. Here, the Ninth Circuit did not need to resolve the key issue on which the D. C. Circuit panel split because it assumed an answer favorable to Mitchell and still denied relief. See\n  <em>\n   United States\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Mitchell\n  </em>\n  , --- F. 3d ----, ---- - ----,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%204815961\">\n   2020 WL 4815961\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (C.A.9 2020) (\n  <em>\n   per curiam\n  </em>\n  ). This case, therefore, does not turn on the question most in need of this Court's guidance: whether the \"manner prescribed by the law of the State\" includes procedures set forth in a state agency's execution protocol. But with additional federal executions scheduled in the coming months, the importance of clarifying the FDPA's meaning remains. I believe that this Court should address this issue in an appropriate case.\n </opinion>\n <p type=\"majority\">\n </p>\n</casebody>\n"
