See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 40:1061.10(A)(2)(a) (West 2020). As in\n  <em>\n   Whole Woman's Health,\n  </em>\n  the District Court found that the statute offers no significant health benefit. It found that conditions on admitting privileges common to hospitals throughout the State have made and will continue to make it impossible for abortion providers to obtain conforming privileges for reasons that have nothing to do with the State's asserted interests in promoting women's health and safety. And it found that this inability places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion. As in\n  <em>\n   Whole Woman's Health\n  </em>\n  , the substantial obstacle the Act imposes, and the absence of any health-related benefit, led the District Court to conclude that the law imposes an\n  undue burden and is therefore unconstitutional. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n  The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court's interpretation of the standards we have said apply to regulations on abortion. It thought, however, that the District Court was mistaken on the facts. We disagree. We have examined the extensive record carefully and conclude that it supports the District Court's findings of fact. Those findings mirror those made in\n  <em>\n   Whole Woman's Health\n  </em>\n  in every relevant respect and require the same result. We consequently hold that the Louisiana statute is unconstitutional.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2014, five months after Texas' admitting-privileges requirement forced the closure of half of that State's abortion clinics, Louisiana's Legislature began to hold hearings to consider a substantially identical proposal.

It argued that there was \"no question that the physicians had standing to contest\" Act 620. App. 44. And it told the District Court that the Fifth Circuit had found that doctors challenging Texas' \"identical\" law \"had third-party standing to assert their patients' rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 43-44. Noting that the Texas law had \"already been upheld,\" the State asserted that it had \"a keen interest in removing any cloud upon the validity of its law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 45. It insisted that this suit was \"the proper vehicle to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The State did not mention its current objection until it filed its cross-petition-more than five years after it argued that the plaintiffs' standing was beyond question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The State's unmistakable concession of standing as part of its effort to obtain a quick decision from the District Court on the merits of the plaintiffs' undue-burden claims bars our consideration of it here.

But the standing argument the State makes here rests on reasons that it tells us are specific to abortion providers\n   <em>\n    in Louisiana\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 41-48.

What we said some 45 years ago in\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   applies equally today: \"[A] decision by us to forgo consideration of the constitutional merits\"-after \"the parties have sought or at least have never resisted an authoritative constitutional determination\" in the courts below-\"in order to await the initiation of a new challenge to the statute by injured third parties would be impermissibly to foster repetitive and time-consuming litigation under the guise of caution and prudence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6079\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/190/#p193\">\n    429 U.S. at 193-194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6079\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/190/#p193\">\n    97 S.Ct. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation altered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In any event, the rule the State invokes is hardly absolute.

We are aware of no authority suggesting that appellate scrutiny of factual determinations varies with the timing of a plaintiff's lawsuit or a trial court's decision. And, in any event, the record belies the dissents' claims that the District Court's findings in this case were \"conjectural\" or premature. As we have explained, the District Court's order on the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order suspended only Act 620's penalties. The plaintiffs were required to continue in their efforts to obtain admitting privileges. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2114. The District Court supervised those efforts through the trial and beyond.

It based its findings on this real-world evidence, not speculative guesswork. Nor can we agree with the suggestion that the timing of the District Court's decision somehow prejudiced the State. From the start, the State urged that the District Court decide the merits of the plaintiffs' claims without awaiting a decision on their applications for admitting privileges. See App. 43-44. And, when this case returned to the District Court in August 2016, following our decision in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , the State stipulated that the case was ripe for decision on the record as it stood in June 2015. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2114 - 2115. In short, we see no legal or practical basis to depart from the familiar standard that applies to all \"[f]indings of fact.\" Fed. Rule Civ.

We also referred to \"common prerequisites to obtaining admitting privileges that have nothing to do with ability to perform medical procedures\"; for example, requirements that doctors have \"treated a high number of patients in the hospital setting in the past year, clinical data requirements, residency requirements, and other discretionary factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   To illustrate how these criteria impacted abortion providers, we noted the example of an obstetrician with 38 years' experience who had been denied admitting privileges for reasons \" 'not based on clinical competence considerations.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   This, we said, showed that the law served no \"relevant credentialing function,\" but prevented qualified providers from serving women who seek an abortion.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 136 S.Ct., at 2313. And that, in turn, \"help[ed] to explain why the new [law's admitting-privileges] requirement led to the closure of \" so many Texas clinics.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 136 S.Ct., at 2313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The evidence on which the District Court relied in this case is even stronger and more detailed. The District Court supervised Does 1, 2, 5, and 6 for over a year and a half as they tried, and largely failed, to obtain conforming privileges from 13 relevant hospitals. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   77-78 ; App. 48-55, 64-82. The court heard direct evidence that some of the doctors' applications were denied for reasons that had nothing to do with their ability to perform abortions safely.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 68-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76-77 ; App. 1310, 1435-1436. It also compiled circumstantial evidence that explains why other applications were denied and explains why, given the costs of applying\n   and the reputational risks that accompany rejection, some providers could have chosen in good faith\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to apply to every qualifying hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1135, 1311 (discussing the costs associated with unsuccessful applications). That circumstantial evidence includes documents and testimony that described the processes Louisiana hospitals follow when considering applications for admitting privileges, including requirements like the ones we cited in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   that are unrelated to a doctor's competency to perform abortions. See generally Brief for Medical Staff Professionals as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   11-30 (reviewing the hospital bylaws in the record).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The evidence shows, among other things, that the fact that hospital admissions for abortion are vanishingly rare means that, unless they also maintain active OB/GYN practices, abortion providers in Louisiana are unlikely to have any recent in-hospital experience.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet such experience can well be a precondition to obtaining privileges. Doe 2, a board-certified OB/GYN with nearly 40 years' experience, testified that he had not \"done any in-hospital work in ten years\" and that just two of his patients in the preceding 5 years had required hospitalization. App. 387, 400. As a result, he was unable to comply with one hospital's demand that he produce data on \"patient admissions and management, consultations and procedures performed\" in-hospital before his application could be \"processed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1435; see\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 437-438. Doe 1, a board-certified family doctor with over 10 years' experience, was similarly unable to \"submit documentation of hospital admissions and management of patients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1436.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The evidence also shows that many providers, even if they could initially obtain admitting privileges, would be unable to keep them. That is because, unless they have a practice that requires regular in-hospital care, they will lose the privileges for failing to use them. Doe 6, a board-certified OB/GYN practitioner with roughly 50 years' experience, provides only medication abortions.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1308. Of the thousands of women he served over the decade before the District Court's decision, during which he also performed surgical abortions, just two required a direct transfer to a hospital and one of them was treated without being admitted.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1309. That safety record would make it impossible for Doe 6 to maintain privileges at any of the many Louisiana hospitals that require newly appointed physicians to undergo a process of \"focused professional practice evaluation,\" in which they are observed by hospital staff as they perform in-hospital procedures. See Record 2635, 2637, 2681, 9054; Brief for Medical Staff Professionals as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   28-29 (describing this practice); cf. Record 10755 (requiring an \"on-going review\" of practice \"in the Operating Room\"). And it would likewise disqualify him at hospitals that require physicians to admit a minimum number of patients, either initially or on an ongoing basis. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 9040, 9068-9069, 9150-9153; cf. App. 1193, 1182 (provider with no patient contacts in first year assigned to \"Affiliate\" status, without admitting privileges).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The evidence also shows that opposition to abortion played a significant role in some hospitals' decisions to deny admitting privileges.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 48-49, 51-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting evidence). Some hospitals expressly bar anyone with privileges from performing abortions. App. 1180, 1205. Others are unwilling to extend privileges to abortion providers as a matter of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1127-1129. For example, Doe 2 testified that he was told not to bother asking for admitting privileges at University Health in Shreveport because of his abortion work.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 383-384. And Doe 1\n   was told that his abortion work was an impediment to his application.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1315-1316.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Still other hospitals have requirements that abortion providers cannot satisfy because of the hostility they face in Louisiana. Many Louisiana hospitals require applicants to identify a doctor (called a \"covering physician\") willing to serve as a backup should the applicant admit a patient and then for some reason become unavailable. See Record 9154, 9374, 9383, 9478, 9667, 10302, 10481, 10637, 10659-10661, 10676. The District Court found \"that opposition to abortion can present a major, if not insurmountable hurdle, for an applicant getting the required covering physician.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   49 ; cf.\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , 579 U. S., at ----, 136 S.Ct., at 2313 (citing testimony describing similar problems faced by Texas providers seeking covering physicians). Doe 5 is a board-certified OB/GYN who had been practicing for more than nine years at the time of trial. Of the thousands of abortions he performed in the three years prior to the District Court's decision, not one required a direct transfer to a hospital. App. 1134. Yet he was unable to secure privileges at three Baton Rouge hospitals because he could not find a covering physician willing to be publicly associated with an abortion provider.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1335-1336. Doe 3, a board-certified OB/GYN with nearly 45 years of experience, testified that he, too, had difficulty arranging coverage because of his abortion work.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 200-202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Just as in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , the experiences of the individual doctors in this case support the District Court's factual finding that Louisiana's admitting-privileges requirement, like that in Texas' law, serves no \" 'relevant credentialing function.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.

It conceded that Doe 1 would not be able to obtain admitting privileges in spite of his good-faith attempts. It concluded, however, that Does 2, 5, and 6 had acted in bad faith.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518819\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/787/#p791\">\n    905 F.3d at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The problem is that the law requires appellate courts to review a trial court's findings under the deferential clear-error standard we have described. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2120 - 2121. Our review of the record convinces us that the Court of Appeals misapplied that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Justice ALITO does not dispute that the District Court's findings are not \"clearly erroneous.\" He argues instead that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals applied the wrong legal standard to the record in this case. By asking whether the doctors acted in \"good faith,\" he contends, the courts below failed to account for the doctors' supposed \"incentive to do as little as\" possible to obtain conforming privileges.\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   , at 2158 - 2160 (dissenting opinion); cf.\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2176 - 2177 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting). But that is not a legal argument at all. It is simply another way of saying that the doctors acted in\n   <em>\n    bad\n   </em>\n   faith. The District Court, after monitoring the doctors' efforts for a year and a half, found otherwise. And \"[w]hen the record is examined in light of the appropriately deferential standard, it is apparent that it contains nothing that mandates a finding that the District Court's conclusion was clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    470 U.S. at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Doe 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The District Court found that Doe 2 tried in good faith to get admitting privileges within 30 miles of his Shreveport-area\n   clinic.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals thought that conclusion clearly erroneous for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   First, the appeals court suggested that Doe 2 failed to submit the data needed to process his application to Bossier's Willis-Knighton Health Center.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518819\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/787/#p791\">\n    905 F.3d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is true that Doe 2 submitted no additional information in response to the last letter he received from Willis-Knighton. But the record explains that failure. Doe 2 reasonably believed there was no point in doing so. The hospital's letter explained that the data Doe 2 had already \"submitted supports the outpatient [abortion] procedures you perform[ed].\" App. 1435. But, the letter added, this data did \"not support your request for hospital privileges\" because it did not allow the hospital to \"evaluate patient admissions and management, consultations, and procedures performed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518819\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/787/#p791\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Doe 2 testified at trial that he understood this to mean that he would have to submit records of\n   <em>\n    hospital\n   </em>\n   admissions, even though he had not \"done any in-hospital work in ten years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 387; see\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 437 (\"I've explained that that information doesn't exist\"). Doe 2's understanding was consistent with Willis-Knighton's similar letter to Doe 1, which explicitly stated that \"we require that you submit documentation of hospital admissions and management of patients ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1436. The record also shows that Doe 2 could not have maintained the \"adequate number of inpatient contacts\" Willis-Knighton requires to support continued privileges. Record 9640; see App. 387-390, 404. Justice ALITO faults Doe 2 for failing to pursue an application for \"courtesy staff\" privileges. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2162 - 2163. For one thing, it is far from clear that courtesy privileges entitle a physician to admit patients, as Act 620 requires. Compare,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Record 9640 with\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 9643. For another, that would not solve the problem that Doe 2 lacked the required in-hospital experience. Justice ALITO wonders whether Willis-Knighton might have conferred courtesy privileges even without that experience. But the factors the hospital considers for both tiers of privileges are facially identical.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 9669. We have no license to reverse a trial court's factual findings based on speculative inferences from facts not in evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Second, the Court of Appeals found Doe 2's explanation that Christus Schumpert Hospital \"would not staff an abortion provider\" to be \"blatantly contradicted by the record.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518819\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/787/#p791\">\n    905 F.3d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record, however, contains Christus' bylaws. They state that \"[n]o activity prohibited by\" the Ethical and Religious Directives to which the hospital subscribes \"shall be engaged in by any Medical Staff appointee or any other person exercising clinical privileges at the Health System.\" App. 1180. These directives provide that abortion \"is never permitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1205. And they warn against \"the danger of scandal in any association with abortion providers.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The State suggests that the Court of Appeals, in speaking of a \"contradic[tion],\" was referring to the fact that Doe 3 had admitting privileges at Christus, as had Doe 2 at an earlier time. Brief for Respondent 75. Doe 3 testified, however, that he did not know whether Christus was \"aware that I was performing abortions\" and that he did not \"feel like testing the waters there\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   by \"asking [Christus] how they would feel\" if they were aware that he \"was performing abortions.\" App. 273. And nothing in the record suggests that Christus, 10 years earlier, was aware of Doe 2's connection with abortion. Justice ALITO imagines a number of ways that Christus may have become aware of Doe 2 or Doe 3's abortion practice. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2161 - 2162, and n. 10 (dissenting opinion). The State apparently did not see fit to test these theories or probe the doctors' accounts\n   on cross-examination, however. And the District Court's finding of good faith is plainly permissible on the record before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, the Court of Appeals faulted Doe 2 for failing to apply to Minden Hospital. The record also explains that decision. Minden subjects all new appointees to \"not less than\" six months of \"focused professional practice evaluation.\" Record 9281; see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 9252. That evaluation requires an assessment of the provider's in-hospital work. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2123 - 2124. Doe 2 could not meet that requirement because, as we have said, Doe 2 does not do in-hospital work, and only two of his patients in the past five years have required hospitalization. App. 400. Moreover, Minden's bylaws express a preference for applicants whom \"members of the current Active Staff of the Hospital\" have recommended.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1211. Doe 2 testified that Minden Hospital was \"a smaller hospital,\" \"very close to the [geographic] limits,\" where he \"[did]n't really know anyone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 454. He applied to those hospitals where he believed he had the highest likelihood of success.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Given this evidence, the Fifth Circuit was wrong to conclude that the District Court's findings in respect to Doe 2 were \"clearly erroneous.\" See\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    470 U.S. at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Doe 5\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The District Court found that Doe 5 was unable to obtain admitting privileges at three hospitals in range of his Baton Rouge clinic in spite of his good-faith efforts to satisfy each hospital's requirement that he find a covering physician.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   76 ; see App. 1334-1335 (Women's Hospital); Record 2953 (Baton Rouge General), 10659-10661 (Lane Regional).

And, if the matter became well known, the doctor whom Doe 5 asked worried that it could make him a target of threats and protests.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Doe 5 was familiar with the problem. Anti-abortion protests had previously forced him to leave his position as a staff member of a hospital northeast of Baton Rouge.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1137-1138, 1330. And activists had picketed the school attended by the children of a former colleague, who then stopped performing abortions as a result.

Doe 4's actual testimony was that he did not believe requiring doctors to obtain a covering physician was \"an overburdensome requirement for admitting privileges.\" Record 14154. In context, that statement is most naturally read as saying that such a requirement was reasonable, not that it was easy to fulfill. In fact, Doe 4 testified that he had been unable to apply to two hospitals for admitting privileges because he could not find a covering physician.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 14154-14155.

All four directly support the testimony of Doe 6 and the State's expert. Three hospitals require doctors who receive admitting privileges to undergo a process of \"focused professional practice evaluation.\" See Record 2635, 2637, 2681 (Touro Hospital), 9054 (New Orleans East Hospital), 10755 (East Jefferson Hospital). As we have explained, this evaluation requires hospital staff to observe a doctor with admitting privileges while he or she performs a certain number of procedures. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2123 - 2124. If the doctor admits no patients (and Doe 6 has no patients requiring admission), there is nothing to observe. Another hospital requires physicians to admit a minimum number of patients, either initially or after\n   receiving admitting privileges. Record 9150-9153 (West Jefferson Hospital). And one requires both.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 9040, 9069 (New Orleans East Hospital). The record apparently is silent as to the remaining three hospitals, but that silence cannot contradict the well-supported testimony of Doe 6 and the State's expert that Doe 6 would not receive admitting privileges from any of them. Good faith does not require an exercise in futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   We recognize that Doe 5 was able to secure limited admitting privileges at Touro Hospital, to which Doe 6 did not apply.

To better understand the significance of these conclusions, the reader should keep in mind the geographic distribution of the doctors and their clinics. Figure 1 shows the distribution of doctors and clinics at the time of the District Court's decision. Figure 2 shows the projected distribution if the admitting-privileges requirement were enforced, as found by the District Court. The figures in parentheses indicate the approximate number of abortions each physician performed annually, according to the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Figure 1\n   </em>\n   - Distribution of Abortion Clinics and Providers at the Time of the District Court's Decision\n   <em>\n    Figure 2\n   </em>\n   - Projected Distribution of Abortion Clinics and Providers Following Enforcement of Act 620\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   As we have seen, enforcing the admitting-privileges requirement would eliminate Does 1, 2, and 6.

So the departure of Does 1 and 2 would also eliminate Doe 3. That would leave only Doe 5. And Doe 5's inability to obtain privileges in the Baton Rouge area would leave Louisiana with just one clinic with one provider to serve the 10,000 women annually who seek abortions in the State.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87-88 ; cf.\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.

App. 1134, 1331; see\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1129. And because Doe 5 does not perform abortions beyond 18 weeks, women between 18 weeks and the state legal limit of 20 weeks would have little or no way to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1330-1331.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Those women not altogether prevented from obtaining an abortion would face other burdens. As in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , the reduction in abortion providers caused\n   by Act 620 would inevitably mean \"longer waiting times, and increased crowding.\" 579 U. S., at ----, 136 S.Ct. (slip op., at 26). The District Court heard testimony that delays in obtaining an abortion increase the risk that a woman will experience complications from the procedure and may make it impossible for her to choose a noninvasive medication abortion. App. 220, 290, 312-313; see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1139, 1305, 1313, 1316, 1323.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Even if they obtain an appointment at a clinic, women who might previously have gone to a clinic in Baton Rouge or Shreveport would face increased driving distances. New Orleans is nearly a five hour drive from Shreveport; it is over an hour from Baton Rouge; and Baton Rouge is more than four hours from Shreveport. The impact of those increases would be magnified by Louisiana's requirement that every woman undergo an ultrasound and receive mandatory counseling at least 24 hours before an abortion. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 40:1061.10(D). A Shreveport resident seeking an abortion who might previously have obtained care at one of that city's local clinics would either have to spend nearly 20 hours driving back and forth to Doe 5's clinic twice, or else find overnight lodging in New Orleans. As the District Court stated, both experts and laypersons testified that the burdens of this increased travel would fall disproportionately on poor women, who are least able to absorb them. App. 106-107, 178, 502-508, 543; see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 311-312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   We note that the Court of Appeals also faulted the District Court for factoring Doe 3's departure into its calculations.

That is beside the point. Even if we pretended as though (contrary to the record evidence) Doe 3 would continue to provide abortions at Shreveport-based Hope Clinic, the record nonetheless supports the District Court's alternative finding that Act 620's burdens would remain substantial.

And, the District Court found that Doe 5 can perform no more than roughly 3,000 abortions annually. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2129. So even if Doe 3 remained active in Shreveport, the annual demand for abortions in Louisiana would be more than double the capacity. And although the availability of abortions in Shreveport might lessen the driving distances faced by some women, it would still leave thousands of Louisiana women with no practical means of obtaining a safe, legal abortion, and it would not meaningfully address the health risks associated with crowding and delay for those able to secure an appointment with one of the State's two remaining providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Taken together, we think that these findings and the evidence that underlies them are sufficient to support the District Court's conclusion that Act 620 would place substantial obstacles in the path of women seeking an abortion in Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    Benefits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   We turn finally to the law's asserted benefits.

This argument misconceives the question before us. \"The question we must answer\" is \"not whether the [Fifth] Circuit's interpretation of the facts was clearly erroneous, but whether the\n   <em>\n    District Court's\n   </em>\n   finding[s were] clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    470 U.S. at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). As we have explained, we think the District Court's factual findings here are plausible in light of the record as a whole. Nothing in the State's briefing furnishes a basis to disturb that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Second, the State says that the record does not show that Act 620 will burden\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   woman in Louisiana who seeks an abortion. Brief for Respondent 69-70 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Salerno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    481 U.S. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) ). True, but beside the point. As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   , a State's abortion-related law is unconstitutional on its face if \"it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion\" in \"a large fraction of the cases in which [it] is relevant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    505 U.S. at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (majority opinion). In\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , we reaffirmed that standard. We made clear that the phrase refers to a large fraction of \"those women for whom the provision is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction.\" 579 U.

Brief for Respondent 71-72. But, again, the words \"nearly impossible\" do not describe the legal standard that governs here. Since\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   , we have repeatedly reiterated that the plaintiff's burden in a challenge to an abortion regulation is to show that the regulation's \"purpose or effect\" is to \"plac[e] a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    505 U.S. at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion); see\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.

Brief for Respondent 60-66. That, however, is not this case.

Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 40:1061.10(A)(2)(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2020).

The law would reduce the number of clinics from three to \"one, or at most two,\" and the number of physicians providing abortions from five to \"one, or at most two,\" and \"therefore cripple women's ability to have an abortion in Louisiana.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    at 87-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The legal doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike.

Black's Law Dictionary 1696 (11th ed. 2019). It has long been \"an established rule to abide by former precedents, where the same points come again in litigation; as well to keep the scale of justice even and steady, and not liable to waver with every new judge's opinion.\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 69 (1765). This principle is grounded in a basic humility that recognizes today's legal issues are often not so different from the questions of yesterday and that we are not the first ones to try to answer them. Because the \"private stock of reason ... in each man is small, ... individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages.\" 3 E.

As is often the case with legal challenges to abortion regulations, this suit was brought by abortionists and abortion clinics. Their sole claim before this Court is that Louisiana's law violates the purported substantive due process right of a woman to abort her unborn child. But they concede that this right does not belong to them, and they seek to vindicate no private rights of their own. Under a proper understanding of Article III, these plaintiffs lack standing to invoke our jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Despite the fact that we granted Louisiana's petition specifically to address whether \"abortion providers [can] be presumed to have third-party standing to challenge health and safety regulations on behalf of their patients,\" Conditional Cross-Pet. in No. 18-1460, p. i, a majority of the Court all but ignores the question. The plurality and THE CHIEF JUSTICE ultimately cast aside this jurisdictional barrier to conclude that Louisiana's law is unconstitutional under our precedents. But those decisions created the right to abortion out of whole cloth, without a shred of support from the Constitution's text. Our abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled.

But, ultimately, it dodges the question, claiming that Louisiana's standing challenge was waived below. Both assertions are erroneous. First, there is no controlling precedent that sets forth the blanket rule advocated for by plaintiffs here-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , abortionists may challenge health and safety regulations based solely on their role in the abortion process. Second, I agree with Justice ALITO that Louisiana did not waive its standing challenge below.\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   , at 2165 - 2166 (dissenting opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   But even if there were a waiver, it would not be relevant.

To achieve this end, the majority misuses the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   , invokes an inapplicable standard of appellate review, and distorts the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The plurality eschews the constitutional test set out in\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   and instead employs the balancing test adopted in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health.\n   </em>\n   The plurality concludes that the Louisiana law does nothing to protect the health of women, but that is disproved by substantial evidence in the record. And the plurality upholds the District Court's finding that the Louisiana law would cause a drastic reduction in the number of abortion providers in the State even though this finding was based on an erroneous legal standard and a thoroughly inadequate factual inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE stresses the importance of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   and thinks that precedent, namely\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health,\n   </em>\n   dooms the Louisiana law. But at the same time, he votes to overrule\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    Health\n   </em>\n   insofar as it changed the\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Both the plurality and THE CHIEF JUSTICE hold that abortion providers can invoke a woman's abortion right when they attack state laws that are enacted to protect a woman's health. Neither waiver nor\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   can justify this holding, which clashes with our general rule on third-party standing. And the idea that a regulated party can invoke the right of a third party for the purpose of attacking legislation enacted to protect the third party is stunning. Given the apparent conflict of interest, that concept would be rejected out of hand in a case not involving abortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   For these reasons, I cannot join the decision of the Court. I would remand the case to the District Court and instruct that court, before proceeding any further, to require the joinder of a plaintiff with standing. If a proper plaintiff is added, the\n   District Court should conduct a new trial and determine, based on proper evidence, whether enforcement of Act 620 would diminish the number of abortion providers in the State to such a degree that women's access to abortions would be substantially impaired. In making that determination, the court should jettison the nebulous \"good faith\" test that it used in judging whether the physicians who currently lack admitting privileges would be able to obtain privileges and thus continue to perform abortions if Act 620 were permitted to take effect. Because the doctors in question (many of whom are or were plaintiffs in this case) stand to lose, not gain, by obtaining privileges, the court should require the plaintiffs to show that these doctors sought admitting privileges with the degree of effort that they would expend if their personal interests were at stake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Under our precedent, the critical question in this case is whether the challenged Louisiana law places a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\"\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"654\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    505 U.S. at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"655\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion).

At oral argument, their attorney maintained that a law that has no effect on women's access to abortion is nevertheless unconstitutional if it is not needed to protect women's health. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19. Of course, that is precisely the argument one would expect from a business that wishes to be free from burdensome regulations. But unless an abortion law has an adverse effect\n   <em>\n    on women\n   </em>\n   , there is no reason why the law should face greater constitutional scrutiny than any other measure that burdens a regulated entity in the name of health or safety.

Unless\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   is reexamined-and Louisiana has not asked us to do that-the test it adopted should remain the governing standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Because the plurality adheres to the balancing test adopted in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , it considers whether the Louisiana law helps to protect the health of women seeking abortions, and it concludes that \"nothing in the record indicates that the background vetting for admitting privileges adds significantly to the vetting that the State Board of Medical Examiners already provides.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , at 2131. THE CHIEF JUSTICE seems to agree,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at 2140 - 2141 (opinion concurring in judgment), although it is unclear why this issue matters under the test he favors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   In any event, contrary to the view taken by the plurality and (seemingly) by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, there is ample evidence in the record showing that admitting privileges help to protect the health of women by ensuring that physicians who perform abortions meet a higher standard of competence than is shown by the mere possession of a license to practice. In deciding whether to grant admitting privileges, hospitals typically undertake a rigorous investigative process to ensure that a doctor is responsible and competent and has the training and experience needed to perform the procedures for which the privileges are sought. As the Fifth Circuit explained, \"hospitals verify an applicant's surgical ability, training, education, experience, practice record, and criminal history. These factors are reviewed by a board of multiple physicians.\"\n   <em>\n    June Medical Services, L. L. C. v. Gee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518819\" index=\"664\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/787/#p791\">\n    905 F.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 805, n. 53 (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   The standards used by the great majority of hospitals in deciding whether to grant privileges clearly show that hospitals demand proof of a higher level of competence. The Joint Commission, a nonprofit organization that accredits healthcare institutions, has issued standards for granting admitting privileges, and all of the hospitals whose rules are relevant here (and the vast majority of Louisiana hospitals) comply with those standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These standards call for an examination of each applicant's licensure, education, training, and current competence. See Joint Commission, 2020 Hospital Accreditation Standards, pp. MS-23, 25, 26, 29. They require an examination of a doctor's health records, clinical data on performance, and peer recommendations, and they demand that a hospital make a careful assessment of the procedures a physician may perform.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Dr. Robert Marier, the former director of the Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners (and the former dean of Louisiana State University Medical School), testified that the process conducted by hospitals in deciding whether to grant admitting privileges is \"the primary way of determining competency.\" App. 818. That process, he explained, \"thoroughly vet[s] the qualifications of [applicants] to ensure that [they] are competent to provide the services that are in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   June Medical's expert, Dr. Eva Pressman, agreed that \"admitting privileges can serve the function of providing an evaluation mechanism for physician competency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 1042, 1091; Record 10864. Doe 3, one of the doctors who currently performs abortions in Louisiana, also acknowledged the credentialing value of admitting privileges, App. 247-248, as did Doe 4, another Louisiana abortion doctor, Record 14155.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Although the plurality contends that the review conducted by hospitals adds little to the vetting undertaken by the State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), that is not true. Hospitals look beyond the mere possession of a license, and they do that for very obvious reasons. If nothing else, their review process serves the hospitals' interests by diminishing the risk of awards for malpractice committed by doctors practicing on their premises. In Louisiana, hospitals that perform negligent credentialing cannot benefit from the State's medical malpractice cap. See\n   <em>\n    Billeaudeau v. Opelousas General Hospital Auth.\n   </em>\n   , 20160846, p. 21 (La. 10/19/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12363537\" index=\"665\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/218/513/#p527\">\n    218 So.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527. In addition, a hospital's \"Medicare participation\n   and other certifications depend on completing the credentialing process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   The review conducted by hospitals goes beyond that of the Board in another way: it is continuous. Under the Joint Commission Standards, hospitals must monitor physicians with admitting privileges and can therefore make a running assessment of their competence. See Record 11850. The Board, on the other hand, conducts an inquiry before initially issuing a license, but the annual license renewal process entails nothing more than completing a standard form, paying the required fee, and documenting a certain number of continuing medical education credits. See 46 La. Admin. Code, pt. XLV, \u00a7 417 (2020).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Because hospitals continue to evaluate doctors after privileges are granted, they may discover information that assists the Board in carrying out its responsibilities. In the past, hospitals have forwarded such information to the Board, and such referrals have led the Board to take serious disciplinary actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   The record shows that the vetting conducted by hospitals goes far beyond what is done at Louisiana abortion clinics. Some clinics demand nothing more than possession of a license. Take the example of petitioner June Medical. Doe 3, the only person at that clinic who evaluates applicants, testified that he does not perform background checks of any kind, not even criminal records checks. App. 249-250. In the past, Doe 3 hired a radiologist and ophthalmologist to perform abortions.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 249.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Delta Clinic in Baton Rouge and Women's Clinic in New Orleans have similarly lax practices. Leroy Brinkley, the president of both clinics, testified before a Pennsylvania grand jury that, in making hiring decisions, \" 'I don't judge the license. If they have a license and the state gave the license, it's not for me to determine if they are capable.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A \" 'background check,' \" he said, is not within his \" 'framework.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Doe 4, who practiced at the now-defunct Causeway Clinic near New Orleans, recounted the meager vetting that occurred when he was hired at that facility. He had to produce a valid medical license and DEA license but was not required \"to undergo anything similar to review by a credentials committee.\" Record 14156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   In light of these practices, it is no surprise that the Louisiana Department of Health has issued Statements of Deficiency against abortion facilities for failing to adopt \" 'a detailed credentialing process for physicians,' \" failing to investigate \" 'possible restrictions' \" on physicians' licenses, and failing to look into \" 'evidence of prior malpractice claims/settlements.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Louisiana adopted Act 620 in the aftermath of the Kermit Gosnell grand jury report, which expounded on the failures of regulatory oversight that allowed Gosnell's practices to continue for an extended period. See Report of Grand Jury in\n   No. 0009901-2008 (1st Jud. Dist. Pa., Jan. 14, 2011). The grand jury concluded that closer supervision would have uncovered Gosnell's egregious health and safety violations. Gosnell had a medical license, but it is doubtful that any hospital would have given him admitting privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   In sum, contrary to the plurality's assertion, there is ample evidence in the record showing that requiring admitting privileges has health and safety benefits. There is certainly room for debate about the need for this requirement, but under our case law, this Court's task is not to ascertain whether a law \"adds significantly\" to the existing regulatory framework. Instead, when confronted with a genuine dispute about a law's benefits, we have afforded legislatures \"wide discretion\" in assessing whether a regulation serves a legitimate medical need and is medically reasonable even in the face of medical and scientific uncertainty.\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

They misuse the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   and the standard of appellate review for findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   <em>\n    Stare decisis\n   </em>\n   is a major theme in the plurality opinion and that of THE CHIEF JUSTICE. Both opinions try to create the impression that this case is the same as\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   and that\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   therefore commands the same result. In truth, however, the two cases are very different. While it is certainly true that the Texas and Louisiana\n   <em>\n    statutes\n   </em>\n   are largely the same, the two cases are not. The decision in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   was not based on the face of the Texas statute, but on an empirical question, namely, the effect of the statute on access to abortion in that State. 579 U. S., at ----, 136 S.Ct., at (slip op., at 24). The Court's answer to that question depended on numerous factors that may differ from State to State, including the demand for abortions, the number and location of abortion clinics and physicians, the geography of the State, the distribution of the population, and the ability of physicians to obtain admitting privileges.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at ---- - ----, 136 S.Ct., at (slip op., at 24-26). There is no reason to think that a law requiring admitting privileges will necessarily have the same effect in every state. As a result, just because the Texas admitting privileges requirement was found by this Court, based on evidence in the record of that case, to have substantially reduced access to abortion in that State, it does not follow that Act 620 would have comparable effects in Louisiana. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at ---- - ----, 136 S.Ct., at (slip op., at 22-26) (reviewing Texas record). The two States are neighbors, but they are not the same. Accordingly, the record-based empirical determination in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   is not controlling here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   The suggestion that\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   is materially identical to this case is ironic, since the two cases differ in a way that was critical to the Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health, i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the difference between a pre-enforcement facial challenge and a post-enforcement challenge based on evidence of the law's effects. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at ----, 136 S.Ct., at (slip op., at 11). Before the Texas law went into effect, abortion providers mounted an unsuccessful facial challenge, arguing that the law would drastically limit abortion access. The Fifth Circuit held that the plaintiffs had not shown that the law would create a substantial obstacle for women seeking abortions, and a final judgment was entered against them.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex.

Pointing to the District Court's finding that the Louisiana law would have a drastic effect on abortion access,\n   <em>\n    June Medical Services, LLC v. Kliebert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"681\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87 (MD La. 2017), the plurality and THE CHIEF JUSTICE note that findings of fact may be overturned only if clearly erroneous, and they see no such error here.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , at 2120 - 2121 (opinion of BREYER, J.);\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at 2141 - 2142 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). In taking this approach, they overlook the flawed legal standard on which the District Court's finding depends, and they ignore the gross deficiencies of the evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   Because the Louisiana law was not allowed to go into effect for any appreciable time, it was necessary for the District Court to predict what its effects would be. Attempting to do that, the court apparently concluded that none of the doctors who currently perform abortions in the State would be replaced if the admitting privileges requirement forced them to leave abortion practice.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"682\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That inference is debatable, as it primarily rests on the anecdotal testimony of June Medical's administrator. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 81-82 ; App. 113-114. Neither the plurality nor THE CHIEF JUSTICE explains why it should be accepted. That alone casts doubt\n   on the finding to which the majority defers, but the problems with the finding do not stop there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   The finding was based on a fundamentally flawed test. In attempting to ascertain how many of the doctors who perform abortions in the State would have to leave abortion practice for lack of admitting privileges, the District Court received evidence in a variety of forms-some live testimony, but also deposition transcripts, declarations, and even letters from counsel-about the doctors' unsuccessful efforts to obtain privileges. The District Court considered whether these doctors had proceeded in \"good faith\"; it found that they all met that standard; and it therefore concluded that the law would leave the State with very few abortion providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Under the reasoning just described, the factual finding on which the plurality and THE CHIEF JUSTICE rely-that the Louisiana law would drastically reduce access to abortion in the State-depends on the District Court's finding that the doctors in question exercised \"good faith\" in their quest for privileges, but that test is woefully deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   It has aptly been said that \"good faith\" \" 'is an elusive idea, taking on different meanings and emphases as we move from one context to another.' \" Black's Law Dictionary 836 (11th ed. 2019). What the District Court understood the term to mean in the present context is uncertain, but this is clear: The District Court ignored a factor of the utmost importance, the incentives of the doctors in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   When the District Court made its assessment of the doctors' \"good faith,\" enforcement of Act 620 had been preliminarily enjoined, and the doctors surely knew that enforcement would be permanently barred if the lawsuit was successful. Thus, the doctors had everything to lose and nothing to gain by obtaining privileges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two of the doctors-Does 1 and 2-are petitioners and cross-respondents in this Court. Two others, Does 5 and 6, were plaintiffs earlier but dropped out for unexplained reasons. See App. 1327. And Doe 3, although not a plaintiff, is the medical director of June Medical, a party to this case.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 186, 206, 245.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   If these doctors had secured privileges, that would have tended to defeat the lawsuit. Not only that, acquiring privileges would have subjected all the doctors to the previously described hospital monitoring, as well as any other obligations that a hospital imposed on doctors with privileges, such as providing unpaid care for the indigent. See\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at 2163 - 2164. Thus, in light of the situation at the time when the doctors made their attempts to get privileges, they had an incentive to do as little as they thought the District Court would demand, not as much as they would if they stood to benefit from success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Given this incentive structure, the District Court's \"good faith\" test was not up\n   to the task. Although the District Court did not define exactly what the test required, \"good faith\" might easily mean only that a doctor lacked the subjective intent to avoid getting privileges. See Black's Law Dictionary, at 836 (defining \"good faith\" to mean, among other things, \"absence of intent to defraud or seek unconscionable advantage\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   In light of the doctors' incentives, more should have been required. The court should have asked whether the doctors' efforts to acquire privileges were equal to the efforts they would have made if they knew that their ability to continue to perform abortions was at stake. The District Court did not do that, and because its finding on abortion access rests on the wrong legal standard, it cannot stand. A finding based on an erroneous legal test is invalid; it cannot be sustained under the \"clearly erroneous\" rule.

Five doctors perform abortions at those three locations: Doe 1, Doe 2, and Doe 3 at June Medical; Doe 5 at Delta Clinic and Women's Clinic; and Doe 6 at Women's Clinic. For purposes of the analysis that follows, I assume that Doe 1 could not get privileges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   If we also assume that none of these doctors would be replaced if they ceased to perform abortions, the impact of the challenged law on abortion access in\n   the State depends on the ability of four doctors to secure such privileges: Doe 2 (June Medical, Shreveport), Doe 3 (June Medical, Shreveport), Doe 5 (Delta Clinic, Baton Rouge, and Women's Clinic, New Orleans), and Doe 6 (Women's Clinic, New Orleans). As I will show, under the correct legal standard, June Medical failed to prove that Act 620 would drive these four doctors out of the abortion practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Doe 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The District Court concluded that Doe 2 made a good-faith effort to obtain privileges, and the Court now affirms that holding.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , at 2126. It is painfully obvious, however, that Doe 2 did not act in the way one would expect if compliance with Act 620 had been to his benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   E-mails in the record reveal that Doe 2 only half-heartedly applied for privileges, did so on the advice of counsel, and calculated that an outright denial would be best for his legal challenge. See App. 1452 (\"The lawyers think it is important that I at least have an application pending at a hospital\");\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 1453 (\"It may, however, be more important from a legal challenge standpoint against this Bill just to have an application pending\n   <em>\n    or even denied\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Consistent with this attitude, Doe 2 declined to apply for privileges at a Shreveport-area hospital, Christus Health, where he previously had privileges while performing abortions offsite and where another doctor who performed abortions, Doe 3, maintained privileges.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185889\" index=\"691\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/273/#p287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 382. Doe 2 knew that Doe 3 had privileges at Christus Health, a hospital that grants \"courtesy privileges,\" which allow doctors to admit patients but do not require a minimum number of admissions. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 406; Record 12125 (bylaws).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   Doe 2's stated reasons for not applying to Christus Health are not reasons that are likely to have deterred an individual with a strong personal incentive to obtain privileges. He testified that Christus is a Catholic hospital and that he did not apply there for that reason. App. 405-406. He added that he applied to other hospitals where he \"knew people and might feel more comfortable,\" \"places that [he] thought meant something\" and where he would have \"the highest likelihood\" of obtaining privileges.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 454. A person with a strong personal incentive to get privileges is not likely to have found these reasons sufficient to justify failing even to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   The District Court did not address Doe 2's failure to apply to Christus Health.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"692\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 68-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plurality, however, argues that Christus would not have granted Doe 2 privileges because its bylaws object to abortion practice.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2125 - 2126. But as noted, Christus Health had previously granted privileges to doctors who perform abortions. Not only did Doe 2 have privileges there while he was performing abortions, but Doe 3 has had privileges at Christus \"off and on\" for \"30 years\" and was reappointed to the Christus Health staff in 2012 and again in 2014. App. 272; Record 12102 (2012-2014);\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 12112 (2014-2016). Throughout this time, he performed abortions. App. 206, 210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   Attempting to justify Doe 2's decision not to (re)apply to Christus, the plurality suggests that Doe 3 (and by extension Doe 2) successfully concealed their abortion practice from Christus, and that if Doe 2 had applied for privileges, Christus would have discovered that he was performing abortions and denied his application on that ground. It is doubtful that Christus was actually in the dark, and speculative that an application would have been denied for this reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the important point\n   is that a doctor with a strong personal incentive would have tried and not simply gone through the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   Instead of applying to Christus Health, Doe 2 made a formal application to Willis-Knighton Bossier City (WKBC) and an informal inquiry at University Hospital, but the record does not show that he pursued those requests with any zeal. At WKBC, he did not apply for courtesy privileges, which do not require a minimum number of admissions, Record 9642-9643, but instead sought an active staff position,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9751, and according to Doe 2, this application was doomed because he could not satisfy the minimum-admissions requirement for such a position, App. 384-390. Doe 2 later sent a three-paragraph e-mail to a WKBC e-mail address purporting to amend his 102-page application so as to seek only courtesy privileges,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 1446, but the record does not reflect whether that e-mail was received or processed, and subsequent correspondence from WKBC does not acknowledge it,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 1435. Doe 2 stated that he sought an active staff position \"to keep [his] practice options for the future open,\" Record 9756, but that does not explain his lack of diligence in seeking courtesy staff privileges. Although it is true that WKBC requested inpatient records from Doe 2 for an active staff position, we do not know whether the hospital would have made the same request had Doe 2 applied for courtesy privileges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 1435.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Doe 2 said he made an informal inquiry about admitting privileges at University Hospital, where he has consulting privileges, but that the head of the OB/GYN Department, Dr. Groome, \"essentially\n   said\" that the hospital would not upgrade his credentials.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 384. Doe 2 attributed this to \"the political nature of what I do and the controversy of what I do.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . But Doe 2 did not introduce evidence (or seek to elicit testimony from Dr. Groome) substantiating his account of this informal inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Doe 2's account raises obvious questions. Since he was\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   a member of the University Hospital staff, it is not apparent why the hospital would reject his request for upgraded privileges because of \"the political nature\" of his practice.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 440-441. And University Hospital has long been on notice of Doe 2's abortion practice. He has been affiliated with that hospital since 1979, Record 9757, and has performed abortions since 1980,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 9759.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   In sum, Doe 2 all but admitted in his e-mails that his efforts to obtain privileges were perfunctory; he declined to apply at a hospital where he previously had privileges; at the only hospital where he made a formal application, he sought a position he knew he could not get for lack of a sufficient number of admissions; and at one other hospital (where he already had consulting privileges) he did no more than make an informal inquiry. The District Court should have considered whether Doe 2's efforts were consistent with the conduct of a person who really wanted to get privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Doe 5\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Doe 5 is an OB/GYN who performs abortions at Women's Clinic in New Orleans and Delta Clinic in Baton Rouge.

The remaining question is whether the law would bar him from performing abortions in Baton Rouge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Doe 5 could continue to do that if one hospital in that area granted him admitting privileges, and Doe 5 testified that one, Woman's Hospital, will grant him privileges once he finds a doctor who is willing to cover him when he is not available. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 1334. Doe 5 asked exactly one doctor to serve as his covering physician. That does not show that he \"could not find a covering physician,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2126, if he made other inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   The plurality justifies Doe 5's meager effort based on pure speculation. Because the one doctor Doe 5 asked had a transfer agreement with the Baton Rouge abortion clinic, the plurality reasons that \"Doe 5 could have reasonably thought that, if this doctor wouldn't serve as his covering physician, no one would.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , at 2126. The plurality goes on to say that \"it was well within the District Court's discretion to credit that reading of the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   This argument shows how far the plurality is willing to go to strike down the Louisiana law. The plurality relies on speculation about why Doe 5 made only one inquiry and why the District Court found this one inquiry sufficient. In fact, however, Doe 5 never explained why he asked only one doctor, and he never intimated that he gave up because that doctor had a transfer agreement with the clinic. Nor did the District Court rely on that inference in finding that Doe 5 exhibited good faith. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"694\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 75-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in any event, even if Doe 5 had a particularly strong reason to hope that the doctor he asked would agree to cover for him, it hardly follows that other inquiries would necessarily fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   Doe 5 applied for privileges at two other area hospitals, Lane and Baton Rouge, but he did not even call back to check on them because he thought his \"best chances for privileges [were] at Woman's Hospital,\" App. 1334, and he noted that Lane and Baton Rouge require that their doctors treat some indigent patients \"for free basically\" while opening themselves up to liability,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 1335. Also, Doe 5 explained, Lane is \"further away\" from the Delta Clinic than the other hospitals.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   To sum up Doe 5's situation: The challenged law would have no effect on him if he could find a covering doctor in Baton Rouge, but he asked only one doctor. He did little to pursue applications at two other hospitals because he was not optimistic about his chances and those hospitals required a certain amount of unpaid service to the poor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Doe 6\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Doe 6 is a Board-certified OB/GYN who practices at Women's Clinic in New Orleans. There are nine qualifying New Orleans-area hospitals, and according to his affidavit, Doe 6 made an informal inquiry at one and filed a formal application at another. The District Court found that he attempted in \"good faith\" to obtain admitting privileges even though Doe 6 did not testify and was never subjected to adversarial questioning. The only relevant information before the court were several paragraphs in Doe 6's declaration,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"695\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 1307-1313, and hearsay in the declaration of the Women's Clinic administrator,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 1119-1131; see also\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274126\" index=\"696\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/27/#p53\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 76-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   These questionable sources left many important questions unanswered, for example, why Doe 6 did not apply for privileges at Touro Hospital, where Doe 5, who also performs abortions at Women's Clinic, has privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   The plurality provides an explanation that is found nowhere in the record,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., that Doe 6 could not get privileges at Touro because, unlike Doe 5, who performs both surgical and medication abortions, Doe 6 performs only medication abortions.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , at 2127 - 2128. Not only is this pure speculation, but it is not evident why this difference might matter. The plurality notes that Doe 6's medication abortion patients have never been admitted to a hospital, but the plurality also argues that very few surgical abortion patients are admitted.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , at 2127 - 2128, 2131. If Doe 6 had testified or been deposed, he could have been asked about his decision not to apply at Touro, but that did not occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   Aside from Touro, there are eight other hospitals in the New Orleans area, but Doe 6 apparently made no attempt to get privileges at six of these, and nothing in the scant record explains why. He stated that he formally applied at East Jefferson Hospital and made an informal inquiry at Tulane Hospital, but much about these efforts is unknown. No representative from Tulane or East Jefferson testified or was deposed, and no documents relating to either application were offered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   With respect to Doe 6's informal inquiry at Tulane, all that the District Court had before it was a single paragraph in Doe 6's declaration in which he stated that he spoke to an unnamed individual and was told he should not bother to apply because he did not have the requisite number of admissions per year. App. 1310. Nothing in the record reveals the type of privileges about which Doe 6 inquired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   Doe 6 furnished even less information about his formal application to East Jefferson hospital-a hospital which offers courtesy privileges, and does not impose an admissions requirement for those privileges. Record 10679. In his declaration, which he signed in September 2014, Doe 6 wrote that he had applied but had not\n   received a response. App. 1311. A few weeks later, June Medical's counsel informed the District Court by letter that Doe 6 had complied with East Jefferson's request for additional information,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 54, but the record says nothing about any later developments. Presumably, East Jefferson did not grant privileges, but the record does not disclose why. Did Doe 6 provide all the information that the hospital requested and do everything else required by the application process? The record is silent, and the District Court was incurious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Doe 3\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Doe 3, who performs abortions at the June Medical clinic in Shreveport, would not be directly affected by Act 620 because he maintains privileges at two area hospitals, Christus Health and WKBC, but he stated that he would stop performing abortions if, as a result of that law, he was left as the only abortion doctor in the northern part of the State.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 236. Thus, if Doe 1 or Doe 2 got privileges and continued to perform abortions, Doe 3, according to his testimony, would remain as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Putting all this together, it is apparent that the record does not come close to showing that Doe 2, Doe 5, and Doe 6 made the sort of effort that one would expect if their ability to continue performing abortions had depended on success. These doctors had an incentive to do the bare minimum that they thought the judge would demand-and as it turned out, the judge did not demand much, not even an appearance in his courtroom. In short, the record does not show that Act 620 would drive any of these doctors out of abortion practice, and therefore the Act would not lead Doe 3 to leave either. It follows that the District Court's finding on Act 620's likely effects cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   The Court should remand this case for a new trial under the correct legal standards.

And it should require those challenging Act 620 to demonstrate that the doctors who lack admitting privileges attempted to obtain them with the same zeal they would have exhibited if the Act were in effect and they stood to lose by failing in those efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   On remand, the District Court should not permit June Medical to assert the rights of women wishing to obtain an abortion. The court should require the joinder of a plaintiff whose own rights are at stake. Our precedents rarely permit a plaintiff to assert the rights of a third party, and June Medical cannot satisfy our established test for third-party standing.

The plurality relies on a passing statement in a brief filed by the State in District Court in\n   connection with the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order, but the statement is simply an accurate statement of circuit precedent on the standing of abortion providers.

Like any other regulated entity, an abortion provider has a financial interest in avoiding burdensome regulations such as Act 620's admitting privileges requirement. Applying for privileges takes time and energy, and maintaining privileges may impose additional burdens. See App. 1335. Women seeking abortions, on the other hand, have an interest in the preservation of regulations that protect their health. The conflict inherent in such a situation is glaring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   Some may not see the conflict in this case because they are convinced that the admitting privileges requirement does nothing to promote safety and is really just a ploy. But an abortion provider's ability to assert the rights of women when it challenges ostensible safety regulations should not turn on the merits of its claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   The problem with the rule that the majority embraces is highlighted if we consider challenges to other safety regulations. Suppose, for example, that a clinic in a State that allows certified non-physicians to perform abortions claims that the State's certification requirements are too onerous and that they imperil the clinic's continued operation. Should the clinic be able to assert the rights of women in attacking this regulation, which the state lawmakers thought was important to protect women's health?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   When an abortion regulation is enacted for the asserted purpose of protecting the health of women, an abortion provider seeking to strike down that law should not be able to rely on the constitutional rights\n   of women. Like any other party unhappy with burdensome regulation, the provider should be limited to its own rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   This rule is supported by precedent and follows from general principles regarding conflicts of interest.

See App. 784-786. She will typically meet the abortion doctor for the first time just before the procedure, and if Doe 1's description is representative, their relationship consists of the doctor's telling the woman what he will do, offering to answer questions, informing her of his progress as the abortion is performed, and asking her to remain calm.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 688.

A state bar ethics committee filed a disciplinary proceeding in state court against a lawyer who had entered into an attorney-fee arrangement that was prohibited by a provision of the Black Lung Benefits Act. When the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the lawyer on the ground that the provision in question violated Black Lung claimants' constitutional right to counsel, both the bar ethics committee and the Department of Labor, which had intervened in state court, successfully petitioned for review in this Court.

See\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , at 2160 - 2165. Perhaps that is because only rejections for lack of \"professional competence or professional conduct\" need to be disclosed to the relevant federal database.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"783\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2060.12\">\n     45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 60.12\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 60.3 (2019).

He applied there for courtesy privileges, received letters instructing him to pick up a badge, and when he called to clarify the meaning of letters sent to him, an unnamed doctor supposedly told him that he should apply for \"some kind of a nonstaff caregiver type\" position, App. 725, and he then ceased all efforts to get courtesy staff privileges at Christus,\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    ., at 728.

Today, however, the plurality declares that the law before us holds no benefits for the public and bears too many social costs. All while sharing virtually nothing about the\n   facts that led the legislature to conclude otherwise. The law might as well have fallen from the sky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   Of course, that's hardly the case. In Act 620, Louisiana's legislature found that requiring abortion providers to hold admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they perform abortions would serve the public interest by protecting women's health and safety. Those in today's majority never bother to say so, but it turns out that Act 620's admitting privileges requirement for abortion providers tracks longstanding state laws governing physicians who perform relatively low-risk procedures like colonoscopies, Lasik eye surgeries, and steroid injections at ambulatory surgical centers. In fact, the Louisiana legislature passed Act 620 only after extensive hearings at which experts detailed how the Act would promote safer abortion treatment-by providing \"a more thorough evaluation mechanism of physician competency,\" promoting \"continuity of care\" following abortion, enhancing inter-physician communication, and preventing patient abandonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   Testifying physicians explained, for example, that abortions carry inherent risks including uterine perforation, hemorrhage, cervical laceration, infection, retained fetal body parts, and missed ectopic pregnancy. Unsurprisingly, those risks are minimized when the physician providing the abortion is competent. Yet, unlike hospitals which undertake rigorous credentialing processes, Louisiana's abortion clinics historically have done little to ensure provider competence. Clinics have failed to perform background checks or to inquire into the training of doctors they brought on board. Clinics have even hired physicians whose specialties were unrelated to abortion-including a radiologist and an ophthalmologist. Requiring hospital admitting privileges, witnesses testified, would help ensure that clinics hire competent professionals and provide a mechanism for ongoing peer review of physician proficiency. Loss of admitting privileges, as well, might signal a problem meriting further investigation by state officials. At least one Louisiana abortion provider's loss of admitting privileges following a patient's death alerted the state licensing board to questions about his competence, and ultimately resulted in restrictions on his practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   The legislature also heard testimony that Louisiana's clinics and the physicians who work in them have racked up dozens of citations for safety and ethical violations in recent years. Violations have included failing to use sterile equipment, maintaining unsanitary conditions, failing to monitor patients' vital signs, permitting improper administration of medications by unauthorized persons, and neglecting to obtain informed consent from patients. Some clinics have failed to maintain supplies of emergency medications and medical equipment for treating surgical complications. One clinic used single-use hoses and tubes on multiple patients, and the solution needed to sterilize instruments was changed so infrequently that it often had pieces of tissue floating in it. Hospital credentialing processes, witnesses suggested, could help prevent such violations. In the course of the credentialing process, physicians' prior safety lapses, including criminal violations and medical malpractice suits, would be revealed and investigated, and incompetent doctors might be weeded out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   The legislature heard, too, from affected women and emergency room physicians about clinic doctors' record of abandoning their patients. One woman testified that, while she was hemorrhaging, her abortion provider told her, \" 'You're on your own. Get out.' \" Eventually, the woman went to\n   a hospital where an emergency room physician removed fetal body parts that the abortion provider had left in her body. Another patient who complained of severe pain following her abortion was told simply to go home and lie down. When she decided for herself to go to the emergency room, physicians discovered a tear in her uterus and a large hematoma containing a fetal head. The woman required an emergency hysterectomy. In another case, a clinic physician allowed a patient to bleed for three hours, yet a clinic employee testified that the physician would not let her call 911 because of possible media involvement. In the end, the employee called anyway and emergency room personnel discovered that the woman had a perforated uterus and a needed a hysterectomy. A different physician explained that she routinely treats abortion complications in the emergency room when the physician who performed the abortion lacks admitting privileges. In her experience, that situation \"puts a woman's health at an unnecessary, unacceptable risk that results from a delay of care ... and a lack of continuity of care.\" Admitting privileges would mitigate these risks, she testified, because \"the physician who performed the procedure would be the one best equipped to evaluate and treat the patient.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   Nor did the legislature neglect to consider the law's potential burdens. As witnesses explained, the admitting privileges requirement in Act 620 for abortion clinic providers would parallel existing requirements for many physicians who work at ambulatory surgical centers. And there is no indication this parallel admitting privileges requirement has led to the closing of any surgical centers or otherwise presented obstacles to quality care in Louisiana. Further, legislators learned that at least one Louisiana abortion provider already had qualifying admitting privileges, suggesting other competent abortion providers would be able to comply with the new regulation as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   Since trial, the State continues to accrue evidence supporting Act 620, and the State has sought to lodge that evidence with this Court. In particular, the State has learned of additional safety violations at Louisiana clinics, including evidence of an abortion provider deviating from the standard of care in a way that can result in the live births of nonviable fetuses. The State has also proffered new evidence of potential criminal conduct by Louisiana abortion providers, including the failure to report the forcible rape of a minor and performing an abortion on a minor without parental consent or judicial bypass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   After overlooking so many facts and the deference owed to the legislative process, today's decision misapplies many of the rules that normally constrain the judicial process.

Normally, the fact that the plaintiffs do not even know who those women are would be enough to preclude third-party standing. This Court has held, for example, that a future \"\n   <em>\n    hypothetical\n   </em>\n   attorney-client relationship\" (as opposed to an \"\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   \" one) cannot confer third-party standing.\n   <em>\n    Kowalski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3441929\" index=\"846\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/125/#p129\">\n    543 U.S. at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3441929\" index=\"847\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/125/#p129\">\n    125 S.Ct. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If standing isn't present in cases like those, it is hard to see how it might be present in this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   Nor is that the end of the plaintiffs' standing problems. Even when a plaintiff can identify an actual and close relationship, this Court will normally refuse third-party standing if the plaintiff has a potential conflict of interest with the person whose rights are at issue. See\n   <em>\n    Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525260\" index=\"851\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/1/#p9\">\n    542 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15, 17-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525260\" index=\"852\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/1/#p9\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525260\" index=\"853\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/1/#p9\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). And it's pretty hard to ignore the potential for conflict here. After all, Louisiana's law expressly aims to protect women from the unsafe conditions maintained by at least some abortion providers who, like the plaintiffs, are either unwilling or unable to obtain admitting privileges. Cf.\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2166 - 2167 (ALITO, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   Seeking to set all these difficulties aside, today's decision contends that Louisiana has waived its prudential standing arguments. But in doing so, today's decision mistakes three more legal principles. First, what the plurality characterizes as a waiver\n   arises from the State's admission that applicable circuit law allowed the plaintiffs standing. At worst, that reflects a forfeiture of, or a failure to pursue, a possible argument against standing, not an affirmative waiver of the argument, or an intentional relinquishment of any interest in the issue. Cf.\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2165 - 2166 (ALITO, J., dissenting). Second, this Court typically relies on a forfeiture or even a waiver only if the issue was \" 'not pressed or passed upon' \" in the lower courts.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11727752\" index=\"854\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/36/#p41\">\n    504 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11727752\" index=\"855\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/36/#p41\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11727752\" index=\"856\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/36/#p41\">\n    118 L.Ed.2d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).

Generally, courts decide the constitutionality of statutes as applied to specific people in specific situations and disfavor facial challenges seeking to forestall a law's application in every circumstance. The reasons for this rule are many. Not least, when a court focuses on the parties before it, it is able to assess the law's application within a real factual context, rather than left to imagine \"every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Barrows v.

Importantly, too, as-applied challenges reduce the risk that a court will \"short circuit the democratic process\" by interfering with legislation any more than necessary to remedy a complaining party's injury.\n   <em>\n    Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675723\" index=\"865\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/442/#p451\">\n    552 U.S. 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675723\" index=\"866\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/442/#p451\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675723\" index=\"867\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/442/#p451\">\n    170 L.Ed.2d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   As a result, the path for a litigant pursuing a facial challenge is deliberately difficult.

Instead of asking whether the law has a \"substantial number of unconstitutional applications\" compared to its \"legitimate sweep,\" the plurality asks whether the law will impose a \" 'substantial obstacle' \" for a \" 'large fraction' \" of \" 'those women for whom the provision is\n   an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2132. Concededly, the two tests sound similar-after all, who could say whether a \"substantial number\" is more or less than a \"large fraction\"? But notice the switch at the end, where the plurality limits our focus to women for whom the law is an \"actual\" restriction. Because of that limitation, it doesn't matter how many women continue to have convenient access to abortions: Any woman not burdened by the challenged law is deemed \"irrelevant\" to the analysis. So instead of asking how the law's unconstitutional applications compare to its legitimate sweep, the plurality winds up asking only whether the law burdens a very large fraction of the people that it burdens. The words might sound familiar, but this circular test is unlike anything we apply to facial challenges anywhere else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   Abandoning our usual caution with facial challenges leads, predictably, to overbroad conclusions. Suppose that for a substantial number of women Louisiana's law imposes no burden at all. These women might live in an area well-served by well-qualified abortion providers who can easily obtain admitting privileges. No one could dispute the law is constitutional as applied to these women and providers. But suppose the law makes it difficult to obtain an abortion on the other side of the State, where qualified providers are fewer and farther between. Under the standard applied today, it seems the entire law would fall statewide, notwithstanding its undeniable constitutionality in many applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   Nor is this possibility farfetched. Today's decision declares the admitting privileges requirement unconstitutional even as applied to Does 3 and 5, each of whom holds admitting privileges. Not a single woman would be burdened by requiring these doctors to maintain the privileges they already have. Yet the State may not enforce the law even against them. In effect, the standard for facial challenges has been flipped on its head: Rather than requiring that a law be unconstitutional in all its applications to fall, today's decision requires that Louisiana's law be constitutional in all its applications to stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   Even when it comes to assessing the law's effects on the subset of women deemed \"relevant,\" this case proves unusual.

To justify injunctive relief on that theory, however, it can't be enough to show that the law would induce any particular doctor or clinic to stop providing abortions. Instead, the plaintiffs would have to show that a sufficient number of clinics would close (without enough new clinics opening) so that supply would no longer meet demand for abortion in the State.

Take the question whether existing providers will be able to continue their existing practices. On its way to predicting dire results, the plurality uncritically accepts that, if Act 620 went into effect, Doe 5 would be unable to obtain admitting privileges in Baton Rouge. The plurality does so even though it is undisputed that the sole remaining step for him to obtain privileges is to find a doctor willing to cover for him-and that Doe 5 gave up on that effort after asking only one doctor. Similarly, the plurality takes it as given that Doe 2 would be denied admitting privileges even though he dropped a pending application when the hospital simply sent him a request for additional information. Maybe these physicians didn't feel it was worth putting in much effort to obtain admitting privileges given their chances of prevailing in this lawsuit. But it \"taxes the credulity of the credulous\" to think they would have treated the process so lightly if their livelihood depended on securing admitting privileges.\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

Today's decision also appears to assume that, if Louisiana's law took effect, not a single hospital would amend its rules to permit abortion providers easier access to admitting privileges; no clinic would choose to relocate closer to a hospital that offers admitting privileges rather than permanently close its doors; the prospect of significant unmet demand would not prompt a single Louisiana doctor with established admitting privileges to begin performing abortions; and unmet demand would not induce even one out-of-state abortion provider to relocate to Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   All these assumptions are open to question. Hospitals can (and do) change their policies in response to regulations. Clinic operators have opened, closed, and relocated clinics numerous times. There are hundreds of OB/GYNs with active admitting privileges in Louisiana who could lawfully perform abortions tomorrow. Millions of Americans move between States every year to pursue their profession. Yet with conditions ripe for market entry and expansion, today's decision foresees nothing but clinic closures and unmet demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   Not only questionable, the plurality's assumptions are already contradicted by emerging evidence. For example, a major hospital reacted to the law by developing a new type of admitting privileges expressly for an abortion provider seeking to comply with Act 620. Whether this type of privileges satisfies the statute is yet unknown-so, again assuming the worst, today's decision simply ignores the possibility. If nothing else, this development belies the prediction that hospitals statewide would stand idly by as thousands upon thousands of requests for abortions go unfulfilled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   What's more, as this suit was in progress, the State discovered two additional Louisiana abortion providers not reflected in the district court's opinion. No one disputes the accuracy of the State's information about these two providers. Nor could anyone deny the importance of this information,\n   when so much of today's decision seems to turn on the exact quantity and distribution of a relatively small number of abortion providers. Normally, this Court might hesitate to deliver a fact-bound decision premised on facts we know to be incorrect. But today's decision, assuming the worst once more, simply proceeds as if these providers didn't exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   If there is a silver lining, though, it may be here. This Court generally recognizes that facts can change over time-and that, when they do, legal conclusions based on them may have to change as well.

And, given the fact-intensive nature of today's analysis, the relief directed might well need to be reconsidered below if, for example, hospitals start offering qualifying admitting privileges to abortion providers, a handful of abortion providers relocate from other States, or even a tiny fraction of Louisiana's existing OB/GYNs decide to begin performing abortions.

The plurality sides with the district court in concluding that the time and cost some women might have to endure to obtain an abortion outweighs the benefits of Act 620. Perhaps the plurality sees that answer as obvious, given its apparent conclusion that the Act would offer the public no benefits of any kind. But for its test to provide any helpful guidance, it must be capable of resolving cases the plurality can't so easily dismiss. Suppose, for example, a factfinder credited the State's evidence of medical benefit, finding that a small number of women would obtain safer medical care if the law went into effect. But suppose the same factfinder\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   credited a plaintiff's evidence of burden, finding that a large number of women would have to endure longer wait times and farther drives, and that a very small number of women would be unable to obtain an abortion at all. How is a judge supposed to balance, say, a few women's emergency hysterectomies against many women spending extra hours travelling to a clinic? The plurality's test offers no guidance. Nor can it. The benefits and burdens are incommensurable, and they do not teach such things in law school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   When judges take it upon themselves to assess the raw costs and benefits of a new law or regulation, it can come as no surprise that \"[s]ome courts wind up attaching the same significance to opposite facts,\" and even attaching the opposite significance to the same facts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"928\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It can come as no surprise, either, that judges retreat to their underlying assumptions or moral intuitions when deciding whether a burden is undue. For what else is left?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   Some judges have thrown up their hands at the task put to them by the Court in this area. If everything comes down to balancing costs against benefits, they have observed, \"the only institution that can give an authoritative answer\" is this Court, because the question isn't one of law at all and the only \"balance\" that matters is the one this Court strikes.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Ind. &amp; Ky. v. Box\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"929\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20F.3d%20997\">\n    949 F.3d 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 999 (CA7 2019) (Easterbrook, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc). The lament is understandable. Missing here is exactly what judges usually depend on when asked to make tough calls: an administrable legal rule to follow, a neutral principle, something outside themselves to guide their decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   Setting aside the other departures from the judicial process on display today, the concurrence suggests it can remedy at least this one. We don't need to resort to a raw balancing test to resolve today's dispute. A deeper respect for\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   and existing precedents, the concurrence assures us, supplies the key to a safe way out. Unfortunately, however, the reality proves more complicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   Start with the concurrence's discussion of\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   . Immediately after paying homage to\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   , the concurrence\n   <em>\n    refuses\n   </em>\n   to follow the all-things-considered balancing test that decision employed when striking down Texas's admitting privileges law. In the process, the concurrence rightly recounts many of the problems with raw balancing tests. But\n   then, switching directions again, the concurrence insists we are bound by an\n   <em>\n    alternative\n   </em>\n   holding in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   . According to the concurrence, this alternative holding declared that the Texas law imposed an impermissible \"substantial obstacle\" to abortion access in light\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   of the burdens the law imposed-\"independent of [any] discussion of [the law's] benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2138 - 2139 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). And, the concurrence concludes, because the facts of this suit look like those in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , we must find an impermissible substantial obstacle here too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   But in this footwork lie at least two missteps. For one, the facts of this suit cannot be so neatly reduced to\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   redux. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2153 - 2155;\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2157 - 2158, 2160 - 2166 (ALITO, J. dissenting). For another,\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   nowhere issued the alternative holding on which the concurrence pins its argument. At no point did the Court hold that the burdens imposed by the Texas law alone-divorced from any consideration of the law's benefits-could suffice to establish a substantial obstacle. To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   insisted that the substantial obstacle test \"\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits th[e] la[w] confer[s].\" 578 U. S., at ---- - ----, 136 S.Ct., at (emphasis added) (slip op., at 19-20). And whatever else respect for\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   might suggest, it cannot demand allegiance to a nonexistent ruling inconsistent with the approach actually taken by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   The concurrence's fallback argument doesn't solve the problem either. So what if\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   rejected the benefits-free version of the \"substantial obstacle\" test the concurrence endorses? The concurrence assures us that\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"930\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    505 U.S. 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"931\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"932\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), specified this form of the test, so we must (or at least may) do the same, whatever\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   says.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   But here again, the concurrence rests on at least one mistaken premise. In the context of laws implicating only the State's interest in fetal life previability, the\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   plurality did describe its \"undue burden\" test as asking whether the law in question poses a substantial obstacle to abortion access.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"933\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    505 U.S. at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"934\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But when a State enacts a law \"to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion,\" the\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   plurality added a key qualification: Only \"\n   <em>\n    [u]nnecessary\n   </em>\n   health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"935\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). That qualification is clearly applicable here, yet the concurrence nowhere addresses it, applying instead a new test of its own creation. In the context of medical regulations, too, the concurrence's new test might even prove stricter than strict scrutiny. After all, it's possible for a regulation to survive strict scrutiny if it is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest. And no one doubts that women's health can be such an interest. Yet, under the concurrence's test it seems possible that even the most compelling and narrowly tailored medical regulation would have to fail if it placed a substantial obstacle in the way of abortion access. Such a result would appear to create yet another discontinuity with\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   , which expressly disavowed any test as strict as strict scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"936\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"936\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    at 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"937\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p878\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   To arrive at today's result, rules must be brushed aside and shortcuts taken. While the concurrence parts ways with the plurality at the last turn, the road both travel leads us to a strangely open space, unconstrained\n   by many of the neutral principles that normally govern the judicial process. The temptation to proceed this direction, closer with each step toward an unobstructed exercise of will, may be always with us, a danger inherent in judicial review. But it is an impulse this Court normally strives mightily to resist. Today, in a highly politicized and contentious arena, we prove unwilling, or perhaps unable, to resist that temptation.

A different five Members of the Court conclude that Louisiana's admitting-privileges law is unconstitutional because it \"would restrict women's access to abortion to the same degree as\" the Texas law in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , at 2139 - 2140 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.

But I respectfully dissent from the second because, in my view, additional factfinding is necessary to properly evaluate Louisiana's law. As Justice ALITO thoroughly and carefully explains, the factual record at this stage of plaintiffs' facial, pre-enforcement challenge does not adequately demonstrate that the three relevant doctors (Does 2, 5, and 6) cannot obtain admitting privileges or, therefore, that any of the three Louisiana abortion clinics would close as a result of the admitting-privileges law. I expressed the same concern about the incomplete factual record more than a year ago during the stay proceedings, and the factual record has not changed since then. See\n   <em>\n    June Medical Services, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gee\n   </em>\n   , 586 U.
