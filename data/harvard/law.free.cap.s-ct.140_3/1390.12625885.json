Eventually, 10 jurors found the evidence against him persuasive. But a pair of jurors believed that the State of Louisiana had failed to prove Mr. Ramos's guilt beyond reasonable doubt; they voted to acquit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 48 States and federal court, a single juror's vote to acquit is enough to prevent a conviction. But not in Louisiana. Along with Oregon, Louisiana has long punished people based on 10-to-2 verdicts like the one here. So instead of the mistrial he would have received almost anywhere else, Mr. Ramos was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Why do Louisiana and Oregon allow nonunanimous convictions? Though it's hard to say why these laws persist, their origins are clear. Louisiana first endorsed nonunanimous verdicts for serious crimes at a constitutional convention in 1898. According to one committee chairman, the avowed purpose of that convention was to \"establish the supremacy of the white race,\" and the resulting document included many of the trappings of the Jim Crow era: a poll tax, a combined literacy and property ownership test, and a grandfather clause that in practice exempted white residents from the most onerous of these requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nor was it only the prospect of African-Americans voting that concerned the delegates. Just a week before the convention, the U. S. Senate passed a resolution calling for an investigation into whether Louisiana was systemically excluding African-Americans from juries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Seeking to avoid unwanted national attention, and aware that this Court would strike down any policy of overt discrimination against African-American jurors as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the delegates sought to undermine African-American participation on juries in another way. With a careful eye on racial demographics, the convention delegates sculpted a \"facially race-neutral\" rule permitting 10-to-2 verdicts in order \"to ensure that African-American juror service would be meaningless.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Adopted in the 1930s, Oregon's rule permitting nonunanimous verdicts can be similarly traced to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and efforts to dilute \"the influence of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities on Oregon juries.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, no one before us contests any of this; courts in both Louisiana and Oregon have frankly acknowledged that race was a motivating factor in the adoption of their States' respective nonunanimity rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We took this case to decide whether the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial-as incorporated against the States by way of the Fourteenth Amendment-requires a unanimous verdict to convict a defendant of a serious offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Louisiana insists that\n   this Court has never definitively passed on the question and urges us to find its practice consistent with the Sixth Amendment. By contrast, the dissent doesn't try to defend Louisiana's law on Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment grounds; tacitly, it seems to admit that the Constitution forbids States from using nonunanimous juries. Yet, unprompted by Louisiana, the dissent suggests our precedent requires us to rule for the State anyway. What explains all this? To answer the puzzle, it's necessary to say a bit more about the merits of the question presented, the relevant precedent, and, at last, the consequences that follow from saying what we know to be true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Sixth Amendment promises that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.\" The Amendment goes on to preserve other rights for criminal defendants but says nothing else about what a \"trial by an impartial jury\" entails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Still, the promise of a jury trial surely meant\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   -otherwise, there would have been no reason to write it down. Nor would it have made any sense to spell out the places from which jurors should be drawn if their powers as jurors could be freely abridged by statute. Imagine a constitution that allowed a \"jury trial\" to mean nothing but a single person rubberstamping convictions without hearing any evidence-but simultaneously insisting that the lone juror come from a specific judicial district \"previously ascertained by law.\" And if that's not enough, imagine a constitution that included the same hollow guarantee\n   <em>\n    twice\n   </em>\n   -not only in the Sixth Amendment, but also in Article III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   No: The text and structure of the Constitution clearly suggest that the term \"trial by an impartial jury\" carried with it\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   meaning about the content and requirements of a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   One of these requirements was unanimity. Wherever we might look to determine what the term \"trial by an impartial jury trial\" meant at the time of the Sixth Amendment's adoption-whether it's the common law, state practices in the founding era, or opinions and treatises written soon afterward-the answer is unmistakable. A jury must reach a unanimous verdict in order to convict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The requirement of juror unanimity emerged in 14th century England and was soon accepted as a vital right protected by the common law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Blackstone explained, no person could be found guilty of a serious crime unless \"the truth of every accusation ... should ... be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbors, indifferently chosen, and superior to all suspicion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   A \" 'verdict, taken from eleven, was no verdict' \" at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This same rule applied in the young American States. Six State Constitutions explicitly required unanimity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another four preserved the right to a jury trial in more general terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the variations did not matter much; consistent with the common law, state courts appeared to regard unanimity as an essential feature of the jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It was against this backdrop that James Madison drafted and the States ratified the Sixth Amendment in 1791. By that time, unanimous verdicts had been required for about 400 years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the term \"trial by an impartial jury\" carried any meaning at all, it surely included a requirement as long and widely accepted as unanimity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Influential, postadoption treatises confirm this understanding. For example, in 1824, Nathan Dane reported as fact that the U. S. Constitution required unanimity in criminal jury trials for serious offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few years later, Justice Story explained in his Commentaries on the Constitution that \"in common cases, the law not only presumes every man innocent, until he is proved guilty; but unanimity in the verdict of the jury is indispensable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similar statements can be found in American legal treatises throughout the 19th century.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nor is this a case where the original public meaning was lost to time and only recently recovered. This Court has, repeatedly and over many years, recognized that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimity. As early as 1898, the Court said that a defendant enjoys a \"constitutional right to demand that his liberty should not be taken from him except by the joint action of the court and the unanimous\n   verdict of a jury of twelve persons.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few decades later, the Court elaborated that the Sixth Amendment affords a right to \"a trial by jury as understood and applied at common law, ... includ[ing] all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and England when the Constitution was adopted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, the Court observed, this includes a requirement \"that the verdict should be unanimous.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   In all, this Court has commented on the Sixth Amendment's unanimity requirement no fewer than 13 times over more than 120 years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There can be no question either that the Sixth Amendment's unanimity requirement applies to state and federal criminal trials equally. This Court has long explained that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is \"fundamental to the American scheme of justice\" and incorporated against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has long explained, too, that incorporated provisions of the Bill of Rights bear the same content when asserted against States as they do when asserted against the federal government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   So if the Sixth Amendment's right to a jury trial requires a unanimous verdict to support a conviction in federal court, it requires no less in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   How, despite these seemingly straightforward principles, have Louisiana's and Oregon's laws managed to hang on for so long? It turns out that the Sixth Amendment's otherwise simple story took a strange turn in 1972. That year, the Court confronted these States' unconventional schemes for the first time-in\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a companion case,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Louisiana\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the Court could do no more than issue a badly fractured set of opinions. Four dissenting Justices would not have hesitated to strike down the States' laws, recognizing that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimity and that this guarantee is fully applicable against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But a four-Justice plurality took a very different view of the Sixth Amendment. These Justices declared that the real question before them was whether unanimity serves an important \"function\" in \"contemporary society.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, having reframed the question, the plurality wasted few words before concluding that unanimity's costs outweigh its benefits in the modern era, so the Sixth Amendment should not stand in the way of Louisiana or Oregon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The ninth Member of the Court adopted a position that was neither here nor there. On the one hand, Justice Powell agreed that, as a matter of \"history and precedent, ... the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous jury verdict to convict.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, on the other hand, he argued that the Fourteenth Amendment does not render this guarantee against the federal government fully applicable against the States. In this way, Justice Powell doubled down on his belief in \"dual-track\" incorporation-the idea that a single right can mean two different things depending on whether it is being invoked against the federal or a state government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Justice Powell acknowledged that his argument for dual-track incorporation came \"late in the day.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Late it was. The Court had already, nearly a decade earlier, \"rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a 'watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   It's a point we've restated many times since, too, including as recently as last year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, Justice Powell frankly explained, he was \"unwillin[g]\" to follow the Court's precedents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   So he offered up the essential fifth vote to uphold Mr. Apodaca's conviction-if based only on a view of the Fourteenth Amendment that he knew was (and remains) foreclosed by precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the years following\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   , both Louisiana and Oregon chose to continue allowing nonunanimous verdicts. But their practices have always stood on shaky ground. After all, while Justice Powell's vote secured a favorable judgment for the States in\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   , it's never been clear what rationale could support a similar result in future cases. Only two possibilities exist: Either the Sixth Amendment allows nonunanimous verdicts, or the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial applies with less force to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment. Yet, as we've seen, both bear their problems. In\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   itself, a majority of Justices-including Justice Powell-recognized that the Sixth\n   Amendment demands unanimity, just as our cases have long said. And this Court's precedents, both then and now, prevent the Court from applying the Sixth Amendment to the States in some mutated and diminished form under the Fourteenth Amendment. So what could we possibly describe as the \"holding\" of\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Really, no one has found a way to make sense of it. In later cases, this Court has labeled\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   an \"exception,\" \"unusual,\" and in any event \"not an endorsement\" of Justice Powell's view of incorporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, we have continued to recognize the historical need for unanimity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   We've been studiously ambiguous, even inconsistent, about what\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   might mean.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   To its credit, Louisiana acknowledges the problem. The State expressly tells us it is not \"asking the Court to accord Justice Powell's solo opinion in\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   precedential force.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, in an effort to win today's case, Louisiana embraces the idea that everything is up for grabs. It contends that this Court has never definitively ruled on the propriety of nonunanimous juries under the Sixth Amendment-and that we should use this case to hold for the first time that nonunanimous juries are permissible in state and federal courts alike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Louisiana's approach may not be quite as tough as trying to defend Justice Powell's dual-track theory of incorporation, but it's pretty close. How does the State deal with the fact this Court has said 13 times over 120 years that the Sixth Amendment\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   require unanimity? Or the fact that five Justices in\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   said the same? The best the State can offer is to suggest that all these statements came in dicta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But even supposing (without granting) that Louisiana is right and it's dicta all the way down, why would the Court now walk away from many of its own statements about the Constitution's meaning? And what about the prior 400 years of English and American cases requiring unanimity-should we dismiss all those as dicta too?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Sensibly, Louisiana doesn't dispute that the common law required unanimity. Instead, it argues that the drafting history of the Sixth Amendment reveals an intent by the framers to leave this particular feature behind. The State points to the fact that Madison's proposal for the Sixth Amendment originally read: \"The trial of all crimes ... shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage, with the requisite of unanimity for conviction, of the right of challenge, and other accustomed requisites....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Louisiana notes that the House of Representatives approved this text with minor modifications. Yet, the State stresses, the Senate replaced \"impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage\" with \"impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed\" and also removed the explicit references to unanimity, the right of challenge, and \"other accustomed requisites.\" In light of these revisions, Louisiana would have us infer an intent to abandon the common law's traditional unanimity requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But this snippet of drafting history could just as easily support the opposite inference. Maybe the Senate deleted the language about unanimity, the right of challenge, and \"other accustomed prerequisites\" because all this was so plainly included in the promise of a \"trial by an impartial jury\" that Senators considered the language surplusage. The truth is that we have little contemporaneous evidence shedding light on why the Senate acted as it did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   So rather than dwelling on text left on the cutting room floor, we are much better served by interpreting the language Congress retained and the States ratified. And, as we've seen, at the time of the Amendment's adoption, the right to a jury trial\n   <em>\n    meant\n   </em>\n   a trial in which the jury renders a unanimous verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Further undermining Louisiana's inference about the drafting history is the fact it proves too much. If the Senate's deletion of the word \"unanimity\" changed the meaning of the text that remains, then the same would seemingly have to follow for the other deleted words as well. So it's not just unanimity that died in the Senate, but all the \"other accustomed requisites\" associated with the common law jury trial right-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    everything\n   </em>\n   history might have taught us about what it means to have a jury trial. Taking the State's argument from drafting history to its logical conclusion would thus leave the right to a \"trial by jury\" devoid of meaning. A right mentioned twice in the Constitution would be reduced to an empty promise. That can't be right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Faced with this hard fact, Louisiana's only remaining option is to invite us to distinguish between the historic features of common law jury trials that (we think) serve \"important enough\" functions to migrate silently into the Sixth Amendment\n   and those that don't. And, on the State's account, we should conclude that unanimity isn't worthy enough to make the trip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But to see the dangers of Louisiana's overwise approach, there's no need to look any further than\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   itself. There, four Justices, pursuing the functionalist approach Louisiana espouses, began by describing the \" 'essential' \" benefit of a jury trial as \" 'the interposition ... of the commonsense judgment of a group of laymen' \" between the defendant and the possibility of an \" 'overzealous prosecutor.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   And measured against that muddy yardstick, they quickly concluded that requiring 12 rather than 10 votes to convict offers no meaningful improvement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Meanwhile, these Justices argued, States have good and important reasons for dispensing with unanimity, such as seeking to reduce the rate of hung juries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Who can profess confidence in a breezy cost-benefit analysis like that? Lost in the accounting are the racially discriminatory\n   <em>\n    reasons\n   </em>\n   that Louisiana and Oregon adopted their peculiar rules in the first place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   What's more, the plurality never explained why the promised benefit of abandoning unanimity-reducing the rate of hung juries-always scores as a credit, not a cost. But who can say whether any particular hung jury is a waste, rather than an example of a jury doing exactly what the plurality said it should-deliberating carefully and safeguarding against overzealous prosecutions? And what about the fact, too, that some studies suggest that the elimination of unanimity has only a small effect on the rate of hung juries?\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Or the fact that others profess to have found that requiring unanimity may provide other possible benefits, including more open-minded and more thorough deliberations?\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   It seems the\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   plurality never even conceived of such possibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Our real objection here isn't that the\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   plurality's cost-benefit analysis was too skimpy. The deeper problem is that the plurality subjected the ancient guarantee of a unanimous jury verdict to its own functionalist assessment in the\n   first place. And Louisiana asks us to repeat the error today, just replacing\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   's functionalist assessment with our own updated version. All this overlooks the fact that, at the time of the Sixth Amendment's adoption, the right to trial by jury\n   <em>\n    included\n   </em>\n   a right to a unanimous verdict. When the American people chose to enshrine that right in the Constitution, they weren't suggesting fruitful topics for future cost-benefit analyses. They were seeking to ensure that their children's children would enjoy the same hard-won liberty they enjoyed. As judges, it is not our role to reassess whether the right to a unanimous jury is \"important enough\" to retain. With humility, we must accept that this right may serve purposes evading our current notice. We are entrusted to preserve and protect that liberty, not balance it away aided by no more than social statistics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   If Louisiana's path to an affirmance is a difficult one, the dissent's is trickier still. The dissent doesn't dispute that the Sixth Amendment protects the right to a unanimous jury verdict, or that the Fourteenth Amendment extends this right to state-court trials. But, it insists, we must affirm Mr. Ramos's conviction anyway. Why? Because the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   supposedly commands it. There are two independent reasons why that answer falls short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the first place and as we've seen, not even Louisiana tries to suggest that\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   supplies a governing precedent. Remember, Justice Powell agreed that the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous verdict to convict, so he would have no objection to that aspect of our holding today. Justice Powell reached a different result only by relying on a dual-track theory of incorporation that a majority of the Court had already rejected (and continues to reject). And to accept\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   reasoning as precedential, we would have to embrace a new and dubious proposition: that a single Justice writing only for himself has the authority to bind this Court to propositions it has already rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This is not the rule, and for good reason-it would do more to destabilize than honor precedent. To see how, consider a\n   hypothetical. Suppose we face a question of first impression under the Fourth Amendment: whether a State must obtain a warrant before reading a citizen's email in the hands of an Internet provider and using that email as evidence in a criminal trial. Imagine this question splits the Court, with four Justices finding the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant and four Justices finding no such requirement. The ninth Justice agrees that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, but takes an idiosyncratic view of the consequences of violating that right. In her view, the exclusionary rule has gone too far, and should only apply when the defendant is prosecuted for a felony. Because the case before her happens to involve only a misdemeanor, she provides the ninth vote to affirm a conviction based on evidence secured by a warrantless search. Of course, this Court has longstanding precedent requiring the suppression of all evidence obtained in unconstitutional searches and seizures.\n   <em>\n    Mapp v.

But like Justice Powell, our hypothetical ninth Justice sticks to her view and expressly rejects this Court's precedent. Like Justice Powell, this Justice's vote would be essential to the judgment. So if, as the dissent suggests,\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   is enough to displace precedent, would\n   <em>\n    Mapp\n   </em>\n   's exclusionary rule now be limited to felony prosecutions?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Admittedly, this example comes from our imagination. It has to, because no case has before suggested that a single Justice may overrule precedent. But if the Court were to embrace the dissent's view of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   , it would not stay imaginary for long. Every occasion on which the Court is evenly split would present an opportunity for single Justices to overturn precedent to bind future majorities. Rather than advancing the goals of predictability and reliance lying behind the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   , such an approach would impair them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The dissent contends that, in saying this much, we risk defying\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   , when \"a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, 'the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   But notice that the dissent never actually gets around to telling us which opinion in\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   it considers to be the narrowest and controlling one under\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   -or why. So while the dissent worries that we defy a\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   precedent, it is oddly coy about where exactly that precedent might be found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The parties recognize what the dissent does not:\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   has nothing to do with this case. Unlike a\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   dispute where the litigants duel over which opinion represents the narrowest and controlling one, the parties before us accept that\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   yielded no controlling opinion at all. In particular, both sides admit that Justice Powell's opinion cannot bind us-precisely because he relied on a dual-track rule of incorporation that an unbroken line of majority opinions before and after\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   has rejected. Still, the dissent presses the issue, suggesting that a single Justice's opinion\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   overrule prior precedents under \"the logic\" of\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, as the dissent itself implicitly acknowledges,\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   never sought to offer or defend such a rule. And, as we have seen, too, a\n   rule like that would do more to harm than advance\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The dissent's backup argument fares no better. In the end, even the dissent is forced to concede that Justice Powell's\n   <em>\n    reasoning\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   lacks controlling force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   So far, so good. But then the dissent suggests\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   somehow still manages to supply a controlling precedent as to its\n   <em>\n    result\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Look closely, though. The dissent's account of\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    result\n   </em>\n   looks suspiciously like the\n   <em>\n    reasoning\n   </em>\n   of Justice Powell's opinion: \"In\n   <em>\n    Apodaca,\n   </em>\n   this means that when (1) a defendant is convicted in state court, (2) at least 10 of the 12 jurors vote to convict, and (3) the defendant argues that the conviction violates the Constitution because the vote was not unanimous, the challenge fails.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Where does the convenient \"state court\" qualification come from? Neither the\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   plurality nor the dissent included any limitation like that-their opinions turned on the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. What the dissent characterizes as\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   's result turns out to be nothing more than Justice Powell's reasoning about dual-track incorporation dressed up to look like a logical proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   All of this does no more than highlight an old truth. It is usually a judicial decision's reasoning-its\n   <em>\n    ratio\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    decidendi\n   </em>\n   -that allows it to have life and effect in the disposition of future cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   As this Court has repeatedly explained in the context of summary affirmances, \" 'unexplicated' \" decisions may \" 'settl[e] the issues for the parties, [but they are] not to be read as a renunciation by this Court of doctrines previously announced in our opinions.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Much the same may be said here.\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   's judgment line resolved that case for the parties in that case. It is binding in that sense. But stripped from any reasoning, its judgment alone cannot be read to repudiate this Court's repeated pre-existing teachings on the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   There's another obstacle the dissent must overcome. Even if we accepted\n   the premise that\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   established a precedent, no one on the Court today is prepared to say it was rightly decided, and\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   isn't supposed to be the art of methodically ignoring what everyone knows to be true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of course, the precedents of this Court warrant our deep respect as embodying the considered views of those who have come before. But\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   has never been treated as \"an inexorable command.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the doctrine is \"at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   because a mistaken judicial interpretation of that supreme law is often \"practically impossible\" to correct through other means.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   To balance these considerations, when it revisits a precedent this Court has traditionally considered \"the quality of the decision's reasoning; its consistency with related decisions; legal developments since the decision; and reliance on the decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, each factor points in the same direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Start with the quality of the reasoning. Whether we look to the plurality opinion or Justice Powell's separate concurrence,\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   was gravely mistaken; again, no Member of the Court today defends either as rightly decided. Without repeating what we've already explained in detail, it's just an implacable fact that the plurality spent almost no time grappling with the historical meaning of the Sixth Amendment's jury trial right, this Court's long-repeated statements that it demands unanimity, or the racist origins of Louisiana's and Oregon's laws. Instead, the plurality subjected the Constitution's jury trial right to an incomplete functionalist analysis of its own creation for which it spared one paragraph. And, of course, five Justices expressly rejected the plurality's conclusion that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimity. Meanwhile, Justice Powell refused to follow this Court's incorporation precedents. Nine Justices (including Justice Powell) recognized this for what it was; eight called it an error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Looking to\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   's consistency with related decisions and recent legal developments compounds the reasons for concern.\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   sits uneasily with 120 years of preceding case law. Given how unmoored it was from the start, it might seem unlikely that later developments could have done more to undermine the decision. Yet they have. While Justice Powell's dual-track theory of incorporation was already foreclosed in 1972, some at that time still argued that it might have a role to play outside the realm of criminal procedure. Since then, the Court has held otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Until recently, dual-track incorporation attracted at least a measure of support in dissent. But this Court has now roundly rejected it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor has the plurality's rejection\n   of the Sixth Amendment's historical unanimity requirement aged more gracefully. As we've seen, in the years since\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   , this Court has spoken inconsistently about its meaning-but nonetheless referred to the traditional unanimity requirement on at least eight occasions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of all this, calling\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   an outlier would be perhaps too suggestive of the possibility of company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   When it comes to reliance interests, it's notable that neither Louisiana nor Oregon claims anything like the prospective economic, regulatory, or social disruption litigants seeking to preserve precedent usually invoke. No one, it seems, has signed a contract, entered a marriage, purchased a home, or opened a business based on the expectation that, should a crime occur, at least the accused may be sent away by a 10-to-2 verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does anyone suggest that nonunanimous verdicts have \"become part of our national culture.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would be quite surprising if they had, given that nonunanimous verdicts are insufficient to convict in 48 States and federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Instead, the only reliance interests that might be asserted here fall into two categories. The first concerns the fact Louisiana and Oregon may need to retry defendants convicted of felonies by nonunanimous verdicts whose cases are still pending on direct appeal. The dissent claims that this fact supplies the winning argument for retaining\n   <em>\n    Apodaca\n   </em>\n   because it has generated \"enormous reliance interests\" and overturning the case would provoke a \"crushing\" \"tsunami\" of follow-on litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The overstatement may be forgiven as intended for dramatic effect, but prior convictions in only two States are potentially affected by our judgment. Those States credibly claim that the number of nonunanimous felony convictions still on direct appeal are somewhere in the hundreds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   and retrying or plea bargaining these cases will surely impose a cost. But new rules of criminal procedures usually do, often affecting significant numbers of pending cases across the whole country. For example, after\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines must be advisory rather than mandatory, this Court vacated and remanded nearly 800 decisions to the courts of appeals. Similar consequences likely followed when\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   overturned prior interpretations of the Confrontation Clause\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gant\n   </em>\n   changed the law for searches incident to arrests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our decision here promises to cause less, and certainly nothing before us supports the dissent's surmise that it will\n   cause wildly more, disruption than these other decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The second and related reliance interest the dissent seizes upon involves the interest Louisiana and Oregon have in the security of their final criminal judgments. In light of our decision today, the dissent worries that defendants whose appeals are already complete might seek to challenge their nonunanimous convictions through collateral (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   habeas) review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But again the worries outstrip the facts. Under\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   , newly recognized rules of criminal procedure do not normally apply in collateral review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   True,\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   left open the possibility of an exception for \"watershed rules\" \"implicat[ing] the fundamental fairness [and accuracy] of the trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, as this language suggests,\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   's test is a demanding one, so much so that this Court has yet to announce a new rule of criminal procedure capable of meeting it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the test is demanding by design, expressly calibrated to address the reliance interests States have in the finality of their criminal judgments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Nor is the\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   question even before us. Whether the right to jury unanimity applies to cases on collateral review is a question for a future case where the parties will have a chance to brief the issue and we will benefit from their adversarial presentation. That litigation is sure to come, and will rightly take into account the States' interest in the finality of their criminal convictions. In this way,\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   frees us to say what we know to be true about the rights of the accused under our Constitution today, while leaving questions about the reliance interest States possess in their final judgments for later proceedings crafted to account for them. It would hardly make sense to ignore that two-step process and count the State's reliance interests in final judgments both here and again there. Certainly the dissent cites no authority for such double counting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Instead, the dissent suggests that the feeble reliance interests it identifies should get a boost because the right to a unanimous jury trial has \"little practical importance going forward.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the dissent's telling, Louisiana has \"abolished\" nonunanimous verdicts and Oregon \"seemed on the verge of doing the same until the Court intervened.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, as the dissent itself concedes, a ruling for Louisiana would invite other States to relax their own unanimity requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, 14 jurisdictions have already told us that they would value the right to \"experiment\" with nonunanimous juries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   Besides, Louisiana's law bears only prospective effect, so the State continues to allow nonunanimous verdicts for crimes committed before 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   And while the dissent speculates that our grant of certiorari contributed to the failure of legal reform efforts in Oregon, its citation does not support its surmise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   No doubt, too, those who risk being subjected to nonunanimous juries in Louisiana and Oregon today, and elsewhere tomorrow, would dispute the dissent's suggestion that their Sixth Amendment rights are of \"little practical importance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   That point suggests another. In its valiant search for reliance interests, the dissent somehow misses maybe the most important one: the reliance interests of the American people. Taken at its word, the dissent would have us discard a Sixth Amendment right in perpetuity rather than ask two States to retry a slice of their prior criminal cases. Whether that slice turns out to be large or small, it cannot outweigh the interest we all share in the preservation of our constitutionally promised liberties. Indeed, the dissent can cite no case in which the one-time need to retry defendants has\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   been sufficient to inter a constitutional right forever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the final accounting, the dissent's\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   arguments round to zero. We have an admittedly mistaken decision, on a constitutional issue, an outlier on the day it was decided, one that's become lonelier with time. In arguing otherwise, the dissent must elide the reliance the American people place in their constitutionally protected liberties, overplay the competing interests of two States, count some of those interests twice, and make no small amount of new precedent all its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On what ground would anyone have us leave Mr. Ramos in prison for the rest of his life? Not a single Member of this Court is prepared to say Louisiana secured his conviction constitutionally under the Sixth Amendment. No one before us suggests that the error was harmless. Louisiana does not claim precedent commands an affirmance. In the end, the best anyone can seem to muster against Mr. Ramos is that, if we dared to admit in his case what we all know to be true about the Sixth Amendment, we might have to say the same in some others. But where is the justice in that? Every judge must learn to live with the fact he or she will make some mistakes; it comes with the territory. But it is something else entirely to perpetuate something we all know to be wrong only because we fear the consequences of being right. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-262\">\n    Official Journal of the Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Louisiana 374 (H.

For example, during a two decade period in the late 17th century, the Carolinas experimented with a non-common law system designed to encourage a feudal social structure; this \"reactionary\" constitution permitted conviction by majority vote. See Carolina Const., Art. 69 (1669), in 5 Thorpe 2781; Reinsch, The English Common Law in the Early American Colonies, in 1 Select Essays in Anglo-American Legal History 407 (1907).

In particular, the dissent reminds us that, at points and places in our history, women were not permitted to sit on juries. See\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at 1433 - 1434. But we hardly need\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    's functionalism to avoid repeating that wrong. Unlike the rule of unanimity, rules about who qualified as a defendant's \"peer\" varied considerably at common law at the time of the Sixth Amendment's adoption. Reflecting that fact, the Judiciary Act of 1789-adopted by the same Congress that passed the Sixth Amendment-initially pegged the qualifications for federal jury service to the relevant state jury qualification requirements.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%2088\">\n     1 Stat. 88\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The Framers of our Constitution understood that the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    is part of the \"judicial Power\" and rooted in Article III of the Constitution. Writing in Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton emphasized the importance of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    : To \"avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable\" that federal judges \"should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them.\" The Federalist No. 78, p. 529 (J.

That is because Congress and the President can alter a statutory precedent by enacting new legislation. To be sure, enacting new legislation requires finding room in a crowded legislative docket and securing the agreement of the House, the Senate (in effect, 60 Senators), and the President. Both by design and as a matter of fact, enacting new legislation is difficult-and far more difficult than the Court's cases sometimes seem to assume. Nonetheless, the Court has ordinarily left the updating or correction of erroneous statutory precedents to the legislative process. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kimble v.

To overrule, the Court demands a special justification or strong grounds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    But the \"special justification\" or \"strong grounds\" formulation elides a key question: What constitutes a special justification or strong grounds?\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    In other words, in deciding whether to overrule an erroneous constitutional decision, how does the Court know when to overrule and when to stand pat?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    As the Court has exercised the \"judicial Power\" over time, the Court has identified various\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    factors. In articulating and applying those factors, the Court has, to borrow James Madison's words, sought to liquidate and ascertain the meaning of the Article III \"judicial Power\" with respect to precedent. The Federalist No. 37, at 236.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    factors identified by the Court in its past cases include:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n    \u2022 the quality of the precedent's reasoning;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    \u2022 the precedent's consistency and coherence with previous or subsequent decisions;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    \u2022 changed law since the prior decision;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    \u2022 changed facts since the prior decision;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n    \u2022 the workability of the precedent;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n    \u2022 the reliance interests of those who have relied on the precedent; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n    \u2022 the age of the precedent.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    But the Court has articulated and applied those various individual factors without establishing any consistent methodology or roadmap for how to analyze all of the factors taken together. And in my view, that muddle poses a problem for the rule of law and for this Court, as the Court attempts to apply\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    principles in a neutral and consistent manner.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    As I read the Court's cases on precedent, those varied and somewhat elastic\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    factors fold into three broad considerations that, in my view, can help guide the inquiry and help determine what constitutes a \"special justification\" or \"strong grounds\" to overrule a prior constitutional decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n    , is the prior decision not just wrong, but grievously or egregiously wrong? A garden-variety error or disagreement does not suffice to overrule. In the view of the Court that is considering whether to overrule, the precedent must be egregiously wrong as a matter of law in order for the Court to overrule it. In conducting that inquiry, the Court may examine the quality of the precedent's reasoning, consistency and coherence with other decisions, changed law, changed facts, and\n    workability, among other factors.

This consideration focuses on the legitimate expectations of those who have reasonably relied on the precedent. In conducting that inquiry, the Court may examine a variety of reliance interests and the age of the precedent, among other factors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    In short, the first consideration requires inquiry into how wrong the precedent is as a matter of law. The second and third considerations together demand, in Justice Jackson's words, a \"sober appraisal of the disadvantages of the innovation as well as those of the questioned case, a weighing of practical effects of one against the other.\" Jackson, 30 A. B. A. J., at 334.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Those three considerations together provide a structured methodology and roadmap for determining whether to overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent. The three considerations correspond to the Court's historical practice and encompass the various individual factors that the Court has applied over the years as part of the\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    calculus. And they are consistent with the Founding understanding and, for example, Blackstone's shorthand description that overruling is warranted when (and only when) a precedent is \"manifestly absurd or unjust.\" 1 Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, at 70.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Taken together, those three considerations set a high (but not insurmountable) bar for overruling a precedent, and they therefore limit the number of overrulings and maintain stability in the law.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Those three considerations also constrain judicial discretion in deciding when to overrule an erroneous precedent. To be sure, applying those considerations is not a purely mechanical exercise, and I do not claim otherwise. I suggest only that those three considerations may better structure how to consider the many traditional\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    factors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    It is inevitable that judges of good faith applying the\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    considerations will sometimes disagree about when to overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent, as the Court does in this case. To begin with, judges may disagree about whether a prior decision is wrong in the first place-and importantly, that disagreement is sometimes the\n    <em>\n     real\n    </em>\n    dispute when judges joust over\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    . But even when judges agree that a prior decision\n    is wrong, they may disagree about whether the decision is so egregiously wrong as to justify an overruling. Judges may likewise disagree about the severity of the jurisprudential or real-world consequences caused by the erroneous decision and, therefore, whether the decision is worth overruling. In that regard, some judges may think that the negative consequences can be addressed by narrowing the precedent (or just living with it) rather than outright overruling it. Judges may also disagree about how to measure the relevant reliance interests that might be affected by an overruling. And on top of all of that, judges may also disagree about how to weigh and balance all of those competing considerations in a given case.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    This case illustrates that point.

Louisiana achieved statehood in 1812. And throughout most of the 1800s, the State required unanimous juries in criminal cases. But at its 1898 state constitutional convention, Louisiana enshrined non-unanimous juries into the state constitution. Why the change? The State wanted to diminish the influence of black jurors, who had won the right to serve on juries through the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875.

After all,\n    that was the whole point of adopting the non-unanimous jury requirement in the first place. And the math has not changed. Then and now, non-unanimous juries can silence the voices and negate the votes of black jurors, especially in cases with black defendants or black victims, and only one or two black jurors. The 10 jurors \"can simply ignore the views of their fellow panel members of a different race or class.\"\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

That reality-and the resulting perception of unfairness and racial bias-can undermine confidence in and respect for the criminal justice system. The non-unanimous jury operates much the same as the unfettered peremptory challenge, a practice that for many decades likewise functioned as an engine of discrimination against black defendants, victims, and jurors. In effect, the non-unanimous jury allows backdoor and unreviewable peremptory strikes against up to 2 of the 12 jurors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    In its 1986 decision in\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Kentucky\n    </em>\n    , the Court recognized the pervasive racial discrimination woven into the traditional system of unfettered peremptory challenges.

England has employed non-unanimous juries, and various legal organizations in the United States have at times championed non-unanimous juries. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Juries Act 1974, ch. 23, \u00a7 17 (Eng.); ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Trial By Jury \u00a7 1.1, p. 7 (App. Draft 1968); ALI, Code of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 355, p. 99 (1930).

It does. Rather, the disputed question here is whether to overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent that allowed non-unanimous juries. And on that question-the question whether to overrule-the Jim Crow origins and racially discriminatory effects (and the perception thereof) of non-unanimous juries in Louisiana and Oregon should matter and should count heavily in favor of overruling, in my respectful view.

Paschal, The Constitution of the United States 210 (1876) (capitalization omitted). And a volume on the jury trial was in agreement. See J.

As a result, I part ways with the Court on both its affirmative argument about the Fourteenth Amendment and its treatment of\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    , in which five Justices agreed the Sixth Amendment included a right to unanimity but a different majority concluded that the right did not apply to the States.

The Court conspicuously avoids saying which clause it analyzes. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1394 - 1395, 1397. But one assumes from its silence that the Court is either following our due process incorporation precedents or believes that \"nothing in this case turns on\" which clause applies,\n    <em>\n     Timbs\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at ----, 139 S.Ct., at 691 (GORSUCH, J., concurring).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    I have already rejected our due process incorporation cases as demonstrably erroneous, and I fundamentally disagree with applying that theory of incorporation simply because it reaches the same result in the case before us. Close enough is for horseshoes and hand grenades, not constitutional interpretation. The textual difference between protecting \"citizens\" (in the Privileges or Immunities Clause) and \"person[s]\" (in the Due Process Clause) will surely be relevant in another case. And our judicial duty-not to mention the candor we owe to our fellow citizens-requires us to put an end to this Court's due process prestidigitation, which no one is willing to defend on the merits.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    I would simply hold that, because all of the opinions in\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    addressed the\n    Due Process Clause, its Fourteenth Amendment ruling does not bind us because the proper question here is the scope of the Privileges or Immunities Clause.

What is necessary, however, is a clear understanding of the means by which the Sixth Amendment right applies against the States. We should rely on the Privileges or Immunities Clause, not the Due Process Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment in some vague sense. Accordingly, I concur only in the judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, and with whom Justice KAGAN joins as to all but Part III-D, dissenting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    The doctrine of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    gets rough treatment in today's decision. Lowering the bar for overruling our precedents, a badly fractured majority casts aside an important and long-established decision with little regard for the enormous reliance the decision has engendered. If the majority's approach is not just a way to dispose of this one case, the decision marks an important turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    Nearly a half century ago in\n    <em>\n     Apodaca v.

Understandably thinking that\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    was good law, the state courts in Louisiana and Oregon have tried thousands of cases under rules that permit such verdicts. But today, the Court does away with\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    and, in so doing, imposes a potentially crushing burden on the courts and criminal justice systems of those States. The Court, however, brushes aside these consequences and even suggests that the States should have known better than to count on our decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    To add insult to injury, the Court tars Louisiana and Oregon with the charge of racism for permitting nonunanimous verdicts-even though this Court found such verdicts to be constitutional and even though there are entirely legitimate arguments for allowing them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    I would not overrule\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    . Whatever one may think about the correctness of the decision, it has elicited enormous and entirely\n    reasonable reliance. And before this Court decided to intervene, the decision appeared to have little practical importance going forward. Louisiana has now abolished non-unanimous verdicts, and Oregon seemed on the verge of doing the same until the Court intervened.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    In Part II of this opinion, I will address the surprising argument, advanced by three Justices in the majority, that\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    was never a precedent at all, and in Part III, I will explain why\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    supports retention of that precedent. But before reaching those issues, I must say something about the rhetoric with which the majority has seen fit to begin its opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    Too much public discourse today is sullied by\n    <em>\n     ad hominem\n    </em>\n    rhetoric, that is, attempts to discredit an argument not by proving that it is unsound but by attacking the character or motives of the argument's proponents. The majority regrettably succumbs to this trend. At the start of its opinion, the majority asks this rhetorical question: \"Why do Louisiana and Oregon allow nonunanimous convictions?\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1394. And the answer it suggests? Racism, white supremacy, the Ku Klux Klan.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1393 - 1394. Non-unanimous verdicts, the Court implies, are of a piece with Jim Crow laws, the poll tax, and other devices once used to disfranchise African-Americans.\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    If Louisiana and Oregon originally adopted their laws allowing non-unanimous verdicts for these reasons,\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    that is deplorable, but what does that have to do with the broad constitutional question before us? The answer is: nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    For one thing, whatever the reasons why Louisiana and Oregon originally adopted their rules many years ago, both States readopted their rules under different circumstances in later years. Louisiana's constitutional convention of 1974 adopted a new, narrower rule, and its stated purpose was \"judicial efficiency.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

Constitutional Convention Records Comm'n 1977). The people of Louisiana ratified the new Constitution. The majority makes no effort to show either that the delegates to the constitutional convention retained the rule for discriminatory purposes or that proponents of the new Constitution made racial appeals when approval was submitted to the people. The same is true for Oregon's revisions and reenactments. Ore. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 11 (amended May 18, 1934); Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 136.450 (1997); \u00a7 136.610 (1971).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    The more important point, however, is that today's decision is not limited to anything particular about Louisiana or Oregon. The Court holds that the Sixth Amendment requires jury unanimity in\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    state criminal trials. If at some future time another State wanted to allow non-unanimous verdicts, today's decision would rule that out-even if all that State's lawmakers were angels.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    For this reason, the origins of the Louisiana and Oregon rules have no bearing on the broad constitutional question that the Court decides. That history would be relevant if there were no legitimate reasons\n    why anyone might think that allowing non-unanimous verdicts is good policy. But that is undeniably false.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    Some years ago the British Parliament enacted a law allowing non-unanimous verdicts.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Was Parliament under the sway of the Klan? The Constitution of Puerto Rico permits non-unanimous verdicts.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Were the framers of that Constitution racists?

It is remarkable that it is even necessary to address this question, but in Part IV-A of the principal opinion, three Justices take the position that\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    was never a precedent. The\n    only truly fitting response to this argument is: \"Really?\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    Consider what it would mean if\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    was never a precedent. It would mean that the entire legal profession was fooled for the past 48 years. Believing that\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    was a precedent, the courts of Louisiana and Oregon tried thousands of cases under rules allowing conviction by a vote of 11 to 1 or 10 to 2, and appellate courts in those States upheld these convictions based on\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    But according to three Justices in the majority, these courts were deluded.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    This Court, for its part, apparently helped to perpetuate the illusion, since it reiterated time and again what\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    had established.

I will therefore attempt to untangle these questions and address each in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    An initial question is whether, in a case where there is no opinion of the Court, the position taken by a single Justice in the majority can constitute the binding rule for which the decision stands. Under\n    <em>\n     Marks\n    </em>\n    , the clear answer to this question is yes. The logic of\n    <em>\n     Marks\n    </em>\n    applies equally no matter what the division of the Justices in the majority, and I am aware of no case holding that the\n    <em>\n     Marks\n    </em>\n    rule is inapplicable when the narrowest ground is supported by only one Justice. Certainly the lower courts have understood\n    <em>\n     Marks\n    </em>\n    to apply in that situation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    The next question is whether the\n    <em>\n     Marks\n    </em>\n    rule applies any differently when the precedent that would be established by a fractured decision would overrule a prior precedent. Again, the logic of\n    <em>\n     Marks\n    </em>\n    dictates an affirmative answer, and I am aware of no case holding that the\n    <em>\n     Marks\n    </em>\n    rule applies any differently in this situation. But as far as the present case is concerned, this question is academic because\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    did not overrule any prior decision of this Court. At most, what the Court had \"recognized,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1396 - 1397, in prior cases is that the Sixth Amendment guaranteed the right to a unanimous jury verdict\n    <em>\n     in trials in federal and territorial courts\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    Whether the same rule applied in state prosecutions had not been decided, and indeed, until\n    <em>\n     Duncan v.

The majority indicts Justice White's opinion on five grounds: (1) it \"spent almost no time grappling with the historical meaning of the Sixth Amendment's jury trial right,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    (2) it did not give due weight to the \"Court's long-repeated statements that [the right] demands unanimity,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    (3) it did not take into account\n    \"the racist origins of [the] Louisian[a] and Orego[n] laws,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    (4) it looked to the function of the jury-trial right,\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    and (5) it engaged in \"a breezy cost-benefit analysis\" that, in any event, did not properly weigh the costs and benefits.\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    All these charges are overblown.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    First, it is quite unfair to criticize Justice White for not engaging in a detailed discussion of the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment jury-trial right since he had already done that just two years before in his opinion for the Court in\n    <em>\n     Williams v. Florida\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"671\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p100\">\n     399 U.S. 78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 92-100,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"672\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p100\">\n     90 S.Ct. 1893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"673\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p100\">\n     26 L.Ed.2d 446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1970). In\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    , after examining that history, he concluded that the Sixth Amendment did not incorporate every feature of the common-law right (a conclusion that the majority, by the way, does not dispute). And in\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    , he built on the analysis in\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    Accordingly, there was no need to repeat what had been said before.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    Second, it is similarly unfair to criticize Justice White for not discussing the prior decisions that commented on jury unanimity. None of those decisions went beyond saying that this was a feature of the common-law right or cursorily stating that unanimity was required.\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    And as noted,\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    had already held that the Sixth Amendment did not preserve all aspects of the common-law right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    Third, the failure of Justice White (and Justice Powell) to take into account the supposedly racist origins of the Louisiana and Oregon laws should not be counted as a defect for the reasons already discussed. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1426 - 1427.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    Fourth, it is hard to know what to make of the functionalist charge. One Member of the majority explicitly disavows this criticism, see\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1409 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part), and it is most unlikely that all the Justices in the majority are ready to label all functionalist decisions as poorly reasoned. Most of the landmark criminal procedure decisions from roughly\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    's time fall into that category. See\n    <em>\n     Mapp v.

Here is the problem. No one questions that the Sixth Amendment incorporated\n    <em>\n     the core\n    </em>\n    of the common-law jury-trial right, but did it incorporate\n    <em>\n     every feature\n    </em>\n    of the right? Did it constitutionalize the requirement that there be 12 jurors even though nobody can say why 12 is the magic number? And did it incorporate features that we now find highly objectionable, such as the exclusion of women from jury service? At the time of the adoption of\n    the Sixth Amendment (and for many years thereafter), women were not regarded as fit to serve as a defendant's peers. Unless one is willing to freeze in place late 18th-century practice, it is necessary to find a principle to distinguish between the features that were incorporated and those that were not. To do this, Justice White's opinion for the Court in\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    looked to the underlying purpose of the jury-trial right, which it identified as interposing a jury of the defendant's peers to protect against oppression by a \" 'corrupt or overzealous prosecutor' \" or a \" 'compliant, biased, or eccentric judge.' \" 399 U.S. at 100,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"686\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p100\">\n     90 S.Ct. 1893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Duncan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767723\" index=\"687\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/145/#p148\">\n     391 U.S. at 156\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767723\" index=\"688\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/145/#p148\">\n     88 S.Ct. 1444\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    The majority decries this \"functionalist\" approach but provides no alternative. It does not claim that the Sixth Amendment incorporated every feature of common-law practice, but it fails to identify any principle for identifying the features that were absorbed. On the question of jury service by women, the majority's only answer, buried in a footnote, is that the exclusion of women was outlawed by \"further constitutional amendments,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1402, n. 47, presumably the Fourteenth Amendment.

I agree that Justice Powell's view on incorporation is not in harmony with the bulk of our case law, but the majority's point about \"recent legal developments\" is\n    an exaggeration. No subsequent Sixth Amendment decision has undercut the plurality. And while Justice Powell's view on incorporation has been further isolated by later cases holding that two additional provisions of the Bill of Rights apply with full force to the States, see\n    <em>\n     Timbs\n    </em>\n    , 586 U.

As I have explained, see\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 1433 - 1434, the\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    plurality's reasoning was based on the same fundamental mode of analysis as that in\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"705\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p100\">\n     399 U.S. 78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"706\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p100\">\n     90 S.Ct. 1893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"707\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p100\">\n     26 L.Ed.2d 446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , which had held just two years earlier that the Sixth Amendment did not constitutionalize the common law's requirement that a jury have 12 members. Although only one State, Oregon, now permits non-unanimous verdicts, many more allow six-person juries.\n    <footnotemark>\n     29\n    </footnotemark>\n    Repudiating the reasoning of\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    will almost certainly prompt calls to overrule\n    <em>\n     Williams.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    C\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    Up to this point, I have discussed the majority's reasons for overruling\n    <em>\n     Apodaca,\n    </em>\n    but that is only half the picture. What convinces me that\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    should be retained are the enormous reliance interests of Louisiana and Oregon. For 48 years, Louisiana and Oregon, trusting that\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    is good law, have conducted thousands and thousands of trials under rules allowing non-unanimous verdicts. Now, those States face a potential tsunami of litigation on the jury-unanimity issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    At a minimum, all defendants whose cases are still on direct appeal will presumably be entitled to a new trial if they were convicted by a less-than-unanimous verdict and preserved the issue in the trial court. And at least in Oregon, even if no objection was voiced at trial, defendants may be able to challenge their convictions based on plain error. See Ore. Rule App. Proc. 5.45(1), and n. 1 (2019);\n    <em>\n     State v.

But the burden of\n    resentencing cannot be compared with the burden of retrying cases. And while resentencing was possible in all the cases affected by\n    <em>\n     Booker\n    </em>\n    , there is no guarantee that all the cases affected by today's ruling can be retried.

It begins by hinting that today's decision will not apply on collateral review under the framework adopted in\n    <em>\n     Teague v.

Under\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    , \"an old rule applies both on direct and collateral review,\" but if today's decision constitutes a new procedural rule, prisoners will be able to rely on it in a collateral proceeding only if it is what we have termed a \"watershed rule\" that implicates \"the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\"\n    <em>\n     Whorton v.

Noting that we have never found a new rule of criminal procedure to qualify as \"watershed,\" the Court hints that the decision in this case is likely to meet the same fate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    But having feinted in this direction, the Court quickly changes course and says that the application of today's decision to prisoners whose appeals have ended should not concern us.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1406 - 1407. That question, we are told, will be decided in a later case.\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    The majority cannot have it both ways. As long as retroactive application on collateral review remains a real possibility, the crushing burden that this would entail cannot be ignored. And while it is true that this Court has been chary in recognizing new watershed rules, it is by no means clear that\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    will preclude the application of today's decision on collateral review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    applies only to a \"new rule,\" and the positions taken by some in the majority may lead to the conclusion that the rule announced today is an old rule. Take the proposition, adopted by three Members of the majority, that\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    was never a precedent. Those Justices, along with the rest of the majority, take the position that our cases established well before\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    both that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimity,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1396 - 1397, and that it applies in the same way in state and federal court,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1398 - 1399. Thus, if\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    was never a precedent and did not disturb what had previously been established, it may be argued that today's decision does not impose a new rule but instead merely recognizes what the correct rule has been for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    Two other Justices in the majority acknowledge that\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    was a precedent and thus would presumably regard today's decision as a \"new rule,\" but the question remains whether today's decision qualifies as a \"watershed rule.\" Justice KAVANAUGH concludes that it does not and all but decides-without briefing or argument-that the decision will not apply retroactively on federal collateral review and similarly that there will be no successful claims of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to challenge\n    <em>\n     Apodaca\n    </em>\n    . See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1418 - 1420 (opinion concurring in part).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    The remaining Justices in the majority, and those of us in dissent, express no view on this question, but the majority's depiction of the unanimity requirement as a hallowed right that Louisiana and Oregon flouted for ignominious reasons certainly provides fuel for the argument that the rule announced today meets the test. And in Oregon, the State most severely impacted by today's decision, watershed status may not matter since the State Supreme Court has reserved decision on whether state law gives prisoners a greater opportunity to invoke new precedents in state collateral proceedings.

It is not accurate to imply that these defendants would have been spared conviction if unanimity had been required.

See Brief for State of Oregon as\n    <em>\n     Amicus\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Curiae\n    </em>\n    12. It is impossible to believe that all these cases would have resulted in mistrials if unanimity had been demanded.

The result of\n     <em>\n      Apodaca\n     </em>\n     was that state criminal juries need not be unanimous. That precedential result has been followed by this Court and the other federal and state courts for the last 48 years. To be sure,\n     <em>\n      Apodaca\n     </em>\n     had no majority opinion. When the Court's decision is splintered, courts follow the result, and they also follow the reasoning or standards set forth in the opinion constituting the \"narrowest grounds\" of the Justices in the majority.

That\n     <em>\n      Marks\n     </em>\n     rule is ordinarily commonsensical to apply and usually means that courts in essence heed the opinion that occupies the middle-ground position between (i) the broadest opinion among the Justices in the majority and (ii) the dissenting opinion.

After reiterating the history recounted by the majority, he eventually acknowledges that there are \"neutral and legitimate\" reasons for allowing non-unanimous verdicts and that Louisiana may have retained a version of its old rule for such reasons. He also agrees with the majority that a rule allowing nonunanimous verdicts would be unconstitutional no matter what the State's reasons. So what is the relevance of the original motivations for the Louisiana and Oregon rules? He offers no explanation. He does opine that allowing such verdicts works to the disadvantage of African-American defendants, but the effect of various jury decision rules is a complex question that has been the subject of much social-science research, none of which the opinion even acknowledges.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-363\">\n     For Oregon, see,\n     <em>\n      e.g.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      State v.
