But they are largely united in their disdain for robocalls. The Federal Government receives a staggering number of complaints about robocalls-3.7 million complaints in 2019 alone. The States likewise field a constant barrage of complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For nearly 30 years, the people's representatives in Congress have been fighting back. As relevant here, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, known as the TCPA, generally prohibits robocalls to cell phones and home phones. But a 2015 amendment to the TCPA allows robocalls that are made to collect debts owed to or guaranteed by the Federal Government, including robocalls made to collect many student loan and mortgage debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case concerns robocalls to cell phones. Plaintiffs in this case are political and nonprofit organizations that want to make political robocalls to cell phones. Invoking the First Amendment, they argue that the 2015 government-debt exception unconstitutionally favors debt-collection speech over political and other speech. As relief from that unconstitutional law, they urge us to invalidate the entire 1991 robocall restriction, rather than simply invalidating the 2015 government-debt exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Six Members of the Court today conclude that Congress has impermissibly favored debt-collection speech over political and other speech, in violation of the First Amendment. See\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at 2345 - 2347;\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , at 2356 - 2357 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment);\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , at 2363, 2364 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Applying traditional severability principles, seven Members of the Court conclude that the entire 1991 robocall restriction should not be invalidated, but rather that the 2015 government-debt exception must be invalidated and severed from the remainder of the statute. See\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at 2348 - 2356;\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , at 2357 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment);\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , at 2362 - 2363 (BREYER,\n   J., concurring in judgment with respect to severability and dissenting in part). As a result, plaintiffs still may not make political robocalls to cell phones, but their speech is now treated equally with debt-collection speech. The judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1991, Congress passed and President George H. W. Bush signed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The Act responded to a torrent of vociferous consumer complaints about intrusive robocalls. A growing number of telemarketers were using equipment that could automatically dial a telephone number and deliver an artificial or prerecorded voice message. At the time, more than 300,000 solicitors called more than 18 million Americans every day. TCPA, \u00a7 2, \u00b6\u00b63, 6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Stat.%202394\">\n    105 Stat. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , note following\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consumers were \"outraged\" and considered robocalls an invasion of privacy \"regardless of the content or the initiator of the message.\" \u00b6\u00b66, 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A leading Senate sponsor of the TCPA captured the zeitgeist in 1991, describing robocalls as \"the scourge of modern civilization. They wake us up in the morning; they interrupt our dinner at night; they force the sick and elderly out of bed; they hound us until we want to rip the telephone right out of the wall.\" 137 Cong. Rec. 30821 (1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In enacting the TCPA, Congress found that banning robocalls was \"the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.\" TCPA \u00a7 2, \u00b612. To that end, the TCPA imposed various restrictions on the use of automated telephone equipment. \u00a7 3(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Stat.%202395\">\n    105 Stat. 2395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As relevant here, one restriction prohibited \"any call (other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party) using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice\" to \"any telephone number assigned to a paging service,\n   <em>\n    cellular telephone service\n   </em>\n   , specialized mobile radio service, or other radio common carrier service, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Stat.%202395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 2395-2396 (emphasis added). That provision is codified in \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of Title 47 of the U. S. Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In plain English, the TCPA prohibited almost all robocalls to cell phones.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Twenty-four years later, in 2015, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act. In addition to making other unrelated changes to the U. S. Code, that Act amended the TCPA's restriction on robocalls to cell phones. It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"(a) IN GENERAL .-Section 227(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 ( 47 U.S.C. 227(b) ) is amended-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) in paragraph (1)-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-23\">\n   (A) in subparagraph (A)(iii), by inserting ', unless such call is made solely to\n   collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States' after 'charged for the call.' \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%20588\">\n    129 Stat. 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In other words, Congress carved out a new government-debt exception to the general robocall restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The TCPA imposes tough penalties for violating the robocall restriction. Private parties can sue to recover up to $1,500 per violation or three times their actual monetary losses, which can add up quickly in a class action. \u00a7 227(b)(3). States may bring civil actions against robocallers on behalf of their citizens. \u00a7 227(g)(1). And the Federal Communications Commission can seek forfeiture penalties for willful or repeated violations of the statute. \u00a7 503(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are the American Association of Political Consultants and three other organizations that participate in the political system. Plaintiffs and their members make calls to citizens to discuss candidates and issues, solicit donations, conduct polls, and get out the vote. Plaintiffs believe that their political outreach would be more effective and efficient if they could make robocalls to cell phones.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But because plaintiffs are not in the business of collecting government debt, \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) prohibits them from making those robocalls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action against the U. S. Attorney General and the FCC, claiming that \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) violated the First Amendment. The U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina determined that the robocall restriction with the government-debt exception was a content-based speech regulation, thereby triggering strict scrutiny. But the court concluded that the law survived strict scrutiny, even with the content-based exception, because of the Government's compelling interest in collecting debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated the judgment.\n   <em>\n    American Assn. of Political Consultants, Inc. v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521038\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/923/159/\">\n    923 F.3d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019). The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the robocall restriction with the government-debt exception was a content-based speech restriction. But the court held that the law could not withstand strict scrutiny and was therefore unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals then applied traditional severability principles and concluded that the government-debt exception was severable from the underlying robocall restriction. The Court of Appeals therefore invalidated the government-debt exception and severed it from the robocall restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Government petitioned for a writ of certiorari because the Court of Appeals invalidated part of a federal statute-namely,\n   the government-debt exception. Plaintiffs supported the petition, arguing from the other direction that the Court of Appeals did not go far enough in providing relief and should have invalidated the entire 1991 robocall restriction rather than simply invalidating the 2015 government-debt exception. We granted certiorari. 589 U.

The Government concedes that it cannot satisfy strict scrutiny to justify the government-debt exception. We agree. The Government's stated justification for the government-debt exception is collecting government debt.

Before we apply ordinary severability principles, we must address plaintiffs' broader initial argument for why the entire 1991 robocall restriction is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs correctly point out that the Government's asserted interest for the 1991 robocall restriction is consumer privacy. But according to plaintiffs, Congress's willingness to enact the government-debt exception in 2015 betrays a newfound lack of genuine congressional concern for consumer privacy. As plaintiffs phrase it, the 2015 exception \"undermines the credibility\" of the Government's interest in consumer privacy. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38. Plaintiffs further contend that if Congress no longer has a genuine interest in consumer privacy, then the underlying 1991 robocall restriction is no longer justified (presumably under any level of heightened scrutiny) and is therefore now unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument is not without force, but we ultimately disagree with it. It is true that the Court has recognized that exceptions to a speech restriction \"may diminish the credibility of the government's rationale for restricting speech in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Ladue v. Gilleo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39640\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/43/#p52\">\n    512 U.S. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39640\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/43/#p52\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39640\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/43/#p52\">\n    129 L.Ed.2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). But here, Congress's addition of the government-debt exception in 2015 does not cause us to doubt the credibility of Congress's continuing interest in protecting consumer privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After all, the government-debt exception is only a slice of the overall robocall landscape. This is not a case where a restriction on speech is littered with exceptions that substantially negate the restriction. On the contrary, even after 2015, Congress has retained a very broad restriction on robocalls. The pre-1991 statistics on robocalls show that a variety of organizations collectively made a huge number of robocalls. And there is no reason to think that the incentives for those organizations-and many others-to make robocalls has diminished in any way since 1991. The continuing robocall restriction proscribes\n   <em>\n    tens of millions\n   </em>\n   of would-be robocalls that would otherwise occur\n   <em>\n    every day\n   </em>\n   . Congress's continuing broad prohibition of robocalls amply demonstrates Congress's continuing interest in consumer privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The simple reality, as we assess the legislative developments, is that Congress has competing interests. Congress's growing interest (as reflected in the 2015 amendment) in collecting government debt does not mean that Congress suddenly lacks a genuine interest in restricting robocalls. Plaintiffs seem to argue that Congress must be interested either in debt collection or in consumer privacy. But that is a false dichotomy, as we see it. As is not infrequently the case with either/or questions,\n   the answer to this either/or question is \"both.\" Congress is interested both in collecting government debt and in protecting consumer privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Therefore, we disagree with plaintiffs' broader initial argument for holding the entire 1991 robocall restriction unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

At least absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court should adhere to the text of the severability or nonseverability clause. That is because a severability or nonseverability clause leaves no doubt about what the enacting Congress wanted if one provision of the law were later declared unconstitutional. A severability clause indicates \"that Congress did not intend the validity of the statute in question to depend on the validity of the constitutionally offensive provision.\"\n    <em>\n     Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131466\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/678/#p686\">\n     480 U.S. 678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 686,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131466\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/678/#p686\">\n     107 S.Ct. 1476\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131466\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/678/#p686\">\n     94 L.Ed.2d 661\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1987). And a nonseverability clause does the opposite.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    On occasion, a party will nonetheless ask the Court to override the text of a severability or nonseverability clause on the ground that the text does not reflect Congress's \"actual intent\" as to severability. That kind of argument may have carried some force back when courts paid less attention to statutory text as the definitive expression of Congress's will. But courts today zero in on the precise statutory text and, as a result, courts hew closely to the text of severability or nonseverability clauses.

For example, some of the Court's cases declare that courts should sever the offending provision unless \"the statute created in its absence is legislation that Congress would not have enacted.\"\n    <em>\n     Alaska Airlines\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131466\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/678/#p686\">\n     480 U.S., at 685\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131466\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/678/#p686\">\n     107 S.Ct. 1476\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But experience shows that this formulation often leads to an analytical dead end. That is because courts are not well equipped to imaginatively reconstruct a prior Congress's hypothetical intent. In other words, absent a severability or nonseverability clause, a court often cannot really know what the two Houses of Congress and the President from the time of original enactment of a law would have wanted if one provision of a law were later declared unconstitutional.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court's cases have instead developed a strong presumption of severability. The Court presumes that an unconstitutional provision in a law is severable from the remainder of the law or statute. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.\n    </em>\n    , the Court set forth the \"normal rule\": \"Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem, severing any problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     561 U.S. 477\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 508,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     177 L.Ed.2d 706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\n    <em>\n     Seila Law\n    </em>\n    , --- U.S. at ----, 140 S.Ct. at 2209,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 32,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%203492641\">\n     2020 WL 3492641\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (same).

Applying the presumption, the Court invalidates and severs unconstitutional provisions from the remainder of the law rather than razing whole statutes or Acts of Congress. Put in common parlance, the tail (one unconstitutional provision) does not wag the dog (the rest of the codified statute or the Act as passed by Congress). Constitutional litigation is not a game of gotcha against Congress, where litigants can ride a discrete constitutional flaw in a statute to take down the whole, otherwise constitutional statute. If the rule were otherwise, the entire Judiciary Act of 1789 would be invalid as a consequence of\n    <em>\n     Marbury\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Madison\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Before severing a provision and leaving the remainder of a law intact, the Court must determine that the remainder of the statute is \"capable of functioning independently\" and thus would be \"fully operative\" as a law.\n    <em>\n     Seila Law\n    </em>\n    , --- U.S. at ----, 140 S.Ct. at 2209,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 33,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%203492641\">\n     2020 WL 3492641\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n    , 584 U.

Passed by Congress and signed by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1934, the Communications Act is codified in Title 47 of the U. S. Code. The TCPA of 1991 amended the Communications Act by adding the robocall restriction, which is codified at \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of Title 47. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 then amended the Communications Act by adding the government-debt exception, which is codified along with the robocall restriction at \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of Title 47.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Since 1934, the Communications Act has contained an express severability clause: \"If any provision of\n    <em>\n     this chapter\n    </em>\n    or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20608\">\n     47 U.S.C. \u00a7 608\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). The \"chapter\" referred to in the severability clause is Chapter 5 of Title 47. And Chapter 5 in turn encompasses \u00a7 151 to \u00a7 700 of Title 47, and therefore covers \u00a7 227 of Title 47, the provision with the robocall restriction and the government-debt exception.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Enacted in 2015, the government-debt exception added an unconstitutional discriminatory exception to the robocall restriction. The text of the severability clause squarely covers the unconstitutional government-debt exception and requires that we sever it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    To get around the text of the severability clause, plaintiffs point out that the Communications Act's severability clause was enacted in 1934, long before the TCPA's 1991 robocall restriction and the 2015 government-debt exception. But a severability clause must be interpreted according to its terms, regardless of when Congress enacted it. See n. 6,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Even if the severability clause did not apply to the government-debt provision at issue in this case (or even if there were no severability clause in the Communications Act), we would apply the presumption of severability as described and applied in cases such as\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    . And\n    under that presumption, we likewise would sever the 2015 government-debt exception, the constitutionally offending provision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    With the government-debt exception severed, the remainder of the law is capable of functioning independently and thus would be fully operative as a law. Indeed, the remainder of the robocall restriction did function independently and fully operate as a law for 20-plus years before the government-debt exception was added in 2015.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court's precedents further support severing the 2015 government-debt exception. The Court has long applied severability principles in cases like this one, where Congress added an unconstitutional amendment to a prior law. In those cases, the Court has treated the original, pre-amendment statute as the \"valid expression of the legislative intent.\"\n    <em>\n     Frost v.

If the statute contains a severability clause, the Court typically severs the discriminatory exception or classification, and thereby extends the relevant statutory benefits or burdens to those previously exempted, rather than nullifying the benefits or burdens for all. In light of the presumption of severability, the Court generally does the same even in the absence of a severability clause. The Court's precedents reflect that preference for extension rather than nullification.

But here, we need not tackle all of the possible\n    hypothetical applications of severability doctrine in equal-treatment cases. The government-debt exception is a relatively narrow exception to the broad robocall restriction, and severing the government-debt exception does not raise any other constitutional problems.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Plaintiffs insist, however, that a\n    <em>\n     First Amendment\n    </em>\n    equal-treatment case is different. According to plaintiffs, a court should not cure \"a First Amendment violation by outlawing more speech.\" Brief for Respondents 34. The implicit premise of that argument is that extending the robocall restriction to debt-collection robocalls would be unconstitutional. But that is wrong. A generally applicable robocall restriction would be permissible under the First Amendment. Extending the robocall restriction to those robocalls raises no First Amendment problem. So the First Amendment does not tell us which way to cure the unequal treatment in this case. Therefore, we apply traditional severability principles. And as we have explained, severing the 2015 government-debt exception cures the unequal treatment and constitutes the proper result under the Court's traditional severability principles. In short, the correct result in this case is to sever the 2015 government-debt exception and leave in place the longstanding robocall restriction.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    4\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Justice GORSUCH's well-stated separate opinion makes a number of important points that warrant this respectful response.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Justice GORSUCH suggests that our decision provides \"no relief\" to plaintiffs.\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    , at 2366.

That is not a judicially modest approach but is more of a wolf in sheep's clothing. That approach would disrespect the democratic process, through which the people's representatives have made crystal clear that robocalls must be restricted. Justice GORSUCH's remedy would end up harming a different and far larger set of strangers to this suit-the tens of millions of consumers who would be bombarded every day with nonstop robocalls notwithstanding Congress's clear prohibition of those robocalls.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Justice GORSUCH suggests more broadly that severability doctrine may need to be reconsidered. But when and how? As the saying goes, John Marshall is not walking through that door. And this Court, in this and other recent decisions, has clarified and refined severability doctrine by emphasizing firm adherence to the text of severability clauses, and underscoring the strong presumption of severability. The doctrine as so refined is constitutionally well-rooted, see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Marbury v.

True, there is no magic solution to severability that solves every conundrum, especially in equal-treatment cases, but the Court's current approach as reflected in recent cases such as\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seila Law\n    </em>\n    is constitutional, stable, predictable, and commonsensical.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    In 1991, Congress enacted a general restriction on robocalls to cell phones. In 2015, Congress carved out an exception that allowed robocalls made to collect government debt. In doing so, Congress favored debt-collection speech over plaintiffs' political speech. We hold that the 2015 government-debt exception added an unconstitutional exception to the law. We cure that constitutional violation by invalidating the 2015 government-debt exception and severing it from the remainder of the statute. The judgment of the U. S.

The concept is abstract but simple: \"We the People of the United States\" have created a government of laws enacted by elected representatives. For our government to remain a\n    <em>\n     democratic\n    </em>\n    republic, the people must be free to generate, debate, and discuss both general and specific ideas, hopes, and experiences. The people must then be able to transmit their resulting views and conclusions to their elected representatives, which they may do directly, or indirectly through the shaping of public opinion. The object of that transmission is to influence the public policy enacted by elected representatives.

This Court, for example, has applied a \"rational basis\" standard for reviewing those restrictions when they have only indirect impacts on speech. See\n    <em>\n     Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916108\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/457/#p469\">\n     521 U.S. 457\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 469-470, 477,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916108\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/457/#p469\">\n     117 S.Ct. 2130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916108\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/457/#p469\">\n     138 L.Ed.2d 585\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1997). And it has applied a mid-level standard of review-often termed \"intermediate scrutiny\"-when the government directly restricts protected commercial speech. See\n    <em>\n     Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/#p561\">\n     447 U.S. 557\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 561-564,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/#p561\">\n     100 S.Ct. 2343\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/#p561\">\n     65 L.Ed.2d 341\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1980).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    This account of well-established principles at the core of the First Amendment demonstrates the problem with the plurality's approach. To reflexively treat all content-based distinctions as subject to strict scrutiny regardless of context or practical effect is to engage in an analysis untethered from the First Amendment's objectives. And in this case, strict scrutiny is inappropriate. Recall that the exception at issue here concerns debt collection-specifically a method for collecting government-owned or -backed debt. Regulation of debt collection does not fall on the first side of the democratic equation. It has next to nothing to do with the free marketplace of ideas or the transmission of the people's thoughts and will to the government. It has everything to do with the second side of the equation, that is, with government response to the public will through ordinary commercial regulation. To apply the strictest level of scrutiny to the economically based exemption here is thus remarkable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    I recognize that the underlying cell phone robocall restriction primarily concerns a means of communication. And that\n    fact, as I discuss below, triggers some heightened scrutiny, reflected in an intermediate scrutiny standard. Strict scrutiny and its strong presumption of unconstitutionality, however, have no place here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The plurality claims that its approach, which categorically applies strict scrutiny to content-based distinctions, will not \"affect traditional or ordinary economic regulation of commercial activity.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2347. But how is that so? Much of human life involves activity that takes place through speech. And much regulatory activity turns upon speech content. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=576%20U.S.%20155\">\n     576 U.S., at 177-178\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n     135 S.Ct. 2218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment) (giving examples). Consider, for example, the regulation of securities sales, drug labeling, food labeling, false advertising, workplace safety warnings, automobile airbag instructions, consumer electronic labels, tax forms, debt collection, and so on. All of those regulations necessarily involve content-based speech distinctions. What are the differences between regulatory programs themselves other than differences based on content? After all, the regulatory spheres in which the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Trade Commission operate are defined by content. Put simply, treating all content-based distinctions on speech as presumptively unconstitutional is unworkable and would obstruct the ordinary workings of democratic governance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    That conclusion is true here notwithstanding the plurality's effort to bring political speech into the First Amendment analysis. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2346 - 2347, 2356 (characterizing Congress as having \"favored debt-collection speech over plaintiffs' political speech\"). It is true that the underlying cell phone robocall restriction generally prohibits political speakers from making robocalls. But that has little to do with the government-debt exception or\n    <em>\n     its\n    </em>\n    practical effect. Nor does it justify the application of strict scrutiny.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Consider prescription drug labels, securities forms, and tax statements. A government agency might reasonably specify just what information the form or label must contain and further provide that the form or label may not contain other information (thereby excluding political statements). No one would think that the exclusion of political speech, say, from a drug label, means that courts must examine all other regulatory exceptions with strict scrutiny. Put differently, it is hard to imagine that such exceptions threaten political speech in the marketplace of ideas, or have any significant impact on the free exchange of ideas. To treat those exceptions as presumptively unconstitutional would work a significant transfer of authority from legislatures and agencies to courts, potentially inhibiting the creation of the very government programs for which the people (after debate) have voiced their support, despite those programs' minimal speech-related harms.

Given that this Court looks to the nature and content of speech to determine whether, or to what extent, the First Amendment protects it, it makes little sense to treat\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    content-based distinction Congress has made as presumptively unconstitutional.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Moreover, it is no answer to claim that this Court's precedents categorically require such an analysis. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2347 - 2348, n. 5 (plurality opinion). Our First Amendment jurisprudence has always been contextual and has defied straightforward reduction to unyielding categorical rules. The idea that broad language in any one case (even\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n    ) has categorically determined how content discrimination should be applied in\n    <em>\n     every single context\n    </em>\n    is both wrong and reflects an oversimplification and over-reading of our precedent. The diversity of approaches in this very case underscores the point that the law here is far from settled. Indeed, the plurality itself disclaims the idea that its rule would apply to unsettle \"traditional or ordinary economic regulation of commercial activity,\" indicating that the plurality presumably thinks there are some outer bounds to its broad language.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2347. The question here is whether the Court's general statements about content discrimination triggering strict scrutiny, including in\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n    , make sense as applied in\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    context. As I have explained, they do not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    That said, I am not arguing for the abolition of the concept of \"content discrimination.\" There are times when using content discrimination to trigger scrutiny is eminently reasonable. Specifically, when content-based distinctions are used as a method for suppressing particular viewpoints or threatening the neutrality of a traditional public forum, content discrimination triggering strict scrutiny is generally appropriate. See\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=576%20U.S.%20155\">\n     576 U.S., at 176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n     135 S.Ct. 2218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment);\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 182-183,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n     135 S.Ct. 2218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (KAGAN, J., concurring in judgment).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Neither of those situations is present here. Outside of these circumstances, content\n    discrimination can at times help determine the strength of a government justification or identify a potential interference with the free marketplace of ideas. See\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 176-177,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n     135 S.Ct. 2218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). But, as I have explained, this case is not about protecting the marketplace of ideas. It is not about the formation of public opinion or the transmission of the people's will to elected representatives. It is fundamentally about a method of regulating debt collection.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    I would examine the validity of the regulation at issue here using a First Amendment standard that (unlike strict scrutiny) does not strongly presume that a regulation that affects speech is unconstitutional. However, given that the government-debt exception does directly impact a means of communication, the appropriate standard requires a closer look at the restriction than does a traditional \"rational basis\" test. A proper inquiry should examine the seriousness of the speech-related harm, the importance of countervailing objectives, the likelihood that the restriction will achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so. Narrow tailoring in this context, however, does not necessarily require the use of the least-restrictive means of furthering those objectives. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Ward v. Rock Against Racism\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n     491 U.S. 781\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 797-799, and n. 6,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2746\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n     105 L.Ed.2d 661\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1989) (explaining that outside of strict scrutiny review, narrow tailoring does not require the use of least-restrictive-means analysis). That inquiry ultimately evaluates a restriction's speech-related harms in light of its justifications. We have typically called this approach \"intermediate scrutiny,\" though we have sometimes referred to it as an assessment of \"fit,\" sometimes called it \"proportionality,\" and sometimes just applied it without using a label. See\n    <em>\n     United States v. Alvarez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p730\">\n     567 U.S. 709\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 730-731,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p730\">\n     132 S.Ct. 2537\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p730\">\n     183 L.Ed.2d 574\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment);\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=576%20U.S.%20155\">\n     576 U.S., at 179\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n     135 S.Ct. 2218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Applying this Court's intermediate scrutiny analysis, I would begin by asking just what the First Amendment harm is here. As Justice KAVANAUGH notes, the government-debt exception provides no basis for undermining the general cell phone robocall restriction.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2348 - 2349. Indeed, looking at the government-debt exception in context, we can see that the practical effect of the exception, taken together with the rest of the statute, is to put\n    <em>\n     non\n    </em>\n    -government debt collectors at a disadvantage. Their speech operates in the same sphere as government-debt collection speech, communicates comparable messages, and yet does not have the benefit of a particular instrument of communication (robocalls). While this is a speech-related harm, debt-collection speech is both commercial and highly regulated. See Brief for Petitioners 20-21 (describing multiple restrictions imposed by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act on communications by debt collectors in the course of debt collection). The speech-related harm at issue here-and any related effect on the marketplace of ideas-is modest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    What, then, is the justification for this harm? The purpose of the exception is to further the protection of the public fisc. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2357 - 2358. That protection is an important governmental interest. Private debt typically involves private funds; public debt typically involves funds that, in principle, belong to all of us, and help to implement numerous governmental policies that the people support.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Finally, is the exception narrowly tailored? Its limited scope shows that it is.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Congress has minimized any speech-related harm by tying the exception directly to the Government's interest in preserving the public fisc. The statutory text makes clear that calls will only fall within the bounds of that exception if they are \"made\n    <em>\n     solely\n    </em>\n    to collect\" Government debt.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). Thus, the exception cannot be used to permit communications unrelated or less directly related to that public fiscal interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The upshot is that the government-debt exception, taken in context, inflicts some speech-related harm. But the harm, as I have explained, is related not to public efforts to develop ideas or transmit them to the Government, but to the Government's response to those efforts, which here takes the form of highly regulated commercial communications. Moreover, there is an important justification for that harm, and the exception is narrowly tailored to further that goal. Given those facts, the government-debt exception should survive intermediate First Amendment scrutiny.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    IV\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    For the reasons described above, I would find that the government-debt exception does not violate the First Amendment. A majority of the Court, however, has concluded the contrary. It must thus decide whether that provision is severable from the rest of the statute. As to that question, I agree with Justice KAVANAUGH's conclusion that the provision is severable. Accordingly, I respectfully concur in the judgment with respect to severability and dissent in part.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Justice GORSUCH, with whom Justice THOMAS joins as to Part II, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    I agree with Justice KAVANAUGH that the provision of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act before us violates the First Amendment. Respectfully, however, I disagree about why that is so and what remedial consequences should follow.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    The TCPA is full of regulations on robocalls. The statute limits robocalls to residential landlines, hospitals, emergency numbers, and business lines. The only provision before us today, however, concerns robocalls to cell phones, mobile devices, or \"any service for which the called party is charged for the call.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(A)(iii). Before the law's enactment, many cell phone users had to pay for each call, so they suffered not only the pleasure of robocalls, but also the privilege of paying for them. In 1991, Congress sought to address the problem by banning nearly all unsolicited robocalls to cell phones.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    But much has changed since then. Now, cell phone users often pay a flat monthly fee for unlimited minutes, reducing the cost (if not the annoyance) of hearing from robocallers. New weapons in the fight against robocallers have emerged, too-including tools that allow consumers to more easily screen and block unwanted calls. Perhaps in recognition of these changes, Congress relaxed the ban on cellphone robocallers in 2015. Today, unsolicited calls are permitted if they are \"made solely to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    That leaves robocallers no shortage of material. The government backs millions upon millions of loans-student loans, home mortgages, veterans' loans, farm loans, business loans. When it comes to student loans alone, the government guarantees more than $150 billion in private loans involving over 7 million individuals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    And, to be clear, it's not just the government that's allowed to call about these loans. Private lenders and debt collectors are free to send in the robots too, so long as the debt at issue is ultimately guaranteed by the government.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Today's plaintiffs wish to use robocalls for something different: to campaign and solicit donations for political causes. The plaintiffs allege that the law's continuing ban on calls like theirs violates the First Amendment, and on the main points of their argument the parties agree. First, no one doubts the TCPA regulates speech. Second, everyone accepts that restrictions on speech-no matter how evenhanded-must be justified by at least a \" 'significant governmental interest.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ward v. Rock Against Racism\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n     491 U.S. 781\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 791,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2746\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n     105 L.Ed.2d 661\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1989). And, third, the parties agree that laws that go further by regulating speech on the basis of content invite still greater scrutiny. When the government seeks to censor speech based on its content, favoring certain voices and punishing others, its restrictions must satisfy \"strict scrutiny\"-meaning they must be justified by interests that are \"compelling,\" not just significant. After all, a constitutional right would hardly be needed to protect popular speakers; the First Amendment does its real work in giving voice to those a majority would silence. See\n    <em>\n     McCullen v. Coakley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20464\">\n     573 U.S. 464\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 477-478,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581709\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2518/\">\n     134 S.Ct. 2518\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581709\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2518/\">\n     189 L.Ed.2d 502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2014) ; but see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2359 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment with respect to severability and dissenting in part) (seeking to overturn precedent and allow the government sometimes to impose content-based restrictions to \"respon[d] to the public will\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    In my view, the TCPA's rule against cellphone robocalls is a content-based restriction that fails strict scrutiny. The statute is content-based because it allows speech on a subject the government favors (collecting its debts) while banning speech on other disfavored subjects (including political matters). Cf.\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2361 - 2363 (opinion of BREYER, J.) (mistakenly characterizing the content discrimination as \"not about\" political activities). The statute fails strict scrutiny because the government offers no compelling justification for its prohibition against the plaintiffs' political speech. In fact, the government does not dispute that, if strict scrutiny applies, its law must fall.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    It's easy enough to see why the government makes no effort to satisfy strict scrutiny. Now that most cell phone plans do not charge by the call, the only justification the government cites for its robocall ban is its interest in protecting consumer privacy. No one questions that protecting consumer privacy qualifies as a legitimate and \"genuine\" interest for the government to pursue.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2357 - 2358, 2362. But before the government may censor the plaintiffs' speech based on its content, it must point to a\n    <em>\n     compelling\n    </em>\n    interest. And if the government thinks consumer privacy interests are insufficient to overcome its interest in collecting debts, it's hard to see how the government might invoke consumer privacy interests to justify banning private political speech. Especially when consumers seem to find debt collection efforts particularly intrusive: Year after year, the Federal Trade Commission receives more complaints about the debt collection industry than any other. The nature and breadth of the law's exception calls into question the necessity of its rule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Much precedent supports this course. As this Court has long explained, a law's failure to address a wide swath of conduct implicating its supposed concern \"diminish[es] the credibility of the government's [stated] rationale for [its] restrict[ion].\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    <em>\n     City of Ladue v.

The government might, for example, show that the apparent inconsistency in its law is justified by some qualitative or quantitative difference between the speech it favors and the speech it disfavors. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898094\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/48/#p60\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898094\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/48/#p60\">\n     at 61\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . So if debt collection robocalls were less invasive of consumer privacy than other kinds of robocalls, or if they were inherently rare, an exception permitting debt collection calls might not undermine the government's claimed interest in banning other calls. But the government, a party with every incentive and ample resources, has not even tried to suggest conditions like those are present here, and understandably so: The government-debt exception allows a seemingly\n    <em>\n     infinite\n    </em>\n    number of robocalls of the type consumers appear to find\n    <em>\n     most\n    </em>\n    invasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    With a First Amendment violation proven, the question turns to remedy. Because the challenged robocall ban unconstitutionally infringes on their speech, I would hold that the plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction preventing its enforcement against them. This is the traditional remedy for proven violations of legal rights likely to work irreparable injury in the future. Preventing the law's enforcement against the plaintiffs would fully address their injury. And going this far, but no further, would avoid \"short circuit[ing] the democratic process\" by interfering with the work of Congress any more than necessary.\n    <em>\n     Washington State Grange v.

Invoking \"severability doctrine,\" it declares the government-debt exception void and severs it from the statute. As revised by today's decision, the law prohibits nearly all robocalls to cell phones, just as it did back in 1991. In support of this remedy, we are asked to consider cases involving equal protection violations, where courts have sometimes solved the problem of unequal treatment by leveling others \"down\" to the plaintiff 's status rather than by leveling the plaintiff \"up\" to the status others enjoy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    I am doubtful of our authority to rewrite the law in this way. Many have questioned the propriety of modern severability doctrine,\n    <footnotemark>\n     *\n    </footnotemark>\n    and today's case illustrates some of the reasons why. To start, it's hard to see how today's use of severability doctrine qualifies as a remedy at all: The plaintiffs\n    have not challenged the government-debt exception, they have not sought to have it severed and stricken, and far from placing \"unequal treatment\" at the \"heart of their suit,\" they have never complained of unequal treatment as such.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2355 - 2356. The plaintiffs point to the government-debt exception only to show that the government lacks a compelling interest in restricting their speech. It isn't even clear the plaintiffs would have standing to challenge the government-debt exception. They came to court asserting a right to speak, not a right to be free from other speakers. Severing and voiding the government-debt exception does nothing to address the injury they claim; after today's ruling, federal law bars the plaintiffs from using robocalls to promote political causes just as stoutly as it did before. What is the point of fighting this long battle, through many years and all the way to the Supreme Court, if the prize for winning is no relief at all?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    A severance remedy not only fails to help the plaintiffs, it harms strangers to this suit. Just five years ago, Congress expressly authorized robocalls to cell phones to collect government-backed debts. Yet, today, the Court reverses that decision and outlaws the entire industry. It is highly unusual for judges to render unlawful conduct that Congress has explicitly made lawful-let alone to take such an extraordinary step without warning to those who have ordered their lives and livelihoods in reliance on the law, and without affording those individuals any opportunity to be heard. This assertion of power strikes me as raising serious separation of powers questions, and it marks no small departure from our usual reliance on the adversarial process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Nor does the analogy to equal protection doctrine solve the problem. That doctrine promises equality of treatment, whatever that treatment may be. The First Amendment isn't so neutral. It pushes, always, in one direction: against governmental restrictions on speech. Yet, somehow, in the name of vindicating the First Amendment, our remedial course today leads to the unlikely result that not a single person will be allowed to speak more freely and, instead, more speech will be banned.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    In an effort to mitigate at least some of these problems, Justice KAVANAUGH suggests that the ban on government-debt collection calls announced today might be applied only prospectively. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2355, n. 13. But prospective decisionmaking has never been easy to square with the judicial power. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     James B. Beam Distilling Co. v.

And a holding that shields\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    government-debt collection callers from past liability under an admittedly unconstitutional law would wind up endorsing the very same kind of content discrimination we say we are seeking to eliminate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Unable to solve the problems associated with its preferred severance remedy, today's decision seeks at least to identify \"harm[s]\" associated with mine. Cf.\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2356 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). In particular, we are reminded that granting an injunction in this case would allow the plaintiffs' (unpopular) speech, and that could induce others to seek injunctions of their own, resulting in still more (unpopular) speech. But this \"harm\" is hardly comparable to the problems associated with using severability doctrine: Having to tolerate unwanted speech imposes no cognizable constitutional injury on anyone; it is life under the First Amendment, which is\n    almost always invoked to protect speech some would rather not hear.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    In the end, I agree that\n    <extracted-citation index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(A)(iii) violates the First Amendment, though not for the reasons Justice KAVANAUGH offers. Nor am I able to support the remedy the Court endorses today.

Courts would be largely at sea in making that determination, and usually could not do it in a principled way. Here, for example, would a court invalidate all or part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 rather than all or part of the 1991 TCPA? After all, that 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act, not the 1991 TCPA, added the constitutionally problematic government-debt exception.

Under either the Court's approach or Justice THOMAS's approach, an offending provision formally remains on the statute books (at least unless Congress also formally repeals it). Under either approach, the formal remedy afforded to the plaintiff is an injunction, declaration, or damages. One difference between the two approaches is this: Under the Court's approach, a provision is declared invalid and cannot be lawfully enforced against others. Under Justice THOMAS's approach, the Court's ruling that a provision cannot be enforced against the plaintiff, plus executive respect in its enforcement policies for controlling decisional law, plus vertical and horizontal\n     <em>\n      stare decisis\n     </em>\n     in the courts, will mean that the provision will not and cannot be lawfully enforced against others.
