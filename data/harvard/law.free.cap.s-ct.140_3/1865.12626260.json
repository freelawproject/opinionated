Yet, in several jurisdictions throughout the country, law-abiding citizens have been barred from exercising the fundamental right to bear arms because they cannot show that they have a \"justifiable need\" or \"good reason\" for doing so. One would think that such an onerous burden on a fundamental right would warrant this Court's review. This Court would almost certainly review the constitutionality of a law requiring citizens to establish a justifiable need before exercising their free speech rights. And it seems highly unlikely that the Court would allow a State to enforce a law requiring a woman to provide a justifiable need before seeking an abortion. But today, faced with a petition challenging just such a restriction on citizens' Second Amendment rights, the Court simply looks the other way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Petitioner Rogers is a law-abiding citizen who runs a business that requires him to service automated teller machines in high-crime areas. He applied for a permit to carry his handgun for self-defense. But, to obtain a carry permit in New Jersey, an applicant must, among other things, demonstrate \"that he has a justifiable need to carry a handgun.\" N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:58-4(c) (West 2019 Cum. Supp.). For a \"private citizen\" to satisfy this \"justifiable need\" requirement, he must \"specify in detail the urgent necessity for self-protection, as evidenced by specific threats or previous attacks which demonstrate a special danger to the applicant's life that cannot be avoided by means other than by issuance of a permit to carry a handgun.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455289,3644508\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/742/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; see also N.

To determine that scope, we analyzed the original meaning of the Second Amendment's text as well as the historical understanding of the right.

Thus, the right to carry arms for self-defense inherently includes the right to carry in public.

So, as in\n    <em>\n     Heller\n    </em>\n    , my analysis of the scope of that right begins with our country's English roots.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    In 1328, during a time of political transition, the English Parliament enacted the Statute of Northampton. The Statute provided that no man was permitted to \"bring ... force in affray of the peace, nor to go nor ride armed by night nor by day, in Fairs, Markets, nor in the presence of the Justices or other Ministers, nor in no part elsewhere.\" Statute of Northampton 1328,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20Edw.%20Ch.%203\">\n     2 Edw. 3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , ch. 3. On its face, the statute could be read as a sweeping ban on the carrying of arms. However, both the history and enforcement of the statute reveal that it created a far more limited restriction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    From the beginning, the scope of the Statute of Northampton was unclear. Some officers were ordered to arrest all persons that \"go armed,\" regardless of whether the bearer was carrying arms peacefully. See Letter to Mayor and Bailiffs of York (Jan. 30, 1334), in Calendar of the Close Rolls, Edward III, 1333-1337, p. 294 (H. Maxwell-Lyte ed. 1898). Other officers, however, were ordered to arrest only \"persons riding or going armed\n    <em>\n     to disturb the peace\n    </em>\n    .\" Letter to Keeper and Justices of Northumberland (Oct. 28, 1332), in Calendar of the Close Rolls, Edward III, 1330-1333, p. 610 (H. Maxwell-Lyte ed. 1898) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Whatever the initial breadth of the statute, it is clear that it was not strictly enforced in the ensuing centuries. To the contrary, \"[d]uring most of England's history, maintenance of an armed citizenry was neither merely permissive nor cosmetic but essential\" because \"[u]ntil late in the seventeenth century England had no standing army, and until the nineteenth century no regular police force.\" Malcom, The Right of the People To Keep and Bear Arms: The Common Law Tradition,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Hastings%20Const.%20L.Q.%20285\">\n     10 Hastings Const. L. Q. 285\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 290 (1983). Citizens were not only expected to possess arms, they were encouraged to maintain skills in the use of those arms, which, of course, required carrying arms in public. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Hastings%20Const.%20L.Q.%20285\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 292 (describing King Henry VIII's order requiring villages to maintain targets at which local men were to practice shooting).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The religious and political turmoil in England during the 17th century thrust the scope of the Statute of Northampton to the forefront. See J. Malcom, To Keep and Bear Arms 104-105 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm). King James II, a Catholic monarch, sought to revive the Statute of Northampton as a weapon to disarm his Protestant opponents.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Hastings%20Const.%20L.Q.%20285\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 104. To this point, \"[a]lthough men were occasionally indicted for carrying arms to terrorize their neighbours, the strict prohibition [of\n    the Statute of Northampton] had never been enforced.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    . But, in November 1686, the Attorney General brought Sir John Knight-an opponent of James II-to trial before the King's Bench. The information alleged that Knight violated the Statute of Northampton by \"walk[ing] about the streets armed with guns, and [entering] into the church of St. Michael, in Bristol, in the time of divine service, with a gun, to terrify the King's subjects.\"\n    <em>\n     Sir John Knight's Case\n    </em>\n    , 3 Mod. 117, 87 Eng. Rep. 75, 76. At trial, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench stated that the Statute of Northampton only \"punish[ed] people who go armed\n    <em>\n     to terrify the King's subjects\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 118, 87 Eng. Rep., at 76 (emphasis added). He explained that the Statute of Northampton was \"almost gone in desuetudinem\" for \"now there be a general connivance to gentlemen to ride armed for their security.\"\n    <em>\n     Rex\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Sir John Knight\n    </em>\n    , 1 Comb. 38, 39, 90 Eng. Rep. 330 (1686). The Chief Justice also noted that only \"where the crime shall appear to be malo animo [\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    with a wrongful intent,] it will come within the Act.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    In other words, the Statute of Northampton was almost obsolete from disuse and prohibited only the carrying arms to terrify. Knight was ultimately acquitted.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    James II's attempts to disarm his opponents continued. Only two weeks after Knight's acquittal, James II ordered general disarmaments of regions inhabited by his Protestant enemies under the auspices of the Game Act of 1671. See Malcom 105-106. As we explained in\n    <em>\n     Heller\n    </em>\n    , \"[t]hese experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n     554 U.S., at 593\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    In 1688, James II was deposed in an uprising which came to be known as The Glorious Revolution. Soon thereafter, the English compiled the Declaration of Rights, which contained a list of grievances against James II and sought assurances from William and Mary that Protestants would not be disarmed. See Malcom 115. William and Mary accepted the Declaration of Rights, which was later codified as the English Bill of Rights, agreeing that \"the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions, and as allowed by Law.\" 1 Wm. &amp; Mary, ch. 2, \u00a7 7, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The Statute of Northampton remained in force following the codification of the English Bill of Rights, but the narrow interpretation of the statute adopted in\n    <em>\n     Sir John Knight's Case\n    </em>\n    became blackletter law in England. Writing in 1716, Serjeant William Hawkins, author of an influential English treatise, explained that \"no wearing of Arms is within the meaning of [the Statute of Northampton], unless it be accompanied with such Circumstances as are apt to terrify the People; from whence it seems clearly to follow, That Persons of Quality are in no Danger of Offending against this Statute by wearing common Weapons.\" 1 Pleas of the Crown 136 (1716). Theodore Barlow, another legal\n    commentator, also explained that \"Wearing Arms, if not accompanied with Circumstances of Terror, is not within this Statute; therefore People of Rank and Distinction do not offend by wearing common Weapons.\" The Justice of Peace: A Treatise Containing the Power and Duty of That Magistrate 12 (1745). Sir William Blackstone concluded the Statute of Northampton banned only the carrying of \"dangerous and unusual weapons.\"\n    <em>\n     Heller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 627,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted). He explained that the right to arms protected by the 1689 English Bill of Rights preserved \"the natural right of resistance and self-preservation\" and \"the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence.\" 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 139-140 (1765); see also 2\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 412, n. 2 (E.

And for purposes of discerning the original meaning of the Second Amendment, it is this founding era understanding that is most pertinent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    2\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Founding era legal commentators in America also understood the Second Amendment right to \"bear Arms\" to encompass the right to carry in public.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    St. George Tucker, in his 1803 American edition of Blackstone's Commentaries, explained that the right to armed self-defense is the \"first law of nature.\" 1 Blackstone's Commentaries, App. 300. He described \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\" as \"the true palladium of liberty.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Tucker makes clear that bearing arms in public was common practice at the founding: \"In many parts of the United States, a man no more thinks, of going out of his house on any occasion, without his rifle or musket in his hand, than a European fine gentleman without his sword by his side.\" 5\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 19.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Similarly, William Rawle, a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly that ratified the Bill of Rights, acknowledged the right to carry arms in public. A View of the Constitution of the United States of America 125-126 (1825). Rawle noted that the right should not \"be abused to the disturbance of the public peace\" and explained that if a man carried arms \"attended with circumstances giving just reason to fear that he purposes to make an unlawful use of them,\" he may be required \"to give surety of the peace.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 126.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    But his general understanding appeared to mirror Hawkins' articulation of the English right-public carry was permitted so long as it was not done to terrify.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Other commentators took a similar view. James Wilson, a prominent Framer and one of the six original Justices of the Supreme Court, understood founding era law to prohibit only the carrying of \"dangerous and unusual weapons, in such a manner, as will naturally diffuse a terrour among the people.\" 2 Lectures on Law, in Collected Works of James Wilson 1138 (K. Hall &amp; M. Hall eds. 2007). Charles Humphreys, a law professor, reiterated \"that in this country the constitution guarranties to all persons\n    the right to bear arms\" and that \"it can only be a crime to exercise this right in such a manner, as to terrify the people unnecessarily.\" A Compendium of the Common Law in Force in Kentucky 482 (1822).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    3\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    This view persisted in the early years of the Republic. The majority of the relevant cases during the antebellum period-many of which\n    <em>\n     Heller\n    </em>\n    relied on-support the understanding that the phrase \"bear Arms\" includes the right to carry in public.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Bliss v.

Second, the court held that even assuming \"that our ancestors adopted and brought over with them [the Statute of Northampton], or [a] portion of the common law,\" the state-law \"right to keep and to bear arms\" \"completely abrogated it.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11266731\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/13/356/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 359-360 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In 1840, the Supreme Court of Alabama concluded that, while the legislature could impose limitations on \"the manner in which arms shall be borne,\" it could not bar the right to bear arms in public for self-defense.\n    <em>\n     State v.

In doing so, however, the court recognized that there were limits to the State's ability to restrict the right to carry in public: \"A statute which, under the pretence of regulating, amounts to a destruction of the right [to bear arms], or which requires arms to be so borne as to render them wholly useless for the purpose of defence, would be clearly unconstitutional.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"902261\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/1/612/#p616\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 616-617.
