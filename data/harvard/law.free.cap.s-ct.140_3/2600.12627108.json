The 8-day trial included thousands of records and testimony from the plaintiffs, state and county officials, public defenders, and experts. On May 24, 2020, the District Court entered a permanent injunction and issued its factual findings and legal conclusions in a 125-page opinion. See generally\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Guided by the Eleventh Circuit's controlling analysis in\n   <em>\n    Jones I\n   </em>\n   , the District Court concluded that Florida's pay-to-vote system creates an unconstitutional wealth barrier to voting.\n   <em>\n    Jones II\n   </em>\n   , --- F.

Based on the State's estimates, moreover, the District Court noted that Florida officials would need about six years to determine how much (if anything) currently registered voters (to say nothing of those who seek to register) must pay to vote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%202618062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%202618062\">\n    2020 WL 2618062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *24. Compounding the problem, the District Court found, is that Florida law puts the risk of error on the prospective voter, suggesting on its registration forms that a false affirmation of voting eligibility is a felony \"regardless of willfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%202618062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%202618062\">\n    2020 WL 2618062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Last, the District Court concluded that Florida's payment requirement is a tax abridging the right to vote in violation of the Twenty-fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%202618062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%202618062\">\n    2020 WL 2618062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *29. In the District Court's view, the required payments are taxes because Florida assesses them \"regardless of \" a defendant's \"culpability,\" and for the \"sole\" or \"primary purpose of raising revenue to pay for government operations-for things the state must provide, such as a criminal-justice system, or things the state chooses to provide, such as a victim-compensation fund.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2020%20WL%202618062\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Having found several grounds for awarding relief, the District Court prescribed remedies tailored to the State's existing procedures.

Yet because of the Eleventh Circuit's decision, these voters will have no notice of their potential ineligibility or the resulting criminal prosecution they may face for failing to follow the abrupt change in law. Making matters worse, the Eleventh Circuit will not hear argument on this case until August 18, the day of the primary election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In short, the plaintiffs have raised serious claims, some of which the Eleventh Circuit already found likely to succeed. Because the parties' rights and the legal framework had been well established, it was error to for the Eleventh Circuit to reverse course in an unexplained stay order right before an election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This Court's inaction continues a trend of condoning disfranchisement. Ironically, this Court has wielded\n   <em>\n    Purcell\n   </em>\n   as a reason to forbid courts to make voting safer during a pandemic, overriding two federal courts because any safety-related changes supposedly came too close to election day. See\n   <em>\n    Republican National Committee\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Democratic National Committee\n   </em>\n   , 589 U.

Now, faced with an appellate court stay that disrupts a legal status quo and risks immense disfranchisement-a situation that\n   <em>\n    Purcell\n   </em>\n   sought to avoid-the Court balks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
