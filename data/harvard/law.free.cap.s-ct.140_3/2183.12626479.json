In organizing the CFPB, Congress deviated from the structure of nearly every other independent administrative agency in our history. Instead of placing the agency under the leadership of a board with multiple members, Congress provided that the CFPB would be led by a single Director, who serves for a longer term than the President and cannot be removed by the President except for inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance. The CFPB Director has no boss, peers, or voters to report to. Yet the Director wields vast rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudicatory authority over a significant portion of the U. S. economy. The question before us is whether this arrangement violates the Constitution's separation of powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Under our Constitution, the \"executive Power\"-all of it-is \"vested in a President,\" who must \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" Art.

Because no single person could fulfill that responsibility alone, the Framers expected that the President would rely on subordinate officers for assistance.

We decline to take that step. While we need not and do not revisit our prior decisions allowing certain limitations on the President's removal power, there are compelling reasons not to extend those precedents to the novel context of an independent agency led by a single Director. Such an agency lacks a foundation in historical practice and clashes with constitutional structure by concentrating power in a unilateral actor insulated from Presidential control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We therefore hold that the structure of the CFPB violates the separation of powers. We go on to hold that the CFPB Director's removal protection is severable from the other statutory provisions bearing on the CFPB's authority. The agency may therefore continue to operate, but its Director, in light of our decision, must be removable by the President at will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the summer of 2007, then-Professor Elizabeth Warren called for the creation of a new, independent federal agency focused on regulating consumer financial products. Warren, Unsafe at Any Rate, Democracy (Summer 2007). Professor Warren believed the financial products marketed to ordinary American households-credit cards, student loans, mortgages, and the like-had grown increasingly unsafe due to a \"regulatory jumble\" that paid too much attention to banks and too little to consumers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To remedy the lack of \"coherent, consumer-oriented\" financial regulation, she proposed \"concentrat[ing] the review of financial products in a single location\"-an independent agency modeled after the multimember Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That proposal soon met its moment. Within months of Professor Warren's writing, the subprime mortgage market collapsed, precipitating a financial crisis that wiped out over $10 trillion in American household wealth and cost millions of Americans their jobs, their retirements, and their homes. In the aftermath, the Obama administration embraced Professor Warren's recommendation. Through the Treasury Department, the administration encouraged Congress to establish an agency with a mandate to ensure that \"consumer protection regulations\" in the financial sector \"are written fairly and enforced vigorously.\" Dept. of Treasury, Financial Regulatory Reform: A New Foundation 55 (2009). Like Professor Warren, the administration envisioned a traditional independent agency, run by a multimember board with a \"diverse set of viewpoints and experiences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2010, Congress acted on these proposals and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent financial regulator within the Federal Reserve System.

Congress tasked the CFPB with \"implement[ing]\" and \"enforc[ing]\" a large body of financial consumer protection laws to \"ensur[e] that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services and that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205511\">\n    12 U.

Congress transferred the administration of 18 existing federal statutes to the CFPB, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Truth in Lending Act. See \u00a7\u00a7 5512(a), 5481(12), (14). In addition, Congress enacted a new prohibition on \"any unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice\" by certain participants in the consumer-finance sector. \u00a7 5536(a)(1)(B). Congress authorized the CFPB to implement that broad standard (and the 18 pre-existing statutes placed under the agency's purview) through binding regulations. \u00a7\u00a7 5531(a)-(b), 5581(a)(1)(A), (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Congress also vested the CFPB with potent enforcement powers. The agency has the authority to conduct investigations, issue subpoenas and civil investigative demands, initiate administrative adjudications, and prosecute civil actions in federal court. \u00a7\u00a7 5562, 5564(a), (f). To remedy violations of federal consumer financial law, the CFPB may seek restitution, disgorgement, and injunctive relief, as well as civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 (inflation adjusted) for each day that a violation occurs. \u00a7\u00a7 5565(a), (c)(2);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201083.1\">\n    12 CFR \u00a7 1083.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Table (2019).

Instead, the CFPB receives funding directly from the Federal Reserve, which is itself funded outside the appropriations process through bank assessments.

See \u00a7 5562(e)(1) (creating cause of action for that purpose). In response, Seila Law renewed its defense that the demand was invalid and must be set aside because the CFPB's structure violated the Constitution.

The Court took as its starting point\n   <em>\n    Humphrey's Executor\n   </em>\n   , which had approved for-cause removal protection for the Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In applying that precedent, the Court recognized that the CFPB wields \"substantially more executive power than the FTC did back in 1935\" and that the CFPB's leadership by a single Director (as opposed to a multimember commission) presented a \"structural difference\" that some jurists had found \"dispositive.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521087\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/923/680/\">\n    923 F.3d at 683-684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Court felt bound to disregard those differences in light of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   , which permitted a single individual (an independent counsel) to exercise a core executive power (prosecuting criminal offenses) despite being insulated from removal except for cause. Because the Court found\n   <em>\n    Humphrey's Executor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   \"controlling,\" it affirmed the District Court's order requiring compliance with the demand.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521087\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/923/680/\">\n    923 F.3d at 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We granted certiorari to address the constitutionality of the CFPB's structure. 589 U.

Start with\n    <em>\n     Humphrey's Executor.\n    </em>\n    Unlike the New Deal-era FTC upheld there, the CFPB is led by a single Director who cannot be described as a \"body of experts\" and cannot be considered \"non-partisan\" in the same sense as a group of officials drawn from both sides of the aisle.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333771\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/602/\">\n     295 U.S. at 624\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333771\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/295/602/\">\n     55 S.Ct. 869\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Moreover, while the staggered terms of the FTC Commissioners prevented complete turnovers in agency leadership and guaranteed that there would always be some Commissioners who had accrued significant expertise, the CFPB's single-Director structure and five-year term guarantee abrupt shifts in agency leadership and with it the loss of accumulated expertise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In addition, the CFPB Director is hardly a mere legislative or judicial aid. Instead of making reports and recommendations to Congress, as the 1935 FTC did, the Director possesses the authority to promulgate binding rules fleshing out 19 federal statutes, including a broad prohibition on unfair and deceptive practices in a major segment of the U. S. economy. And instead of submitting recommended dispositions to an Article III court, the Director may unilaterally issue final decisions awarding legal and equitable relief in administrative adjudications. Finally, the Director's enforcement authority includes the power to seek daunting monetary penalties against private parties on behalf of the United States in federal court-a quintessentially executive power not considered in\n    <em>\n     Humphrey's Executor\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The logic of\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    also does not apply. Everyone agrees the CFPB Director is not an inferior officer, and her duties are far from limited. Unlike the independent counsel, who lacked policymaking or administrative authority, the Director has the sole responsibility to administer 19 separate consumer-protection statutes that cover everything from credit cards and car payments to mortgages and student loans. It is true that the independent counsel in\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    was empowered to initiate criminal investigations and prosecutions, and in that respect wielded core executive power. But that power, while significant, was trained inward to high-ranking Governmental actors identified by others, and was confined to a specified matter in which the Department of Justice had a potential conflict of interest. By contrast, the CFPB Director has the authority to bring the coercive power of the state to bear on millions of private citizens and businesses, imposing even billion-dollar\n    penalties through administrative adjudications and civil actions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In light of these differences, the constitutionality of the CFPB Director's insulation from removal cannot be settled by\n    <em>\n     Humphrey's Executor\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    alone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    C\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The question instead is whether to extend those precedents to the \"new situation\" before us, namely an independent agency led by a single Director and vested with significant executive power.\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     561 U.S., at 483\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In that scheme, individual executive officials will still wield significant authority, but that authority remains subject to the ongoing supervision and control of the elected President. Through the President's oversight, \"the chain of dependence [is] preserved,\" so that \"the lowest officers, the middle grade, and the highest\" all \"depend, as they ought, on the President, and the President on the community.\" 1 Annals of Cong. 499 (J. Madison).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The CFPB's single-Director structure contravenes this carefully calibrated system by vesting significant governmental power in the hands of a single individual accountable to no one. The Director is neither elected by the people nor meaningfully controlled (through the threat of removal) by someone who is. The Director does not even depend on Congress for annual appropriations. See The Federalist No. 58, at 394 (J. Madison) (describing the \"power over the purse\" as the \"most compleat and effectual weapon\" in representing the interests of the people). Yet the Director may\n    <em>\n     unilaterally\n    </em>\n    , without meaningful supervision, issue final regulations,\n    oversee adjudications, set enforcement priorities, initiate prosecutions, and determine what penalties to impose on private parties. With no colleagues to persuade, and no boss or electorate looking over her shoulder, the Director may dictate and enforce policy for a vital segment of the economy affecting millions of Americans.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The CFPB Director's insulation from removal by an accountable President is enough to render the agency's structure unconstitutional. But several other features of the CFPB combine to make the Director's removal protection even more problematic. In addition to lacking the most direct method of presidential control-removal at will-the agency's unique structure also forecloses certain indirect methods of Presidential control.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Because the CFPB is headed by a single Director with a five-year term, some Presidents may not have any opportunity to shape its leadership and thereby influence its activities. A President elected in 2020 would likely not appoint a CFPB Director until 2023, and a President elected in 2028 may\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    appoint one. That means an unlucky President might get elected on a consumer-protection platform and enter office only to find herself saddled with a holdover Director from a competing political party who is dead set\n    <em>\n     against\n    </em>\n    that agenda. To make matters worse, the agency's single-Director structure means the President will not have the opportunity to appoint any other leaders-such as a chair or fellow members of a Commission or Board-who can serve as a check on the Director's authority and help bring the agency in line with the President's preferred policies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The CFPB's receipt of funds outside the appropriations process further aggravates the agency's threat to Presidential control. The President normally has the opportunity to recommend or veto spending bills that affect the operation of administrative agencies. See Art. I, \u00a7 7, cl. 2; Art. II, \u00a7 3. And, for the past century, the President has annually submitted a proposed budget to Congress for approval. See Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, ch. 18, \u00a7 201,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20Stat.%2020\">\n     42 Stat. 20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Presidents frequently use these budgetary tools \"to influence the policies of independent agencies.\"\n    <em>\n     PHH\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275132\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/75/\">\n     881 F.3d at 147\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Henderson, J., dissenting) (citing Pasachoff, The President's Budget as a Source of Agency Policy Control,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Yale%20L.J.%202182\">\n     125 Yale L.

Instead, the Director receives over $500 million per year to fund the agency's chosen priorities. And the Director receives that money from the Federal Reserve, which is itself funded outside of the annual appropriations process. This financial freedom makes it even more likely that the agency will \"slip from the Executive's control, and thus from that of the people.\"\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     561 U.S., at 499\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    3\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <em>\n     Amicus\n    </em>\n    raises three principal arguments in the agency's defense.

We directed the parties to brief and argue whether the Director's removal protection was severable from the other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that establish the CFPB. If so, then the CFPB may continue to exist and operate notwithstanding\n    Congress's unconstitutional attempt to insulate the agency's Director from removal by the President. There is a live controversy between the parties on that question, and resolving it is a necessary step in determining petitioner's entitlement to its requested relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    As the defendant in this action, petitioner seeks a straightforward remedy. It asks us to deny the Government's petition to enforce the civil investigative demand and dismiss the case. The Government counters that the demand, though initially issued by a Director unconstitutionally insulated from removal, can still be enforced on remand because it has since been ratified by an Acting Director accountable to the President. The parties dispute whether this alleged ratification in fact occurred and whether, if so, it is legally sufficient to cure the constitutional defect in the original demand. That debate turns on case-specific factual and legal questions not addressed below and not briefed here. A remand for the lower Courts to consider those questions in the first instance is therefore the appropriate course-unless such a remand would be futile.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    In petitioner's view, it would be. Before the Court of Appeals, petitioner contended that, regardless of any ratification, the demand is unenforceable because the statutory provision insulating the CFPB Director from removal cannot be severed from the other statutory provisions that define the CFPB's authority. See Brief for Appellant in No. 17-56324 (CA9), pp. 27-28, 30-32. If petitioner is correct, and the offending removal provision means the entire agency is unconstitutional and powerless to act, then a remand would be pointless. With no agency left with statutory authority to maintain this suit or otherwise enforce the demand, the appropriate disposition would be to reverse with instructions to deny the Government's petition to enforce the agency's demand for documents and dismiss the case, as petitioner requests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Accordingly, there is a live controversy over the question of severability. And that controversy is essential to our ability to provide petitioner the relief it seeks: If the removal restriction is not severable, then we must grant the relief requested, promptly rejecting the demand outright. If, on the other hand, the removal restriction is severable, we must instead remand for the Government to press its ratification arguments in further proceedings. Unlike the lingering ratification issue, severability presents a pure question of law that has been fully briefed and argued by the parties. We therefore proceed to address it.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    It has long been settled that \"one section of a statute may be repugnant to the Constitution without rendering the whole act void.\"\n    <em>\n     Loeb v.

Quite the opposite. Unlike the Sarbanes-Oxley Act at issue in\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    , the Dodd-Frank Act contains an express severability clause.

Petitioner highlights the references to the CFPB's independence in the statutory text and legislative history, as well as in Professor Warren's and the Obama administration's original proposals. See Brief for Petitioner 43-44 (collecting examples). And petitioner submits that Congress might not have exempted the CFPB from congressional oversight via the appropriations process if it had known that the CFPB would come under executive control.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    These observations certainly confirm that Congress preferred an independent CFPB to a dependent one; but they shed little light on the critical question whether Congress would have preferred a dependent CFPB to\n    <em>\n     no agency at all.\n    </em>\n    That is the only question we have the authority to decide, and the answer seems clear. Petitioner assumes that, if we eliminate the CFPB, regulatory and enforcement authority over the statutes it administers would simply revert back to the handful of independent agencies previously responsible for them. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5933721,12450135\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/91/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 46. But, as the Solicitor General and House of Representatives explain, that shift would trigger a major regulatory disruption and would leave appreciable damage to Congress's work in the consumer-finance arena. See Reply Brief for Respondent 21-22; Tr. of Oral Arg. 67-68. One of the agencies whose regulatory authority was transferred to the CFPB no longer exists.

The others do not have the staff or appropriations to absorb the CFPB's 1,500-employee, 500-million-dollar operations. And none has the authority to administer the Dodd-Frank Act's new prohibition on unfair and deceptive practices in the consumer-finance sector. Given these consequences, it is far from evident that Congress would have preferred no CFPB to a CFPB led by a Director removable at will by the President.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Justice THOMAS would have us junk our settled severability doctrine and start afresh, even though no party has asked us to do so. See\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at 2219 - 2220 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).

We think it clear that Congress would prefer that we use a scalpel rather than a bulldozer in\n    curing the constitutional defect we identify today. And such an approach by this Court can come as no surprise to Congress, which was on notice of constitutional objections to single-Director agencies by multiple past Presidents from both political parties,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 2201 - 2202, and enacted Dodd-Frank against the background of our established severability doctrine.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    As in every severability case, there may be means of remedying the defect in the CFPB's structure that the Court lacks the authority to provide. Our severability analysis does not foreclose Congress from pursuing alternative responses to the problem-for example, converting the CFPB into a multimember agency.

See \u00a7 5562(e)(1). Seila \"challenge[d] the validity of both the civil investigative demand and the ensuing enforcement action.\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 5. Seila has not countersued or sought affirmative relief preventing the CFPB from acting in the future; it simply asks us to \"reverse the court of appeals' judgment.\" Brief for Petitioner 35. I would do just that. As the Court recognizes, the enforcement of a civil investigative demand by an official with unconstitutional removal protection injures Seila. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2195 - 2196. Presented with an enforcement request from an unconstitutionally insulated Director, I would simply deny the CFPB's petition for an order of enforcement. This approach would resolve the dispute before us without addressing the issue of severability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    The Court, however, does more. In the plurality's view,\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    because the CFPB raised a ratification argument before the Court of Appeals, we can (and should) reach the question of severability. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2207 - 2208. But as explained more fully below, resolving this question is wholly unnecessary. Regardless of whether the CFPB's ratification theory is valid, the Court of Appeals on remand must reach the same outcome: The CFPB's civil investigative demand cannot be enforced against Seila.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    The ratification argument presented by the CFPB is quite simple. Since its creation in 2010, the CFPB has had three Directors-first Director Richard Cordray, then Acting Director Mick Mulvaney, and\n    now Director Kathleen Kraninger. The CFPB's first Director, Director Cordray, issued a civil investigative demand to Seila and initiated the enforcement action. The CFPB has conceded that these actions were unconstitutional. But, in the Ninth Circuit, the CFPB argued that the investigative demand was ratified by Acting Director Mulvaney, who it claimed was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    insulated by the removal provision. Brief for Appellee in No. 17-56324, pp. 13-19. In the CFPB's view, the President could remove Acting Director Mulvaney at will because the \"removal provision by its terms applies only to 'the Director,' not to an Acting Director,\" and the Federal Vacancy Reform Act \"does not limit the President's ability to designate a different person as Acting Director.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 14. Based on this ratification theory, the CFPB asked the Ninth Circuit to affirm the District Court's order granting the CFPB's petition to enforce its investigative demand.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    The CFPB does not ask this Court to address ratification on the merits, but it does rely on its unresolved ratification theory to assert that the Court should reach severability. In doing so, the CFPB relies on the same theory that it presented to the Ninth Circuit. Thus, the only live ratification claim is the theory that Acting Director Mulvaney ratified the civil investigative demand. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2207 - 2208.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    The resolution of the CFPB's Acting-Director ratification theory, however, has no bearing on the outcome of the dispute before us and therefore provides no basis for addressing severability. If the Acting Director did not ratify the investigative demand, then there is obviously no need to address severability. And even if he did, the Court still does not need to address severability because the alleged ratification does not cure the constitutional injury-enforcement of an investigative demand by an unconstitutionally insulated Director. Seila \"challenge[d] the validity of both the civil investigative demand\n    <em>\n     and the ensuing enforcement action\n    </em>\n    .\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 5 (emphasis added). Acting Director Mulvaney may (or may not) have properly ratified the issuance of the investigative demand and the initiation of the enforcement proceedings. But he certainly could not ratify the continuance of the enforcement action by his successor, Director Kraninger.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 7. Thus, even if the CFPB's ratification theory is valid, Seila still has an injury: It has been (and continues to be) subjected to enforcement of an investigative demand by Director Kraninger, who \"remains statutorily insulated from removal.\" Reply Brief for Respondent 7; see also\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     561 U.S., at 513\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2196.

It starts by pointing\n    to the severability clause in the Dodd-Frank Act. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2209. That clause states: \"If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\" \u00a7 5302. The plurality states that \"[i]f the Director were removable at will by the President, the constitutional violation would disappear.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2208 - 2209. Then, relying on language in the severability clause, it concludes that the removal provision, \u00a7 5491(c)(3), should be severed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    The plurality suggests that its analysis is a matter of simply enforcing the \"plain language\" of the severability clause. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2209. But I am not sure it is that simple. For one, the plurality does not actually analyze the statutory language.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Second, the analysis the plurality does provide looks nothing like traditional statutory interpretation. Generally, when we interpret a statute, we do not hold that the text sets out a \"presum[ption]\" that can be rebutted by looking to atextual evidence of legislative intent.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2208 - 2209. A text-based interpretation does not allow a free-ranging inquiry into what \" 'Congress, faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have preferred' \" had it known of a constitutional issue.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2209 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 509,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). Nor does it consider whether Congress would have wanted to avoid \"a major regulatory disruption.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2210 - 2211. Statutory interpretation focuses on the text.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Even treating the question as a matter of pure statutory interpretation and assuming that the plurality points to the correct language, the text of the severability clause cannot, in isolation, justify severance of the removal provision. In some instances, a constitutional injury arises as a result of two or more statutory provisions operating together.

But if the Director lacked executive authority under the statute to seek enforcement of a civil investigative demand, \u00a7 5562(e)(1), the constitutional violation in this case would also disappear. The plurality thus\n    <em>\n     chooses\n    </em>\n    which of the provisions to sever.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    In short, when multiple provisions of law combine to cause a constitutional injury, the Court's current approach allows the Court to decide which provision to sever. The text of a severability clause does not guide that choice. Nor does the practice of early American courts. See\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 2218 - 2219. The Court is thus left to choose based on nothing more than speculation as to what the Legislature would have preferred. And the result of its choice can have a dramatic effect on the governing statutory scheme. See\n    <em>\n     Booker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 259,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p245\">\n     125 S.Ct. 738\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (converting the entirety of the Sentencing Guidelines from a mandatory to a discretionary system).

In particular, the Court has commonly allowed those two branches to create zones of administrative independence by limiting the President's power to remove agency heads. The Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The National Labor Relations Board. Statute after statute establishing such entities instructs the President that he may not discharge their directors except for cause-most often phrased as inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Those statutes, whose language the Court has repeatedly approved, provide the model for the removal restriction before us today. If precedent were any guide, that provision would\n    have survived its encounter with this Court-and so would the intended independence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    Our Constitution and history demand that result. The text of the Constitution allows these common for-cause removal limits. Nothing in it speaks of removal. And it grants Congress authority to organize all the institutions of American governance, provided only that those arrangements allow the President to perform his own constitutionally assigned duties. Still more, the Framers' choice to give the political branches wide discretion over administrative offices has played out through American history in ways that have settled the constitutional meaning. From the first, Congress debated and enacted measures to create spheres of administration-especially of financial affairs-detached from direct presidential control. As the years passed, and governance became ever more complicated, Congress continued to adopt and adapt such measures-confident it had latitude to do so under a Constitution meant to \"endure for ages to come.\"\n    <em>\n     McCulloch v. Maryland\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p415\">\n     4 Wheat. 316\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 415,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"446\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p415\">\n     4 L.Ed. 579\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1819) (approving the Second Bank of the United States). Not every innovation in governance-not every experiment in administrative independence-has proved successful. And debates about the prudence of limiting the President's control over regulatory agencies, including through his removal power, have never abated.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    But the Constitution-both as originally drafted and as practiced-mostly leaves disagreements about administrative structure to Congress and the President, who have the knowledge and experience needed to address them. Within broad bounds, it keeps the courts-who do not-out of the picture.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The Court today fails to respect its proper role. It recognizes that this Court has approved limits on the President's removal power over heads of agencies much like the CFPB. Agencies possessing similar powers, agencies charged with similar missions, agencies created for similar reasons. The majority's explanation is that the heads of those agencies fall within an \"exception\"-one for multimember bodies and another for inferior officers-to a \"general rule\" of unrestricted presidential removal power.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2197 - 2198. And the majority says the CFPB Director does not. That account, though, is wrong in every respect. The majority's general rule does not exist. Its exceptions, likewise, are made up for the occasion-gerrymandered so the CFPB falls outside them. And the distinction doing most of the majority's work-between multimember bodies and single directors-does not respond to the constitutional values at stake. If a removal provision violates the separation of powers, it is because the measure so deprives the President of control over an official as to impede his own constitutional functions. But with or without a for-cause removal provision, the President has at least as much control over an individual as over a commission-and possibly more. That means the constitutional concern is, if anything, ameliorated when the agency has a single head. Unwittingly, the majority shows why courts should stay their hand in these matters. \"Compared to Congress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an inferior understanding of the realities of administration\" and the way \"political\n    power[ ] operates.\"\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund v.

It writes in rules to the Constitution that the drafters knew well enough not to put there. It repudiates the lessons of American experience, from the 18th century to the present day. And it commits the Nation to a static version of governance, incapable of responding to new conditions and challenges. Congress and the President established the CFPB to address financial practices that had brought on a devastating recession, and could do so again. Today's decision wipes out a feature of that agency its creators thought fundamental to its mission-a measure of independence from political pressure. I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    The text of the Constitution, the history of the country, the precedents of this Court, and the need for sound and adaptable governance-all stand against the majority's opinion. They point not to the majority's \"general rule\" of \"unrestricted removal power\" with two grudgingly applied \"exceptions.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2197 - 2198, 2199 - 2200. Rather, they bestow discretion on the legislature to structure administrative institutions as the times demand, so long as the President retains the ability to carry out his constitutional duties. And most relevant here, they give Congress wide leeway to limit the President's removal power in the interest of enhancing independence from politics in regulatory bodies like the CFPB.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    What does the Constitution say about the separation of powers-and particularly about the President's removal authority? (Spoiler alert: about the latter, nothing at all.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    The majority offers the civics class version of separation of powers-call it the Schoolhouse Rock definition of the phrase. See Schoolhouse Rock! Three Ring Government (Mar. 13, 1979), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKSGyiT-o3o (\"Ring one, Executive. Two is Legislative, that's Congress. Ring three, Judiciary\"). The Constitution's first three articles, the majority recounts, \"split the atom of sovereignty\" among Congress, the President, and the courts.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2202 - 2203 (internal quotation marks omitted). And by that mechanism, the Framers provided a \"simple\" fix \"to governmental power and its perils.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"450\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    There is nothing wrong with that as a beginning (except the adjective \"simple\"). It is of course true that the Framers lodged three different kinds of power in three different entities. And that they did so for a crucial purpose-because, as James Madison wrote, \"there can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person[ ] or body\" or where \"the power of judging [is] not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\" The Federalist No. 47, p. 325 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (quoting Baron de Montesquieu).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    The problem lies in treating the beginning as an ending too-in failing to recognize that the separation of powers is, by design, neither rigid nor complete. Blackstone, whose work influenced the Framers on this subject as on others, observed that \"every branch\" of government \"supports and is supported, regulates and is regulated, by the rest.\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 151\n    (1765). So as James Madison stated, the creation of distinct branches \"did not mean that these departments ought to have no partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of each other.\" The Federalist No. 47, at 325 (emphasis deleted).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    To the contrary, Madison explained, the drafters of the Constitution-like those of then-existing state constitutions-opted against keeping the branches of government \"absolutely separate and distinct.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 327. Or as Justice Story reiterated a half-century later: \"[W]hen we speak of a separation of the three great departments of government,\" it is \"not meant to affirm, that they must be kept wholly and entirely separate.\" 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 524, p. 8 (1833). Instead, the branches have-as they must for the whole arrangement to work-\"common link[s] of connexion [and] dependence.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    One way the Constitution reflects that vision is by giving Congress broad authority to establish and organize the Executive Branch. Article II presumes the existence of \"Officer[s]\" in \"executive Departments.\" \u00a7 2, cl. 1. But it does not, as you might think from reading the majority opinion, give the President authority to decide what kinds of officers-in what departments, with what responsibilities-the Executive Branch requires. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2197 (\"The entire 'executive Power' belongs to the President alone\"). Instead, Article I's Necessary and Proper Clause puts those decisions in the legislature's hands. Congress has the power \"[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" not just its own enumerated powers but also \"all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\" \u00a7 8, cl. 18. Similarly, the Appointments Clause reflects Congress's central role in structuring the Executive Branch. Yes, the President can appoint principal officers, but only as the legislature \"shall ... establish[ ] by Law\" (and of course subject to the Senate's advice and consent). Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. And Congress has plenary power to decide not only what inferior officers will exist but also who (the President or a head of department) will appoint them. So as Madison told the first Congress, the legislature gets to \"create[ ] the office, define[ ] the powers, [and] limit[ ] its duration.\" 1 Annals of Cong. 582 (1789). The President, as to the construction of his own branch of government, can only try to work his will through the legislative process.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    The majority relies for its contrary vision on Article II's Vesting Clause, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2197, 2204 - 2205, but the provision can't carry all that weight.

And nothing of that sort broadly prevents Congress from limiting the President's removal power. I'll turn soon to the Decision of 1789 and other evidence of Post-Convention thought. See\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , at 2228 - 2231. For now, note two points about practice before the Constitution's drafting. First, in that era, Parliament often restricted the King's power to remove royal officers-and the President, needless to say, wasn't supposed to be a king. See Birk, Interrogating the Historical Basis for a Unitary Executive, 73 Stan. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2021). Second, many States at the time allowed limits on gubernatorial removal power even though their constitutions had similar vesting clauses. See Shane, The Originalist Myth of the Unitary Executive,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"459\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.%20Pa.%20J.%20Const.%20L.%20323\">\n     19 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 323\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 334-344 (2016). Historical understandings thus belie the majority's \"general rule.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Nor can the Take Care Clause come to the majority's rescue. That Clause cannot properly serve as a \"placeholder for broad judicial judgments\" about presidential control. Goldsmith &amp; Manning, The Protean Take Care Clause,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"460\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%201835\">\n     164 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1835\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1867 (2016) ; but see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2197, 2206 n.11 (using it that way). To begin with, the provision-\"he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\"-speaks of duty, not power. Art. II, \u00a7 3. New scholarship suggests the language came from English and colonial oaths taken by, and placing fiduciary obligations on, all manner and rank of executive officers. See Kent, Leib, &amp; Shugerman, Faithful Execution and Article II,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"461\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%202111\">\n     132 Harv. L. Rev. 2111\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 2121-2178 (2019). To be sure, the imposition of a duty may imply a grant of power sufficient to carry it out. But again, the majority's view of that power ill comports with founding-era practice, in which removal limits were common. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Corwin, Tenure of Office and the Removal Power Under the Constitution,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"462\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%20353\">\n     27 Colum. L. Rev. 353\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 385 (1927) (noting that New York's Constitution of 1777 had nearly the same clause, though the State's executive had \"very little voice\" in removals). And yet more important, the text of the Take Care Clause requires only enough authority to make sure \"the laws [are] faithfully executed\"-meaning with fidelity to the law itself, not to every presidential policy preference. As this Court has held, a President can ensure \" 'faithful execution' of the laws\"-thereby satisfying his \"take care\" obligation-with a removal provision like the one here.\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"463\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     487 U.S., at 692\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"464\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The majority professes unconcern. After all, it\n    says, \"neither is there a 'separation of powers clause' or a 'federalism clause.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2204 - 2205. But those concepts are carved into the Constitution's text-the former in its first three articles separating powers, the latter in its enumeration of federal powers and its reservation of all else to the States. And anyway, at-will removal is hardly such a \"foundational doctrine[ ],\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"466\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    : You won't find it on a civics class syllabus.

As Madison wrote, \"a regular course of practice\" can \"liquidate &amp; settle the meaning of \" disputed or indeterminate constitutional provisions. Letter to Spencer Roane (Sept. 2, 1819), in 8 Writings of James Madison 450 (G. Hunt ed. 1908); see\n    <em>\n     NLRB v.

The majority lays claim to that kind of record, asserting that its muscular view of \"[t]he President's removal power has long been confirmed by history.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2197. But that is not so. The early history-including the fabled Decision of 1789-shows mostly debate and division about removal authority. And when a \"settle[ment of] meaning\" at last occurred, it was not on the majority's terms. Instead, it supports wide latitude for Congress to create spheres of administrative independence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    1\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    Begin with evidence from the Constitution's ratification. And note that this moment is indeed the beginning: Delegates to the Constitutional Convention never discussed whether or to what extent the President would have power to remove executive officials. As a result, the Framers advocating ratification had no single view of the matter. In Federalist No. 77, Hamilton presumed that under the new Constitution \"[t]he consent of [the Senate] would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint\" officers of the United States.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 515. He thought that scheme would promote \"steady administration\": \"Where a man in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it, a new president would be restrained\" from substituting \"a person more agreeable to him.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    By contrast, Madison thought the Constitution allowed Congress to decide how any executive official could be removed. He explained in Federalist No. 39: \"The tenure of the ministerial offices generally will be a subject of legal regulation, conformably to the reason of the case, and the example of the State Constitutions.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 253. Neither view, of course, at all supports the majority's story.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    The second chapter is the Decision of 1789, when Congress addressed the removal\n    power while considering the bill creating the Department of Foreign Affairs. Speaking through Chief Justice Taft-a judicial presidentialist if ever there was one-this Court in\n    <em>\n     Myers v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501270\" index=\"472\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/52/\">\n     272 U.S. 52\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501270\" index=\"473\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/52/\">\n     47 S.Ct. 21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501270\" index=\"474\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/52/\">\n     71 L.Ed. 160\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1926), read that debate as expressing Congress's judgment that the Constitution gave the President illimitable power to remove executive officials. The majority rests its own historical claim on that analysis (though somehow also finding room for its two exceptions). See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2197 - 2198. But Taft's historical research has held up even worse than\n    <em>\n     Myers\n    </em>\n    ' holding (which was mostly reversed, see\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , at 2200 - 2201). As Dean Manning has concluded after reviewing decades' worth of scholarship on the issue, \"the implications of the debate, properly understood, [are] highly ambiguous and prone to overreading.\" Manning, 124 Harv. L. Rev., at 1965, n. 135; see\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 2030-2031.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    The best view is that the First Congress was \"deeply divided\" on the President's removal power, and \"never squarely addressed\" the central issue here.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 1965, n. 135; Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"475\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Cornell%20L.%20Rev.%201021\">\n     91 Cornell L. Rev. 1021\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1072 (2006). The congressional debates revealed three main positions. See Corwin, 27 Colum. L. Rev., at 361. Some shared Hamilton's Federalist No. 77 view: The Constitution required Senate consent for removal. At the opposite extreme, others claimed that the Constitution gave absolute removal power to the President. And a third faction maintained that the Constitution placed Congress in the driver's seat: The legislature could regulate, if it so chose, the President's authority to remove. In the end, Congress passed a bill saying nothing about removal, leaving the President free to fire the Secretary of Foreign Affairs at will. But the only one of the three views definitively rejected was Hamilton's theory of necessary Senate consent. As even strong proponents of executive power have shown, Congress never \"endorse[d] the view that [it] lacked authority to modify\" the President's removal authority when it wished to. Prakash,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1073 ; see Manning,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1965, n. 135, 2030-2031. The summer of 1789 thus ended without resolution of the critical question: Was the removal power \"beyond the reach of congressional regulation?\" Prakash,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1072.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    At the same time, the First Congress gave officials handling financial affairs-as compared to diplomatic and military ones-some independence from the President. The title and first section of the statutes creating the Departments of Foreign Affairs and War designated them \"executive departments.\" Act of July 27, 1789, ch. 4,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"476\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%2028\">\n     1 Stat. 28\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 7,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"477\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%2049\">\n     1 Stat. 49\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

That difference in nomenclature signaled others of substance.

But even James Madison, who at this point opposed most removal limits, told Congress that \"there may be strong reasons why an officer of this kind should not hold his office at the pleasure\" of the Secretary or President. 1 Annals of Cong. 612. At the least, as Professor Prakash writes, \"Madison maintained that Congress had the [constitutional] authority to modify [the Comptroller's] tenure.\" Prakash,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 1071.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    Contrary to the majority's view, then, the founding era closed without any agreement that Congress lacked the power to curb the President's removal authority. And as it kept that question open, Congress took the first steps-which would launch a tradition-of distinguishing financial regulators from diplomatic and military officers. The latter mainly helped the President carry out his own constitutional duties in foreign relations and war. The former chiefly carried out statutory duties, fulfilling functions Congress had assigned to their offices. In addressing the new Nation's finances, Congress had begun to use its powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause to design effective administrative institutions. And that included taking steps to insulate certain officers from political influence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    2\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    As the decades and centuries passed, those efforts picked up steam. Confronting new economic, technological, and social conditions, Congress-and often the President-saw new needs for pockets of independence within the federal bureaucracy. And that was especially so, again, when it came to financial regulation. I mention just a few highlights here-times when Congress decided that effective governance depended on shielding technical or expertise-based functions relating to the financial system from political pressure (or the moneyed interests that might lie behind it). Enacted under the Necessary and Proper Clause, those measures-creating some of the Nation's most enduring institutions-themselves helped settle the extent of Congress's power. \"[A] regular course of practice,\" to use Madison's phrase, has \"liquidate[d]\" constitutional meaning about the permissibility of independent agencies. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2228 - 2229.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    Take first Congress's decision in 1816 to create the Second Bank of the United States-\"the first truly independent agency in the republic's history.\" Lessig &amp; Sunstein, The President and the Administration,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"483\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%201\">\n     94 Colum.

Yet the Bank had a greater impact on the Nation than any but a few institutions, regulating the Nation's money supply in ways anticipating what the Federal Reserve does today. Of\n    course, the Bank was controversial-in large part because of its freedom from presidential control. Andrew Jackson chafed at the Bank's independence and eventually fired his Treasury Secretary for keeping public moneys there (a dismissal that itself provoked a political storm). No matter. Innovations in governance always have opponents; administrative independence predictably (though by no means invariably) provokes presidential ire. The point is that by the early 19th century, Congress established a body wielding enormous financial power mostly outside the President's dominion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    The Civil War brought yet further encroachments on presidential control over financial regulators. In response to wartime economic pressures, President Lincoln (not known for his modest view of executive power) asked Congress to establish an office called the Comptroller of the Currency. The statute he signed made the Comptroller removable only with the Senate's consent-a version of the old Hamiltonian idea, though this time required not by the Constitution itself but by Congress. See Act of Feb. 25, 1863, ch. 58,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"485\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Stat.%20665\">\n     12 Stat. 665\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The majority dismisses the original version of the statute as an \"aberration.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2201. But in the wake of the independence given first to the Comptroller of the Treasury and then to the national Bank, it's hard to conceive of this newest Comptroller position as so great a departure. And even the second iteration of the statute preserved a constraint on the removal power, requiring a President in a firing mood to explain himself to Congress-a demand likely to make him sleep on the subject. In both versions of the law, Congress responded to new financial challenges with new regulatory institutions, alert to the perils in this area of political interference.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    And then, nearly a century and a half ago, the floodgates opened. In 1887, the growing power of the railroads over the American economy led Congress to create the Interstate Commerce Commission. Under that legislation, the President could remove the five Commissioners only \"for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\"-the same standard Congress applied to the CFPB Director. Act of Feb. 4, 1887, \u00a7 11,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Stat.%20383\">\n     24 Stat. 383\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . More-many more-for-cause removal provisions followed. In 1913, Congress gave the Governors of the Federal Reserve Board for-cause protection to ensure the agency would resist political\n    pressure and promote economic stability.

To be sure, the line of our decisions has not run altogether straight. But we have repeatedly upheld provisions that prevent the President from firing regulatory officials except for such matters as neglect or malfeasance. In those decisions, we sounded a caution, insisting that Congress could not impede through removal restrictions the President's performance of his own constitutional duties. (So, to take the clearest example, Congress could not curb the President's power to remove his close military or diplomatic advisers.) But within that broad limit, this Court held, Congress could protect from at-will removal the officials it deemed to need some independence from political pressures. Nowhere do those precedents suggest what the majority announces today: that the President has an \"unrestricted removal power\" subject to two bounded exceptions.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2188 - 2189.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    The majority grounds its new approach in\n    <em>\n     Myers\n    </em>\n    , ignoring the way this Court has cabined that decision.\n    <em>\n     Myers\n    </em>\n    , the majority tells us, found an unrestrained removal power \"essential to the [President's] execution of the laws.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2197 - 2198 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Myers,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501270\" index=\"492\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/52/\">\n     272 U.S., at 117\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501270\" index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/52/\">\n     47 S.Ct. 21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).

The\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    Court, over a one-Justice dissent, upheld for-cause protections afforded to an independent counsel with power to investigate and prosecute crimes committed by high-ranking officials. The Court well understood that those law enforcement functions differed from the rulemaking and adjudicatory duties highlighted in\n    <em>\n     Humphrey's\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Wiener\n    </em>\n    . But that difference did not resolve the issue. An official's functions,\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    held, were relevant to but not dispositive of a removal limit's constitutionality. The key question in all the cases,\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    saw, was whether such a restriction would \"impede the President's ability to perform his constitutional duty.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"531\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     487 U.S., at 691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"532\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Only if it did so would it fall outside Congress's power. And the protection for the independent counsel, the Court found, did not. Even though the counsel's functions were \"purely executive,\" the President's \"need to control the exercise of [her] discretion\" was not \"so central to the functioning of the Executive Branch as to require\" unrestricted removal authority.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     at 690-691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"534\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . True enough, the Court acknowledged, that the for-cause standard prevented the President from firing the counsel for discretionary decisions or judgment calls. But it preserved \"ample authority\" in the President \"to assure that the counsel is competently performing\" her \"responsibilities in a manner that comports with\" all legal requirements.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     at 692\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"536\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

(Mostly, it seems, the majority just wishes the case would go away. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2200, n. 4.)

It again rejected the notion of an \"all-inclusive\" removal power.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"540\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It yet further confined\n    <em>\n     Myers\n    </em>\n    ' reach, making clear that Congress could restrict the President's removal of officials carrying out even the most traditional executive functions. And the decision, with care, set out the governing rule-again, that removal restrictions are permissible so long as they do not impede the President's performance of his own constitutionally assigned duties. Second,\n    as all that suggests,\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    is not limited to inferior officers. In the eight pages addressing the removal issue, the Court constantly spoke of \"officers\" and \"officials\" in general.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"541\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     487 U.S., at 685-693\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"542\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . By contrast, the Court there used the word \"inferior\" in just one sentence (which of course the majority quotes), when applying its general standard to the case's facts.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     at 691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"544\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Indeed, Justice Scalia's dissent emphasized that the counsel's inferior-office status played no role in the Court's decision.

In that case, the Court considered a \"highly unusual\" scheme of double for-cause protection.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"552\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     561 U.S., at 505\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"553\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Members of an accounting board were protected from removal by SEC Commissioners, who in turn were protected from removal by the President. The Court found that the two-layer structure deprived the President of \"adequate control\" over the Board members.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"554\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"554\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     at 508\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"555\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The scheme \"impaired\" the President's \"ability to execute the laws,\" the Court explained, because neither he nor any fully dependent agent could decide \"whether[ ] good cause exists\" for a discharge.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     at 495-496\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"557\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That holding cast no doubt on ordinary for-cause protections, of the kind in the Court's prior cases (and here as well). Quite the opposite. The Court observed that it did not \"take issue with for-cause limitations in general\"-which\n    <em>\n     do\n    </em>\n    enable the President to determine whether good cause for discharge exists (because, say, an official has violated the law).\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"558\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"558\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     at 501\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"559\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And the Court's solution to the constitutional problem it saw was merely to strike one level of insulation, making the Board removable by the SEC at will. That remedy left the SEC's own for-cause protection in place. The President could thus remove Commissioners for malfeasance or neglect, but not for policy disagreements. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2206 - 2207.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    So caselaw joins text and history in establishing the general permissibility of for-cause provisions giving some independence to agencies. Contrary to the majority's view, those laws do not represent a suspicious departure from illimitable presidential control over administration. For almost a century, this Court has made clear that Congress has broad discretion to enact for-cause protections in pursuit of good governance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    D\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    The deferential approach this Court has taken gives Congress the flexibility it needs to craft administrative agencies. Diverse problems of government demand diverse solutions. They call for varied measures and mixtures of democratic accountability and technical expertise, energy and efficiency. Sometimes, the arguments push toward tight presidential control of agencies. The President's engagement, some people say, can disrupt bureaucratic stagnation, counter industry capture, and make agencies more responsive to public interests. See, well, Kagan,\n    Presidential Administration,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"560\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%202245\">\n     114 Harv. L. Rev. 2245\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 2331-2346 (2001). At other times, the arguments favor greater independence from presidential involvement. Insulation from political pressure helps ensure impartial adjudications. It places technical issues in the hands of those most capable of addressing them. It promotes continuity, and prevents short-term electoral interests from distorting policy. (Consider, for example, how the Federal Reserve's independence stops a President trying to win a second term from manipulating interest rates.) Of course, the right balance between presidential control and independence is often uncertain, contested, and value-laden. No mathematical formula governs institutional design; trade-offs are endemic to the enterprise. But that is precisely why the issue is one for the political branches to debate-and then debate again as times change. And it's why courts should stay (mostly) out of the way. Rather than impose rigid rules like the majority's, they should let Congress and the President figure out what blend of independence and political control will best enable an agency to perform its intended functions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    Judicial intrusion into this field usually reveals only how little courts know about governance. Even everything I just said is an over-simplification. It suggests that agencies can easily be arranged on a spectrum, from the most to the least presidentially controlled. But that is not so. A given agency's independence (or lack of it) depends on a wealth of features, relating not just to removal standards, but also to appointments practices, procedural rules, internal organization, oversight regimes, historical traditions, cultural norms, and (inevitably) personal relationships. It is hard to pinpoint how those factors work individually, much less in concert, to influence the distance between an agency and a President. In that light, even the judicial opinions' perennial focus on removal standards is a bit of a puzzle. Removal is only the most obvious, not necessarily the most potent, means of control. See generally\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"561\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     561 U.S., at 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"562\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (BREYER, J., dissenting). That is because informal restraints can prevent Presidents from firing at-will officers-and because other devices can keep officers with for-cause protection under control. Of course no court, as\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    noted, can accurately assess the \"bureaucratic minutiae\" affecting a President's influence over an agency.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"563\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 500,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"564\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (majority opinion);\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2208 (reprising the point). But that is yet more reason for courts to defer to the branches charged with fashioning administrative structures, and to hesitate before ruling out agency design specs like for-cause removal standards.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    Our Constitution, as shown earlier, entrusts such decisions to more accountable and knowledgeable actors. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2226 - 2229. The document-with great good sense-sets out almost no rules about the administrative sphere. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote when he upheld the first independent financial agency: \"To have prescribed the means by which government should, in all future time, execute its powers, would have been to change, entirely, the character of the instrument.\"\n    <em>\n     McCulloch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"565\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p415\">\n     4 Wheat. at 415\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That would have been, he continued, \"an unwise attempt to provide, by immutable rules, for exigencies which, if foreseen at all, must have been seen dimly.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"566\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p415\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    And if the Constitution, for those reasons, does not lay out immutable rules, then neither should judges. This Court has usually respected that injunction. It has declined to second-guess the work of the political branches in creating independent agencies like the CFPB. In reversing course today-in spurning a \"pragmatic, flexible approach to American governance\" in favor\n    of a dogmatic, inflexible one,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2207-the majority makes a serious error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    As the majority explains, the CFPB emerged out of disaster. The collapse of the subprime mortgage market \"precipitat[ed] a financial crisis that wiped out over $10 trillion in American household wealth and cost millions of Americans their jobs, their retirements, and their homes.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2192. In that moment of economic ruin, the President proposed and Congress enacted legislation to address the causes of the collapse and prevent a recurrence. An important part of that statute created an agency to protect consumers from exploitative financial practices. The agency would take over enforcement of almost 20 existing federal laws. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"567\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205581\">\n     12 U. S. C. \u00a7 5581\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And it would administer a new prohibition on \"unfair, deceptive, or abusive act[s] or practice[s]\" in the consumer-finance sector. \u00a7 5536(a)(1)(B).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    No one had a doubt that the new agency should be independent. As explained already, Congress has historically given-with this Court's permission-a measure of independence to financial regulators like the Federal Reserve Board and the FTC. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2197 - 2200. And agencies of that kind had administered most of the legislation whose enforcement the new statute transferred to the CFPB. The law thus included an ordinary for-cause provision-once again, that the President could fire the CFPB's Director only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" \u00a7 5491(c)(3). That standard would allow the President to discharge the Director for a failure to \"faithfully execute[ ]\" the law, as well as for basic incompetence. U. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 3 ; see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2195, 2202. But it would not permit removal for policy differences.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    The question here, which by now you're well equipped to answer, is whether including that for-cause standard in the statute creating the CFPB violates the Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    Applying our longstanding precedent, the answer is clear: It does not. This Court, as the majority acknowledges, has sustained the constitutionality of the FTC and similar independent agencies. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2191 - 2192, 2231 - 2233. The for-cause protections for the heads of those agencies, the Court has found, do not impede the President's ability to perform his own constitutional duties, and so do not breach the separation of powers. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2200 - 2203. There is nothing different here. The CFPB wields the same kind of power as the FTC and similar agencies. And all of their heads receive the same kind of removal protection. No less than those other entities-by now part of the fabric of government-the CFPB is thus a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to structure administration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    First, the CFPB's powers are nothing unusual in the universe of independent agencies. The CFPB, as the majority notes, can issue regulations, conduct its own adjudications, and bring civil enforcement actions in court-all backed by the threat of penalties. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2191;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"568\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205512\">\n     12 U. S.

See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"569\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2045\">\n     15 U. S.

Just for a comparison, the CFPB now has 19 enforcement actions pending, while the SEC brought 862 such actions last year alone. See Brief for Petitioner 7; SEC, Div. of Enforcement 2019 Ann. Rep. 14. And although the majority bemoans that the\n    CFPB can \"bring the coercive power of the state to bear on millions of private citizens,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2200 - 2201, that scary-sounding description applies to most independent agencies. Forget that the more relevant factoid for those many citizens might be that the CFPB has recovered over $11 billion for banking consumers. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2193. The key point here is that the CFPB got the mass of its regulatory authority from other independent agencies that had brought the same \"coercive power to bear.\" See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"570\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205581\">\n     12 U.

The CFPB, gauged by that comparison, is a piker.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    Second, the removal protection given the CFPB's Director is standard fare. The removal power rests with the President alone; Congress has no role to play, as it did in the laws struck down in\n    <em>\n     Myers\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Bowsher\n    </em>\n    . See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2233 - 2234. The statute provides only one layer of protection, unlike the law in\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    . See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2236. And the clincher, which you have heard before: The for-cause standard used for the CFPB is identical to the one the Court upheld in\n    <em>\n     Humphrey's\n    </em>\n    . Both enable the President to fire an agency head for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"572\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205491\">\n     12 U.

A removal provision of that kind applied to a financial agency head, this Court has held, does not \"unduly trammel[ ] on executive authority,\" even though it prevents the President from dismissing the official for a discretionary policy judgment.\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"574\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     487 U.S., at 691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"575\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Rather, this Court has explained, the for-cause standard gives the President \"ample authority to assure that [the official] is competently performing his\n    or her statutory responsibilities in a manner that comports with\" all legal obligations.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"578\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     487 U.S., at 692\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"579\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2235. In other words-and contra today's majority-the President's removal power, though not absolute, gives him the \"meaningful[ ] control[ ]\" of the Director that the Constitution requires.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2203 - 2204.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    The analysis is as simple as simple can be. The CFPB Director exercises the same powers, and receives the same removal protections, as the heads of other, constitutionally permissible independent agencies. How could it be that this opinion is a dissent?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    The majority focuses on one (it says sufficient) reason: The CFPB Director is singular, not plural. \"Instead of placing the agency under the leadership of a board with multiple members,\" the majority protests, \"Congress provided that the CFPB would be led by a single Director.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2191.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    And a solo CFPB Director does not fit within either of the majority's supposed exceptions. He is not an inferior officer, so (the majority says)\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    does not apply; and he is not a multimember board, so (the majority says) neither does\n    <em>\n     Humphrey's\n    </em>\n    . Further, the majority argues, \"[a]n agency with a [unitary] structure like that of the CFPB\" is \"novel\"-or, if not quite that, \"almost wholly unprecedented.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2188 - 2189, 2200 - 2201. Finally, the CFPB's organizational form violates the \"constitutional structure\" because it vests power in a \"single individual\" who is \"insulated from Presidential control.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2188 - 2189, 2203 - 2204.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    I'm tempted at this point just to say: No. All I've explained about constitutional text, history, and precedent invalidates the majority's thesis. But I'll set out here some more targeted points, taking step by step the majority's reasoning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    First, as I'm afraid you've heard before, the majority's \"exceptions\" (like its general rule) are made up. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2232 - 2236. To begin with, our precedents reject the very idea of such exceptions. \"The analysis contained in our removal cases,\"\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    stated, shuns any attempt \"to define rigid categories\" of officials who may (or may not) have job protection.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"580\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     487 U.S., at 689\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"581\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Still more, the contours of the majority's exceptions don't connect to our decisions' reasoning. The analysis in\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    , as I've shown, extended far beyond inferior officers. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2235 - 2236. And of course that analysis had to apply to\n    <em>\n     individual\n    </em>\n    officers: The independent counsel was very much a person, not a committee. So the idea that\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    is in a separate box from this case doesn't hold up.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Similarly,\n    <em>\n     Humphrey's\n    </em>\n    and later precedents give no support to the majority's view that the number of people at the apex of an agency matters to the constitutional issue. Those opinions mention the \"groupness\" of the agency head only in their background sections. The majority picks out that until-now-irrelevant fact to distinguish the CFPB, and constructs around it an until-now-unheard-of exception. So if the majority really wants to see something \"novel,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2191 - 2192, it need only look to its opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    By contrast, the CFPB's single-director structure has a fair bit of precedent behind it. The Comptroller of the Currency. The Office of the Special Counsel (OSC). The Social Security Administration (SSA). The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Maybe four prior agencies is in the eye of the beholder, but it's hardly nothing. I've already explained why the earliest of those agencies-the Civil-War-era Comptroller-is not the blip the majority describes. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2231 - 2232. The office is one in a long line, starting with the founding-era Comptroller of the Treasury (also one person), of financial regulators designed to do their jobs with some independence. As for the other three, the majority objects: too powerless and too contested. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2200 - 2203. I think not. On power, the SSA runs the Nation's largest government program-among other things, deciding all claims brought by its 64 million beneficiaries; the FHFA plays a crucial role in overseeing the mortgage market, on which millions of Americans annually rely; and the OSC prosecutes misconduct in the two-million-person federal workforce. All different from the CFPB, no doubt; but the majority can't think those matters beneath a President's notice. (Consider: Would the President lose more votes from a malfunctioning SSA or CFPB?) And controversial? Well, yes, they are. Almost\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    independent agencies are controversial, no matter how many directors they have. Or at least controversial among Presidents and their lawyers. That's because whatever might be said in their favor, those agencies divest the President of some removal power. If signing statements and veto threats made independent agencies unconstitutional, quite a few wouldn't pass muster. Maybe that's what the majority really wants (I wouldn't know)-but it can't pretend the disputes surrounding these agencies had anything to do with whether their heads are singular or plural.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    Still more important, novelty is not the test of constitutionality when it comes to structuring agencies. See\n    <em>\n     Mistretta v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"582\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p385\">\n     488 U.S. 361\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 385,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"583\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p385\">\n     109 S.Ct. 647\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"584\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p385\">\n     102 L.Ed.2d 714\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1989) (\"[M]ere anomaly or innovation\" does not violate the separation of powers). Congress regulates in that sphere under the Necessary and Proper Clause, not (as the majority seems to think) a Rinse and Repeat Clause. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2227. The Framers understood that new times would often require new measures, and exigencies often demand innovation. See\n    <em>\n     McCulloch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"585\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p415\">\n     4 Wheat. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    415 ;\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2237. In line with that belief, the history of the administrative sphere-its rules, its practices, its institutions-is replete with experiment and change. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2228 - 2233. Indeed, each of the agencies the majority says now fits within its \"exceptions\" was once new; there is, as the saying goes, \"a first time for everything.\"\n    <em>\n     National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"586\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p549\">\n     567 U.S. 519\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 549,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"587\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p549\">\n     132 S.Ct. 2566\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"588\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p549\">\n     183 L.Ed.2d 450\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012). So even if the CFPB differs from its forebears in having a single director, that departure is not itself \"telling\" of a \"constitutional problem.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2200 - 2201. In deciding what\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    moment demanded, Congress had no obligation to make a carbon copy of a design from a bygone era.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    And Congress's choice to put a single director, rather than a multimember commission, at the CFPB's head violates no principle of separation of powers. The purported constitutional problem here is that an official has \"slip[ped] from the Executive's control\" and \"supervision\"-that he has become unaccountable to the President.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2203, 2205 (internal quotation marks omitted). So to make sense on the majority's own terms, the distinction between singular and plural agency heads must rest on a theory about why the former more easily \"slip\" from the President's grasp. But the majority has nothing to offer. In fact, the opposite is more likely to be true: To the extent that such matters are measurable, individuals are easier than groups to supervise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    To begin with, trying to generalize about these matters is something of a fool's errand. Presidential control, as noted earlier, can operate through many means-removal to be sure, but also appointments, oversight devices (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    centralized review of rulemaking or litigating positions), budgetary processes, personal outreach, and more. See\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"589\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     561 U.S., at 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"590\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (BREYER, J., dissenting);\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2236 - 2237.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    The effectiveness of each of those control mechanisms, when present, can then depend on a multitude of agency-specific practices, norms, rules, and organizational features. In that complex stew, the difference between a singular and plural agency head will often make not a whit of difference. Or to make the point more concrete, a multimember commission may be harder to control than an individual director for a host of reasons unrelated to its plural character. That may be so when the two are subject to the same removal standard, or even when the individual director has greater formal job protection. Indeed, the very category of multimember commissions breaks apart under inspection, spoiling the majority's essential dichotomy. See generally Brief for Rachel E. Barkow et al. as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    . Some of those commissions have chairs appointed by the President; others do not. Some of those chairs are quite powerful; others are not. Partisan balance requirements, term length,\n    voting rules, and more-all vary widely, in ways that make a significant difference to the ease of presidential control. Why, then, would anyone distinguish along a simple commission/single-director axis when deciding whether the Constitution requires at-will removal?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    But if the demand is for generalization, then the majority's distinction cuts the opposite way: More powerful control mechanisms are needed (if anything) for commissions. Holding everything else equal, those are the agencies more likely to \"slip from the Executive's control.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2204. Just consider your everyday experience: It's easier to get one person to do what you want than a gaggle. So too, you know exactly whom to blame when an individual-but not when a group-does a job badly. The same is true in bureaucracies. A multimember structure reduces accountability to the President because it's harder for him to oversee, to influence-or to remove, if necessary-a group of five or more commissioners than a single director. Indeed, that is\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    Congress so often resorts to hydra-headed agencies. \"[M]ultiple membership,\" an influential Senate Report concluded, is \"a buffer against Presidential control\" (especially when combined, as it often is, with partisan-balance requirements). Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Study on Federal Regulation, S. Doc. No. 95-91, vol. 5, p. 75 (1977). So, for example, Congress constructed the Federal Reserve as it did because it is \"easier to protect a board from political control than to protect a single appointed official.\" R. Cushman, The Independent Regulatory Commissions 153 (1941).\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    It is hard to know why Congress did not take the same tack when creating the CFPB. But its choice brought the agency only closer to the President-more exposed to his view, more subject to his sway. In short, the majority gets the matter backward: Where presidential control is the object, better to have one than many.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    Because it has no answer on that score, the majority slides to a different question: Assuming presidential control of any independent agency is vanishingly slim, is a single-head or a multi-head agency more capable of exercising power, and so of endangering liberty? See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2202 - 2204. The majority says a single head is the greater threat because he may wield power \"\n    <em>\n     unilaterally\n    </em>\n    \" and \"[w]ith no colleagues to persuade.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2203 - 2204 (emphasis in original). So the CFPB falls victim to what the majority sees as a constitutional anti-power-concentration principle (with an exception for the President).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    If you've never heard of a statute being struck down on that ground, you're not alone. It is bad enough to \"extrapolat[e]\" from the \"general constitutional language\" of Article II's Vesting Clause an unrestricted removal power constraining Congress's ability to legislate under the Necessary and Proper Clause.\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"591\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     487 U.S., at 690, n. 29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"592\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2227 - 2228. It is still worse to extrapolate from the Constitution's general\n    structure (division of powers) and implicit values (liberty) a limit on Congress's express power to create administrative bodies. And more: to extrapolate from such sources a distinction as prosaic as that between the SEC and the CFPB-\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    between a multi-headed and single-headed agency. That is, to adapt a phrase (or two) from our precedent, \"more than\" the emanations of \"the text will bear.\"\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"593\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     487 U.S., at 690, n. 29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"594\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

And he can use the many other tools attached to the Office of the Presidency-including in the CFPB's case, rulemaking review-to exert influence over discretionary policy calls. See\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 2242, and n.13. Second, the majority has nothing but intuition to back up its essentially functionalist claim that the CFPB would be less capable of exercising power if it had more than one Director (even supposing that were a suitable issue for a court to address).\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2202 - 2204. Maybe the CFPB would be. Or maybe not. Although a multimember format tends to frustrate the President's control over an agency, see\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 2209 - 2211, it may not lessen the agency's own ability to act with decision and dispatch. (Consider, for a recent example, the Federal Reserve Board.) That effect presumably would depend on the agency's internal organization, voting rules, and similar matters. At the least: If the Court is going to invalidate statutes based on empirical assertions like this one, it should offer some empirical support. It should not pretend that its assessment that the CFPB wields more power more dangerously than the SEC comes from someplace in the Constitution. But today the majority fails to accord even that minimal respect to Congress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-247\">\n    Recall again how this dispute got started. In the midst of the Great Recession, Congress and the President came together to create an agency with an important mission. It would protect consumers from the reckless financial practices that had caused the then-ongoing economic collapse. Not only Congress but also the President thought that the new agency, to fulfill its mandate, needed a measure of independence. So the two political branches, acting together, gave the CFPB Director the same job protection that innumerable other agency heads possess. All in all, those branches must have thought, they had done a good day's work. Relying on their experience and knowledge of administration, they had built an agency in the way best suited to carry out its functions. They had protected the public from financial chicanery and crisis. They had governed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-248\">\n    And now consider how the dispute ends-with five unelected judges rejecting the result of that democratic process. The outcome today will not shut down the CFPB: A different majority of this Court, including all those who join this opinion, believes that\n    <em>\n     if\n    </em>\n    the agency's removal provision is unconstitutional, it should be severed. But the majority on constitutionality jettisons a measure Congress and the President viewed as integral to the way the agency should operate. The majority does so even though the Constitution grants to Congress, acting with the President's approval, the authority to create and shape administrative bodies. And even though those branches, as compared to courts, have far greater understanding of political control mechanisms and agency design.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-249\">\n    Nothing in the Constitution requires that outcome; to the contrary. \"While the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty, it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government.\"\n    <em>\n     Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341177\" index=\"598\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/343/579/#p635\">\n     343 U.S. 579\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 635,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341177\" index=\"599\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/343/579/#p635\">\n     72 S.Ct. 863\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"600\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20L.%20Ed.%201153\">\n     96 L.Ed. 1153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). The Framers took pains to craft a document that would allow the structures of governance to change, as times and needs change. The Constitution says only a few words about administration. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote: Rather than prescribing \"immutable rules,\" it enables Congress to choose \"the means by which government should, in all future time, execute its powers.\"\n    <em>\n     McCulloch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"601\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p415\">\n     4 Wheat. at 415\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It authorizes Congress to meet new exigencies with new devices. So Article II does not generally prohibit independent agencies. Nor do any supposed structural principles. Nor do any odors wafting from the document. Save for when those agencies impede the President's performance of his own constitutional duties, the matter is left up to Congress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-250\">\n    Our history has stayed true to the Framers' vision. Congress has accepted their invitation to experiment with administrative forms-nowhere more so than in the field of financial regulation. And this Court has mostly allowed it to do so. The result is a broad array of independent agencies, no two exactly alike but all with a measure of insulation from the President's removal power. The Federal Reserve Board; the FTC; the SEC; maybe some you've never heard of. As to each, Congress thought that formal job protection for policymaking would produce regulatory outcomes in greater accord with the long-term public interest. Congress may have been right; or it may have been wrong; or maybe it was some of both. No matter-the branches accountable to the people have decided how the people should be governed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-251\">\n    The CFPB should have joined the ranks. Maybe it will still do so, even under today's opinion: The majority tells Congress that it may \"pursu[e] alternative responses\" to the identified constitutional defect-\"for example, converting the CFPB into a multimember agency.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2211. But there was no need to send Congress back to the drawing board. The Constitution does not distinguish between single-director and multimember independent agencies. It instructs Congress, not this Court, to decide on agency design. Because this Court ignores that sensible-indeed, that obvious-division of tasks, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-257\">\n     The dissent would have us ignore the reasoning of\n     <em>\n      Humphrey's Executor\n     </em>\n     and instead apply the decision only as part of a reimagined\n     <em>\n      Humphrey's\n     </em>\n     -through-\n     <em>\n      Morrison\n     </em>\n     framework.

See\n     <em>\n      post\n     </em>\n     , at 2227 - 2228. But the Framers hardly viewed State Governors as a reliable guide in fashioning the Federal Executive.

But that carveout makes no logical or constitutional sense.

Anxious to prevent President Andrew Johnson from interfering with reconstruction policies-including through his command of the military-Congress barred presidential removal of any Senate-confirmed officials without the Senate's consent. The law thus severed the President's removal authority over even officials like the Secretaries of War and State. The statute became the basis for the Nation's first presidential impeachment, but was repealed in 1887. See Act of Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 353,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"629\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Stat.%20500\">\n      24 Stat. 500\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . In one sense, the two-decade-long existence of the Tenure of Office Act reveals the 19th-century political system's comfort with expansive restrictions on presidential removal. But the ultimate repudiation of the law, and the broad historical consensus that it went too far, just as strongly shows the limits that system later accepted on legislative power-that Congress may not impose removal restrictions preventing the President from carrying out his own constitutionally assigned functions in areas like war or foreign affairs.

(The majority's reply that a court including Charles Evans Hughes, Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, and Harlan Stone somehow misunderstood these powers, see\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2200 n.4, lacks all plausibility.) And in any case, the relevant point of comparison is the present-day FTC, which remains independent even if it now has some expanded powers-and which remains constitutional under not only\n     <em>\n      Humphrey's\n     </em>\n     but also\n     <em>\n      Morrison\n     </em>\n     .

First, the majority notes that the CFPB receives its funding outside the normal appropriations process. See\n     <em>\n      ante\n     </em>\n     , at 2204 - 2205. But so too do other financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"657\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20243\">\n      12 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 243\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 1815(d), 1820(e). And budgetary independence comes mostly at the expense of Congress's control over the agency, not the President's. (Because that is so, it actually works to the President's advantage.) Second, the majority complains that the Director's five-year term may prevent a President from \"shap[ing the agency's] leadership\" through appointments.\n     <em>\n      Ante\n     </em>\n     , at 2204. But again that is true, to one degree or another, of quite a few longstanding independent agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the FTC, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Postal Service Board of Governors.

That's true in a sense: All (all?) the special counsel had to do was decide whether the President and his top advisers had broken the law. But I doubt (and I suspect Presidents would too) whether the need to control those duties was any less \"central to the functioning of the Executive Branch\" than the need to control the CFPB's.\n     <em>\n      Morrison\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"661\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n      487 U.S., at 691-692\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"662\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n      108 S.Ct. 2597\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . And in any event, as I've shown,\n     <em>\n      Morrison\n     </em>\n     did much more than approve a specific removal provision; it created a standard to govern all removal cases that is at complete odds with the majority's reasoning. See\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     at 2234 - 2236.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"13\">\n    <p id=\"p-286\">\n     To use one important example, Congress provided for executive oversight of all the CFPB's rulemaking. The Financial Stability Oversight Council can veto by a two-thirds vote any CFPB regulation it deems a threat to the \"safety and soundness\" of the financial system.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"663\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205513\">\n      12 U.

So the majority is wrong in saying that the CFPB's Director can \"\n     <em>\n      unilaterally\n     </em>\n     \" issue final regulations.\n     <em>\n      Ante\n     </em>\n     , at 2203 - 2204 (emphasis in original). Indeed, the President has more control over rulemaking at the CFPB than at any similar independent agency. And the majority is similarly wrong to think that because the FSOC has not yet issued a formal veto, its review authority makes no practical difference. See\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2204 n.9. Regulatory review, whether by the Office of Management and Budget or the FSOC, usually relies more on the threat of vetoes than on their execution. OMB casts a long shadow over rulemaking in the Executive Branch, but rarely uses its veto pen.
