Petitioners are practicing lawyers in Wisconsin who allege that their Wisconsin State Bar dues are used to fund \"advocacy and other speech on matters of intense public interest and concern.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 10. Among other things, petitioners allege that the Wisconsin State Bar has taken a position on legislation prohibiting health plans from funding abortions, legislation on felon voting rights, and items in the state budget. Petitioners' First Amendment challenge to Wisconsin's integrated bar arrangement is foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Keller v.

We observed that \"\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   was poorly reasoned,\" that \"[i]t has led to practical problems and abuse,\" and that \"[i]t is inconsistent with other First Amendment cases and has been undermined by more recent decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    138 S.Ct., at 2460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After considering arguments for retaining\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   that sounded in both precedent and original meaning, we held that \"States and public-sector unions may no longer extract agency fees from nonconsenting employees.\" 585 U.

The opinion in\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   rests almost entirely on the framework of\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   . Now that\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law, there is effectively nothing left supporting our decision in\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   . If the rule in\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   is to survive, it would have to be on the basis of new reasoning that is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondents argue that our review of this case would be hindered because it was dismissed on the pleadings. But any challenge to our precedents will be dismissed for failure to state a claim, before discovery can take place. And in any event, a record would provide little, if any, benefit to our review of the purely legal question whether\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   should be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Short of a constitutional amendment, only we can rectify our own erroneous constitutional decisions. We have admitted that\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   was erroneous, and\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   provided the foundation for\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   . In light of these developments, we should reexamine whether\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   is sound precedent. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Respondents resist this conclusion by citing\n    <em>\n     Harris v. Quinn\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20616\">\n     573 U.S. 616\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581778\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2618/\">\n     134 S.Ct. 2618\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581778\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2618/\">\n     189 L.Ed.2d 620\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2014), which predates\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    . But all we said in\n    <em>\n     Harris\n    </em>\n    was that \"a refusal to extend\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    \" would not \"call into question\"\n    <em>\n     Keller\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Harris\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20616\">\n     573 U.S. at 655\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581778\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2618/\">\n     134 S.Ct. 2618\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Now that we have overruled\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Keller\n    </em>\n    has unavoidably been called into question.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
