The Court's decision to let construction continue nevertheless, I fear, may \"operat[e], in effect, as a final judgment.\"\n  <em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"12624912,12626074,12626075,12626072\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/204/1170/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n</em>\n  , at ----,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12624912\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/140/1/#p2\">\n   140 S.Ct., at 1\n  </extracted-citation>\n  .
