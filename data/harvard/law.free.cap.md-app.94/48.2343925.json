The Police Department filed administrative charges against Sergeant Russell Younkers, the appellee, as a result of Sgt. Younkers\u2019 conduct on two occasions. A hearing board subsequently found Sgt. Younkers guilty of violating the Prince George\u2019s County Code and the Police Department\u2019s Manual of Rules and Procedures. The Chief of Police concurred with the Board\u2019s conclusions and notified Sgt. Younkers that, as disciplinary action, the Sergeant would receive a written reprimand and would be reassigned to another duty station. Sgt. Younkers then appealed the Board\u2019s ruling to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The court reversed, reasoning that Sgt. Younkers\u2019 speech on the two occasions in question was constitutionally protected. The Police Department appeals and presents two issues which we have re-numbered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">1. Did the court err when it held that the appellee\u2019s speech was protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">2. Did the court exceed its authority by substituting its judgment for that of the trial board?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">The facts giving rise to this case involve two separate incidents. The first incident concerned one of Sgt. Younkers\u2019 subordinates who was allegedly observed speeding while in a police cruiser on the Capital Beltway. Sgt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Younkers was directed by a superior officer to inquire into the matter and, if Sgt. Younkers found an impropriety, to take appropriate action. While conducting his inquiry and while in the presence of the subordinate in question, Sgt. Younkers commented to a lieutenant, \u201c[I]f this had been a Captain or a Major or some other white shirt,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they would have thrown this thing in the trash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The second incident occurred after a shooting in which another of Sgt. Younkers\u2019 subordinates had been involved. Sgt. Younkers was called to oversee the scene where, among other things, he spoke with the officer involved in the shooting. The officer expressed concern because she had been involved in a previous shooting and informed Sgt. Younkers that she wanted to contact an attorney before giving statements to anyone. Sgt. Younkers used departmental radio equipment to contact the police union attorney on behalf of the officer. Some time later, while he was performing other duties at the scene, Sgt. Younkers noticed that a crowd was gathering (media, neighborhood residents, etc.). Realizing that the officer involved in the shooting was alone, Sgt. Younkers ordered another of his subordinates to \u201cgo back and stay with [the officer] and remind her that she is not supposed to talk to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Sgt. Younkers was subsequently charged with violating the Police Department\u2019s Manual of Rules and Procedures, Volume III, Chapter 802.10, County Personnel Law, \u00a7 16-108 which provides in part, \u201cSupervisors and employees generally of the county government are expected to diligently perform duties, tasks and responsibilities assigned to further the mission of the Department and the County Government.\u201d In addition, Sgt. Younkers was charged with violating \u00a7 1/110 (loyalty) and \u00a7 1/115 (unbecoming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>conduct) of the Manual of Rules and Procedures. Section 1/110 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">Officers will be expected to exercise reasonable and just discretion in the performance of their duties. Recognizing that decisions will frequently be extremely difficult and made in emergency situations, officers are legally, professionally, and personally bound to exercise those judgments within the confines of their loyalty to their oath of service and their obligation to the law, regardless of personal hardship or discomfort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Section 1/115 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">As the most visible representative of government, officers must display unblemished professional conduct. To that end, officers are held bound to avoid excessive, unwarranted, or unjustified behavior that would reflect poorly on themselves, the department, or the government of Prince George\u2019s County, regardless of duty status. Members will refrain from using harsh, violent, profane or derogatory language which would demean the dignity of any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Sgt. Younkers was also charged with violating \u00a7 18-157 of the County Code which prohibits members of the Police Department from \u201cdirectly or indirectly criticizpng] or ridiculpng] any official action of any member of the Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The Police Department argues that Sgt. Younkers acted in a manner that was openly disrespectful of the leadership of the Police Department and that he resisted in performing an order (by failing to discipline the officer accused of speeding). The Department adds that Sgt. Younkers\u2019 actions in responding to the officer who had been involved in the shooting led Sgt. Younkers\u2019 superiors to believe that information was being withheld. In sum, the Department contends that Sgt. Younkers acted in a manner to cause a division between the ranks of the Police Department and \u201cthat Sgt. Younkers\u2019 attitude and demeanor had the effect of disparaging the Police Department and encouraging disloyalty and a lack of respect by other officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>A hearing board received evidence on the alleged violations and decided, with regard to the first incident, that \u201cSergeant Younkers did, while assigned in a supervisory role ... employ ridicule and criticism to discourage an official action of the Department management staff____ As the Board applies the applicable statute and rule to this hearing, the words are beyond a reasonable definition of protected speech.\u201d With regard to the second incident, the Board concluded, \u201cYounkers did in fact issue an Order to direct a subordinate to refuse to make any statement during the review of the subject incident and that the order exceeded his authority and professional responsibility as a police supervisor acting on behalf of the Police Department of Prince George\u2019s County.\u201d On appeal, however, the circuit court found that the statements Sgt. Younkers had made during the two incidents were constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a governmental entity may not discharge an employee for reasons that infringe on the employee\u2019s constitutionally protected speech. <em>Perry v. Sinderman, </em>408 U.S. 593, 597-598, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2698, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). In the same vein, the Maryland Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (LEOBR), applicable to the police departments of all Maryland counties, Md.Ann.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 727(b)(2), provides at \u00a7 733:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">A law enforcement officer may not be discharged, disciplined, demoted, or denied promotion, transfer or reassignment, or otherwise discriminated against in regard to his employment or be threatened with any such treatment, by reason of his exercise of or demand for the rights granted in the subtitle, or by reason of the lawful exercise of his constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">For guidance in resolving Sgt. Younkers\u2019 constitutional challenge, we look to several Supreme Court decisions. In <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), the Court was asked to decide whether the dismissal of an Illinois teacher contravened the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>teacher\u2019s First Amendment rights. The teacher, Pickering, was dismissed from his employment after he had written a letter to a local newspaper criticizing the School Board\u2019s allocation of funds and its proposals to raise new revenue. While acknowledging Pickering\u2019s right to comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operation of public schools, the Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\">At the same time it cannot be gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. at 1734-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The Court declined to establish a rigid standard for resolving such conflicts but, instead, offered some guidelines to aid in the resolution of these matters. First, the Court noted that Pickering\u2019s statements were not directed toward any person with whom Pickering would normally be in contact during the course of his daily work. Thus, the Court found \u201cno question of maintaining either discipline by immediate superiors or harmony among co-workers____\u201d <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 570, 88 S.Ct. at 1735.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The Court next commented that Pickering\u2019s employment relationship with the School Board and the superintendent were \u201cnot the kind of close working relationships for which it can persuasively be claimed that personal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their proper functioning.\u201d <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 570, 88 S.Ct. at 1735. In addition, the Court noted that although the Board had alleged that the publication of the letter damaged the professional reputation of the Board and the superintendent and would foster controversy among the Board, teachers, administrators, and local residents, the Board offered no evidence to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>these allegations. Last, the Court observed that where the issues of education funding and spending were left to a popular vote, those issues were matters of legitimate public concern for which free and open debate was vital to informed decision-making. <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 571-572, 88 S.Ct. at 1736. Thus, the Court concluded that Pickering\u2019s letter to the newspaper was protected under the First Amendment and that his dismissal contravened principles of free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Having ruled in <em>Pickering </em>that a public employee does not, by virtue of government employment, relinquish First Amendment rights, the Supreme Court revisited this issue in <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). The case involved an Assistant District Attorney, Myers, who was discharged for circulating a questionnaire concerning internal office affairs. The genesis of the case occurred when Myers was informed that she would be transferred to prosecute cases in a different section of criminal court. Myers had been employed as a prosecutor for more than five years and had competently performed her duties during that time. Myers strongly opposed the transfer and expressed her displeasure to several of her supervisors, including Connick, the District Attorney. Myers was again notified of the pending transfer, and she then had a second conversation with one of her supervisors. They spoke about several other office matters in addition to the transfer. During their conversation, the supervisor expressed the belief that other employees did not share Myers\u2019 concerns, and Myers stated that she would do some research on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">That night, Myers prepared a questionnaire to obtain her co-workers\u2019 views on the office transfer policy, office morale, the need for a grievance committee, the level of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns. The next morning, Myers typed, copied, and distributed the questionnaire to fifteen Assistant District Attorneys. When Connick was told that Myers was creating a \u201c \u2018mini-insurrection,\u2019 \u201d he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>terminated Myers for her refusal to accept the transfer. Connick also informed Myers that he considered the distribution of the questionnaire an act of insubordination. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 140-141, 103 S.Ct. at 1687.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Myers subsequently filed suit, contending that she had been wrongfully terminated because she had exercised her right to free speech. The District Court found that, although Myers was told she was fired because of her refusal to accept the transfer, the real reason for her dismissal was the distribution of the questionnaire. The court further held that the questionnaire involved matters of public concern and that the State had not \u201c \u2018clearly demonstrated\u2019 \u201d that the survey \u201c \u2018substantially interfered\u2019 \u201d with the operations of the District Attorney\u2019s office. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 141-142, 103 S.Ct. at 1687. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The Supreme Court first considered whether the questionnaire involved a matter of public concern. To resolve this issue, the Court examined the content, form, and context of the questionnaire, as revealed by the entire record and found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">In this case, with but one exception, the questions posed by Myers to her co-workers do not fall under the rubric of matters of \u2018public concern.\u2019 We view the questions pertaining to the confidence and trust that Myers\u2019 co-workers possess in various supervisors, the level of office morale, and the need for a grievance committee as mere extensions of Myers\u2019 dispute over her transfer to another section of the criminal court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">To presume that all matters which transpire within a government office are of public concern would mean that virtually every remark \u2014 and certainly every criticism directed at a public official \u2014 would plant the seed of a constitutional case. While as a matter of good judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>public officials should be receptive to constructive criticism offered by their employees, the First Amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\">Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-149, 103 S.Ct. at 1690-1691.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The Court did find, however, that one of the questions on Myer\u2019s questionnaire touched upon a matter of public concern. Question 11 inquired whether assistant district attorneys ever felt \u201cpressured to work in political campaigns on behalf of office supported candidates.\u201d The Court had previously held that official pressure upon employees to work for certain political candidates amounted to a coercion of belief that violated fundamental constitutional rights. <em>See Branti v. Finkel, </em>445 U.S. 507, 515-516, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 1293-1294, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980). As Question 11 addressed a matter of public concern, the Court next considered whether Myers\u2019 First Amendment interest outweighed Connick\u2019s interest, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public service his office performs through its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On this point, the Court opined, \u201c[T]he State\u2019s burden in justifying a particular discharge varies depending upon the nature of the employee\u2019s expression. Although such particularized balancing is difficult, the courts must reach the most appropriate possible balance of the competing interests.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 150, 103 S.Ct. at 1692 (footnote omitted). \u201cThe <em>Pickering </em>balance,\u201d the Court added, \u201crequires full consideration of the government\u2019s interest in the effective and efficient fulfillment of its responsibilities to the public.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 150, 103 S.Ct. at 1692.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Applying this balancing test, the Court stated, \u201cWhen close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities, a wide degree of deference to the employer\u2019s judgment is appropriate. Furthermore, we do not see the necessity for an employer to allow events to unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the destruction of working relationships is manifest before taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>action.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 151-152, 103 S.Ct. at 1692 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Also relevant to this test is the time, place, and manner of the employee\u2019s speech.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">\u2018When a government employee personally confronts his immediate superior, the employing agency\u2019s institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the employee\u2019s message but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is delivered.\u2019 ... [T]he fact that Myers, unlike Pickering, exercised her rights to speech at the office supports Connick\u2019s fears that the functioning of his office was endangered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">Finally, the context in which the dispute arose is also significant____ When employee speech concerning office policy arises from an employment dispute concerning the very application of that policy to the speaker, additional weight must be given to the supervisor\u2019s view that the employee has threatened the authority of the employer to run the office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\"><em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 153, 103 S.Ct. at 1693 (quoting <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>439 U.S. 410, 415 n. 4, 99 S.Ct. 693, 696 n. 4, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Ultimately, the Court concluded, \u201cThe limited First Amendment interest involved here does not require that Connick tolerate action which he reasonably believed would disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and destroy close working relationships. Myers\u2019 discharge therefore did not offend the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 154, 103 S.Ct. at 1694.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Several years after <em>Connick, </em>the Court was presented with another employee/free speech scenario. <em>Rankin v. McPherson, </em>483 U.S. 378, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 315, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>483 U.S. 1056, 108 S.Ct. 31, 97 L.Ed.2d 819 (1987), involved McPherson, a clerical employee in a county Constable\u2019s office, who had been discharged for remarking, after hearing of an attempt on the life of the President of the United States, \u201cIf they go for him again, I hope they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>get him.\u201d The statement was made to one co-worker and was overheard by another employee who, unbeknown to McPherson, was in the room at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In deciding whether McPherson\u2019s dismissal infringed on her constitutionally protected speech, the Court first decided that McPherson\u2019s speech \u201cplainly dealt with a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Rankin, </em>483 U.S. at 386, 107 S.Ct. at 2898. The Court next balanced McPherson\u2019s interest in making her statement against the interest of the State, as an employer, in efficiently providing public services. On this point, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">Constable Rankin testified that the possibility of interference with the functions of the Constable\u2019s office had <em>not </em>been a consideration in his discharge of respondent and that he did not even inquire whether the remark had disrupted the work of the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">Not only was McPherson\u2019s discharge unrelated to the functioning of the office, it was not based on any assessment by the Constable that the remark demonstrated a character trait that made respondent unfit to perform her work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">In weighing the State\u2019s interest in discharging an employee based on any claim that the content of a statement made by the employee somehow undermines the mission of the public employer, some attention must be paid to the responsibilities of the employee within the agency. The burden of caution employees bear with respect to the words they speak will vary with the extent of authority and public accountability the employee\u2019s role entails. Where, as here, an employee serves no confidential, policymaking, or public contract role, the danger to the agency\u2019s successful functioning from that employee\u2019s private speech is minimal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\"><em>Rankin, </em>483 U.S. at 389-391, 107 S.Ct. at 2900-2901 (emphasis in original). The Court then concluded, \u201cGiven the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>function of the agency, McPherson\u2019s position in the office, and the nature of her statement, we are not persuaded that Rankin\u2019s interest in discharging her outweighed her rights under the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Rankin, </em>483 U.S. at 392, 107 S.Ct. at 2901.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Applying the teachings of the Supreme Court to the case currently before us, we find that the disciplinary action taken against Sgt. Younkers did not violate his First Amendment rights. For purposes of this discussion, we will assume that Sgt. Younkers\u2019 statements related to matters of public concern. This assumption triggers application of the balancing process in which we are to weigh the sergeant\u2019s interest in making his statements against the interest of the Police Department in providing effective, efficient service to the public. To conduct this balancing process, we consider the time, place, and manner of Sgt. Younkers\u2019 speech as well as the context in which his statements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">With regard to the first incident (the matter involving one of Sgt. Younkers\u2019 subordinates who was allegedly observed speeding), Sgt. Younkers, while in the presence of the purportedly offending officer, remarked to a lieutenant that, if the incident had involved a high ranking officer, no action would have been taken. At the least, Sgt. Younkers\u2019 statement planted the seed of dissension by implying that officers of varying ranks received disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">As in <em>Connick, </em>this case involves an employment situation where close working relationships are essential to fulfilling the Police Department\u2019s responsibilities. The Police Department is a compelling example of an institution where camaraderie is one of the cornerstones of its functioning. <em>Warner v. Town of Ocean City, </em>81 Md.App. 176, 184, 567 A.2d 160 (1989); <em>Beeler v. Behan, </em>55 Md.App. 517, 522, 464 A.2d 1091 (1983). It is not hyperbole to say that the lives of the officers, as well as the citizens they protect, depend on cooperation and order within the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has similarly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>More so than the typical government employer, the [State Highway] Patrol has a significant government interest in regulating the speech activities of its officers in order \u2018to promote efficiency, foster loyalty and obedience to superior officers, maintain morale, and instill public confidence in the law enforcement institution.\u2019 <em>Gasparinatti v. Kerr, </em>568 F.2d 311, 315-16 (3rd Cir.1977), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>436 U.S. 903 [98 S.Ct. 2232, 56 L.Ed.2d 401] ... (1977)____ As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Kelley v. Johnson, </em>425 U.S. 238, 246-47 [96 S.Ct. 1440, 1445, 47 L.Ed.2d 708] ... (1976), a police department has a substantial interest in developing \u2018discipline, <em>esprit de corps </em>and uniformity\u2019 within its ranks so as to insure the safety of persons and property. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><em>Hughes v. Whitmer, </em>714 F.2d 1407, 1419 (8th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1023, 104 S.Ct. 1275, 79 L.Ed.2d 680 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has also acknowledged that, in the context of law enforcement agencies, the state\u2019s interests are \u201cparticularly acute\u201d in maintaining discipline and in encouraging a close and personal relationship between an employee and his superiors, where that relationship calls for loyalty and confidence. <em>Egger v. Phillips, </em>710 F.2d 292, 319 (7th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 918, 104 S.Ct. 284, 78 L.Ed.2d 262 (1983). \u201cMutual trust and respect among [officers] and between [officers] and supervisory personnel are particularly important in law enforcement____ And given the high stakes involved\u2014 sometimes life and death decisions are made \u2014 the risks of disharmony can be grave.\u201d <em>Egger, </em>710 F.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Sgt. Younkers\u2019 statement, made in the presence of the subordinate he was to discipline, certainly could have undermined the working relationship essential among police officers. We reiterate the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion that it is unnecessary \u201cfor an employer to allow events to unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the destruction of working relationships is manifest before taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>actions.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 152, 103 S.Ct. at 1692 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">In addition, the statements at issue here were made by a police officer who was acting in a supervisory capacity. It is likely that Sgt. Younkers\u2019 statements would have had a significant influence and impact on the subordinate officers who heard his remarks. In a factual situation analogous to the case now before us, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a judgment against a police officer who was disciplined for making disrespectful and disparaging remarks about a superior officer while addressing subordinates during morning inspection. <em>Kannisto v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>541 F.2d 841 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 931, 97 S.Ct. 1552, 51 L.Ed.2d 775 (1977). The officer\u2019s remarks were found to have violated a departmental regulation proscribing misconduct and insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Quoting the language of <em>Kelley, </em>425 U.S. at 246, 96 S.Ct. at 1445, the Ninth Circuit emphasized the police department\u2019s \u201csubstantial interest in developing \u2018discipline, <em>esprit de corps, </em>and unity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kannisto, </em>541 F.2d at 843. The court continued, \u201cCertainly a prohibition against the communication of an officer\u2019s disaffection to rank-and-file members of the department during regular duty hours may be considered as a necessary adjunct to the department\u2019s substantial interest in maintaining discipline, morale and uniformity.\u201d <em>Kannisto, </em>541 F.2d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Citing <em>Kannisto, </em>the California Court of Appeal disposed of a highway patrol officer\u2019s claim that his dismissal from the force violated his First Amendment free speech rights. <em>Hosford v. State Personnel Bd., </em>74 Cal.App.3d 302, 141 Cal.Rptr 354 (1977). Among other things, the officer was dismissed for expressing \u201cdisdain and disrespect for his commanding officers and for the highway patrol. [His] remarks, spoken in the presence of both inferior and superi- or officers, were all made in the context of the work relationship.\u201d <em>Hosford, </em>74 Cal.App.3d at 306, 141 Cal.Rptr. 354. The court held that Hosford\u2019s \u201cFirst Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>claim must fail,\u201d because, \u201cthe highway patrol\u2019s interest in developing discipline, <em>esprit de corps, </em>and good morale among its members far outweighs any legitimate interest which Hosford could assert in undermining those efforts with unsolicited, disparaging remarks to or about his commanding officers in the course of duty.\u201d <em>Hosford, </em>74 Cal.App.3d at 306, 141 Cal.Rptr. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">As a supervisor, Sgt. Younkers bore a substantial- \u201cburden of caution ... with respect to the words [he spoke],\u201d <em>Rankin, </em>483 U.S. at 390, 107 S.Ct. at 2900, while in the presence of both superior and subordinate officers. Under the circumstances, we believe that the balancing test weighs in favor of the Police Department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We reach the same conclusion regarding the second incident. The second incident concerned one of Sgt. Younkers\u2019 subordinates who had been involved in a shooting. The officer had asked to speak with an attorney, and on the officer\u2019s behalf Sgt. Younkers contacted the attorney representing the police union. Meanwhile, Sgt. Younkers ordered that the officer was not to speak to anyone. This order was to be conveyed by another of Sgt. Younkers\u2019 subordinates who was so surprised by the order that he inquired, \u201cCan we do that?\u201d Concern later arose that Sgt. Younkers\u2019 order had the effect of hindering a thorough investigation of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">While we appreciate Sgt. Younkers\u2019 attempt to safeguard the interests of his subordinates, we cannot overlook the fact that his ultimate duty is to the Police Department. Particularly in a supervisory role, and as the officer \u201cin charge\u201d of this crime scene, Sgt. Younkers was obliged to act in an impartial manner. His order may have conveyed the impression that he was protecting the officer involved in the shooting from the inquiring eyes of departmental investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Here, too, such a rift between the various units within the Police Department could destroy important working relationships and ultimately impinge on the functioning of the Department. It is certainly a legitimate interest of the Police Department to squelch an \u201cus against them\u201d mentality when both the \u201cus\u201d and the \u201cthem\u201d are members of the same police force who are merely performing their various assigned roles. We find, in light of the circumstances surrounding this incident, that the interest of the Department in disciplining an officer for making statements that the Department reasonably believed could disrupt the office, undermine authority, and destroy close working relationships outweighed the interest of the officer in making the statements. The disciplinary action against Sgt. Younkers did not, therefore, contravene the First Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">While, in light of this holding, we need not address the Police Department\u2019s second issue \u2014 that the circuit court impermissibly substituted its judgment for that of the hearing board \u2014 we believe a few words are in order to clarify certain misunderstandings. First, the LEOBR provides that appeals from disciplinary proceedings, like those at issue here, shall proceed before the circuit court pursuant to Maryland Rule B2. Art. 27, \u00a7 732. In addition, an aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the circuit court to the Court of Special Appeals. Art. 27, \u00a7 732. The LEOBR is silent, however, as to the scope of review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Where the scope of review is not specified by statute, a corollary element in judicial review of administrative decisions for arbitrariness is a determination of whether the findings of the board were supported by substantial evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">\u2018While a court reviewing a decision of a board ... may not substitute its judgment for that of the board, it will examine the record upon which the board\u2019s decision is based to determine whether the findings of the board are supported by substantial evidence. The scope of this judicial inquiry is commonly described in the orthodox terminology of the substantial evidence rule.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><em>Annapolis v. Annap. Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 397-398, 396 A.2d 1080 (1979) (quoting R.

Younkers had prevailed on the balancing test, and if we had found his speech a matter of public concern, we would have remanded the case for a finding of fact on whether the sergeant\u2019s speech played a substantial part in the Department\u2019s decision to discipline him. If, at that point, Sgt. Younkers had prevailed, the Department would then have borne the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have disciplined Sgt. Younkers in the absence of the protected speech. <em>Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <em>DiGrazia v. County Exec. For Mont.
