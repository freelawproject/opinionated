Md.Transp.Code Ann. (TR), \u00a7 15-308 requires, as a condition of licensure, that an automobile dealer post a $15,000 bond with the Motor Vehicle Administration. Section 15-103(a) requires that the bond be for the benefit of the Administration \u201cand any other person who suffers <em>any loss </em>because of a violation by the licensee [of certain provisions of the Maryland Vehicle Law].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 15-103(b) provides that any person who suffers \u201ca <em>loss </em>described in subsection (a) of this section has a right of action in his own name against the surety on the bond.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Appellee, American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company, a division of Kemper Insurance Companies, issued a bond to protect Richard D. MacCorkindale, T/A Laurel Junction Auto Sales. The condition of the bond was that MacCorkindale conduct his business in full compliance with the relevant Motor Vehicle Laws. In accordance with the statute, the bond provided that it was for the benefit of the Administration \u201cand for any person who may suffer <em>loss </em>by reason of any violation of the above-mentioned laws.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Appellant, Linda Rose Brock, purchased from MacCorkindale a car that MacCorkindale represented had only minor grill damage but that in fact had been wrecked and declared a total loss. That misrepresentation constituted a violation of TR \u00a7 15-312, which is part of the Maryland Vehicle Law, prohibiting a dealer from making any material misrepresentation in obtaining a vehicle sales contract. It also constituted an unfair and deceptive trade practice under Md.Com. Law Code Ann. (CL), \u00a7 13-301, prohibited by \u00a7 13-303 of that article. Section 13-408(a) of the Commercial Law article provides, in relevant part, that \u201cany person may bring an action to recover for injury or loss sustained by him as the result of a practice prohibited by this title.\u201d Section 13-408(b) provides that any person who brings an action \u201cto recover for injury or loss under this section and who is awarded damages may also seek, and the court may award, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Appellant sued MacCorkindale in the Circuit Court for Howard County for unfair and deceptive trade practices (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), breach of warranty (Count III), intentional interference with contractual rights (Count IV), fraud (Count V), and negligent misrepresentation (Count VI). MacCorkindale failed to answer the complaint, and appellant eventually recovered a judgment under Counts I and VI<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for (1) $2,369 compensatory damages, (2) $190 court costs, (3) $9,798 attorney\u2019s fees, and (4) $25,000 punitive damages. The compensatory and punitive damages and the court costs were awarded under Counts I and VI. The attorney\u2019s fees were awarded under Count I only.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Apparently unable to collect these amounts from MacCorkindale, appellant made demand upon appellee, the surety. Appellee, it appears, offered to pay the $2,369 in compensatory damages but took the position that the bond did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>cover any other part of the judgment. Appellant then sued appellee, also in the Circuit Court for Howard County, for a declaratory judgment that appellee was obligated on its bond to pay the full amount of the judgment. Appellee moved for partial summary judgment, asserting its position that it was not liable for court costs, attorney\u2019s fees, or punitive damages. The court granted that motion. Its order read: \u201c[T]hat judgment be and it is hereby entered in favor of [appellee] and against [appellant] for all sums claimed by [appellant] in her Complaint in excess of $2,369.06.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Notwithstanding the apparent lack of dispute as to the $2,369, appellant never asked for judgment in that amount, and no further judgment was entered in the case. The only right declared was that appellee was not liable for anything beyond $2,369; the court never determined that it was liable for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Appealability \u2014 Final Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">It is evident that appellant presented a single claim to the court and that the court ruled on only part of it. Maryland Rule 2-602(a) provides, in relevant part, that an order, however designated, that adjudicates less than an entire claim is not a final judgment. The purpose of this Rule is to prevent piecemeal appeals by providing that only where a trial court has fully adjudicated all the issues in a case will an appeal be permitted. <em>See Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. v. Los Angeles Rams, </em>284 Md. 86, 91, 394 A.2d 801 (1978); <em>see also Russell v. American Sec. Bank, </em>65 Md.App. 199, 499 A.2d 1320 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">This Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to hearing appeals from final judgments. A ruling of the circuit court is not appealable unless it constitutes a final judgment. The test for finality is whether the ruling finally determines and concludes the rights involved or denies the appellant the means of further prosecuting or defending his rights in the subject matter of the proceeding. <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767 (1989); <em>Peat Marwick, Mitch</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>ell &amp; Co., </em>284 Md. at 91, 394 A.2d 801; <em>United Fire Ins. v. Schwartz, </em>280 Md. 518, 521, 374 A.2d 896 (1977). For the ruling to be final and conclusive and thus appealable, ruling must be \u201cintended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy.\u201d <em>See Sisk &amp; Son v. Friendship Packers, </em>326 Md. 152, 159, 604 A.2d 69 (1992); <em>see also Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41, 566 A.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Rule 2-602(b) allows the court, upon a finding that there is no just reason for delay, to direct the entry of a final judgment \u201cpursuant to Rule 2-501(e)(3), for some but less than all of the amount requested in a claim seeking money relief only.\u201d Rule 2-501(e)(3) permits a court to enter summary judgment \u201cfor some but less than all of the amount requested when the claim for relief is for money only and the court reserves disposition of the balance of the amount requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Although the anticipated function of Rule 2-501(e)(3) was to allow a court to enter a partial summary judgment in favor of the <em>plaintiff </em>where only part of the amount claimed was in dispute, we see no reason why, as worded, the Rule does not allow the converse as well. In either case, it authorizes removal from the action of that part of the claim not in dispute or as to which one party or the other is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, thereby permitting the parties and the court to focus their attention on the matters actually in dispute. To make such a determination final, however, both Rules oblige the court to make the determination required under Rule 2-602(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">That, unfortunately, has not been done here. Maryland Rule 8-602(e), however, allows this Court, upon a finding that the trial court <em>could </em>have entered judgment pursuant to Rule 2-602(b), to enter such a judgment itself. On this record, we believe that this case warrants that approach. As we indicated, there does not appear to be any dispute as to appellee\u2019s liability for the $2,369 in compensatory damages; not only did appellee offer to pay that amount before suit was filed, but in a memorandum filed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>support of its motion for partial summary judgment, it stated that, \u201c[assuming that [appellant] submits an Affidavit to this Court testifying as to the truth of the allegations contained in her complaint, [appellee] will consent to judgment in the amount of $2,369.06 against it in full satisfaction of all claims by [appellant].\u201d It is thus clear that the whole dispute was as to the other aspects of the MacCorkindale judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Although we cannot enter judgment in favor of appellant for the $2,369 \u2014 that being within the sole jurisdiction of the trial court \u2014 we can make the order granting partial summary judgment in favor of appellee final, and, in the interest of judicial economy, we hereby do so. That allows us, then, to consider the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Both sides agree that this case turns on the meaning of the word \u201closs,\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 15-103. Appellee acknowledges in its brief that, because the language of the bond tracks the statutory language, the word, as used in the bond, should be given the same meaning as that used in the statute \u2014 that the bond, in other words, should not be construed in a manner inconsistent with the statute. We agree that is the proper approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The general question, then, is whether the word encompasses anything beyond actual compensatory damages. In fact, the parties, in their respective briefs, have narrowed the issue to whether the term allows recovery against the bond of the attorney\u2019s fees awarded as part of the underlying judgment. Appellant appears to have given up her quest against appellee for recovery of the punitive damages, for she says nothing about that in her brief. Appellee, on the other hand, presented no reason in its brief why the word \u201closs\u201d would not include the $190 in court costs, although it did press the issue at oral argument. The principal issue in dispute in this appeal is whether appellee is liable for the $9,798 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Appellee, obviously, construes the word \u201closs,\u201d and thus its obligation under the bond, strictly. Attorney\u2019s fees are not generally recoverable against sureties, it claims, and cites a number of cases so holding. Moreover, it points out that appellant could have avoided the attorney\u2019s fees by suing directly on the bond. Section 15-103(b) gives a person \u201cwho suffers a loss described in subsection (a)\u201d of that section \u201ca right of action in his own name against the surety on the bond.\u201d Appellant, on the other hand, distinguishes the cases relied upon by appellee as not involving bonds posted under consumer protection laws, laws that expressly permit the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. It relies on a Florida case, <em>Marshall v. W &amp; L Enterprises Corp., </em>360 So.2d 1147 (Fla.App.1978), in which the surety <em>was </em>held liable for attorney\u2019s fees awarded in an underlying judgment against a merchant who violated the State Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">This is a case of first impression in Maryland. It is essentially a matter of statutory construction. The Legislature, as part of the State Consumer Protection Law (\u00a7 13-408 of the Commercial Law article) specifically allowed the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in an action to recover for injury or loss <em>under that section. </em>Merchants are not required to be bonded as part of the Consumer Protection Law. In the Motor Vehicle law (\u00a7 15-103(a) of the Transportation article), however, the Legislature <em>did </em>require dealers to be bonded and declared that the bond was to protect any person who suffers a loss \u201cbecause of a violation by the licensee <em>... of those provisions of the Maryland Vehicle Law that the Administrator specifies.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">There is nothing in this record to indicate which provisions of the Motor Vehicle Law have been specified by the Administrator for purposes of \u00a7 15-103. We note that, by regulation (COMAR 11.12.01.056), the Administrator has declared that the bond required from dealers is for the use and benefit of the Administration \u201cand the public who may suffer or sustain any loss by reason of any violation of the applicable sections of Subtitles 12, 13, 15, 17, and 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Transportation Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, by a dealer.\u201d This regulation, unfortunately, is most unilluminating, not only because the reference to \u201cSubtitles\u201d is ambiguous, the intended reference probably being \u201cTitles\u201d of the article but also because the reader is left to speculate which sections are indeed \u201capplicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In the prefatory allegations of her complaint against MacCorkindale, appellant mentioned two specific violations by the defendant \u2014 COMAR 11.12.01.14 J.4, which requires a dealer to identify conspicuously the former condition of a vehicle that had been previously wrecked; and TR \u00a7 13-113(e)(2), which requires dealers to remit title documents and fees to the Administration within a certain period of time. Appellant did not allege that she suffered any loss by reason of the second of these violations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Count I, upon which the attorney\u2019s fees were awarded, she complained that MacCorkindale</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices prohibited by the Commercial Law of Maryland in consumer automobile sales transactions, in subcounts, in that they:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">(a) failed to state material facts, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">(b) made misleading statements, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">(c) committed deception, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">(d) committed fraud, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">(e) committed misrepresentation, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">(f) committed knowing concealment, suppression or omission of material facts in the above-noted consumer automobile sale in that Defendants deceived the Plaintiff by representing that the vehicle sold Plaintiff only previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ously had minor damage done to it, all subcounts to Plaintiffs damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Each of these alleged acts would constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice under CL \u00a7 13-301. None of them has specific reference to any provision in the Maryland Vehicle Law, however, which consists of the referenced sections of Subtitle 12, 13, 15, 17 and 23 of the Transportation Article, Md.Ann.Code. It seems evident, therefore, that the judgment entered on Count I arose not from any section of the Motor Vehicle Law but rather from CL \u00a7\u00a7 13-301, 13-303, and 13-408. Indeed, it is only under \u00a7 13-408 that attorney\u2019s fees could be awarded. From this, we conclude that the attorney\u2019s fees, even if regarded generally as a \u201closs,\u201d did not constitute a loss because of a violation of a provision of the Motor Vehicle Law that the Administrator had specified. For that reason, and that alone, we hold that the court did not err in determining that appellant had no claim against the bond for the attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">As noted, the court also determined that appellant could not recover on the bond for the $190 in court costs paid by her in the action against MacCorkindale. We believe that the court\u2019s ruling was proper. Although successful plaintiffs are usually entitled to reimbursement for prepaid court costs, Md.Rule 2-603, under TR \u00a7 15-103(b), appellant, had she been willing to forego her claim for punitive damages, could have sued directly on the bond and avoided the action against MacCorkindale. While she was entitled to sue the actual tortfeasor for punitive damages, she could not recover court costs in her action on the bond. The unreimbursed court costs, in our view, do not constitute a \u201closs\u201d to her arising from whatever violation of the Maryland Vehicle Law would have produced the compensatory damage that appellee was willing to pay. For these reasons, we conclude that recovery should not be allowed for the court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\">. The judgment refers to Counts One and <em>Six </em>of the complaint but makes clear that the judgment was based on Deceptive Trade Practices (Count I) and <em>Fraud, </em>which was pled in Count <em>V </em>For purposes of this appeal, it is unimportant whether the court was acting under Count V or Count VI as the validity of the judgment is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-12\">. Although Brock cited a violation of a provision of the Maryland Vehicle Law, <em>i.e. </em>TR \u00a7 13-113(e)(2), significantly, for purposes of our analysis, she alleged that her loss resulted from failure of the dealer to identify conspicuously the condition of the vehicle that had previously been wrecked; she did not assign the dealer\u2019s failure to remit title documents and fees to the Administration as having caused her loss. We do not believe Section 15-103(a) contemplates a violation of COMAR.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
