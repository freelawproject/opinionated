In granting summary judgment for the appellees, the lower court denied all coverage to Monumental. Monumental now appeals, asking us to address ten issues related to its various policies. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">At its heart, this case is simply about indemnification: Monumental Life Insurance Company (\u201cMonumental\u201d) contends that any or all of the four appellees herein, all of which are other insurance companies <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, are obligated to indemnify Monumental for costs and fees it incurred while litigating a prior claim with a third party, Peoples Security Life Insurance Company (\u201cPeoples\u201d). The facts that gave rise to <em>both </em>(1) the present litigation <em>(Monumental v. USF &amp; G et al) and </em>(2) the underlying \u201cthird party\u201d litigation <em>(Peoples v. Monumental) </em>may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">A. <em>The Underlying Litigation: Peoples v. Monumental</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Peoples and Monumental are both large, competing \u201chome-service\u201d life insurance companies which sell their various life insurance policies through individual agents; the agents, in turn, call on their customers at their homes and businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">In September, 1982, Monumental hired as an Executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Vice President B. Larry Jenkins<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Larry Jenkins had been previously employed as the President and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of Peoples. Approximately one month later, Monumental hired as an Agency Vice President Ronald J. Brittingham. Brittingham had been previously employed as a field Vice President at Peoples. In June, 1983, Monumental hired a third officer from Peoples, Willard (Gene) Hines, who left Peoples to become a consultant with Monumental.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">These, as well as numerous other alleged departures of Peoples\u2019 employees to Monumental, began to concern Peoples<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. A series of letters and conversations between the two companies ensued. Included among these was a letter dated November 30, 1983, from William P. Gregg (President, Capital Holding Corporation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) to Leslie B. Disharoon (Chairman, Monumental). This letter contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">This will confirm the substance of Tom Simons\u2019 [Chairman and CEO of Capital Holding Corporation] conversation with you [Disharoon], in which he indicated that we have observed a substantial effort on the part of Monumental to induce Peoples\u2019 employees to terminate their employment and join Monumental. Based upon those observations, we have conducted a more thorough investigation of those activities. That investigation has exposed substantial evidence of an extensive campaign by Monumental to hire Peoples\u2019 employees. This evidence includes the fact that Monumental has hired approximately 25 Peoples\u2019 employees in the last five months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">In addition to the dramatic volume of that activity, the investigation also revealed a startling number of wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ful actions, including the use by some of your employees of confidential information that was obtained during their tenure as Peoples\u2019 employees, and the misrepresentation of information allegedly obtained by such Monumental employees during their employment by Peoples.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">We believe that those activities are unethical. In addition, we are advised that they provide grounds for litigation against Monumental and the individual employees involved. As you can well imagine, we cannot allow them to continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">Accordingly, we are making this final effort to resolve this problem without formal action. However, if we receive any further evidence that your employees are persisting in their pirating of Peoples\u2019 employees, I will instruct counsel to commence litigation and will also consider filing charges of unethical conduct against the appropriate parties under the auspices of industry trade associations. I deeply hope that such action will not be required, but recognize that swift, decisive action on your part will be required to avoid it. * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In addition, pursuant to a letter dated December 16, 1983, from Larry Jenkins (then Chairman and CEO of Monumental) to Thomas Simons (Chairman and CEO of Capital Holding Corporation, as aforementioned), Monumental indicated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">At your request, we are willing to come to a mutual understanding concerning our field personnel hiring practices and yours. * * * * As we discussed by phone, our proposal is this: [wherein Jenkins stated four proposed terms]. * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">In making this proposal, we expressly deny all accusations which have been made about improper acts on our part with respect to Peoples or its field personnel. We have not engaged in any unfair competition. The understanding reached above includes any future work of Gene Hines and any other people we may use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>With this settlement reached between us, we understand there will be no need for litigation between Monumental and Peoples on the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">If I have correctly expressed our understanding, please acknowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">As a result of, <em>inter alia, </em>the above letters and conversations, Monumental and Peoples, by letter dated January 17, 1984, agreed to a five-month hiring moratorium.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">After this moratorium ended, Monumental hired as a Regional Sales Vice President Thomas Jenkins, a fourth Peoples\u2019 officer. As a result, after further discussion and amid threats of litigation, the parties negotiated a second, more complete agreement that was memorialized by a letter dated September 13, 1984. By this letter agreement (and subject to a few delineated exceptions), the parties reciprocally agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) to a one-year moratorium on the hiring of each other\u2019s employees, (2) to a three-year moratorium on the recruiting of each other\u2019s employees, (3) not to use any of the other\u2019s proprietary information, nor to make any material misrepresentations about the other, and (4) to release mutually each other from claims resulting from conduct that occurred before September 13, 1984. (This September 13, 1984 letter agreement shall hereinafter be referred to as the \u201cAgreement.\u201d) The Agreement also provided for a dispute-resolution procedure culminating in binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Despite this Agreement, Monumental allegedly continued to recruit officers and agents from Peoples. Indeed, from 1983 through 1986, inclusive, Monumental was alleged to have hired 61 of Peoples\u2019 managers and 222 of its agents, and to have rewritten approximately 10,000 of its policies. Additionally, Monumental was alleged to have told Peoples\u2019 policyholders, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) Peoples was \u201cgoing broke,\u201d and (2) Peoples could not afford to pay claims, or cash surrender values, on its policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">On August 1, 1986, Peoples filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>eleven count complaint against Monumental, Larry Jenkins, Brittingham and Thomas Jenkins. The following sets forth the relief sought by Peoples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><em>Count 1 </em>sought rescission of the parties\u2019 Agreement based on fraudulent inducement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\"><em>Counts 2 through 4, </em>inclusive, alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the respective, individually named defendants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\"><em>Count 5 </em>sought recovery for unlawful appropriation of trade secrets and confidential information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\"><em>Counts 6 and 7, </em>respectively, sought recovery for tortious interference with contract, and tortious interference with business relationships;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\"><em>Count 8 </em>sought recovery for unfair or deceptive trade practices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\"><em>Count 9 </em>sought recovery for unjust enrichment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\"><em>Count 10 </em>sought recovery <em>for </em>a civil RICO violation; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aor\"><em>Count 11 </em>sought recovery for defamationS. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">On March 20, 1987, on motion filed by Monumental, Peoples\u2019 suit was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Shortly thereafter, on April 23, 1987, Peoples filed an Amended Complaint which (1) added Hines as an additional defendant, (2) added, as a new Count 5, a breach of fiduciary duty against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>individually, and (3) added some supplemental factual allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Monumental then moved, pursuant to the parties\u2019 Agreement, to have the parties\u2019 claims submitted to binding arbitration. Peoples resisted that effort, contending that the Agreement itself was null and void for having been fraudulently induced. The United States District Court for the District of Maryland (Joseph Howard, J.) denied Monumental\u2019s motion (and therefore set the case in for trial), after which Monumental filed an interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On appeal, the circuit court, by opinion dated February 10, 1989, reversed the district court\u2019s ruling and determined that, indeed, Peoples\u2019 <em>entire </em>claim (including the issue as to fraudulent inducement) was subject to binding arbitration<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">On March 15, 1989, Peoples filed its ten count \u201cDemand for Arbitration.\u201d Peoples\u2019 Demand contained essentially the same contentions as had their federal court complaint <em>except </em>that the Demand (1) did <em>not </em>contain the individual tort count of defamation, and (2) <em>added </em>one new claim for relief. Peoples captioned this new claim \u201cAlternative Claim for Breach of Contract,\u201d and alleged therein, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cMonumental Life failed to comply with the spirit of the [parties\u2019 September 13, 1984] Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">After bifurcating liability issues from damage issues, the arbitration panel heard evidence intermittently from February 20 through April 9, 1990, before issuing its written decision regarding liability on August 29, 1990. The panel determined that, with respect to the parties\u2019 September 13, 1984 Agreement, Monumental was <em>not </em>liable for fraud in the inducement because the transaction was entered into at arms length and, as a result, pursuant to the Agreement\u2019s mutual release provision, Monumental was released from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>any claims based on conduct prior to September 13, 1984. The appellees adequately summarized various other findings of the arbitration panel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">1. Paragraph 2 of the Agreement prohibited Monumental from hiring employees of Peoples for a period of one year. The arbitrators found that <em>Monumental breached this provision </em>because during the one-year period it opened employment negotiations with three Peoples\u2019 employees who were later hired by Monumental.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">2. Paragraph 3 of the Agreement prohibited Monumental from recruiting Peoples\u2019 employees for a period of three years. The arbitrators found that <em>Monumental breached this provision </em>through recruiting activities by many Monumental employees in Baton Rouge, LA, Hagerstown, MD, and Newport News, VA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">3. Paragraph 4 of the Agreement prohibited Monumental from using certain proprietary information of Peoples, including a variety of material listed in the Agreement. The arbitrators found that <em>Monumental breached this provision </em>by using customer lists and other Peoples\u2019 proprietary information in competing for business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">4. The arbitrators read into the Agreement the usual duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in every contract. They also found that Monumental undertook additional obligations in Paragraph 6 of the Agreement, which required \u201cfull compliance with the spirit and the terms of this Agreement.\u201d The arbitration panel<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cinterpret[ed] paragraph 6 of the Agreement as an implied contractual commitment not to engage in the tort of unfair competition regarding the subject matter of the Agreement.\u201d Having found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>that contractual obligation, the arbitrators found that <em>Monumental breached it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">(Footnote and emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In addition to the above findings, the panel\u2019s written decision also contained a section captioned \u201cOther Tort Claims.\u201d In this section, the panel found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">In addition to unfair competition, [Peoples] asserts tort claims for, among other things, misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information, tortious interference with contracts and business relationships, employee piracy, and deceptive practices. The factual basis for all of these tort claims is essentially the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">The Tribunal, having found the tort of unfair competition, finds it unnecessary to reach the other tort claims raised by [Peoples].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Following a separate hearing on damages, the panel, by order dated September 11, 1991, awarded Peoples the sum of $9,424,651.00. With respect to the defense of the action brought by Peoples, Monumental alleges that it incurred over $2,000,000.00 in defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">B. <em>Monumental\u2019s Insurance Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaU\">With respect to the case <em>sub judice, </em>Monumental claims that the various appellees have an obligation to defend and/or indemnify Monumental for any damages and costs it incurred in its litigation with Peoples. The appellees have refused to do either <em>(i.e., </em>defend or indemnify). Monumental now contends that, with respect to the duty to defend, all policies of all appellees (except Cal Union) included such a provision. The Cal Union policy is a \u201cduty to pay\u201d defense costs policy, rather than a \u201cduty to defend\u201d type. Monumental has summarized its insurance coverage as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">From 1982 through 1986, inclusive, Monumental had purchased comprehensive general liability insurance (\u201cCGL\u201d) and umbrella excess insurance (\u201cExcess\u201d) from three of the appellees herein, USF &amp; G, Reliance and US Fire. During that time period, Monumental also purchased director and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>officer liability insurance (\u201cD &amp; 0\u201d) from the fourth appellee herein, Cal Union. The following chart summarizes these various coverages<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b544-34\">C. <em>The Present Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-35\">On February 7, 1990, Monumental filed this declaratory action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, against appellees USF &amp; G, Reliance, US Fire, and Cal Union (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cthe carriers\u201d)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>. Monumental\u2019s complaint, <em>inter alia, </em>sought a declaratory judgment that the carriers were obligated to defend and indemnify Monumental (and certain of its officers) for costs and fees associated with defending the suit brought against it by Peoples. In its complaint, Monumental contended that this duty to defend and/or indemnify emanated from (1) either personal injury coverage or advertising injury cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>age under both the USF &amp; G and Reliance policies, (2) advertising injury coverage under the US Fire policy, and (3) D &amp; 0 coverage under the Cal Union policy<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On March 14, 1990, the carriers successfully removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Following the removal, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. By Memorandum Opinion dated June 6, 1991, the court (William M. Nickerson, J.) (1) <em>denied </em>Monumental\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and (2) <em>granted </em>the carriers\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Subsequently, in a Memorandum Opinion and accompanying Order dated August 14, 1991, the court (1) <em>denied </em>Monumental\u2019s Motion to Vacate Judgment and to Remand, and (2) <em>granted </em>various Motions to Alter or Amend the Judgment that had been filed by both Monumental and the carriers. The ultimate effect of the District Court\u2019s judgment was to deny all coverage to Monumental.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Monumental subsequently noted a timely appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which, on October 9, 1991, vacated the federal district court\u2019s judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (incomplete diversity). The case was correspondingly remanded to where it began, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">By stipulation of all of the parties, all of the pleadings, motions and memoranda filed while the case was pending before the United States District Court were deemed filed and operative in that Maryland state court; in addition, following remand, the parties filed supplemental memoranda for the state court to consider. After a February 4,1992 hearing, the circuit court (Joseph H.H. Kaplan, J.) \u201cre-granted\u201d the carriers\u2019 Motions for Summary Judgment, and adopted as its reasons those set forth in the two federal Memoranda Decisions (dated June 6, 1991, and August 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>1991, respectively)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>.

DID THE LOWER COURT PROPERLY GRANT SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR USF &amp; G AND CAL UNION ON THEIR COUNTERCLAIMS WHICH SOUGHT <em>RESTITUTION OF CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS </em>TOWARDS DEFENSE COSTS? <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We shall discuss these four issues respectively.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Monumental\u2019s insurance liability policies with the various appellees may be summarized briefly: with respect to both USF &amp; G and Reliance, there were two separate policies under which Monumental was insured \u2014 a <em>CGL </em>policy and an <em>Excess </em>policy. Under <em>each </em>of those two policies, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>were two distinct types of coverages \u2014 personal injury and advertising injury. With respect to appellee US Fire, there was <em>only </em>an excess policy and <em>only </em>advertising injury coverage. Finally, with respect to Cal Union, there was <em>only </em>a D &amp; 0 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The lower court determined that neither USF &amp; G nor Reliance was liable to Monumental under <em>either </em>type of coverage under <em>either </em>policy; in all instances, the lower court supported its findings with one or more independent grounds. Additionally, the court determined that US Fire was not liable based on two alternative independent grounds. With respect to Cal Union, the court found no coverage under the D &amp; 0 policy based on two alternative independent grounds. In summary, the lower court denied all coverage to Monumental.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We are now asked to review the propriety of the lower court\u2019s granting of the various motions for summary judgment. The facts set forth above in the <em>Background </em>section of this opinion are not in dispute. There are, however, other facts (discussed below) that Monumental implicitly claims <em>are </em>in dispute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In Maryland, the moving party is entitled to summary judgment only when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2-501; <em>see, e.g., King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985). Moreover, as we noted in <em>DeGroft v. Lancaster Silo Co., </em>72 Md.App. 154, 527 A.2d 1316 (1987), \u201cIn ruling on a motion for summary judgment, all disputed facts and inferences therefrom should be viewed in the light most favorable to the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>against whom the motion is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 527 A.2d 1316. We must therefore now determine whether, in any of the claims in the case at bar, after viewing all of the facts and inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to Monumental, there is any dispute as to any material fact and, if not, whether the various appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In addition, where the lower court relied on several alternative independent grounds in reaching its decision, we must determine that at least <em>one </em>of those independent grounds was properly decided in order to affirm that decision. <em>Ellett v. Giant Food, Inc., </em>66 Md.App. 695, 700, 505 A.2d 888 (1986). In other words, in order for us to disturb the lower court\u2019s granting of summary judgment as to the denial of a specific coverage under a particular policy, we would have to determine that <em>all </em>of the grounds upon which the court relied were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">I. DID THE LOWER COURT PROPERLY GRANT SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR USF &amp; G, RELIANCE AND US FIRE ON MONUMENTAL\u2019S CLAIM FOR <em>ADVERTISING INJURY </em>COVERAGE?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of three appellees (USF &amp; G, Reliance and US Fire<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>), and against Monumental, on the issue of advertising injury coverage. Monumental now asserts that the lower court erred in granting summary judgment to the carriers, because Monumental alleges that its conduct occurred in the course of its \u201cadvertising activities,\u201d and therefore coverage should have been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\"><em>A. THE CGL POLICIES: </em>USF &amp; G AND RELIANCE-SCOPE OF \u201cADVERTISING ACTIVITIES\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Both of the CGL carriers \u2014 USF &amp; G and Reliance\u2014 essentially make the same arguments regarding the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>of the term \u201cadvertising injury coverage\u201d contained in their respective (but similarly worded) CGL policies. Therefore, we will combine our discussion of their arguments supporting the denial of advertising injury coverage.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">USF &amp; G\u2019s CGL policy defined \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as injury arising out of an offense committed during the policy period occurring in the course of the named insured\u2019s advertising activities, if such injury arises out of libel, slander, defamation, violation of right of privacy, piracy, unfair competition____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">Reliance\u2019s CGL policy defined \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as injury sustained by any person or organization and arising out of one or more of the following offenses committed in the conduct of the Named Insured\u2019s business: libel, slander, defamation, invasion of the right of privacy, piracy, unfair competition or idea misappropriation under an implied contract ... arising out of the Named Insured\u2019s advertising activitiesf.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">4c 4c $ 4* 4* \u2666</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In denying coverage under USF &amp; G\u2019s advertising injury policy, the trial court held that existing legal principles combined with the facts alleged in Peoples\u2019 complaint required the conclusion that Monumental\u2019s alleged conduct did <em>not </em>occur \u201cin the course of Monumental\u2019s \u2018advertising activities.\u2019 \u201d The court relied on four interrelated factors for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">First, the trial court referred to the canons of construction observed in Maryland that require the policy to be measured \u201cby its express terms and provisions,\u201d and to give the terms \u201ctheir customary and normal meaning.\u201d The lower court stated that although Maryland law requires that claims must be only <em>potentially </em>covered by the policy, <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins., </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A.2d 842 (1975), it found that the customary and normal usage of \u201cadvertising activity\u201d did <em>not </em>include sales or solicitation as alleged by Peoples in the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Second, the lower court relied on <em>Grosman v. Real Estate Comm\u2019n, </em>267 Md. 259, 297 A.2d 257 (1972), for the proposition that advertising must be in the form of a <em>public announcement (i.e., </em>calling public attention to one\u2019s product, service, need, etc.). The lower court held that there was no public announcement alleged in Peoples\u2019 complaints, but only private solicitations which, according to the court, are not encompassed by the term \u201cadvertising.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Third, the lower court favored the meaning of \u201cadvertising\u201d adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Playboy Enterprises v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine, </em>769 F.2d 425 (7th Cir.1985); in <em>Playboy, </em>the Seventh Circuit held that advertising means the \u201cwidespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Finally, the lower court noted that the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in <em>Liberty Life Ins. v. Commercial Union Ins. </em>(\u201cLiberty I\u201d), 857 F.2d 945, 950 (4th Cir.1988) \u2014 a case with substantially similar facts to the one at bar \u2014 left open the question whether solicitations by agents and for agents constitutes \u201cadvertising activities.\u201d In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, the lower court found that the facts do <em>not </em>suggest that Monumental\u2019s agents\u2019 solicitations fell within Monumental\u2019s advertising activities, and therefore the lower court was not persuaded by the court\u2019s holding in <em>Liberty I. </em>The lower court concluded that all of the aforementioned factors demonstrate that \u201cnormal and customary usage\u201d of \u201cadvertising activities\u201d requires that it be of a <em>public </em>nature \u2014 which was not shown in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We agree for the following reason: the plain meaning of the term \u201cadvertising\u201d to a reasonably prudent person is <em>not </em>susceptible of more than one meaning, and encompasses only the \u201cpublic\u201d sense of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">ADVERTISING vs. SOLICITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Judges Nickerson and Kaplan, relying on Maryland law in the interpretation of insurance policies, held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>reasonable layperson would not construe \u201cadvertising activities\u201d in the context of the <em>CGL </em>policies to include the one-to-one sales activity of Monumental\u2019s agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The lower court clearly viewed advertising and solicitation as mutually exclusive, the difference being that advertising must be of a public nature. The court therefore found that Monumental\u2019s solicitations of Peoples\u2019 policyholders were not advertising because they were not of a \u201cpublic nature.\u201d Judges Nickerson and Kaplan stated that \u201cwhile 10,000 policies being replaced by Monumental may be widespread, it is neither \u2018public\u2019 nor \u2018advertising.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">As we have noted previously,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">It is well settled that the construction of a written contract is ordinarily considered to be an issue of law for resolution by the trial judge. <em>University Nat\u2019l Bank v. Wolfe, </em>279 Md. 512, 369 A.2d 570 (1977); <em>Allen Engineering Corp. v. Lattimore, </em>235 Md. 182, 201 A.2d 13 (1964). Only when there is a <em>bona fide </em>ambiguity in the contract\u2019s language or legitimate doubt as to its application under the circumstances is the contract submitted to the trier of the fact for interpretation. <em>See Board of Trustees v. Sherman, </em>280 Md. 373, 373 A.2d 626 (1977); 4 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 616 (1961). Ambiguity arises if, to a reasonably prudent person, the language used is susceptible of more than one meaning and not when one of the parties disagrees as to the meaning of the subject language. <em>Truck Ins. Exch. v. Marks Rentals, Inc., </em>288 Md. 428, 418 A.2d 1187 (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\"><em>Board of Educ. of Charles County v. Plymouth Rubber Co., </em>82 Md.App. 9, 26-27, 569 A.2d 1288 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In the present case, we agree with the lower court that there is no <em>bona fide </em>ambiguity in the language of the policies at issue, nor is there any legitimate doubt as to its application under the circumstances. \u201cAdvertising\u201d means <em>advertising, i.e., </em>\u201cwidespread distribution or announcements to the public.\u201d Consequently, Monumental\u2019s individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>ual, one-to-one solicitations were clearly <em>not </em>\u201cadvertising\u201d within the normal meaning of the word and, accordingly, the lower court acted properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><em>B. THE EXCESS POLICIES: </em>USF &amp; G, RELIANCE AND US FIRE \u2014 SCOPE OF \u201cADVERTISING ACTIVITIES\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The <em>Excess </em>policies of USF &amp; G, Reliance, and US Fire are on a somewhat different footing than the <em>CGL </em>policies discussed above. The distinction is that each of the three <em>Excess </em>policies <em>expressly contained </em>companion language that <em>limited </em>advertising injury coverage to certain listed offenses committed in four specified types of publications: (1) an \u201cadvertisement,\u201d (2) a \u201cpublicity article,\u201d (3) a \u201cbroadcast\u201d or (4) a \u201ctelecast.\u201d With respect to all three carriers, the lower court held that Monumental suffered no advertising injury as that term is defined in the carriers\u2019 respective <em>Excess </em>policies. The lower court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV5\">[t]here is no generalized term \u201cadvertising activities\u201d within the definition of advertising injury in the Excess policy but only the language \u201cadvertisement, publicity article, broadcast or telecast.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In this regard, the lower court examined the case of <em>Liberty Life Ins. v. Commercial Union Ins. </em>(\u201cLiberty II\u201d), Case No. C/A 6:85-1352-17 (D.S.C. August 14, 1989) <em>aff'd, </em>No. 89-1799 &amp; 89-1800 (4th Cir. February 14, 1991), a case which was cited by Monumental in its brief. <em>Liberty II </em>concerned a policy with the <em>same </em>language as the carriers\u2019 <em>Excess </em>policies in the case <em>sub judice, </em>and involved substantially identical facts. Having so considered <em>Liberty II, </em>the lower court in the case at bar proceeded to draw its decisive language therefrom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">It is no where [sic] alleged in any of the underlying [Peoples\u2019] complaints that any of the causes of action for which recovery is sought involved an offense \u2018committed in any advertisement, publicity article, broadcast or telecast\u2019; nor has [Monumental] brought to this Court\u2019s attention any \u2018advertisement, publicity article, broadcast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>or telecast^] which contains the arguable [sic] offensive language or activity being asserted as the basis of [Peoples\u2019] claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><em>{Quoting Liberty II </em>at 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The lower court held that Monumental\u2019s alleged solicitations did <em>not </em>constitute advertising activity and that none of the alleged activity (including the mailing of certain recruiting letters by Monumental) was done in any \u201cadvertisement, publicity article, broadcast or telecast\u201d as defined in the carriers\u2019 <em>Excess </em>policies. We agree. Because this \u201ccompanion language\u201d <em>expressly </em>appeared in each of the carriers\u2019 <em>Excess </em>policies, we hold that coverage was <em>clearly </em>provided only for \u201cadvertising\u201d in its general \u201cpublic\u201d sense. Consequently, because Monumental\u2019s \u201csolicitations\u201d at issue were admittedly <em>not </em>public in nature, neither USF &amp; G, Reliance, nor US Fire had a duty to defend Monumental with regard to advertising injury under their respective <em>Excess </em>policies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">II. DID THE LOWER COURT PROPERLY GRANT SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR USF &amp; G AND RELIANCE ON MONUMENTAL\u2019S CLAIM FOR <em>PERSONAL INJURY </em>COVERAGE?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The lower co\u00fart granted summary judgment in favor of USF &amp; G and Reliance, and against Monumental, and in so doing denied Monumental personal injury coverage<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>. Monumental now asserts that, for the following three reasons, summary judgment should not have been granted against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>it: (1) <em>with respect to USF &amp; G only, </em>and contrary to the lower court\u2019s finding, the applicable statutes of limitations had not run on the Peoples\u2019 claims for which Monumental sought coverage, (2) <em>with respect to Reliance only, </em>and contrary to the lower court\u2019s finding, the alleged defamatory statements first occurred <em>during </em>(as opposed to <em>prior to) </em>the effective dates of the policy, and (3) <em>also with respect to Reliance only, </em>the lower court improperly determined that no \u201coccurrences\u201d took place which would trigger coverage. We discuss these contentions respectively below.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">A. USF &amp; G only \u2014 Statutes of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"A1j\">With respect to USF &amp; G only, the lower court found that the statute of limitations played a big part in allowing USF <em>&amp; </em>G to properly deny personal injury coverage to Monumental. Specifically, with respect to Monumental\u2019s <em>CGL </em>policy with USF &amp; G, Judges Nickerson and Kaplan determined that there were two independent reasons why USF &amp; G could properly decline <em>personal injury </em>coverage to Monumental: (1) Peoples\u2019 underlying defamation claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and (2) \u201cExclusion (4)\u201d acts to preclude coverage to Monumental for defamatory statements made by Monumental with \u201cknowledge of [the] falsity [of such statements].\u201d Moreover, with respect to Monumental\u2019s <em>Excess </em>policy with USF &amp; G, Judges Nickerson and Kaplan determined that USF &amp; G could properly decline <em>personal injury </em>coverage to Monumental simply because the statute of limitations had run on Peoples\u2019 underlying defamation claim. In the relevant portion of its written opinion, the lower court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">[Peoples\u2019 underlying] defamation claim was precluded by the statute of limitations as to USF &amp; G at the time Peoples\u2019 filed its complaint. Peoples filed suit on August 1, 1986, and because defamation has a one year limitations, all such claims before August 1, 1985, were barred at the time the suit was filed because USF <em>&amp; </em>G\u2019s policy expired December 1,1983. Monumental failed to move to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>dismiss defamation claims accruing before August 1, 1985. In light of these events, this Court agrees with USF &amp; G that it should not have a duty to defend nor have damages imposed upon it for failure to defend the allegation of defamation. Another district court faced a similar situation and reasoned:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">Given these facts ... [w]hile the court would not go so far as to impute to defendants an improper motive in their failure to take reasonable steps to obtain an expeditious dismissal of the obviously time-barred claims, in the court\u2019s view <em>it would be highly inequitable to require Southern Guaranty to pay for the defense of clearly non-insured claims </em>where the only potential for coverage arose long after institution of the lawsuit itself and <em>where any defense obligation was invoked and continued only by virtue of what were obviously time-barred tort claims which could have been with little time and effort, quickly disposed of</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>(Quoting E.E.O.C. v. Southern Publishing, </em>705 F.Supp. 1213, 1219-20 (S.D.Miss.1988); emphasis added by the lower court in the case <em>sub judice) </em>(footnote omitted). Monumental now asserts that the lower court erred by finding that the statute of limitations precluded coverage on both the CGL and Excess policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The lower court held that Peoples\u2019 suit arose directly out of the Peoples/Monumental letter Agreement, dated September 13, 1984; therefore the applicable statute of limitations would begin to run shortly thereafter <em>{i.e., </em>subject to the so-called \u201cDiscovery Rule,\u201d the statute would begin to run at the approximate point when Monumental breached the Agreement<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>). Monumental contends that the defamation-type claims in Peoples\u2019 underlying suit (which was filed on August 1,1986) were based on two independent theories: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>(1) standard defamation, for which the statute of limitations is admittedly one year<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>, and (2) violation of the North Carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices statute<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>, for which the statute of limitations is four years. Therefore, (Monumental argues,) by the time Peoples filed its August 1, 1986 complaint, although the one-year statute of limitations <em>may </em>have run on Peoples\u2019 standard defamation claim, the <em>four-year </em>statute of limitations did <em>not </em>run on Peoples\u2019 <em>North Carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices claim </em>(and, consequently, USF &amp; G\u2019s personal injury coverage should have been triggered). Monumental\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Monumental\u2019s <em>CGL </em>policy with USF &amp; G ran from October 12,1982, through December 1,1983; Monumental\u2019s <em>Excess </em>policy ran from October 12, 1982, through January 1, 1984. Those facts are undisputed. Moreover, all activities that Monumental was found liable for arose out of the Peoples/Monumental letter Agreement dated September 13, 1984; this Agreement was therefore executed more than nine months <em>after </em>USF &amp; G\u2019s coverage had expired, and thus USF &amp; G can in no way be responsible for any portion of the resulting judgment which arose from such an Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">That notwithstanding, Monumental essentially concedes that Peoples\u2019 claims for libel or slander <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cstandard\u201d defamation) were time-barred, and thus could not trigger coverage. Monumental\u2019s argument on appeal is therefore limited to Peoples\u2019 North Carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices claim, which allegedly has a four-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Even presuming, without so deciding, that a violation of the cited North Carolina statute <em>could </em>trigger coverage, we must still hold against Monumental because Peoples\u2019 claims were not raised in the appropriate forum (arbitration) until March 15, 1989. All such claims which arose before March 15, 1985<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> are barred as against USF &amp; G (whose policies with Monumental expired, at the very latest, on January 1, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">B. RELIANCE only</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As discussed above, the lower court determined that \u201cMonumental\u2019s claims of personal injury liability obligating a duty to defend do not come within Reliance\u2019s policy terms for three independent reasons.\u201d Those three reasons may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) exclusion 2(b) precludes personal injury coverage because the first publication of the disparaging material occurred prior to December 1, 1983; (2) exclusion 2(c) precludes personal injury coverage because the defamation claimed was \u201cmade by or at the direction of any Insured with knowledge of its falsity\u201d; and (3) the defamatory personal injury claimed by Monumental to be within the policy was not \u201ccaused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Significantly, of these three independent grounds, Monumental has raised only the first and the third as issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>before this court; <em>i.e., </em>Monumental does <em>not </em>now seek to challenge the <em>second </em>independent ground whereby the lower court properly determined that exclusion 2(c) precludes personal injury coverage because the defamation claimed (by Peoples\u2019 in its complaints) was made by Monumental with knowledge of its falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">We have previously held that, where a lower court decision is supported by at least one properly decided independent ground, than we must affirm that decision. <em>Ellett, supra, </em>66 Md.App. at 700, 505 A.2d 888. <em>See also DeGroft, </em>72 Md.App. at 159, 527 A.2d 1316 (appellate court will not review issues not argued in appellant\u2019s brief). As the trial court in the case <em>sub judice </em>had a proper and independent ground upon which to base its decision, <em>i.e., </em>Exclusion 2(c), we now must affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\n<em>\u201cOccurrences\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Regarding personal injury coverage, Monumental\u2019s policy with Reliance stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">[Reliance] will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... personal injury or ... property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an <em>occurrence, </em>and [Reliance] shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such personal injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent, and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient[.] * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\"><em>\u201cOccurrence </em>[means] an accident ... which results in personal injury ... neither <em>expected nor intended from the standpoint of the </em>insured[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Monumental does not challenge the lower court\u2019s finding that the claims alleged by Peoples did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. Rather, Monumental con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>tends that the \u201coccurrence\u201d requirement itself is illusory, and therefore Reliance should have been mandated to provide coverage. To support this contention, Monumental cites <em>Liberty I, supra, </em>for the following proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">The excess policy issued by defendant, Mission, is on a somewhat different footing as it purported to require an unexpected or unintended occurrence to trigger the coverage in any risk category____ Mission did, however, specifically insure for injuries arising out of the insured\u2019s actions which included libel, slander, defamation or unfair competition in connection with its advertising activities. Actions of that nature are not usually deemed unintentional or unexpected. To allow Mission to escape coverage at this stage of the proceeding under its definition of occurrence would make much or all of the advertising liability coverage illusory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">857 F.2d at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">We believe that, by so arguing, Monumental is confusing an intentional <em>act </em>(which forms the basis of much tort liability) with intended <em>results </em>(which precludes coverage under Reliance\u2019s policy). As indicated above, the policy defines an \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201caccident ... which <em>results </em>in personal injury ... <em>neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured[.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The distinction between intentional <em>acts </em>and intended <em>results </em>is both subtle and significant. An intentional <em>act </em>can result in both intended and unintended consequences. <em>See, e.g., Haynes v. American Casualty Co., </em>228 Md. 394, 396-99, 179 A.2d 900 (1962). Moreover, the \u201cintentional\u201d torts of defamation and unfair competition (both of which are at issue presently) can be committed without the actor <em>intending </em>to cause harmful <em>results. See, e.g., Jacron Sales Co., Inc. v. Sindorf </em>276 Md. 580, 350 A.2d 688 (1976) (defamation); <em>Quality Inns Int\u2019l, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>695 F.Supp. 198, 209 (D.Md.1988) (unfair competition).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Consequently, there is nothing illusory about a liability policy that only provides coverage for activities that yield unintended results. Therefore, even had Monumental contested all three of the lower court\u2019s justifications, we would still be mandated to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">III. DID THE LOWER COURT PROPERLY GRANT SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR CAL UNION ON MONUMENTAL\u2019S OFFICERS\u2019 CLAIM FOR <em>D &amp; 0 </em>COVERAGE UNDER A VALIDLY RESCINDED POLICY?</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The following is a brief summary of the relevant facts regarding Cal Union\u2019s D &amp; 0 coverage:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">By application dated December 13, 1983, Monumental requested that Cal Union provide to Monumental D &amp; 0 coverage. Prior to that application date, Monumental had hired at least three former officers of Peoples.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> These, as well as numerous other alleged departures of Peoples\u2019 employees to Monumental, began to concern Peoples. A series of letters and conversations between the two companies ensued, including the two letters set forth in detail above: (1) Gregg\u2019s letter to Disharoon, dated November 30, 1983 <em>(i.e., </em>thirteen days <em>before </em>Monumental applied to Cal Union for D &amp; 0 insurance), and (2) Larry\u2019s Jenkins\u2019 letter to Simons, dated December 16, 1983 <em>(ie., </em>3 days <em>after </em>Monumental applied to Cal Union).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>letter dated January 17, 1984, Monumental and Peoples agreed to a fiye-month hiring moratorium.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In its December 13, 1983 application to Cal Union for insurance, Monumental was required to answer the following question (which was designated on the application as question number 13):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">Is [Monumental] or any Director or Officer proposed for insurance aware of any fact, circumstance or situation involving [Monumental], its Subsidiaries or the Directors or Officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries which (s)he has reason to suppose might result in any future claim such as would fall within the scope of the proposed insurance?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Despite the fact that, at the time, Monumental was involved in activities that would subsequently form the basis of the Peoples/Monumental litigation (as indicated by, among other things, the above November 30 and December 16, 1983 letters), Monumental answered question 13 in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">With respect to the case <em>subjudice, </em>Cal Union successfully argued in its Motion for Summary Judgment that the Cal Union policy accordingly must be rescinded or determined to exclude coverage because it was obtained without disclosure of Peoples\u2019 potential claims. In disposing of the summary judgment motion in favor of Cal Union (and against Monumental), the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (in adopting the two Memoranda Decisions of the U.S. District Court, dated June 6, 1991, and August 14, 1991, respectively) held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">The first reason Cal Union is not liable is because this Court declares the policy void <em>ab initio, </em>finding that Monumental materially misrepresented its response to question 13 in the application for insurance. * * * * [Although Monumental argues that, due to the parties\u2019 on-going negotiations, it possessed subjective good faith in believing that all the problems with Peoples had been resolved, s]ubjective good faith hopes or beliefs [are] irrelevant to the question of material misrepresentation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>it is a reasonableness inquiry. Because the Court finds a material misrepresentation, the policy is rescinded and Monumental cannot recover under it. * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">The second reason Monumental cannot recover under Cal Union\u2019s policy is because the application, now part of the insurance contract<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>, excludes any claims \u201cemanating\u201d from any knowledge of facts or circumstances which Monumental represented. * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">The third reason that Monumental cannot recover under the policy, even assuming the policy is not void <em>ab initio, </em>is that the Tribunal determined that any liabilities of the individual officers and directors who are insured under the policy are the responsibility of Monumental. The parties agree that the individual officers and directors were not signatories to the September 13, 1984, Agreement, and that individuals cannot be held liable for breaching contractual duties that only bind the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">(Footnote added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Monumental now argues that the lower court erred when it held that (1) Monumental\u2019s \u201csubjective good faith\u201d was inapposite to the issue of material misrepresentation, (2) Cal Union was not liable because Monumental\u2019s officers were not individually liable on the September 13, 1984 Agreement in the underlying litigation, and (3) Cal Union sought to rescind Monumental's D &amp; 0 policy in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">A. <em>Grounds Not Appealed Sufficient to Uphold Lower Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">As discussed above, the lower court\u2019s decision as to Cal Union rested on three independent grounds: (1) Monu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>mental made a material misrepresentation on its application to Cal Union for D &amp; 0 coverage, (2) the Cal Union policy, by its terms, excludes any claims \u201cemanating\u201d from any knowledge of facts or circumstances that Monumental represented, and (3) the individual officers and directors were not signatories to the Agreement that was allegedly breached by Monumental <em>{i.e., </em>the September 13, 1984 Agreement), and thus the Peoples\u2019 lawsuit was outside the scope of the D &amp; 0 coverage. Significantly, of these three independent grounds, Monumental has raised only the first and the third as issues before this court; <em>i.e., </em>Monumental does not now seek to challenge the <em>second </em>independent ground whereby the lower court determined that the <em>Cal Union policy, by its terms, excludes from coverage </em>any claims \u201cemanating\u201d from any knowledge of facts or circumstances that Monumental represented. Similarly, the lower court properly determined (and Monumental also does not challenge the fact) that Peoples\u2019 claims <em>{i.e., </em>those claims for which Monumental presently seeks coverage) <em>did indeed \u201cemanate\u201d </em>from the facts or circumstances that Monumental represented in its application to Cal Union for D &amp; 0 coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">As discussed above, we have previously held that, where a lower court decision is supported by at least one properly decided independent ground, then we must affirm that decision. <em>Ellett, supra, </em>66 Md.App. at 700, 505 A.2d 888. <em>See also DeGroft, supra, </em>72 Md.App. at 159, 527 A.2d 1316 (appellate court will not review issues not argued in appellant\u2019s brief). As stated above, since the trial court in the case <em>sub judice </em>had a proper and independent ground upon which to base its decision, we now must affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">B. <em>Individual Officer Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Monumental also contends that the lower court erred when it held, pursuant to the D &amp; 0 policy, that Cal Union need not indemnify Monumental because Monumental\u2019s officers <em>should </em>not have been held individually liable in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>underlying Peoples/Monumental litigation. With respect to this issue, Monumental\u2019s argument is scant, and is reproduced here in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">Monumental\u2019s officers did not individually sign the September 13, 1984 Agreement. But the panel nonetheless found that they were liable for unfair competition. They remained judgment defendants through the present time, now appellants in the 4th Circuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In essence, Monumental employs a type of <em>post hoc </em>reasoning in an attempt to bootstrap coverage, to wit: Monumental argues that because in the <em>actual </em>outcome to the underlying suit Monumental\u2019s officers <em>were </em>found liable, Cal Union is mandated to provide coverage.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">As stated above in this opinion, it is well-established in Maryland that the obligation of an insurer to defend its insured under a liability policy is determined by the <em>allegations </em>contained in the complaint, and not by the final disposition of the claims contained therein. <em>See, e.g., Oweiss v. Erie Ins. Exchange, </em>67 Md.App. 712, 717, 509 A.2d 711 (1986). This is known as the so-called Exclusive Pleading Rule. <em>See, e.g., Eastern Shore Financial v. Donegal Mut., </em>84 Md.App. 609, 620, 581 A.2d 452 (1990). In light of the Exclusive Pleading Rule, and with respect to Cal Union\u2019s D &amp; O coverage, Monumental has conceded that (1) the underlying Peoples/Monumental litigation boiled down to a dispute over an alleged breach of the September 13, 1984 Agreement<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>, and (2) Monumental\u2019s officers did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>individually sign that September 13,1984 Agreement. Consequently, irrespective of the <em>result </em>of the underlying litigation, the lower court properly determined that Monumental\u2019s D &amp; 0 coverage with Cal Union was not invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">C. <em>Timeliness of Cal Union\u2019s Rescission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Cal Union rescinded Monumental\u2019s D &amp; 0 policy in late November, 1990, after becoming sufficiently convinced that Monumental, and its officers and directors, had engaged in wrongdoing.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Monumental now seeks to challenge the timeliness of this rescission. Specifically, Monumental contends that Cal Union had sufficient grounds to rescind the D &amp; 0 policy much earlier than late 1990. They base this contention largely on the following \u201cfacts\u201d: (1) on August 16, 1986, Cal Union received a copy of Peoples\u2019 U.S. District Court complaint, which contained allegations concerning Monumental\u2019s alleged wrongdoing; (2) on or before May 6, 1988, Monumental produced to <em>Peoples, </em>pursuant to Peoples\u2019 discovery request, the documents that Judges Nickerson and Kaplan subsequently found demonstrated Monumental\u2019s \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of its wrongdoing; and (3) most of the Monumental officials associated with those damning documents were deposed by Cal Union in <em>early </em>1990. We discuss each of these three \u201cgrounds\u201d respectively-</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Even presuming, without so determining, that the August 16,1986 complaint was both (1) actually and timely supplied to Cal Union, and (2) sufficient to provide Cal Union with \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of Monumental\u2019s alleged wrongdoing, the lower court\u2019s ruling must still be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Monumental relies on <em>Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co., </em>57 Md.App. 190, 469 A.2d 867, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 88, 475 A.2d 1200 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1215, 105 S.Ct. 1190, 84 L.Ed.2d 336 (1985). Monumental correctly points out that in <em>Finch </em>we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">[a] plaintiff seeking rescission must demonstrate that he acted promptly after discovery of the ground for rescission. He must also show that he tendered to defendant all consideration and benefits received under the contract immediately after notice of the ground for rescission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABSF\">57 Md.App. at 244, 469 A.2d 867. The very next sentence in <em>Finch, </em>however, was <em>not </em>quoted by Monumental, but is nonetheless also relevant to the disposition of the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cThis effort to resume the status quo is required as, <em>if a party who knows the facts which would justify rescission, </em>does any act which recognizes the continued validity of the contract or indicates that he still feels bound under it, he will be held to have waived his right to rescind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab9\"><em>Id. (quoting Lazorcak v. Feuerstein, </em>273 Md. 69, 76, 327 A.2d 477 (1974); emphasis added). Therefore the appropriate focus of the lower court is <em>not </em>(as Monumental errantly contends) when the carrier learns of facts that raise the <em>mere potentiality </em>for rescission but, rather, the lower court must determine when the carrier learns the facts that would <em>justify </em>rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In the instant case, it is undisputed which facts would actually <em>justify </em>rescission, to wit: Cal Union could <em>justify </em>rescission of Monumental\u2019s D &amp; O policy <em>only </em>after it acquired sufficient proof that Monumental, and its officers and directors, had actually engaged in wrongdoing. For its part, Monumental itself spent considerable time, energy and money in the underlying litigation <em>denying </em>that it had engaged in any wrongdoing; we therefore find it curious that Monumental now contends that Peoples\u2019 U.S. District Court complaint could, of itself, form a sufficient basis for Cal Union to be justified in denying D &amp; O coverage to Monumental. Consequently, the furnishing of Peoples\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>1986 complaint to Cal Union could not \u2014 in and of itself\u2014 supply sufficient grounds to justify Cal Union in rescinding its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Similarly, even after considering Monumental\u2019s other two factual bases for its assertion that Cal Union didn\u2019t timely rescind<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>, we still must uphold the lower court\u2019s ruling. Cal Union, of course, was not a party to the Peoples/Monumental litigation. The record reflects (1) that Cal Union, following the aforementioned early-1990 depositions, adequately attempted to investigate the matter more fully, but that (2) Monumental withheld from Cal Union necessary transcripts relating to the Peoples\u2019 litigation until <em>after </em>Cal Union had rescinded its policy. Consequently, under those circumstances, Cal Union cannot be seen as having waived any rights by \u201cdelaying\u201d its decision to rescind. As other courts have noted, carriers themselves may risk bad faith allegations if they rescind too early, <em>i.e., </em>before they have a solid basis to do so. <em>See, e.g., Fountain &amp; Herrington, Inc. v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>55 F.2d 120, 126 (4th Cir.1932); <em>Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. v. Blake, </em>245 Cal.App.2d 196, 53 Cal.Rptr. 701, 705 (1966). We must therefore accord a fair amount of discretion to a carrier who seeks to rescind a policy, but who \u201cdelays\u201d doing so while making a good faith attempt to investigate whether there are proper grounds for rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">As discussed above, Judges Nickerson and Kaplan found that Cal Union didn\u2019t acquire sufficient knowledge of Monumental\u2019s alleged wrongdoing until late November, 1990 <em>{i.e., </em>only a few days before Cal Union actually rescinded its policy). We find no reversible error resulting from that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>IV. DID THE LOWER COURT PROPERLY GRANT SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR USF &amp; G, CAL UNION, and RELIANCE ON THEIR COUNTERCLAIMS WHICH SOUGHT <em>RESTITUTION OF CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS </em>TOWARDS DEFENSE COSTS?</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">After Peoples filed its underlying lawsuit, Monumental notified the various carriers of the claim. Subsequently, three of the carriers \u2014 USF &amp; G, Cal Union and Reliance\u2014 extended defense costs to Monumental in the respective amounts of $232,206.97, $225,717.43, and $277,486.23. In ruling on the various motions for summary judgment filed by the parties hereto, the lower court, <em>inter alia, </em>determined that the respective payments of USF &amp; G and Cal Union to Monumental were conditionally made \u201cunder a full reservation of rights as to both coverage and liability regarding defense costs, ... subject to a later determination among the carriers as to coverage.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Consequently, in light of the lower court\u2019s determination that the carriers had no obligations to defend or indemnify under their respective policies, the court ordered Monumental to refund the amounts conditionally paid by USF &amp; G and Cal Union. Monumental now argues that the lower court erred in that Monumental \u201cshould not be required to refund defense cost payments which were <em>not </em>conditional [on Monumental first establishing, as an absolute condition precedent, that the carriers had a duty to defend or indemnify Monumental].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">With respect to this issue, Monumental\u2019s argument in its brief before this court is essentially nonexistent, and is reproduced here in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">Space does not permit further argument here. Monumental adopts the argument set forth [in its Motion to Vacate the U.S. District Court\u2019s Judgment, as such is included in the Record Extract].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Pursuant to Md.Rule 8-504(a)(5), \u201cA brief [filed before an appellate court] <em>shall </em>contain ... [an argument in support of the party\u2019s position.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d indicates that the provision is mandatory, and that the consequences of noncompliance are those prescribed by the Maryland Rules or by statute. <em>See </em>Md.Rule l-201(a). In the instant case, the effect of noncompliance with Rule 8-504 \u2014 as in the case where a brief does not <em>contain </em>the party\u2019s argument, but merely <em>makes reference </em>to an argument contained elsewhere<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u2014 is set forth in Md.Rule 8-504(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">For noncompliance with this Rule, the appellate court may dismiss the appeal or make any other appropriate order with respect to the case[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Consequently, we need not \u2014 and, indeed, choose not to\u2014 consider the merits of Monumental\u2019s argument concerning the refund of the payments made by USF &amp; G and Cal Union. <em>See also Rosenberg v. Rosenberg, </em>64 Md.App. 487, 515 n. 7, 497 A.2d 485 (1985) (appellate court will not consider appellant\u2019s argument where, rather than setting forth that argument in his brief, he merely attempts to incorporate by reference a discussion that appears in a lower court memorandum); <em>DeGroft, supra, </em>72 Md.App. at 159, 527 A.2d 1316 (appellate court will not review issues not argued in appellant\u2019s brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">V. ADMISSION OF COVERAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Monumental has raised one additional issue which may be disposed of in summary fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Monumental asserts that \u201c[t]he most significant omission in the federal court\u2019s 63-page opinion was any mention of admissions by [USF &amp; G, Reliance and US Fire] that their respective policies provided coverage here.\u201d In support of this assertion, Monumental quotes language from assorted letters written to Monumental by various officers and directors of USF &amp; G, Reliance and US Fire. Each cited instance, <em>taken out of its original context, </em>appears to suggest that the respective carriers admitted coverage. After considering Monumental\u2019s argument in this regard, the lower court implicitly found that none of the carriers had, in fact, admitted coverage. We see no error in that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The record reflects that initially, <em>and while they investigated Peoples\u2019 claims, </em>all carriers reserved all rights under their respective policies. Moreover, the record reflects that all three carriers made known the fact that they weren\u2019t guaranteeing coverage. We discuss each carrier respectively-</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">1. As to USF &amp; G: Both in the letter that Monumental contends evidences USF &amp; G\u2019s admission of coverage, and in a letter dated the very next day, USF &amp; G indicated to Monumental that it was \u201cclosely examining\u201d the \u201ccoverage question,\u201d and that USF &amp; G wasn\u2019t \u201cwaiving any Company rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">2. As to Reliance: In its very first letter to Monumental, as well as in several subsequent letters, Reliance expressly reserved (or confirmed its reservation of) any rights it had under the policy. Indeed, in a letter from Monumental to Reliance, Monumental itself expressly acknowledged that it \u201cappreciate^] [Reliance\u2019s] reservation of rights until further study and further developments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">3. As to US Fire: In his deposition, Monumental\u2019s own general counsel acknowledged that US Fire never admitted coverage. In response to the question, \u201cIs it fair to say that at all times US Fire has denied that it ever had any defense obligations to Monumental since this claim was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>brought to its attention?\u201d, general counsel tellingly responded, \u201cI believe that\u2019s true, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Under these circumstances, the record fails to reflect any admissions of the kind claimed by Monumental.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">.

In a <em>footnote </em>in its brief, Monumental suggests that there was no basis upon which the lower court could have granted summary judgment in favor of the carriers when the court \"simply relied on the dictionary definition of the term \u2018advertising\u2019\" to reach its decision. Although we would have expected that Monumental would have made this argument first and foremost in its brief, its other arguments presented throughout its brief implicitly suggest that there are several material disputed facts in this case, and summary judgment was therefore improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\">. US Fire is only an <em>Excess </em>policy carrier, whereas USF &amp; G and Reliance provided <em>both CGL and Excess </em>coverage at some point during the relevant period in this case <em>(i.e., </em>October 12, 1983 through December 1, 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\">. In the event that we might have determined the threshold issue of \u201cWhether Monumental\u2019s acts were considered \u2018advertising activities\u2019 under the carriers\u2019 <em>Excess </em>policies?\u201d in Monumental\u2019s favor, each carrier (i.eUSF &amp; G, Reliance and US Fire) asserts supplemental arguments in support of their denial of advertising injury coverage under their respective <em>Excess </em>policies. Because we have determined that none of the respective carriers have any duty to defend Monumental under their <em>Excess </em>policies, we need not reach those supplemental arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">. Monumental\u2019s policy with a third carrier, US Fire, did not contain coverage for personal injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\">. Under the discovery rule, a cause of action accrues at the time the plaintiff first knows or reasonably should have known of the alleged wrong. <em>See, e.g., Newell </em>v. <em>Richard, </em>323 Md. 717, 723, 594 A.2d 1152 (1991). <em>See also Poffenberger v.

Monumental now contends that Peoples, in the underlying suit, alleged that Monumental \u201cdisparaged\u201d Peoples\u2019 policies pursuant to this North Carolina statute. Moreover, Monumental argues that such a claim for \"disparagement\u201d was part of Peoples\u2019 original federal complaint (Count 8), its amended federal complaint (Count 9), and its Demand for Arbitration (Count 7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>limitations were not tolled by the earlier federal court suit since the filing of a procedurally defective suit did not toll the statute. <em>See, e.g., Walko Corp. v.

The rule in <em>Walko </em>was modified by Md.Rule 2 \u2014 101(b), which became effective July 1, 1992:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">After Certain Dismissals. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided by statute, if an action is filed in a United States District Court or a court of another state within the period of limitations prescribed by Maryland law and the foreign court enters an order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, because the court declines to exercise jurisdiction, or because the action is barred by the statute of limitations required to be applied by that court, an action filed in this State within 30 days after the foreign court\u2019s order of dismissal shall be treated as timely filed in this State.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\">. (1) In September, 1982, Monumental hired Larry Jenkins as an Executive Vice President; Jenkins had been previously employed as the President and CEO of Peoples; (2) approximately one month later, Monumental hired Brittingham as an Agency Vice President; Brittingham had been previously employed as a field Vice President at Peoples; and (3) in June, 1983, Gene Hines left Peoples to become a consultant with Monumental.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\">.

The phrase \u201cactual outcome\u201d (as such applies to the <em>underlying litigation </em>) is to be distinguished from the holding of the lower court in the case <em>sub judice, </em>which determined that \u2014 contrary to the actual <em>outcome </em>\u2014 Monumental's officers <em>should not </em>have been held liable on the September 13, 1984 Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\">. In its response to Peoples\u2019 Demand for Arbitration, Monumental conceded that, \u201d[d]espite the rhetoric and various claims contained in the \u2018brief of [Peoples], this case boils down to a breach of contract dispute.\" In this regard, Monumental\u2019s concession comports with the allegations of Peoples itself, which \u2014 in its Demand for Arbitration\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>stated that \u201cthis dispute arises out of an agreement dated September 13, 1984.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">. Indeed, Judges Nickerson and Kaplan found that Cal Union didn\u2019t have a sufficient basis to rescind until various officers and directors of Monumental admitted, at their respective depositions (in late 1990), that they had engaged in wrongdoing. It was only a matter of days after these depositions that Cal Union actually sought rescission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\">. As stated above, Monumental claims that (1) on or before May 6, 1988, it produced to <em>Peoples, </em>pursuant to Peoples' discovery request, the documents which Judges Nickerson and Kaplan subsequently found demonstrated Monumental\u2019s \u201cactual knowledge\" of its wrongdoing, and (2) most of the Monumental officials associated with those damning documents were deposed by Cal Union in <em>early </em>1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\">.

Although the case at bar does involve more than one appellee, Monumental is <em>not </em>attempting to incorporate by reference a portion of another party\u2019s brief, and thus Monumental is not now protected by Rule 8 \u2014 503(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
