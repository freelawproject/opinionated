In their divorce proceedings, appellant, Charles Heyda, husband, and appellee, Ivana B. Heyda, wife, entered into a stipulation, which was placed on the record. The stipulation provided (1) that wife was to receive \u201csurvivorship\u201d benefits in Charles\u2019 Civil Service Retirement System plan, and (2) that wife\u2019s interest in husband\u2019s pension and \u201csurvivorship\u201d benefits was to be computed using the so-called <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula. The lower court, in interpreting the stipulation, but in contravention of federal regulations, granted wife (1) an interest in a Former Spouse Survivor Annuity, and (2) a conditional interest in an Insurable Interest Annuity. Also, the lower court did not properly apply the <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula. Finally, after reviewing the applicable (and recently enacted) federal regulations, we hold that the format of the trial court\u2019s order would be unacceptable to the Office of Personnel Management. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On July 5, 1969, Charles Heyda [\u201cCharles\u201d] married Ivana B. Heyda [\u201cIvana\u201d]. At all times relevant to this litigation \u2014 including throughout the entirety of his marriage to Ivana \u2014 Charles was (and remains to this day) a civilian employee of the United States government. As a federal employee, Charles is covered by the federal Civil Service Retirement System [\u201cCSRS\u201d]; the CSRS, in turn, is administered by the federal Office of Personnel Management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>[\u201cOPM\u201d]. The monthly annuity to which Charles, as a retired CSRS participant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, will be entitled is based upon his number of years of federal government service and his earnings. Federal law permits state divorce courts to treat certain pension and retirement rights as marital property, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8345(j), and, correspondingly, Maryland has specifically authorized its trial courts to implement a monetary award by transferring a portion of a party\u2019s pension or retirement plan to his or her spouse. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1991 RepLVol.), \u00a7 8-205(a) of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Eventually Ivana sued Charles for divorce. The parties, with and through the assistance of counsel, negotiated and stipulated a property settlement; one of the terms of this stipulation concerned transferring a portion of Charles\u2019s federal pension, with survivorship benefits, to Ivana.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">On August 15, 1989, the parties came before the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Paul A. McGuckian, J.) to place their stipulation on the record. Louis J. Fiechtner, Esquire, represented Ivana at the hearing; Steven J. Bienstock, Esquire, represented Charles. The colloquy that is relevant to the case <em>sub judice </em>(in that it concerned Ivana\u2019s interest in Charles\u2019s pension benefits) was admittedly brief, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">MR. FIECHTNER: * * * There is also a pension with the federal government of Mr. Heyda. Mr. Heyda has agreed to a division of the pension of 50% to his wife <em>with survivorship benefits.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">A domestic relations order dividing that pension, suitable for an if, as or when division, will be prepared and submitted to Counsel for his review and then ultimately submitted to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">Mr. Heyda would waive any claims to Mrs. Heyda\u2019s pension, if \u2014 well, waive any claims to any pension rights she may have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>MR. BIENSTOCK: The 50 percent is to be computed during \u2014 for the duration of the marriage, from the marriage date until\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">MR. FIECHTNER: Under the bank\u2019s [sic] formula<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP7\">MR. BIENSTOCK: \u2014 divorce, under the standard formula. The\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">THE COURT: When is it due?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">MR. BIENSTOCK: If, as and when.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">MR. FIECHTNER: <em>And with survivorship rights.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">4c * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">MR. BIENSTOCK: In addition, Your Honor, just to summarize, other than what is specified in [the testimony above], it is our understanding that Mrs. Heyda seeks nothing from Mr. Heyda and Mr. Heyda seeks nothing from Mrs. Heyda; that this is the totality of the agreement between the parties. * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">(Emphasis and footnote added.) With respect to these pension issues, there is no other testimony that reflects the parties\u2019 intent. Nor does the record reflect an exchange of correspondence between the parties\u2019 counsel to guide the court as to the parties\u2019 intent. The above colloquy represents the totality of facts upon which the lower court had to base (1) its determination as to the parties\u2019 intended meaning of \u201csurvivorship rights\u201d and \u201csurvivorship benefits,\u201d and (2) its determination as to the applicability of the <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">On January 18, 1990, the court <em>inter alia </em>granted Ivana an absolute divorce from Charles. As part of that judgment, the lower court ordered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-u\">that the provisions of the stipulation of the parties read into the record in open Court before the Honorable Judge Paul McGuckian on August 15, 1989, a transcript of which was introduced and admitted into evidence before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the Master on January 9, 1990 as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit # 2, be and the same are hereby incorporated, but not merged, in this judgment to the extent that the Court has jurisdiction, and it is further * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">ORDERED that this Court hereby reserves jurisdiction to enter a Qualified Domestic Relations Order to effect pension distributions pursuant to the agreement of the parties[.]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">(Footnote added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">On June 28, 1991, Ivana filed a Motion for Entry of Qualified Domestic Relations Order. This motion was intended to implement the foregoing stipulation relative to Ivana\u2019s interest in Charles\u2019 pension distributions. Charles opposed the way Ivana had implemented the parties\u2019 agreement, however, and correspondingly requested a hearing to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">On September 19, 1991, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County heard arguments from the parties concerning four areas of the proposed \u201cQDRO\u201d that were then in dispute. Of these four areas, only two are at issue presently: (1) What did the parties intend when they agreed to provide Ivana with \u201csurvivorship benefits,\u201d and (2) Exactly how should Ivana\u2019s \u201csurvivorship annuity\u201d be calculated?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Unfortunately, these two simply phrased, disputed issues must be resolved through the complex world of federal governmental organizational law and its corresponding OPM regulations. We shall reserve our discussion concerning the legal aspects of these issues for section A of this opinion, below. For our present purposes, however, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>sufficient to note that, pursuant to the aforementioned September 19, 1991 hearing, the lower court adopted Ivana\u2019s view of things; correspondingly, in its \u201cQDRO\u201d dated September 24, 1991, the circuit court <em>inter alia </em>ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9j\">[I]n the ... event that [Charles] shall predecease [Ivana], [she] shall receive a Former Spouse [Survivor] Annuity, as defined in 5 C.F.R. Section 831.603; provided however, that in the event that [Ivana] is otherwise entitled to a Former Spouse [Survivor] Annuity pursuant to this paragraph ..., but is precluded from receiving a Former Spouse [Survivor] Annuity because she remarries prior to attaining age 55, it is hereby agreed that (i) [Ivana] shall be entitled to receive an Insurable Interest Annuity, as defined in 5 C.F.R. Section 831.603, and (ii) [Charles] hereby covenants and agrees that, upon the written request of [Ivana], he shall take whatever actions are needed to convert the Former spouse [survivor] annuity entitlement to an Insurable Interest Annuity. Nothing herein shall be construed to require [Charles] to pay for two types of survivor benefits at the same time for the benefit of [Ivana].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">The Former spouse [survivor] annuity or the Insurable Interest Annuity, as the case may be, shall provide for payments equal to 55% of [Charles\u2019] \u201cself-only annuity\u201d immediately prior to [Charles\u2019] death, ... or, in the event that [Charles] dies prior to the commencement of such payments, 55% of the payments to which [Charles] would have been entitled if he had retired on the date of his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Charles now appeals from this \u201cQDRO.\u201d Specifically, he has asked us to address two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">I. Where the parties entered into a stipulation providing for Ivana to receive \u201csurvivorship\u201d benefits in Charles\u2019 Civil Service Retirement System plan, did the lower court err in awarding Ivana both a Former Spouse Survivor Annuity and an Insurable Interest Annuity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>II. Where the parties agreed that the formula for allocating Charles\u2019 retirement and survivor annuity benefits would be in accordance with the case of <em>Bangs v. Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. 350 [475 A.2d 1214] (1984), did the lower court err in failing to apply the <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula to the survivor annuity benefit computation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>Former Spouse Survivor Annuities v. Insurable Interest Annuities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Charles and Ivana placed their stipulation on record during the aforementioned August 15, 1989 hearing. Therefore, we start with the basic factual proposition that the lower court was asked to interpret the terms of this stipulation. As we stated in <em>Bentz v. Mutual Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Ins. Co., </em>83 Md.App. 524, 575 A.2d 795 (1990),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">[t]he cardinal rule in the construction and interpretation of contracts is that effect must be given to the intention of the parties, unless it is inconsistent with some established principle of law. All other rules of construction are simply in aid of that \u201ccardinal rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 538, 575 A.2d 795 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Moreover, as Charles properly contends, the parties to an agreement are deemed to have contracted with knowledge of existing law \u2014 in this case, the law concerning federal governmental pensions \u2014 and that (unless expressly rejected as inapplicable) such law becomes a part of the contract as though it were expressly referred to and incorporated into the agreement. <em>See, e.g., Shell Oil v. Ryckman, </em>43 Md.App. 1, 8-9, 403 A.2d 379 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">As indicated above, the two simply phrased, disputed issues in this case must be resolved through the complex world of federal governmental organizational law and its corresponding OPM regulations (hereinafter, the \u201cregulations\u201d). As the record before us is silent as to whether the parties wished to reject this law as inapplicable, we therefore hold that such law applies to the agreement <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Accordingly, we may now phrase our present task more succinctly: we must determine whether the trial court erred as a matter of fact-finding when, in light of applicable law, that court found that Charles and Ivana had intended (1) to construe the phrase \u201csurvivorship rights\u201d to include <em>both </em>a Former Spouse Survivor Annuity <em>and </em>an Insurable Interest Annuity, and (2) not to calculate Ivana\u2019s survivorship annuity pursuant to the <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">We therefore begin our analysis by laying some intellectual and definitional groundwork vis-a-vis Charles\u2019 federal government retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The regulatory computation of Charles\u2019 retirement benefits begins with his so-called \u201cself-only annuity.\u201d The regulations define a self-only annuity as \u201cthe recurring payment to a retiree who has elected not to provide a survivor annuity to anyone.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.1703. A self-only annuity may be distinguished from a \u201cgross annuity,\u201d which the regulations define as \u201cthe amount of a self-only annuity <em>less only the applicable survivor reduction, but before any other reduction.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Therefore the mathematical relationship between a self-only annuity and a gross annuity is simple: a self-only annuity <em>minus </em>the applicable survivor reduction <em>equals </em>a gross annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">As is relevant here, there are two types of \u201csurvivorship\u201d annuities that incur \u201csurvivor reductions\u201d so as correspondingly to reduce a retiree\u2019s self-only annuity: these are the so-called \u201cformer spouse survivor annuity\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the so-called \u201cinsurable interest annuity.\u201d We shall discuss them respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The most basic type of survivorship annuity is the <em>former spouse survivor annuity. </em>The regulations define a former spouse survivor annuity as \u201ca recurring benefit under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>CSRS that is payable to a former spouse after the employee\u2019s, Member\u2019s or retiree\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 831.603. For our purposes, there are two significant \u201cfeatures\u201d of a former spouse survivor annuity. First, federal statutory law, and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, expressly authorize a state trial court to order payment of a former spouse survivor annuity. <em>See, e.g., </em>5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8341(h)(1) (\u201c[A] former spouse of a deceased employee ... is entitled to a [former spouse survivor annuity] if and to the extent expressly provided for ... in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree\u201d). <em>See also id. </em>\u00a7 8345(j); 5 C.F.R. 831.1704. Second, former spouse survivor annuity payments terminate under certain specified conditions. Specifically, a former spouse survivor annuity \u201cshall terminate ... no later than the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age[, or when the former spouse dies].\u201d 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8341(h)(3)(B)(i). The following regulations reinforce Congress\u2019s intentions concerning the termination of former spouse survivor annuities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">A former spouse survivor annuity or eligibility for a future former spouse survivor annuity terminates on the last day of the month before the month in which the former spouse remarries before attaining age 55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.625(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">If present or future entitlement to a former spouse survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage of the recipient or potential recipient, the entitlement is permanently extinguished. An annulment of the remarriage does not reinstate the entitlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 831.625(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">OPM will terminate a recurring payment of or a future interest in survivor annuity benefits to a former spouse whenever ... the former spouse dies [or] remarriesf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7I\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 841.908(b)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">A/current or former spouse survivor annuity under this s\u00fabpart terminates on the last day of the month before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the current or former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 843.304(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The parties hereto agree that the \u201cQDRO\u201d in the instant case properly provides that Ivana will receive a portion of Charles\u2019 retirement benefits from the date of his retirement until his death. <em>After Charles\u2019 death, </em>however, pursuant to both the \u201cQDRO\u201d and federal law, Ivana will also receive a <em>former spouse survivor annuity </em>so long as she lives and meets either of two conditions: (1) she does not remarry, or (2) she remarries after age 55. Such is the nature of a former spouse survivor annuity: it permanently terminates if the former spouse remarries <em>before </em>she turns 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the lower court, in determining what Charles and Ivana meant by the phrase \u201csurvivorship benefits,\u201d found that it was the parties\u2019 intention to grant to Ivana a former spouse survivor annuity that, pursuant to federal law and regulations, would permanently terminate if Ivana remarried before she turns 55. In construing the parties\u2019 intentions, however, the lower court also carried things a step further by finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">in the event that [Ivana] ... is precluded from receiving a Former spouse [survivor] annuity because she remarries prior to attaining age 55, it is hereby agreed that (i) [Ivana] shall be entitled to receive an <em>Insurable Interest Annuity, </em>as defined in 5 C.F.R. Section 831.603, and (ii) [Charles] hereby covenants and agrees that, upon the written request of [Ivana], he shall take whatever actions are needed to convert the Former spouse [survivor] annuity entitlement to an Insurable Interest Annuity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The regulations define an <em>insurable interest annuity </em>as \u201cthe recurring payments under CSRS [made] to a retiree who has elected a reduction in annuity to provide a survivor annuity to a person with an insurable interest in the retir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ee.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.603.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to insurable interest annuities, federal law provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">At the time of retiring under section 8336 or 8338 of this title, an employee or Member who is found to be in good health by the Office [of Personnel Management] may elect a reduced annuity instead of an annuity computed under subsections (a)-(i), (n), and (q) of this section and name in writing an individual having an insurable interest in the employee or Member to receive an annuity under section 8341(c) of this title after the death of the retired employee or Member. The annuity of the employee or Member making the election is reduced by 10 percent, and by 5 percent for each full 5 years the individual named is younger than the retiring employee or Member. However, the total reduction may not exceed 40 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8339(k)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Insurable Interest Annuities may be distinguished from Former Spouse Survivor Annuities in two relevant ways. First, unlike Former Spouse Survivor Annuities (which terminate if the former spouse remarries prior to 55 years of age), insurable interest annuities are terminated <em>only </em>upon the death of the recipient. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8341(c). Second (and more significant), the federal law relating to Insurable Interest Annuities differs materially from the law governing Former Spouse Survivor Annuities; the latter expressly authorizes payments of annuities pursuant to state court orders, while the former does not. That is, there are no federal provisions that are comparable to the above cited 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 8341(h)(1) and 8845\u00ae, and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.1704. In this regard, we find instructive 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831, Subpart Q, Appendix B (\u201cGuidelines for Interpreting State Court Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ders Awarding Survivor Annuity Benefits to Former Spouses\u201d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>. This section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">Two types of potential survivor annuities may be provided by retiring employees to cover former spouses. [5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8341(h) ] provides for \u201cformer spouse [surviv- or] annuities.\u201d [M \u00a7 8339(k)] provides for \u201cinsurable interest annuities.\u201d These are distinct benefits, each with its own advantages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">A. OPM <em>will </em>enforce State court orders to provide section 8341(h) annuities. These annuities are less expensive and have fewer restrictions than insurable interest annuities but the former spouse\u2019s interest will automatically terminate upon remarriage before age 55. To provide a section 8341(h) annuity, the [state court] order must use terms such as \u201cformer spouse [survivor] annuity,\u201d \u201csection 8341(h) annuity,\u201d or \u201csurvivor annuity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">B. OPM <em>will not </em>enforce State court orders to provide \u201cinsurable interest annuities\u201d under section 8339(k). These annuities may only be elected at the time of retirement by a retiring employee who is not retiring under the disability provision of the law and who is in good health. The retiree may also elect to cancel the insurable interest annuity to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">There is one other regulatory section that may directly bear on the division of Charles\u2019 pension benefits. That section, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.606 (\u201cElection of Insurable Interest Annuity\u201d), states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>A retiring employee or Member may not elect ... to provide a former spouse [survivor! annuity and an insurable interest annuity to benefit the same former spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 831.606(5)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Above, we have set forth the intellectual and definitional groundwork vis-a-vis Charles\u2019 federal government retirement benefits; we now return to the facts of the case <em>sub judice. </em>As discussed above, we are asked to interpret the parties\u2019 stipulation that was read into the record on August 15, 1989. That stipulation makes no reference to either a Former Spouse Survivor Annuity or an Insurable Interest Annuity; the stipulation merely (and vaguely) refers to \u201csurvivorship benefits,\u201d \u201csurvivorship rights,\u201d and the \u201cbank\u2019s [sic] formula.\u201d As we also mentioned above, an Insurable Interest Annuity can only be elected at the time of retirement, requires the participant to pass a physical exam, and \u2014 most significantly \u2014 a state court order regarding it will not be honored or enforced by OPM.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Moreover, since an Insurable Interest Annuity may only be elected at the time of retirement, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.606(d), if Charles retires before Ivana reaches age 55, and if at that time Ivana has not yet remarried, then Charles \u2014 to protect himself from exposure to liability<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 would be in the position of having to elect <em>both </em>types of annuities, despite such an action being contrary both to federal regulations <em>(see, e.g., </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.606(5)(i)) and to the lower court\u2019s \u201cQDRO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AA-\">Considering the paucity of testimony in the record, when measured in the light of applicable law, the record does not provide sufficient evidence to enable the lower court to have ordered Charles to provide to Ivana an Insurable Interest Annuity as an alternative contingency to Ivana\u2019s being precluded from receiving a Former Spouse Survivor Annui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ty because she remarries prior to attaining age 55. Consequently, the lower court erred in awarding Ivana an interest in both types of annuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>The Bangs\u2019 Formula</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">As discussed above, it is undisputed that the parties intended both the retirement annuity and the \u201csurvivor-ship\u201d benefits payable to Ivana to be computed in accordance with the so-called <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula, <em>i.e., </em>the formula set forth in <em>Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. at 350, 475 A.2d 1214.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula computes the spouse\u2019s share of the participant\u2019s pension as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">[The spouse in <em>Bangs </em>was awarded] a future sum or sums of money equal to a fractional share of [the participant\u2019s] retirement pension if, as and when he receives it. The fractional share payable to [the spouse] out of each pension payment [that the spouse] receives is: one-half of a fraction of which the number of years and months of the marriage ... is the numerator and the total number of years and months of employment credited toward retirement is the denominator:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">1 years and months of marriage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">2 x total years of employment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">[computed in months]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-12\"><em>Id., </em>59 Md.App. at 356, 475 A.2d 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">The record clearly reflects that the parties agreed that the numerator of the above fraction would be 246.466 months. Accordingly, we hold that Ivana shall be entitled to a fractional share of both (1) Charles\u2019 pension if, as and when he receives it, and (2) the appropriate survivor annuity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>benefits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pursuant to the <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula, the fractional share payable to Ivana out of each of Charles\u2019 pension and/or survivor annuity payments may be stated as follows: one-half of the total monthly payment to which Charles (or his survivor beneficiaries) may be from time to time entitled, multiplied by a fraction of which 246.466 is the numerator and the total number of years and months of employment credited toward Charles\u2019 retirement is the denominator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">1 _246.466_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">2 x total months of employment</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">To the degree that the lower court deviated from this formula, it erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">DIRECTIONS ON REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">In accordance with this opinion, we remand this case to the circuit court for reconsideration of a single issue, to wit: the circuit court should conduct a hearing for the limited purpose of permitting the parties to produce evidence of their intent in granting \u201csurvivorship\u201d benefits in Charles\u2019 pension to Ivana. In determining the parties\u2019 intent, the circuit court should <em>carefully </em>consider the limitations imposed by the federal government on a state court\u2019s power to pass an order affecting a Former Spouse Survivor Annuity and/or an Insurable Interest Annuity. Moreover, and also in accordance with the text of this opinion, once the circuit court determines the <em>type </em>of survivorship benefit that the parties intended to bestow on Ivana, that court shall compute Ivana\u2019s share of Charles\u2019 pension benefits pursuant to the <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula as set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Finally, we call to the trial court\u2019s attention the fact that OPM has recently revised its regulations regarding state court orders that affect retirement benefits. <em>See 5 </em>C.F.R. Parts 831, 838, 841-43. The new regulations are designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>to \u201cmake it easier for people to submit orders that will be acceptable to OPM.\u201d <em>See </em>57 Fed.Reg. 120 (1992). The new regulations, however, clearly specify that \u201c[t]he [state] court is also responsible for issuing orders that conform to the statutory and regulatory requirements.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 122. In that regard, we call the circuit court\u2019s particular attention to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.302 which \u201cclarifies that court orders that contain language that make it impossible for [OPM] to process the court order while maintaining [their] ministerial role are not acceptable for processing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124. In particular, section 838.302(a) defines as unprocessable all court orders labeled \u201cqualified domestic relations order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\">. We note that, in designating its order as a \u201cQualified Domestic Relations Order,\u201d [a \"QDRO\u201d] the trial court engaged in a common, but unacceptable (to the federal government) practice. Properly used, the term \u201cQDRO\" describes an order issued by a state trial court under the Employees Retirement Income Security Act [\"ERISA\u201d], 29 U.S.C.A. 1001 <em>et seq. </em>The order in the case <em>sub judice </em>does <em>not </em>involve benefits under ERISA, but rather it involves benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System [\"CSRS\u201d], and hence it should not have been designated as a QDRO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\">. The term \"participant\" is used herein to describe a retiree from federal employment who participates in the CSRS pension system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b123-12\">. It is undisputed that Mr. Fiechtner was referring to the formula set forth in <em>Bangs v. Bangs, 59 </em>Md.App. 350, 475 A.2d 1214 (1984) (hereinafter, the <em>\u201cBangs\u2019 </em>formula\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b124-10\">. The phrase \u201cQualified Domestic Relations Order\" [\u201cQDRO\u201d], as explained in footnote 1, above, was actually being used incorrectly. Nevertheless, the trial court used the phrase to refer to the OPM procedural requirement that, before a former spouse is entitled to a portion of a federal employee\u2019s retirement benefits, the precise terms of the former spouse\u2019s interest in those benefits must be set forth in a \u201cqualifying [state] court order.\u201d <em>See </em>5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 831.603, 831.1704. Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s misuse of the phrase, when we refer to the trial court\u2019s order, we shall nevertheless (and for the sake of consistency) refer to it as a \u201cQDRO.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">. The \u201cformer spouse <em>survivor </em>annuity\u201d has in the past been referred to simply as a \u201cformer spouse annuity.\u201d It is also sometimes referred to as the \"survivor annuity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">. The \"reduction in annuity,\" as such may apply to the instant case (i.e., assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the parties had agreed to provide an insurable interest annuity to Ivana), refers to the reduction in Charles\u2019 and Ivana\u2019s \"gross annuity\u201d benefits that will be paid to the parties from the time that Charles retires until his death. In other words, had the parties elected to provide to Ivana an insurable interest annuity, then, correspondingly, both of their \"standard\" (post-retirement, preCharles\u2019 death) pension benefits would be accordingly reduced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b131-10\">. The introduction to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831, Subpart Q, Appendix B states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">These guidelines explain the interpretation that [OPM] will place on terms and phrases frequently used in awarding survivor benefits. These guidelines are intended not only for the use of OPM, but also for the legal community as a whole, with the hope that by informing attorneys, in advance, about the manner in which OPM will interpret terms written into court orders, the resulting orders will be more carefully drafted, using the proper language to accomplish the aims of the court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">. Pursuant to the QDRO, Charles covenanted that he shall take whatever actions are needed to convert the Former Spouse Annuity entitlement to an Insurable Interest Annuity. It is beyond dispute that therefore Charles must elect the Insurable Interest Annuity at the time of his retirement in order to comply with the QDRO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b133-14\">. As indicated above, the record reflects that Mr. Fiechtner, as counsel for Ivana, indicated that Ivana\u2019s interest in Charles\u2019 pension would be computed under the \"bank\u2019s formula.\u201d At the September 19, 1991 hearing on the wording of the QDRO, counsel for Charles contended, without objection from Ivana\u2019s counsel, that the parties\u2019 clearly were referring to the <em>Bangs\u2019 </em>formula. (E. 31, 33-42.) We accept that contention, and thus are compelled to apply that formula here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b134-11\">.
