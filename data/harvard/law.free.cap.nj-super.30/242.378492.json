J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A2U\">By this action, the executor under the will of Angelica Celia laid before the court for construction and instructions, the residuary paragraph of her will, reading thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">\u2018'I give, devise and bequeath all of the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal or mixed, wheresoever situate, whereof I may die seized or possessed to such Catholic Home for the Aged in the Town of Uldine in Finili, Italy, as selected by the Pope, to have and to hold the same to its own use forever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The parties stipulate that testatrix meant thereby to make reference to the Town of Udine in Friuli, Italy. In that town there is a Catholic home for old and invalided priests, and the Pope selected it. The selection was sustained by the trial court, and the heirs and next of kin appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">We have here a single constructional question. What was it testatrix meant by the words \u201csuch Catholic Home for the Aged\u201d? Appellants take the position that since \u201caged\u201d signifies \u201caged people,\u201d testatrix, therefore, meant to confine the gift to that kind of Catholic home in Udine which is \u201cdedicated to the care of old persons of all walks of life\u201d; this, so appellants say, was the class of homes from which the selection was to be made. There is no such home in that town, indeed no Catholic home for the aged of any sort other than the home for the priests above spoken of. In pursuance of their argument, appellants are obliged to say that the Pope\u2019s power of appointment was so curcumseribed he could not have selected, let us say, a Catholic home for aged farmers, had there been such a home in Udine. However, we think the language of the will, taking it in its natural import, does not admit of the construction contended for. There are no words of restriction in the clause, and it seems to us that by the very force of its terms, the will has reference to any Catholic home for the aged, comprehending therefore not only a home for aged men and women of every sort, but as well a home for aged women, a home for aged mechanics and a home for aged priests.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Appellants seek to support their position by proof of what testatrix had to say to the scrivener when she gave him instructions for the will. According to that proof, she wanted her residuary estate to go \u201cto a Catholic home for the old people in her old home village or town\u201d- \u2014 or, as stated at another point, to limit the gift to the old people <em>\u201cfrom </em>her home village <em>Pozzuolo </em>and Udine.\u201d Eurther, so these instructions went, she certainly \u2014 -\u201coh definitely\u201d \u2014 desired to benefit not \u201cany specific group of aged persons such as old doctors or priests,\u201d but \u201cold people * * * without limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>tation.\u201d Counsel for the Pope and the homo for the priests say that this testimony is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The principles involved here were comprehensively laid out in the recent opinion of <em>In re Armour\u2019s Estate, </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>257 (1953). The law\u2014both the statute of wills (N. <em>J. S. </em>3A:3-2) and the parol evidence rule \u2014 forbids any proof of extrinsic utterances of a testator stating what lie intends, or had intended, to provide by his will. <em>In re Armour, supra, </em>9 <em>Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed.), </em>\u00a7 2471; <em>Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence, </em>396, 444, 482 (1898)\u2014an \u201cepoch-making\u201d work <em>(Hughes v. Atlantic City </em>&amp; <em>S. R. R. Co., </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>212, 216 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914)). \u201cDirect statements of intention,\u201d <em>Thayer </em>(see <em>supra, e. g., </em>440) called them for short. Statements of the testator, not of the forbidden sort, are sometimes designated as \u201coblique\u201d <em>(Warren, Interpretation of Wills, </em>49 <em>Harv. L. Rev. </em>689, 708 (1936)) ; it may be clarifying to add, by way of example, that they include declarations showing an habitual usage, in a nontestanientary connection, of words found in the will. <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 2467, 2471 (first paragraph).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"> To this general rule holding direct statements of intention inadmissible, there is at least one recognized exception. namely, \u201cwhere there are two or more persons or things, each answering exactly to the person or thing described in the will.\u201d <em>Griscom v. Evens, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>402, 407 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1878), affirmed 42 <em>N. J. L. </em>579 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1880); see <em>In re Armour\u2019s Estate, </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>257, 280 (1953), <em>supra </em>(the first class of latent ambiguities). Cairns, as Lord Chancellor, stated this (as did Thayer, <em>supra, p. </em>482) to be the only exception, namely (as Cairns phrased it), where the description is \u201cequally applicable in all its parts\u201d to more than one person or thing. <em>Charter v. Charter, L. R. </em>7 <em>E. &amp; I. App. </em>364, 377 <em>(House of Lords </em>1874). We are not called upon here to consider the validity of the distinction often taken between a patent and latent ambiguity <em>(Thayer, supra, p. </em>424; <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 2472\u20143), first stated in <em>Bacon\u2019s Maxim </em>XXV (numbered XXIII in some editions) which, however, was designed as a rule, not of evidence, but of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>pleading <em>(Thayer, supra, p. </em>425, 472); nor need we pass upon the effect of a blank space in a will or upon cases of a quite similar sort <em>(Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 2473; see <em>Clayton v. Lord Nugent, </em>13 <em>M. </em>&amp; <em>W. </em>200, 153 <em>Eng. Rep. </em>83 (1844), commented on in <em>Wigmore, </em>\u00a7 2467).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Wigmore argues for a second exception to the general rule above stated, and gives some countenance to a third exception. The second exception is said to arise where (as Professor Warren puts it) a description applies \u201cequally but not precisely to two or more\u201d persons or things <em>(Commercial Trust Co. v. Heintz, </em>98 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>15 <em>(Ch. </em>1925), affirmed 99 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>411 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1925)), or, at any event, where a description applies in part to two or more objects <em>(cf. Van Nostrand v. Board of Domestic Missions of Reformed Church in America, </em>59 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>19, 22 <em>(Ch. </em>1899)). <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 2472; <em>Warren, supra, p. </em>711; see <em>Thayer, supra, p. </em>479.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The third exception stands in an aura of dicta and doubt, opening the door still wider to let in direct statements of intention in the ease of any misdescription. This exception may be said to arise where the words cannot apply hut to one object, but they do not even apply to it accurately; or where (as stated in <em>Hand v. Hoffman, </em>8 <em>N. J. L. </em>71 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1825)), the application of words to extraneous things \u201cis found impracticable.\u201d We need not consider here those equivocations and uncertainties in language which cannot be termed descriptions of persons or things <em>(Warren, supra, p. </em>712).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">This third exception comprises the second class of latent ambiguities, as stated in <em>Miller v. Travers, </em>8 <em>Bing. </em>244, 131 <em>Eng. Rep. </em>395 <em>(Ct. C. P. </em>1832), quoted at length in <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 2474 (on the other hand <em>Wigmore </em>can be cited as being against this third exception. See \u00a7 2476 (2)) and in part in <em>In re Armour\u2019s Estate, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>280. But <em>Miller v. Travers </em>(and the same is true as to <em>Hand v. Hoffman, supra) </em>did not, as <em>Thayer, supra, p. </em>480, has pointed out, discriminate between direct statements of intention (involving the important policies underlying the statute of wills and the parol evidence rule) and other extrinsic evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>including oblique statements and proof of surrounding circumstances, which in the present century is not regarded with the disfavor in which it once was held (the history of the law as to extrinsic evidence, other than direct statements of intention, is stated in <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 2470, more concisely than in <em>Thayer).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The declarations of testatrix to the scrivener here, consisting, as they plainly do, of direct statements of intention, are banned by the general rule, unless they can be made to fall within some exception to the rule. To that end we have endeavored to lay out in a comprehensive fashion all exceptions for which there is some authority. Plainly, neither the first exception, nor the second is pertinent here; it is not suggested that the words of the will here apply to two or more objects even in part. Nor is the third exception pertinent; as we have said, we think the words here are applicable \u201cin all their parts\u201d (to use Lord Cairns\u2019 words) to the home for aged and invalided priests. So, without passing on the validity of any exception suggested, we conclude that the testimony stated is inadmissible. <em>In re Armour\u2019s Estate, </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>257, 280 (1953), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The question as to the admissibility of this testimony is discussed in the briefs; but the circumstance that no objection was taken below as to the matter of admissibility is passed by counsel, and lienee we shall do likewise. See further <em>R. R. </em>1:5-3 (c); also see <em>R. Krevolin &amp; Co. v. Brown, </em>20 <em>N. J. Super. </em>85, 92 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">It is said that in the home appointed by the Pope to take under the will, young invalided priests as well as old priests might be admitted. What difference this would make we need not decide, for the proofs indicate the contrary. The only basis for the assertion is to be found in a translation of some stories from Italian newspapers in 1931 received in evidence, stating the purposes for which the home was intended when it was opened then. The proof as to the matter appearing in a document dated 1953 is much more cogent; thereby it appears that \u201cthe exclusive purpose [of the home] is to shelter priests who are old and invalided.\u201d In our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>view, this establishes, so far as the record goes, that only old priests who are invalided would be admitted to the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The appointment, we find, was made to a home embraced within the terms of the will. We therefore need not deal with the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
