A citation having issued to Hickman as guardian, the account was referred to auditors on exceptions, who reported the testimony, and that the ward was barred by a release.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-10\">The account admitted receipts, in 1831, of $450; in 1889, of sums of $50, $75, and $100 ; on these there was allowed, as interest, $235, a settlement having been made in 1844.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-11\">It was proved that the ward was of age in 1841, and had resided in Mercer county. In 1844 he procured a release to his guardian, to be prepared, saying he had settled, or was going to settle. He called on his guardian, who stated the sums received, but that he had all the money out; that he could and did not wish to pay more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>interest than he had' received. The ward said, if he did not get interest, he did not expect him to pay interest. The balance admitted to be due was then paid, and the release delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\">The other facts mentioned in the opinion of the court below wore not on the paper book.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">Bell, P. J., overruled the report, so far as related to the release, saying, \u201c The guardian having answered the command of the citation, by filing an account of his administration of the ward\u2019s estate, it may well be doubted whether, upon exceptions filed to that account, he can- set up the receipt and release signed by Nelson, the ward, on the- 10th of April, 1844, as a bar to all investigation into the truth and correctness of the account; or use it-for any other purpose than as <em>prima facie </em>evidence, so far as it goes, of the true amount' in- his; hands at a particular day. If he intended to use it as'-a-bar to the call-of his late ward,-for an account, it seems to me he should have so pleaded it, and thus presented the question, whether it precluded the ward from having- the kind of settlement-the'law contemplates and-allows; as between'; guardian and- ward. One of'the reasons, and perhaps'the-principal one, for allowing it the quality of abar, is-that the guardian, relying'on the settlement <em>in </em>pais, and the consequent release-' and discharge, has either handed-over-his papers and vouchers relating to the trust,- or in the lapse of time lost them, and so is unable to state-a formal account. But how can this be averred, where the' guardian has, on the return of the citation issued out of this court;, actually' stated and settled am account into which is introduced every item of-debit and credit' which, on his- own' showing, has any relation to5 the trust ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">\u201cBut had the paper' which the auditors were prevailed on- to accept, as'possessing a'legal quality which forbid all examination into the account, been pleaded in bar, I should have- thought; it insufficient-to close the mouth of- the late-ward,-upon-the principles recognised and settled-in' Say\u2019s- Executors' <em>v. </em>Barnes; 4 SergJ &amp; Rawle, 112; every one of which are, as it appears to me, directly applicable to this case. Nor is there any thing said or'decided in-Ex parte Cress, 2 Whart. 494, or Lukens\u2019 Appeal, Y Watts &amp; Serg. 48, both of which were determined upon peculiar circumstances, having no existence here, that- interferes to- prevent this applicability. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">\u201c This being so, it follows that we are at liberty to examine into and- correct this account, just as though- no sitch release bad- been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>executed by the ward to the guardian; allowing to it only whatever force may belong to it as evidence, if any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZ7\">\u201c The correctness of this conclusion is in no way impugned by the remark said to have fallen from the ward, at the time of his settlement with the guardian, that if the latter had not received interest, he, the ward, would not exact it from him. It is evident this remark was made by the party in ignorance of his legal rights, and partly in reference to a sum of money loaned, as it would seem, by the guardian to one of his sons, and of which we have no further account than that it is not known whether the son had repaid it, principal and interest, or not. Neither is any account given of its amount, or the terms upon which, or the circumstances under which, it was loaned. The remark of the ward seems also to have reference to the assertion of the guardian at the time of the settlement, that \u00a3 he had the money out at interest, all he could get out, and he did not like to pay him interest for that which he had not out.\u2019 If by this the guardian intended to say he could not keep the money at interest, it is difficult to conceive this could be strictly true. There are sums of money paid to the guardian sufficiently large to be put to interest, which he knew were to remain in his hands for years. That it would have been easy, by the exercise of an ordinary diligence, to find safe investments for these sums, cannot be doubted. At least, it ought to require more than the mere assertion of the guardian to show this could not <em>be done. </em>The facile acceptance by a ward, unacquainted with his affairs, of this excuse, must not be taken as proof of its truth; \u2022 and as the settlement and release were unquestionably founded upon it, no great weight is due to them. Upon such vague and uncertain grounds as these, unsupported by any thing deserving the name of proof, it would be obviously unjust to release the guardian from the duty he assumed, when he undertook the trust, of putting the estate of his ward to the best uses, and making interest thereon, or show some satisfactory reason why he did not. This is the duty of every guardian, and courts hold him to a strict responsibility in its discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">\u00a3\u00a3 In the present case it appears, from the guardian\u2019s own account, that for Nelson he received at several times divers sums-of money, amounting in the aggregate to $675, which remained in his hands or at interest, uncalled for, during a series of years, \u2014 and indeed during the whole minority of the ward, who lived in a distant county during this period, and, as it would seem, supported him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>self. Allowing a liberal time, in the average six months after their receipt, for putting the respective sums to interest, (and it has not been shown but that they were making interest during the whole period,) and charging it up to the 10th of April, 1844, the date of the settlement and release set up by the accountant, it amounts in the aggregate to $444; calculating the interest on the Baldwin loan at five per cent.,- and charging the guardian with the amount of interest which Baldwin swore he actually paid him. And yet in the account settled the guardian charges himself with but $235 56J of interest. In' the absence of all explanation, \u25a0 this cannot be permitted. The difference, to wit, the sum of $208 43J; is, therefore, to be added to the debit side of his account. Decreed accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-4\">Tilghman, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG0\">The release was voluntary after a settlement with the ward, who was twenty-four years of age, and in which it is not pretended any thing was concealed, and is therefore a bar.
