J., dismissed the petition for the following reasons. This office of the trust is to be executed by the \u201c said Samuel Badger, my executor and trusteeand it cannot well be doubted that, if he had refused before the register to take letters testamentary, his competency to execute said office would have continued unimpaired, it not being annexed to that of executor, as is the duty of seeing to assets, and paying debts and legacies. Taking the legal title for devisees, making partition between them, and vesting in them the fee by proper assurances, are not duties that devolve on the executor by operation of law, but may be performed by any one whom the testator may appoint for that purpose. And when he appoints the person by his proper /name, whom he also makes the executor of his will, the trust is given <em>nominatim, </em>and continues, though he refuse the office of executor; Ebert and Barnitz\u2019s Appeal, 9 Watts, 300. Necessarily, it is not vested <em>ratione officii </em>in the executor; and, in such case, the jurisdiction of the trust is in the Common Pleas. Here, Samuel Badger is made trustee by name, and it can make no difference that his name and the titles of his several offices are coupled, when his duties are assigned him in the will, that being done merely for further description of the person intended. Besides, holding that to be of importance, in reference to this will, must lead to confusion, instead of a clear construction; since, in the event of an agreement to that effect, between him and the devisees, on the 1st of March, 1845, the estate is to be sold by the <em>\u201c </em>executor\u201d simply, both the name of Samuel Badger and the title of trustee being there dropped. To this the case of Rachel Stuart\u2019s Will, 1 Watts &amp; Serg. 288, may be added, which is similar in describing the trustee, who is not amenable to the Orphans\u2019 Court as executor. That testatrix gave to her son, William Johnson, her estate in trust, for the separate use of her daughter, El. Baird, and authorized him, \u201c <em>as executor,\u201d </em>to sell it, and put the proceeds \u201c to interest for the uses aforesaid.\u201d E. Baird was the only beneficiary named in this clause, and the only use expressed was for her; yet, on this clause, the subsequent part of the will, which gives the estate over to her children,in fee, being excluded from the consideration of the court, it is held that the trust was not annexed to the office of executor, though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>person to convert the estate is so described, but was vested in William Johnson, <em>nominatim. </em>Consequently, the Common Pleas had. jurisdiction of the case. The -word \u201c executor\u201d is of course but <em>descriptio personae, </em>the more pointedly to designate the trustee appointed as such. It follows that here the petitioner must seek relief in the Common Pleas, and the citation must be dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-4\">G. <em>B. Browne, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APg\">The cas'es of trusts in executors, either by the words of the will, -or by operation of law, are excepted out of the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas, by the act of 1886. The two functions are blended in this will, and the estate is not to him in fee, but to his executors. The power to sell is also given to him as executor, as well as trustee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-5\">Badger, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhqY\">The answer to the inquiry whether a dismissal from the office of executor would remove him as trustee, solves this question. It is settled, in this state, that the office of trustee and executor cannot be blended together; Aston\u2019s Estate, 5 Whart. <em>288; </em>for they are essentially distinct; Baird\u2019s Case, 1 Watts &amp; Serg. 288. It is very clear that the trusteeship is not given to him under the name of executor, but <em>nominatim, </em>and this has been uniformly recognised as the distinction.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b461-6\"><em>April </em>24.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AoZ\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_U\">It follows not that, because a trust has been created by will, it is cognisable in the Orphans\u2019 Court. To give it that quality, it must be annexed to the office, and not to the person of the executor; it must be committed to him <em>quasi </em>executor, and performed <em>virtute officii. </em>Was it so here? \u201cI do constitute and appoint my brother, Samuel Badger,\u201d said the testator, \u201c to be the sole executor of this, my last will and testament, and the trustee of my estate, and request him to make payment of the above legacies.\u201d I-Ie then devised to his \u201cexecutor and trustee, Samuel Badger,\u201d all his estate, real and personal, in trust to improve it, erect buildings, make repairs, lease or sell such parts of it as he might think advisable, pay expenses from the profits, discharge debts and encumbrances, and, at an appointed or convenient time, divide and distribute the whole among particular persons, and in particular proportions. The constituting clause, however, is that which gives tone to tho rest. The person who was appointed executor was, with the same breath, appointed a trustee for purposes not within the range of an executor\u2019s ordinary duties; and distinct offices were united in the same person, which, howev\u00e9r, have no natural connection, and are easily s\u00e9parable. Had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>trust been committed to tbe executor designated as tbe trustee, by bis official title, and not by name, that would have been impossible; but tbe only difficulty in tbe way, at present, is, that tbe same Samuel Badger who was directed as executor and trustee to pay' tbe legacies, a strictly administrative duty, was directed as executor and trustee to do acts exclusively of a fiduciary nature. It would be as absurd for a trustee to attempt tbe duties of an executor, as for an executor to attempt tbe duties of a trustee, and it is therefore tbe business of tbe court to separate tbe two offices, in a question like tbe present, <em>reddendo singula singulis. As executor, </em>he was to pay tbe legacies; as trustee, be was tbe devisee and depositary of tbe legal title for tbe accomplishment of confidential purposes, with which tbe office of an executor has no necessary connection. Had not tbe creation of tbe two offices in tbe same person been coupled also in tbe same clause, there would not have been a doubt of their severance in tbe contemplation of tbe testator ; tbe will would have presented tbe union of distinct rights in the same person, which are always treated as if they existed in different persons. Perhaps tbe only case in which there is an inseparable union, is where tbe trust is given to tbe executor by tbe style of bis office, and not by bis name; where it is given to tbe officer, and not to tbe man. Had tbe testator intended to blend the two offices, it would have been unnecessary to say any thing about a trustee, for bis object would have been gained by appointing an executor, and devolving tbe trust upon him. He evidently knew that there is a distinction between tbe proper acts of an executor and those of a trustee, and seems to have been determined to preserve it, which is all that was necessary to confer jurisdiction on tbe Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
