Case for malicious prosecution. Under a rule by defendant, arbitrators were chosen. The plaintiff agreed to rest his cas.e on the proof of a warrant and arrest and discharge by the justice, without proof of malice, want of probable cause, or damage. On award filed, defendant excepted to the decision on the point of law; this was dismissed, and judgment entered on the award. The errors assigned were in the decision by the arbitrators of the point submitted, and the entry of judgment by the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-10\"><em>Deford, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aat\">The plaintiff virtually abandoned his cause by his admission, and the error is upon the face of the record: 1 Saund. 230; 2 Stark.

The present is, in effect, a writ of error to the arbitrators; for the errors assigned are theirs, and not the errors of the court. But we can reverse only for error in the judgment \u2014 not in the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
