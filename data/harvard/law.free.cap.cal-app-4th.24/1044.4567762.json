Following denial of his motion to withdraw his plea, he was sentenced to an aggregate prison term exceeding six years, thereby rendering him ineligible for a CRC commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s primary contention he should have been permitted to withdraw his plea on the ground he was misinformed by the court and counsel about the likelihood of a CRC commitment. In the published portion of this opinion, we also reject his contention Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 859a requires the same judge who took the plea, as opposed to the same court, to hear a motion to withdraw the plea. And we hold defendant waived objection to imposition of a restitution fine by failing to raise the issue at or before sentencing. However, we agree with his final contention he was entitled to an additional three days of presentence custody credits. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in all respects save the matter of custody credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Factual and Procedural History<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">1., 2.\u2020</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">3. <em>Section 859a\u2014Motion to withdraw the plea heard and determined by a different judge than the one who accepted the plea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Defendant\u2019s change of plea was taken in municipal court on August 7, 1992, by Judge Scott, a visiting judge who apparently was no longer assigned to that court on October 30 when defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea was set to be heard. The motion was heard instead by Judge Castellucci. At the outset of the hearing, defendant, citing section 859a, argued his motion must be heard by Judge Scott. However, Judge Castellucci <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>concluded the statute requires only that the motion be heard by the same court and not necessarily by the same judge who took the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Section 859a generally provides that a defendant who has entered a plea of not guilty before a magistrate<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> may thereafter change his plea to guilty or nolo contendere. In that event, the magistrate must certify the case to the superior court where such proceedings \u201cshall be had as if the defendant had pleaded guilty in that court.\u201d The section then goes on to provide in part: \u201cIf the defendant subsequently files a written motion to withdraw the plea under Section 1018, the motion shall be heard and determined by <em>the court </em>before which the plea was entered.\u201d (Italics added.)  Defendant asserts on appeal, as he did below, this language requires a motion to withdraw a plea to be heard by the same <em>judge </em>who took the plea. Therefore, he argues, the matter must be remanded so Judge Scott can hear the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Defendant relies entirely on dictum by this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mesa </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 58 [219 Cal.Rptr. 720]. The defendant in <em>Mesa, </em>pursuant to a plea bargain, pleaded guilty before a magistrate, and the matter was certified to the superior court. Prior to sentencing, the defendant orally moved to withdraw his plea. The court, however, found there was no good cause for withdrawal and declined to remand the matter to the lower court. The defendant, citing section 859a, contended on appeal the court had exceeded its jurisdiction by failing to remand the case. (174 Cal.App.3d at pp. 59-60.) In affirming the judgment, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">\u201cThe legislative history[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] of this statutory requirement demonstrates that the legislative purpose of the provision is to require the motion to withdraw a plea to be heard by the judge who accepted the plea and is therefore most familiar with the circumstances. However, by the clear and unequivocal wording of the statute, the obligation to refer the motion to withdraw to the judge who accepted the plea is conditioned upon <em>written </em>motion. (\u2018If the defendant subsequently files a written motion to withdraw the plea ....\u2019)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">\u201cAssuming arguendo there may be some circumstances under which a court would be justified in acting on an oral motion to withdraw a plea, nothing in the facts of this case favors such a course. Most importantly, the record demonstrates that defendant was not prejudiced by the superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>court\u2019s failure to refer the defendant\u2019s motion to the municipal court.\u201d (174 Cal.App.3d at p. 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Thus, our decision in <em>Mesa </em>was based on the defendant\u2019s failure to file a written motion to withdraw his plea, not on a resolution of the question presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Section 859a refers to the \u201cmagistrate\u201d who takes a defendant\u2019s guilty or nolo contendere plea, but requires only that a subsequent motion to withdraw the plea must be heard by the same \u201ccourt.\u201d Clearly, if the Legislature had intended to require the same magistrate to hear the motion, it easily could have said so. (Compare, e.g., section 661 of the Code of Civil Procedure [a motion for new trial shall be heard by the <em>judge </em>who presided at the trial unless he or she is absent or unable to act] with section 663 of the same code [a judgment may be vacated by the same <em>court </em>in which the trial was held].) Although it may be desirable in most cases for the same magistrate to hear the motion, nothing in the language of section 859a requires that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In holding that a judge may not retain jurisdiction in himself or herself during the period of a defendant\u2019s probation, the Supreme Court has stated: \u201cAn individual judge (as distinguished from a court) is not empowered to retain jurisdiction of a cause. The cause is before the court, not the individual judge of that court, and the jurisdiction which the judge exercises is the jurisdiction of the court, not of the judge. Rules of court which provide that posttrial proceedings in a cause shall be heard by the judge who tried the matter are entirely proper, but the individual judge cannot order that such proceedings must be heard by him.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Osslo </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 75, 104 [323 P.2d 397]; see also 2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) \u00a7 50, Courts, p. 65.)  This rule applies equally well to the present situation absent clear statutory language requiring a particular judge to hear defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In addition, a construction of section 859a which requires the same magistrate who took the change of plea to hear the motion to withdraw it would obstruct the efficient operation of the courts where, as evidently was the case here, the magistrate is not available to hear the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In determining legislative intent, the court must look first to the words of the statute themselves; when the language is clear and unambiguous, statutory construction is unnecessary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1007 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].) Nothing in the language of section 859a suggests the Legislature intended \u201cthe court\u201d to be given the narrow construction urged by defendant. Section 859a should be interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>to mean no more than what it plainly says: a motion to withdraw a guilty or nolo contendere plea shall be heard and determined by <em>the court </em>before which the plea was entered. This requirement was satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">4., 5.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The cause is remanded to the superior court with instructions to modify the abstract of judgment to reflect that appellant is entitled to an additional three days of presentence custody credits.
