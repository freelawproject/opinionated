J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"ANY\">A jury convicted the defendant of a number of sexual offenses (which we need not detail) and kidnapping for the purpose of committing rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 207, subd. (a); 208, subd. (d); undesignated section references are to this code). The jury also sustained numerous firearm enhancements. Sentenced to state prison, the defendant disputes not the acts of which he was convicted so much as their legal significance. In the published portion of the opinion we hold that section 289, subdivision (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>(penetration by foreign object), contemplates the punishment of a defendant who forces a victim to penetrate the victim\u2019s <em>own </em>anus or genitals. Finding no error, we shall affirm the judgment in its entirety.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Rather than set out a separate statement of facts, we will incorporate the relevant portions of the victim\u2019s testimony in the Discussion (this being the only testimony relating to the nature of the crimes). To provide an overview, the victim had made the defendant\u2019s acquaintance for the first time during a late night of socializing in Alturas with her boyfriend and others.The crimes took place after the defendant intercepted her on the highway as she drove home.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">I. <em>Sufficiency of kidnapping evidence</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">II. <em>Penetration by foreign object</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">After the first asportation, the defendant spread a blanket on the ground. While undressing, he directed the victim at gunpoint to lie down on the blanket, insert two fingers of one hand in her vagina, and a finger from her other hand in her anus.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">On appeal, the defendant argues this testimony does not establish penetration by a foreign object (\u00a7 289, subd. (a)), the crimes of which the jury convicted him in counts two and three. In his view, the statute, which provides, \u201cEvery person who causes the penetration, however, slight, of the genital or anal openings of any person or causes another person to so penetrate the defendant\u2019s or another person\u2019s genital or anal openings for the purpose of sexual arousal ... by any foreign object . . . when the act is accomplished against the victim\u2019s will . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>does not contemplate the punishment of a defendant who forces a victim to penetrate the victim\u2019s <em>own </em>anus or genitals. To quote the key to his novel assertion, \u201cClearly, a person\u2019s finger cannot be foreign to that person.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also relies on subdivision (m) of the statute, which provides: \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018victim\u2019 includes any person who the defendant causes to penetrate the genital or anal openings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>the defendant or another person or whose genital or anal openings are caused to be penetrated by the defendant or another person and who otherwise qualifies as a victim under the requirements of this section.\u201d (\u00a7 289, subd. (m).) He concludes by noting that acts such as those alleged here would not generally go unpunished, because they are proscribed by the sexual battery statute (\u00a7 243.4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, he points out that section 243.4 is not a lesser included offense of section 289, so this court\u2019s course must be to reverse counts 2 and 3, not reduce the gravity of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The defendant\u2019s first premise places too restrictive a definition upon the word \u201cforeign.\u201d  It is true that on the one hand the common dictionary definition refers to something \u201crelating to, or proceeding from some other person . . . than the one under consideration.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Diet. (9th ed. 1983) p. 483.) However, the common definition also embraces the meaning of something \u201coccurring in an abnormal situation in the living body and often introduced from outside.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Attempting to adhere to a delicacy of expression, we confine ourselves to the comment that one\u2019s finger is not naturally found within one\u2019s orifices. Nor does this result in an \u201cambiguity\u201d to be resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor. The Legislature is entitled to proscribe <em>both </em>types of forcible intrusion into the orifices of a victim, whether proceeding from another person <em>or </em>from a body part of the victim not naturally found there.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">This leaves his alternative argument interpreting the language of the two parts of the statute as excluding forcible self-penetration. We do not find this interpretation tenable. The two general categories proscribed by section 289, subdivision (a) are those <em>\u201cwho </em>cause[] the penetration ... of any person\u201d (italics supplied), as distinct from those who \u201ccause[] another person to so penetrate the defendant] or another person[].\u201d Thus, the only requirement where a victim is penetrated is that the defendant \u201ccaused\u201d it. A defendant can cause the finger of anyone\u2014whether victim, defendant, or a third party\u2014to penetrate the victim. Nor does resort to section 289, subdivision (m) avail the defendant. Here, the two categories are inverted. The first set of victims are those whom a defendant \u201ccause[s] to penetrate ... the defendant or another person,\u201d while the second are those who <em>\u201care caused to be penetrated </em>by the defendant or another person\u201d (italics supplied). Under this prolix passive, once again the only requirement for victim status is that the defendant or third party \u201ccaused\u201d the penetration of the victim. Forcible self-penetration may logically be caused by a defendant or third party, and therefore the forcibly self-penetrated come within the ambit of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>In short, the defendant may legally be prosecuted and convicted under section 289 for the acts he forced the victim to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">III.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Scotland, J., and Nicholson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 14, 1994.
