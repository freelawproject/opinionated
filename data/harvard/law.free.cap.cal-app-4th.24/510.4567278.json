J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa_\">An amended information charged defendant with petit theft with a prior petit theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 666) and alleged defendant had served a prior prison term for vehicular manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (c)(3)) within the meaning of Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b). A jury convicted defendant as charged and defendant admitted the prior prison term allegation. Defendant was sentenced to state prison for an aggregate term of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">On appeal defendant contends, principally, that the evidence shows as a matter of law she did not serve a term in a penal institution within the meaning of Penal Code section 666. We deal with this contention in the published part of this opinion and, concluding that defendant is correct on this point but otherwise presents no grounds for reversal, we shall modify the judgment to reduce defendant\u2019s conviction to petit theft.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Defendant took items of merchandise displayed for sale at a Mervyn\u2019s department store, placed them in a Mervyn\u2019s bag and walked out of the store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>without paying for them. The items had a retail value of $128.99. Defendant was apprehended by store security guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Penal Code section 666 provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery person who having been convicted of petit theft, . . . and having served a term therefor in any penal institution or having been imprisoned therein as a condition of probation for that offense, is subsequently convicted of petit theft, then the person convicted of that subsequent offense is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The information charged defendant had been previously convicted of petit theft and \u201cserved a term therefor in a penal institution and [was] imprisoned therein as a condition of probation. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The evidence showed defendant had been convicted of petit theft and granted probation on condition she serve 30 days in county jail. However, the sheriff had permitted defendant to perform 20 days on a work project pursuant to Penal Code section 4024.2 in lieu of jail time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant did not actually serve any time in jail as a result of her prior petty theft conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Defendant argued in the trial court, as she does on appeal, that she did not serve a term in a penal institution within the meaning of Penal Code section 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Penal Code section 4024.2 (\u00a7 4024.2) authorizes a county to establish a voluntary work release program for persons committed to jail who, if eligible to participate, may earn remission of one day of confinement for each day of participation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under section 4024.2 a work release program participant performs eight to ten hours of labor \u201cin lieu of\u2019 one day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>confinement. (\u00a7 4024.2, subds. (a), (b)(4).) \u201cIn lieu of\u2019 clearly implies that a participant may perform the labor or serve the day in confinement, but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Subdivision (c) of section 4024.2 requires that a participant \u201cshall give his or her promise to appear for work or assigned activity by signing a notice to appear before the sheriff or at the education, vocational, or substance abuse program at a time and place specified in the notice and shall sign an agreement that the sheriff may immediately <em>retake the person into custody </em>to serve the balance of his or her sentence if the person fails to appear for the program at the time and place agreed to, does not perform the work or activity assigned, or for any other reason is no longer a fit subject for release under this section.\u201d (Italics added.) Furthermore, \u201cWhenever a peace officer has reasonable cause to believe the person has failed to appear at the time and place specified in the notice or fails to appear or work at the time and place agreed to or has failed to perform the work assigned, the peace officer may, without a warrant, <em>retake the person into custody, or the court may issue an arrest warrant for the retaking of the person into custody, to complete the remainder of the original </em>sentence.\u201d (\u00a7 4024.2, subd. (c), italics added.) These provisions clearly contemplate that eligible participants who sign a \u201cpromise to appear for work ... at a time and place specified,\u201d if in custody, will be released. In default of that promise, the erstwhile participant may be \u201cretake[n] . . . into custody ... to complete the remainder of the original sentence.\u201d (\u00a7 4024.2, subd. (c).) These provisions unambiguously describe a work program for persons who are committed to but not confined in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Section 4024.2 expressly establishes \u201ca work release program\u201d (\u00a7 4024.2, subd. (c)) for certain eligible persons committed to a county correctional facility but, under the program, not confined to the facility. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>establishes that defendant\u2019s 30-day jail term imposed as a condition of probation was entirely satisfied by her participation in a work release program. Accordingly, defendant did not serve a term in a penal institution within the meaning of Penal Code section 666 as a result of her prior petit theft conviction, and the proof of that essential element of the instant charge fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The judgment is modified to reduce defendant\u2019s conviction from petit theft with a prior petit theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 666) to petit theft, a misdemeanor (Pen. Code, \u00a7 484). The restitution fine imposed for conviction of a felony (Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967, subd. (c)) is vacated. The matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Davis, J., and Nicholson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 976(b) and 976.1, this opinion is certified for publication with the exception of parts II and III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\">A work project participant is not in custody and therefore is not entitled to credits under Penal Code section 4019. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wills </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1810, 1813 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 925].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Section 4024.2 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the board of supervisors of any county may authorize the sheriff or other official in charge of county correctional facilities to offer a voluntary program under which any person committed to the facility may participate in a work release program pursuant to criteria described in subdivision (b), in which one day of participation will be in lieu of one day of confinement.

A copy of the notice shall be delivered to the person and a copy shall be retained by the sheriff.

A peace officer may not retake a person into custody under this subdivision, without a warrant for arrest, unless the officer has a written order to do so, signed by the sheriff or other person in charge of the program, that describes with particularity the person to be retaken. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>page 511.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
