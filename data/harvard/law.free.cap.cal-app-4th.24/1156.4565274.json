When the banks failed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) placed them in receiverships and transferred their assets (including the ELIC Muni-GICs) to successor banks which, in turn, became creditors in ELIC\u2019s subsequent conservatorship proceedings. To obtain priority over other claimants, the banks contend their ephemeral involvement with the FDIC clothed them with the aura of a governmental entity. The trial court disagreed and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">In 1986, InterFirst Bank Houston, N.A. (a Texas bank) and Capital Bank &amp; Trust Co. (a Louisiana bank), as trustees acting for the benefit of municipal bondholders, invested funds in ELIC\u2019s Muni-GICs. InterFirst invested about $295. million and Capital invested about $150 million.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">On October 30, 1987, by court order, Capital was declared insolvent and placed in receivership by the FDIC. That same day, the FDIC organized a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>\u201cbridge bank,\u201d Capital Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A. (CBTNA). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> CBTNA, in turn, entered into a purchase and assumption agreement, pursuant to which Capital\u2019s trust business was transferred to CBTNA by the receiver (the FDIC), which made CBTNA the successor trustee under the LAFA trust indenture and the holder of the ELIC Muni-GICs. On May 23, 1988, Grenada Sunburst System Corporation acquired CBTNA pursuant to an agreement which resulted in the merger of CBTNA and Sunburst Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Grenada. To induce the merger and the transfer of CBTNA\u2019s trust assets (including the ELIC Muni-GICs) to Sunburst, the FDIC indemnified Sunburst for all losses arising from the acquisition agreement, including any claims by Capital\u2019s creditors. Since that time, Sunburst has served as the successor trustee of LAFA\u2019s ELIC Muni-GICs.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Meanwhile, during June 1987, InterFirst merged with First RepublicBank of Houston, N.A. On July 29, 1988, by court order, RepublicBank was placed in FDIC receivership. The same day, pursuant to a purchase and assumption agreement, the FDIC (as receiver) transferred some of RepublicBank\u2019s assets and trust business (including the ELIC Muni-GICs) to JRB Bank, N.A., a bridge bank created by the FDIC for that purpose. The bridge bank became the successor trustee under the SETHFCO trust indenture and the holder of the ELIC Muni-GICs. Later the same day, the FDIC accepted the bid of NCNB Corporation to purchase the bridge bank\u2019s stock. To induce NCNB to make the purchase, the FDIC promised financial assistance to NCNB and its affiliates and, as part of that assistance, agreed to indemnify NCNB Texas National Bank\u2014the renamed bridge bank\u2014against any losses, liabilities or expenses it might later incur in any proceeding as a result of the assumption. Since that time, NCNB Texas (later renamed NationsBank of Texas, N.A.) has served as the successor trustee of SETHFCO\u2019s ELIC Muni-GICs.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>On April 11, 1991, the California Insurance Commissioner, acting under the authority of section 1011 of the Insurance Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> asked the Los Angeles Superior Court to place ELIC into conservatorship. The unopposed request was granted, the Commissioner was named as the conservator and, among other things, a moratorium was imposed on payments to the Muni-GIC trustees. In August, the Commissioner submitted a proposed rehabilitation plan which established priorities among claimants according to a schedule which placed Muni-GICs at the bottom of the ladder (Class 6), below ELIC\u2019s non-Muni-GIC policyholders (who were placed in Class 5). (\u00a7 1033, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under this proposed plan, the ELIC policies with Class 5 priority were to be transferred to the newly created Aurora National Life Insurance Company, which would issue new policies equal to about 80 percent of the value of the original policies. ELIC annuity contracts and \u201cPension-GICs\u201d (GICs issued by ELIC to employee pension funds) were given Class 5 priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In the fall of 1991 (while the rehabilitation plan was pending before the trial court), Sunburst and NationsBan,k sued ELIC and the Commissioner, seeking a declaration that their Muni-GICs were entitled to \u201cat least\u201d the Class 5 priority given to other annuities and Pension-GICs under the proposed rehabilitation plan. In an amended complaint, Sunburst alleged its claim was entitled to Class 4 priority\u2014on the theory that the FDIC, as a government entity, was entitled to Class 4 priority and that, therefore, so was Sunburst\u2014because the FDIC\u2019s momentary possession of Sunburst\u2019s Muni-GICs had, by an actual or implied assignment or other alchemy, bestowed upon Sunburst the right to walk in the FDIC\u2019s shoes. Following a mid-November trial on the proposed rehabilitation plan, the trial court ruled that the Muni-GICs were entitled to Class 5 priority but postponed a ruling on Sunburst\u2019s request for Class 4 priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">In January' 1992, the Commissioner submitted a revised rehabilitation plan which, in conformance with the trial court\u2019s ruling, included the Muni-GICs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>in Class 5. Under this plan, all Class 5 claimants would receive about 70 percent of the value of their claims (as opposed to the 80 percent contemplated under the original plan). (See <em>Texas Commerce Bank </em>v. <em>Garamendi </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 460 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 854].)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">On January 10, NationsBank amended its declaratory relief complaint to assert a right to Class 4 priority for its Muni-GIC on the same theory as Sunburst and, in February, Sunburst and NationsBank moved for summary judgment. The Commissioner, several other Class 5 claimants, and the other Muni-GIC holders who had not acquired their Muni-GICs from or through the FDIC, all opposed the motion, and the Commissioner also filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the Banks\u2019 motions, granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion, and entered judgment against NationsBank and Sunburst in their declaratory relief actions, finding their Muni-GICs were not entitled to Class 4 priority. NationsBank and Sunburst appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">NationsBank and Sunburst contend their claims are entitled to Class 4 priority because they have a preference under federal law. Although we are inclined to disagree, the point is immaterial-\u2014because even assuming the FDIC would have had a right to priority if it was a party litigant, no such right was assigned or otherwise transferred to the Banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Class 4 priority is available only for those claims \u201chaving preference by the laws of the United States and by laws of this state.\u201d (\u00a7 1033, subd. (a)(4).) To bring themselves within this category, the Banks claim a preference under title 31 United States Code section 3713(a)(1), which provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>(as relevant) that a \u201cclaim of the United States Government shall be paid first when ... a person indebted to the Government is insolvent and ... an act of bankruptcy is committed . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The Banks\u2019 syllogism is this: Federal policy promotes \u201ca healthy and solvent national banking system,\u201d including efforts by the FDIC to protect the assets of insolvent financial institutions by encouraging asset assignments to new banks which, in turn, provide uninterrupted service to the public. Federal law (including 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3713(a)(1)) gives the FDIC the tools to implement such transfers, by bestowing upon the FDIC \u201cthe right to assert a federal law priority in an insolvency proceeding\u201d such as ELIC\u2019s conservatorship. California law (\u00a7 1033, subd. (a)(4)) recognizes this right by permitting claims made under \u201cthe laws of the United States\u201d to be paid ahead of most other claims \u201cbecause claims that may affect the public fisc are entitled to satisfaction before private parties may be reimbursed.\u201d The FDIC\u2019s functions are \u201cfundamentally governmental\u201d and, under \u201csettled assignment principles, NationsBank and Sunburst, the FDIC\u2019s assignees, are entitled to assert a [C]lass 4 priority as well.\u201d According to NationsBank and Sunburst, the fact that ELIC\u2019s indebtedness and \u201cact of bankruptcy\u201d (the conservatorship) are admitted means there are only two questions to be decided in this case\u2014whether the FDIC is entitled to assert a federal priority and, if so, whether the Banks can do so as their assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">\n<em>Priority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">According to the Banks, the FDIC is entitled to priority because it is both (1) an \u201cintegral part of the governmental mechanism\u201d created to accomplish something Congress deemed to be of national importance <em>(Small Business Adm\u2019n </em>v. <em>McClellan </em>(1960) 364 U.S. 446, 450 [5 L.Ed.2d 200, 203, 81 S.Ct. 191]) and (2) its activities affect the federal treasury (cf. <em>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 218, 222-223 [273 Cal.Rptr. 531]). Since other \u201cfederally chartered corporations\u201d which meet these criteria have been held to be federal agencies or instrumentalities <em>(Rust </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 597 F.2d 174, 177-178 [Federal National Mortgage Association]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Rivieccio </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1987) 661 F.Supp. 281, 287-288 [National Credit Union Administration]; <em>Fed. Land Bank of Wichita </em>v. <em>Bd. of County Com\u2019rs </em>(D.Colo. 1984) 582 F.Supp. 1507, 1511 [Federal Land Bank]), the same result should follow as to the FDIC\u2014because the FDIC performs important governmental functions by regulating banks, insuring deposits, and minimizing the effect of bank failures on the national banking system. For these and related reasons, the Banks conclude, the FDIC is entitled to Class 4 priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">According to the Commissioner and the other Muni-GIC owners, the Banks\u2019 argument ignores the fact that the FDIC has three distinct roles\u2014one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>as regulator (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1820(g)), one as corporate insurer of deposits (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1811 et seq.), and one as receiver of failed banking institutions (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(c).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the latter context (as in this case), the FDIC stands in the shoes of the insolvent bank <em>(Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation </em>v. <em>Glickman </em>(9th Cir. 1971) 450 F.2d 416, 418) and acquires the rights and duties of that institution <em>(F.D.I.C. </em>v. <em>Wheat </em>(5th Cir. 1992) 970 F.2d 124, 130), no more and no less. For this reason, the FDIC (wearing its receiver hat) is not a federal instrumentality for purposes of the Tax Injunction Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, which precludes a federal court from interfering with the collection of state taxes) or the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>(Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>State of N.Y. </em>(2d Cir. 1991) 928 F.2d 56; <em>PIMA Financial Serv. </em>v. <em>Intermountain Home Systems </em>(D.Colo. 1992) 786 F.Supp. 1551, 1560-1561.) A fortiori (according to the Commissioner and the other Muni-GIC owners), the FDIC does not have a right to priority over ELIC\u2019s other policyholders\u2014because the FDIC can have no greater rights than its assignors, Capital and Republic Bank.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Having stated the issue, we move on without deciding it, leaving it to another court at another time to resolve an apparent conflict in the cases. As we will explain, the FDIC\u2019s failure to assign to the Banks any right of its own (as opposed to the rights and assets of the failed banks) defeats the contention that, assuming the FDIC would itself have had a right to priority in this case, any such right was transferred to NationsBank or Sunburst.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>\n<em>Assignment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Assuming for discussion that the FDIC could, in this litigation, assert a claim to federal priority on its own behalf, no such right was assigned or otherwise transferred to the Banks.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">As to both NationsBank and Sunburst, the purchase and assumption agreements provided, in identical language, that: \u201cThe Assuming Bank hereby accepts from the Receiver an assignment of, and the Receiver hereby sells, assigns, transfers, conveys and delivers to the Assuming Bank, all right, title and interest of the Receiver <em>in and to all of the following assets of the </em>[Failed] Bank. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The listed assets included the failed banks\u2019 \u201ctrust business\u201d and the trust business, in turn, included the ELIC Muni-GICs. More specifically, each agreement provided, \u201cwith Respect to Trust Business,\u201d that the \u201cAssuming Bank shall . . . succeed to the rights, obligations, properties, assets, investments, deposits, agreements and trusts of the [Failed] Bank <em>all to the same extent as though the Assuming Bank had originally assumed the same </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) In neither agreement is there an assignment of <em>anything </em>belonging to the FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">These agreements did not confer on NationsBank or Sunburst any claim of priority the FDIC might have had. While no particular form of assignment is required, it is essential to the assignment of a right that the assignor manifest an intention to transfer the right. (Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 324; <em>Cockerell </em>v. <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 284, 291 [267 P.2d 16].) Nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>purchase and assumption agreements establishes or even suggests an intent by the FDIC to assign to the Banks a right belonging to the FDIC qua FDIC. Quite the opposite intent is manifested by the provision that the assignment of the failed bank\u2019s trust assets was made \u201cto the same extent as though\u201d NationsBank and Sunburst \u201chad originally assumed\u201d those assets from the failed banks, without any involvement by the FDIC. (Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 203, subd. (c) [\u201cspecific terms and exact terms are given greater weight than general language]; <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 17, 25 [131 Cal.Rptr. 250].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">The Banks\u2019 reliance on <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>F.D.I.C. </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 447 [86 L.Ed. 956, 62 S.Ct. 676], is misplaced. In <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme, </em>the Supreme Court created a rule of estoppel to prevent a failed bank\u2019s borrowers from asserting against the FDIC and its assignees a defense based upon a secret or unrecorded agreement, on the theory that the FDIC must be able to value a failed bank by reference to its books and records, free from concerns about undisclosed side deals. (See <em>Bell &amp; Murphy &amp; Assoc, </em>v. <em>InterFirst Bank Gateway </em>(5th Cir. 1990) 894 F.2d 750, 754.) The <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine (now codified in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(e)) may bar many claims and defenses which would defeat or diminish the FDIC\u2019s rights in and to an acquired asset, and it may sometimes be extended to benefit the FDIC\u2019s assignees <em>(Cadle Co. II, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1993) 254 Kan. 158 [864 P.2d 718, 720-721]). But the doctrine has never been applied in the manner suggested by NationsBank and Sunburst, which would create an implied assignment bestowing upon an assignee of the FDIC a governmental priority over other claimants. (Compare <em>White </em>v. <em>Moriarty, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1297-1298 [following the federal cases which have implied an assignment of the FDIC\u2019s right to a six-year period of limitations without discussion of the terms of the parties\u2019 purchase and assignment agreement].) Since the parties have demonstrated their ability to draft an assignment with specificity, and since the equities of this case do not favor a finding of implied assignment, we decline the Banks\u2019 invitation to extend the <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In short, the fleeting presence of the FDIC in the chain of possession of the Muni-GICs now owned by NationsBank and Sunburst did not transmogrify the Banks\u2019 claims into claims of the United States government.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The appeals from the July 31, 1992, and November 25, 1992, orders (Nos.

Under the indenture agreements (which are contracts between the municipal bond issuers and their indenture trustee-banks), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>trustees were expressly obligated to purchase one or more ELIC Muni-GICs. In 1986, ELIC issued eight Muni-GICs (only three are involved in this case), for a total consideration of about $1.8 billion. The Muni-GICs required ELIC to make specified interest payments and permitted the trustees to withdraw accumulated interest (which could then be used to service the debt on the bonds and to finance the low-income housing and agricultural loans). At maturity, ELIC was to return to the trustees their initial investments and any unpaid interest. SETHFCO and LAFA were third party beneficiaries of the Muni-GICs which are the subject of these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The FDIC is authorized by statute to establish a \u201cbridge bank\u201d to lake over the assets and liabilities of a failed bank and to carry on its business for a limited period while an agreement is worked out with a purchasing bank.

Corp. </em>v. <em>Hatmaker </em>(6th Cir. 1985) 756 F.2d 34, 36, fn. 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">For an interesting mix of cases, see <em>Lapadula &amp; Villani, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1983) 563 F.Supp. 782, 784 (the public treasury is unaffected by the FDIC\u2019s success or failure in recovering debts owed to it as successor to the claims of a failed bank, which means the FDIC is not an integral part of the governmental mechanism but rather a separate legal entity serving essentially a proprietary rather than a sovereign function, which means it is not entitled to priority); <em>PIMA Financial Serv. </em>v. <em>Intermountain Home Systems, </em>supra, 786 F.Supp. 1551, 1560-1561; and compare <em>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at page 224, footnote 2 (without distinguishing the FDIC\u2019s separate corporate and receiver functions, Division Seven of our court suggested, in dicta, that the FDIC\u2019s actions always affect the public fisc); <em>Engleman </em>v. <em>Commodity Credit Corp. </em>(S.D.Cal. 1952) 107 F.Supp. 930, 932-936 (interpreting an earlier version of the priority statute to require the simultaneous occurrence of the elements of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3713, an (1) insolvent person who (2) is indebted to the government (3) commits an act of bankruptcy); <em>In re Big \u2018D\u2019iscount Stores, Ltd. </em>(Bankr.

Our rejection of the Banks\u2019 ultimate conclusion (by our holding that there was no assignment) does not include our acceptance of this underlying hypotheses. All we have done is cut to the chase. (See <em>I.C. Herman &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Taub, Hummel &amp; Schnall, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1974) 497 F.2d 1301, 1302 [in bankruptcy proceedings, a customs broker who advances customs duties for an importer is not entitled to succeed to the rights of the United States against the bankrupt importer, and the broker thus cannot assert the government\u2019s right to have its claim accorded priority status in the distribution of the bankrupt\u2019s estate]; <em>White </em>v. <em>Moriarty </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1298 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 200] [an assignee of the FDIC is entitled to the benefit of the federal statute of limitations when it enforces a failed bank\u2019s note].) While the customs case is factually distinguishable because it does not involve an assignment, the limitations case is equally distinguishable (or more so). The availability of a longer period of limitations in an action between an assignee of an insolvent bank and a debtor of the same bank does no more than extend the period during which those parties can litigate their rights vis-a-vis each other. There are miles to go before reaching the Banks\u2019 conclusion, which would permit the assignee of a failed bank to claim priority in an action involving parties who had no relationship at all with the failed bank and who, by pure chance, are attempting to collect from the same third party debtor as the Banks. (See also <em>S.E.C. </em>v. <em>Albert &amp; Maguire Sec. Co., Inc. </em>(3d Cir. 1977) 560 F.2d 569, 573 [bank receiving assignment of customer\u2019s priority claim in Securities Investor Protection Act liquidation could not assume preferred status because it would result in an \u201cinequitable distribution\u201d of the estate].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The fact that the FDIC indemnified NationsBank and Sunburst against the claims of their predecessors\u2019 creditors adds nothing. An agreement to indemnify is not an assignment of a right. For this reason, we deny the Banks\u2019 request that we judicially notice documents from other lawsuits in which the FDIC apparently has agreed to contribute to obligations otherwise payable (if at all) by NationsBank and Sunburst. Aside from the fact that these documents were not before the trial court and thus ought not to be considered by us <em>(Carleton </em>v. <em>Tortosa </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 745, 753-754, fn. 1 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 734]), they are irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
