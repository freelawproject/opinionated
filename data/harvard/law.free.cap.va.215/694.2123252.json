Wickham, and the appellee-wife, Barbara Park Wickham. The agreement required the husband to pay a lump sum of $930 per month \u201cfor the support and maintenance of the wife and the [three] minor children of the parties.\u201d The agreement provided that the payments would be reduced by the sum of $150 per month upon \u201cthe death or emancipation ... of each child.\u201d On May 7, 1971, the agreement was affirmed, ratified, and incorporated in a final decree of divorce entered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-17\">On August 24,1973, the wife filed a \u201cPetition for Clarification and Modification of Final Decree.\u201d In the petition, the wife prayed for an \u201cincrease in child support\u201d and for an order modifying the final decree \u201cby declaring what portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>total sum paid by the [husband] to the [wife] is alimony and what portion is child support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Ruling that the wife had failed to show a change of circumstances, the court denied the prayer for an increase in child support. The court further ruled, however, that the final decree \u201cshould be modified and clarified by setting forth specifically . . . the amount to be paid . . . for alimony and . . . the amount to be paid ... for child support.\u201d Accordingly, the court ordered the husband to pay $480 per month as alimony and $150 per month for each child as child support. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The husband contends that the trial court lacked authority to modify the final decree by splitting the unitary award into separate payments for alimony and child support. By so splitting the award, the husband argues, the court directed the payment of alimony contrary to the approved settlement agreement, in violation of Code \u00a7 20-109.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The apportionment had the further effect, the husband asserts, of depriving him, contrary to the intention of the parties, of certain income tax benefits to which he was entitled under the agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The wife contends, on the other hand, that apportionment of the award did not violate Code \u00a7 20-109. She argues that it was necessary to apportion the award so that the court, in determining whether an increase in child support was warranted, could leave undisturbed the portion allocated to alimony and thus avoid a violation of Code \u00a7 20-109. Apportionment was further required, the wife says, despite the husband\u2019s resulting loss of tax benefits, to preserve the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>continuing power to supervise child support, as provided by Code \u00a7 20-108.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In any event, the wife asserts, any question of the court\u2019s authority to apportion the award is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>215 Va. 475, 211 S.E.2d 253 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">We do not agree with the wife concerning the effect of the <em>Carter </em>decision. It is true that in <em>Carter </em>we considered Code \u00a7 20-109 and upheld apportionment of a unitary award made pursuant to an approved settlement agreement. But <em>Carter </em>presented a problem entirely different from what is involved here. In <em>Carter, </em>the apportionment, which resulted in the allocation to Mrs. Carter of a specific amount as alimony and in the abatement of child support, was necessitated by transfer of custody of the children from the mother to the father. This was a change of circumstances, the evidence showed, which was never contemplated by the parties when they entered into their settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\"><em>Carter </em>is limited in application to cases involving substantially similar factual situations. We did not intend the decision to stand for the proposition that a court, without any necessity therefor, may apportion a unitary award made pursuant to an approved settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Here, there was no necessity for apportioning the award. The necessity claimed by the wife, <em>viz., </em>that circumstances had so changed as to warrant an increase in child support, was not shown to exist. Neither was it necessary for the trial court, in determining whether to grant an increase in child support, formally to apportion the award. The agreement and final decree themselves provided the basis, $150 per month for each child, from which to calculate and determine whether any change had occurred in the financial circumstances involving the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">By employing the agreed upon basis for calculating and determining the children\u2019s financial needs, the court would have had all it required as a starting point to decide whether to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>additional provision for child support. If it had decided that more child support was warranted, it could have provided therefor merely by adding to the existing award, increasing the total the husband would be required to pay the wife. This disposition would have retained the unitary character of the award, thus protecting the tax benefits to which the husband was entitled under the agreement. Such disposition also would have avoided a possible violation of Code \u00a7 20-109 and would have preserved the court\u2019s continuing power to supervise child support under Code \u00a7 20-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The trial court having determined, however, that circumstances had not so changed as to warrant an increase in child support, there was no necessity even to consider the wife\u2019s prayer to apportion the award. The court should have dismissed the wife\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and dismiss the wife\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\"> \u201c\u00a7 20-109.
