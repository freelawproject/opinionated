On October 21,1972, he was arrested for that offense in Washington, D. C., and upon waiver of extradition, was delivered to the Alexandria jail where he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>held for disposition of unrelated charges. In April, 1973, he was transferred to the Fairfax County jail for disposition of other charges. He was transferred on October 12,1973, to the Virginia State Penitentiary where he was given credit against his penitentiary sentence for 169 days spent in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A memorandum on file at the penitentiary shows that penitentiary authorities learned of defendant\u2019s presence in Virginia on October 25, 1972, four days after his arrest. On November 22, 1972, defendant was indicted for escape in violation of Code \u00a7 53-291(2). More than a year later, on December 12, 1973, he was convicted of that offense and sentenced to one year in the penitentiary. It is stipulated that in the interval between indictment and trial, six regular terms of the trial court had passed. Before final judgment, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he had been held for trial for more than three regular terms of the trial court before he was brought to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Code \u00a7 19.1-191<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is the statutory implementation of the constitutional guarantee of the right to a speedy trial. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>210 Va. 318, 171 S.E.2d 243 (1969). Under the statute the right begins to run in favor of an accused felon when the \u201cindictment is found\u201d and he is \u201cheld . . . for trial\u201d. The right is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>violated \u201cif there be three regular terms of the circuit.. . court in which the case is pending after he is so held without a trial\u201d. The right is not violated if \u201cthe failure to try him was caused\u201d by any of six stated circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The Commonwealth contends that during the time defendant was held in the Alexandria and Fairfax County jails he \u201cwas not available for trial before the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond on the escape charge\u201d and that he was not held for trial \u201cuntil such time as he was returned to the Virginia State Penitentiary.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The Commonwealth acquired sovereign jurisdiction over the person of the defendant the moment he entered her borders. Between defendant\u2019s indictment and his trial, the Commonwealth held the defendant for more than a year in three of her penal institutions. Two were jails; one was a penitentiary; all were \u201cpenal institutions\u201d. Code \u00a7 53-9 (now Code \u00a7 53-19.18 (Repl. Vol. 1974)). As an inmate, defendant was subject to transfer from one penal institution to another. Code \u00a7 53-8 (now Code \u00a7 53-19.17 (Repl. Vol. 1974)). With jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 53-295 (Cum. Supp. 1974) to try the escape indictment, the trial court had full process powers, reaching into every penal institution within the jurisdiction of the sovereign. At any time after the indictment was found, the trial court could have issued process and defendant could have been transferred from the jail to the penitentiary for ready access. What could have been done to grant a speedy trial should have been done. \u201cIt is the duty of officers charged with the responsibility of enforcing the criminal laws of the Commonwealth to prepare for and obtain a trial of an accused within the three regular terms of court specified.\u201d <em>Flanary </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 204, 210-11, 35 S.E.2d 135, 138 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Since, at all times subsequent to his indictment for the escape felony defendant was held by the Commonwealth in her penal institutions and was available for trial in the court in which the case was pending, we are of opinion that he was being \u201cheld . . . for trial\u201d within the meaning of the speedy trial statute and was entitled to claim its protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The General Assembly has enumerated six circumstances which excuse \u201cthe failure to try\u201d. And, as the Commonwealth says we have held that this enumeration was not intended to exclude other circumstances <em>in pari ratione. Wadley </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>98 Va. 803, 35 S.E. 452 (1900). But if circumstances such as those in this case are to be sufficient to justify delay in bringing the accused to trial, the General Assembly must say so. What it says must, of course, comply with the constraints of Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Constitution of Virginia and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. <em>See Nail </em>v. <em>Slayton, </em>353 F. Supp. 1013 (W. D. Va. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The judgment is reversed, the indictment is dismissed, and the defendant is forever discharged from prosecution for the offense of escape charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> \u201c\u00a7 19.1-191. Within what time an indictment for felony must be tried.\u2014Every person against whom an indictment is found charging a felony and held in any court for trial, whether he be in custody or not, shall be forever discharged from prosecution for the offense, if there be three regular terms of the circuit or four of the corporation or hustings court in which the case is pending after he is so held without a trial, unless the failure to try him was caused:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">(1) By his insanity or by reason of his confinement in a hospital for the insane for care and observation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">(2) By the witnesses for the Commonwealth being enticed or kept away or prevented from attending by sickness or inevitable accident,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">(3) By the granting of a separate trial at the request of a person indicted jointly with others for a felony,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">(4) By continuance granted on the motion of the accused or by reason of his escaping from jail or failing to appear according to his recognizance,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">(5) By the inability of the jury to agree in their verdict, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\">(6) Where there be no court held at the regular term or where there is court held and for any reason it would be injudicious, in the opinion of the court, to have jurors and witnesses summoned for that term, which reason shall be specially spread upon the records of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-14\">\u201cBut the time during the pendency of any appeal in any appellate court shall not be included as applying to the provisions of this section.\u201d (Repl. Vol. 1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">This statute was amended in 1974, subsequent to defendant\u2019s trial. (Cum. Supp. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
