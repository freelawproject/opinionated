Cooper (claimant) appeals the Industrial Commission\u2019s award dismissing his claim for \u201cblack lung\u201d benefits filed against Mary E. Coal Corporation (Mary Coal) and Old Republic Insurance Company (Insurer). The dispositive question is whether the Commission erred in ruling that Mary Coal was not the employer liable on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">On October 17, 1970, while employed as a coal miner by Enterprise Coal Corporation (Enterprise), claimant obtained a chest X-ray administered by the Public Health Service pursuant to the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801, <em>et seq. </em>Claimant became employed by Mary Coal on January 10, 1972. On April 2, 1972, claimant received a letter dated March 11, 1972, from the Public Health Service informing him that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>\u201ccategory 1 simple pneumoconiosis\u201d. On October 10, 1972, claimant filed a claim under Code \u00a7 65.1-49 (Repl. Vol. 1973) against Mary Coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">In an award dated January 7, 1974, Commissioner M. E. Evans ruled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-6\">\u201cThe medical evidence preponderates in proving that claimant has 1st stage pneumoconiosis and that the disease had reached that stage prior to the time he was employed by the defendant [Mary Coal]. It follows that the employer for whom he worked prior to October 17, 1970, would be the employer with whom claimant was last injuriously exposed to the causative hazards of his pneumoconiosis and not this defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">On March 12, 1974, the full Commission adopted \u201cthe findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the decision and award of January 7, 1974,\u201d and affirmed the award dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Code \u00a7 65.1-50 (Repl. Vol. 1973) provides in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-9\">\u201cWhen an employee has an occupational disease that is covered by this Act, the employer in whose employment he was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease and the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, if any, at the time of the exposure, shall alone be liable therefor, without right to contribution from any prior employer or insurance carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Construing that section, claimant says that the employer liable on the claim is the employer in whose employment claimant was last injuriously exposed \u201cprior to the communication of the disease\u201d. Mary Coal and Insurer construe the section to mean that the employer liable is the employer in whose employment claimant was last injuriously exposed \u201cprior to the date the existence of the condition or disease is conclusively established\u201d. Claimant argues that, in determining the employer liable on a claim based on pneumoconiosis, the date the diagnosis was communicated governs, while Mary Coal and Insurer contend that the date of the taking of the X-ray upon which the diagnosis was predicated governs. The Commission ruled that the date on which the X-ray was taken governs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>We are of opinion the Commission\u2019s ruling was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The authorities are in general accord that the critical date is the date of actual disability, the date entitlement to benefits accrues.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">\u201cOccupational disease cases typically show a long history of exposure without actual disability, culminating in the enforced cessation of work on a definite date. In the search for an identifiable instant in time which can perform such necessary functions as to start claim periods running, establish claimant\u2019s right to benefits, <em>and fix the employer and insurer liable for compensation, the date of disability has been found the most satisfactory. </em>Legally, it is the moment at which the right to benefits accrues; as to limitations, it is the moment at which in most instances the claimant ought to know he has a compensable claim; and, as to successive insurers, it has the one cardinal merit of being definite, while such other possible dates as that of the actual contraction of the disease are usually not susceptible to positive demonstration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-7\">\u201cSince the onset of disability is the key factor in assessing liability under the last-injurious-exposure rule, <em>it does not detract from the operation of this rule to show that the disease existed under a prior employer or carrier, or had become actually apparent, </em>or had received medical treatment, or, indeed, as held in North Carolina, had already been the subject of a claim filed against the prior employer, so long as it had not resulted in disability.\u201d [Emphasis added]. 3 A. Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 95.21 (508.136-38, 508.141) (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Pursuing this rationale in the construction of the phrase \u201clast injuriously exposed\u201d, a majority of states have adopted a rule fixing liability upon the employer in whose employment the claimant was last injuriously exposed prior to or at the time of disability, the date on which entitlement to benefits accrued. <em>See, e.g., Employers Liabil. A. Corp. </em>v. <em>Employers Mut. L. Ins. Co., </em>232 Ark. 113, 116, 334 S.W.2d 701, 703 (1960); <em>Alloy Surfaces Co. </em>v. <em>Cicamore, </em>221 A.2d 480, 485-86 (Del. 1966); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Harlan Everglow Coal Co., </em>392 S.W.2d 62, 64 (Ky. 1965); <em>White </em>v. <em>Scullin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>Steel Co., </em>435 S.W.2d 711, 715-16 (Mo. 1968); <em>Mariani </em>v. <em>Helena Rubenstein, Inc., </em>19 A.D.2d 916, 243 N.Y.S.2d 964 (1963); <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>State Accident Insurance Fund, 10 Ore. </em>App. 139, 148, 499 P.2d 1331, 1335-36 (1972); <em>Tennessee Tufting Co. </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>206 Tenn. 620, 629, 337 S.W.2d 601, 602 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">We believe that the proper construction of the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act dictates the same rule. Under Code \u00a7 65.1-49 (Repl. Vol. 1973) entitlement to benefits accrues on the date of \u201cthe first communication of the diagnosis\u201d. That section makes the provisions of the Act concerning occupational accidents applicable to occupational diseases \u201cexcept as otherwise provided.\u201d On a claim based upon an accident, the employer on the date of the accident is the employer liable, and that date determines the applicable notice requirements, statute of limitations, and rate of compensation. In a claim based upon a disease, the date of the accident (fixed by the statute as the date of the \u201cfirst communication of the diagnosis\u201d) plays a similar, but not an identical, role. Standing alone, it does not identify the employer liable on the claim; it is \u201cotherwise provided\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.1-50 which adds another criterion. Under that section, the employer on the date of the accident may be the employer liable but only if he is also \u201cthe employer in whose employment [claimant] was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease.\u201d The construction urged by Mary Coal and Insurer that the employer liable is the employer on \u201cthe date the existence of the condition or disease is conclusively established\u201d, here, the date the X-ray was taken, finds no support in any provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">We hold, therefore, that liability under Code \u00a7 65.1-50 attaches to the employer in whose employment a claimant was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of an occupational disease prior to \u201cfirst communication of the diagnosis\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">On the date claimant received the diagnosis, he had worked 53 shifts for Mary Coal. There is no evidence to show where he worked on the job site or the nature of his working conditions, and Mary Coal and Insurer argue that claimant failed to prove injurious exposure at Mary Coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Such proof is essential to recovery under Code \u00a7 65.1-50. But here, under a misinterpretation of that section, the Commission ruled that the employer liable on the claim was \u201cthe employer for whom [claimant] worked prior to October 17, 1970\u201d, the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>the X-ray was taken. After that ruling, evidence of injurious exposure subsequent to October 17, 1970, would have been immaterial, and claimant\u2019s failure to adduce it is not fatal to his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The Commission\u2019s ruling is reversed, the award is set aside, and the application is remanded for a new hearing in order that claimant may be afforded an opportunity to present evidence concerning injurious exposure during his employment by Mary Coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\"> At the time of the Commission\u2019s ruling, claimant\u2019s right to amend his claim and join Enterprise as a defendant had expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
