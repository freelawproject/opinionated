He then singled out juror Gomer Evans, who was well known to him, and asked the extent of his acquaintance with defendant\u2019s counsel. Evans stated that he knew defendant\u2019s counsel because he was associated with the law firm that represented the compensation company for whom Evans used to work. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel pursued the matter and established that Evans had worked in the compensation department of an underwriting company eight years earlier and that defendant\u2019s counsel was associated with a law firm which represented insurance carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Evans was asked if his \u201cemployment with that company of underwriters\u201d would affect his partiality in the case, to which he responded that it would not.' Finally, under continuous questioning by plaintiffs counsel, Evans stated that a member of plaintiffs counsel\u2019s law firm had represented him on a personal matter, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel remarked, \u201cI am sure we never did represent [insurance] underwriters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In actions to recover damages for personal injuries we have held that an inadvertent reference to insurance coverage is harmless error if it appears that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been done. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>199 Va. 806, 812-13, 102 S.E.2d 292, 296-97 (1958); <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>163 Va. 662, 667, 177 S.E. 208, 211 (1934). In contrast, we have held that it is reversible error not to grant a mistrial where the reference to insurance is deliberate and for improper \u25a0purposes. <em>Travelers </em>v. <em>Lobello, </em>212 Va. 534, 535, 186 S.E.2d 80, 82 (1972); <em>Hope Windows </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>208 Va. 489, 493, 158 S.E.2d 722, 725 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The obvious purpose and effect of the detailed examination of Evans by plaintiff\u2019s counsel were to inform the members of the jury panel that the defendant had insurance coverage. Since this action was deliberate, the motion for a mistrial should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The judgment entered for the plaintiff is reversed, the jury\u2019s verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
