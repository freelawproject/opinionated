It involves the validity of a provision in a garage liability policy which excludes a permissive user from coverage if possession of the vehicle had been transferred to such user by the named insured pursuant to an agreement of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-20\">Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) filed a motion for judgment against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company seeking indemnification in the amount of $8,167.68, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the result of payments it made in connection with certain uninsured motorist claims arising from an accident which occurred on January 24, 1970, in Portsmouth, Virginia. The trial court, sitting without a jury, decided that a policy of garage liability insurance, issued by Nationwide to Gosport Motor Service, covered the operation by Charles Powell of a 1958 Dodge automobile at the time of the accident and entered judgment in favor of GEICO. A writ of error was awarded Nationwide to review this judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">On January 2, 1970, Obie Brown, formerly a resident of North Carolina but then living in Portsmouth, managed to start his previously inoperative 1958 Dodge sedan, which had been parked in the yard of his residence for some time. He had decided to \u201cjunk\u201d the 1958 Dodge and to purchase a 1965 Dodge Coronet, which he had observed on the premises of Frank P. and Louis J. Eates, trading as Gosport Motor Service, a used automobile sales and service business in Portsmouth. While on his way to a junk yard to dispose of the car, Brown stopped at the Gosport used car lot to obtain some information on the 1965 vehicle. While there, his car became inoperative again.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">After some discussion with Joseph Battaglia, employed by Gosport as a commission salesman, Brown agreed to purchase the 1965 Dodge for $995. The \u201cused car invoice\u201d showed \u201cNO TRADE\u201d and Brown testified that Gosport \u201cwouldn\u2019t take [the 1958 car] as a trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">After Brown failed in several attempts to start the 1958 Dodge for the purpose of driving it to a junk yard, Battaglia approached Brown and stated that if Brown would leave the car on the Gosport lot, he would try to \u201cget rid of it\u201d and that he would give Brown \u201chalf of whatever he got on the car.\u201d Brown agreed. He then endorsed in blank the North Carolina title certificate for the 1958 vehicle, which was in the vehicle, and handed it to Battaglia with the keys to the car. The North Carolina license plates were not removed from the vehicle. Brown then drove away in the 1965 Dodge and, later that day, arranged for the transfer of the liability insurance coverage from the 1958 Dodge to the 1965 vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The 1958 Dodge remained on the Gosport used car lot until Charles Powell acquired possession of it on January 24,1970, the day of the accident. Powell had previously noticed the car on the lot parked near the sales office. On January 24, he went to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>office, and as the result of his conversation with Louis Eates, Battaglia and Kenny McDaniels, another Gosport salesman, agreed to purchase the 1958 Dodge for fifty dollars cash. The money was handed to Eates who prepared a handwritten \u201creceipt\u201d on a blank sheet of paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Another car was driven adjacent to the 1958 Dodge and it was started with the use of \u201cjumper cables.\u201d Eates handed Powell the North Carolina title certificate endorsed in blank by Brown, and instructed Powell to take it with the \u201creceipt\u201d to a notary public or justice of the peace and \u201cthey would fix it up\u201d and \u201ctransfer it to [Powell\u2019s] name.\u201d The North Carolina license plates were still on the car, and Powell was directed to return them to Gosport after he \u201cgot the car home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Powell never reached his home with the car. He drove several blocks from Gosport\u2019s lot and left it at a garage to be serviced. Several hours later, as he was driving the car from the garage to his home, it collided with another vehicle operated by Amanda B. Wooten.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">At the time of the collision, the Wooten vehicle was covered by a GEICO automobile liability insurance policy containing the standard uninsured motorist endorsement. When the driver and the three passengers in the Wooten vehicle made personal injury claims against Powell, Nationwide rejected GEICO\u2019s demand to assume the adjustment of these claims, contending that it did not owe coverage to Powell under its garage liability policy issued to Gosport. GEICO then settled the several claims under its uninsured motorist coverage after having determined that, as the result of Nationwide\u2019s denial of coverage, Powell was uninsured and that he was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The broad issue is whether Powell\u2019s operation of the 1958 Dodge at the time of the accident was covered under Nationwide\u2019s policy. If it was, GEICO prevails; if it was not, Nationwide prevails. The specific issue we decide is whether Nationwide\u2019s policy provision, sometimes called an escape clause, which eliminated Poivell as an \u201cinsured,\u201d was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Nationwide\u2019s policy was issued to \u201cFrank P. &amp; Louis J. Eates T/A Gosport Motor Service\u201d as the \u201cNamed Insured\u201d for a one year period beginning May 4,1969. Under the \u201cGarage Insurance Coverage,\u201d it agreed to pay on behalf of its insured \u201c.. . all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of . . . bodily injury ... to which this insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>applies, caused by an occurrence and arising out of garage operations, including only the automobile hazard for which insurance is afforded . ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">\u201cAutomobile hazard\u201d is defined as the \u201cownership, maintenance or use ... of any automobile for the purpose of garage operations ...\u201d and, additionally, as the \u201cuse in connection with garage operations of any automobile which is neither owned nor hired by the Named Insured, . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In the policy, \u201c \u2018garage\u2019 means an automobile sales agency . . .\u201d and \u201c \u2018garage operations\u2019 means the ownership, maintenance or use of the premises for the purposes of a garage and all operations necessary or incidental thereto . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Under the section, \u201c PERSONS INSURED,\u201d the policy defined \u201cinsured\u201d as the named insured and \u201c. . . any person while using, with the permission of the Named Insured, any automobile to which the insurance applies under the automobile hazard, provided his actual operation ... is within the scope of such permission . . . .\u201d Within the same section is found the escape clause in question, which provided that: \u201cNone of the following is an Insured: . . . any person, other than the Named Insured with respect to any automobile . . . possession of which has been transferred to another by the Named Insured pursuant to an agreement of sale . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">GEICO argues, and the trial court so held in a memorandum opinion, that Powell was covered by Nationwide\u2019s policy for the reasons that his use fell within the broad definition of \u201cgarage operations,\u201d Powell was the permissive user of Brown\u2019s vehicle, and the exclusion relied on by Nationwide was void as being repugnant to the omnibus clause. Code \u00a7 38.1-381(a). Nationwide argues that its policy did not cover Powell\u2019s operation of the 1958 Dodge, because there was \u201cno possible rational connection between what he was doing at the time of the accident and \u2018garage operations\u2019....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Alternatively, Nationwide contends that the escape clause is valid and relieves it of liability since Powell\u2019s possession of the 1958 Dodge had been transferred to him by Nationwide\u2019s named insured pursuant to an agreement of sale. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">We will assume without deciding that the vehicle was still owned by Brown at the time of the accident,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Powell was its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>permissive user, and that his use fell within the policy definition of \u201cgarage operations.\u201d Therefore, Powell was entitled to coverage under Nationwide\u2019s policy, unless the escape clause was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Admittedly, possession of the vehicle had been transferred by Eates pursuant to the agreement of sale, but GEICO argues that the escape clause is void because it conflicts with Code \u00a7 38.1-381(a), the omnibus clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It contends that since the policy excludes from coverage a permissive user who obtained possession of the vehicle from the named insured pursuant to an agreement of sale, the effect is to restrict the scope of the coverage with regard to one class of permissive users, although the coverage is not so limited to the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">As GEICO points out, we have held similar limitations void as being repugnant to the omnibus clause, because, under the statute, the permissive user is entitled to the identical protection afforded the named insured; that is, the same quantity and quality of coverage. <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Company </em>v. <em>General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation, Ltd., </em>212 Va. 780, 188 S.E.2d 218 (1972); <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Company </em>v. <em>Celina Mutual Insurance Company, </em>209 Va. 60, 161 S.E.2d 680 (1968); <em>American Motorists Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>209 Va. 53, 161 S.E.2d 675 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">But a significant feature of this case, overlooked by GEICO, renders the foregoing cases, upon which it relies, inapposite. In those cases, owners\u2019 policies were involved. The insured in each garage liability policy owned the vehicle in question. In <em>General Accident, </em>the operator of the Chevrolet at the time of the accident was the permissive user of the vehicle owned by the insured new car dealer. In <em>Celina Mutual, </em>the permissive user <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>operated a loaned truck owned by the insured automobile sales agency. In <em>Kaplan, </em>the permissive user was test-driving a vehicle owned by the insured automobile dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Here, we are not dealing with an owner\u2019s policy. The vehicle operated by Powell was, as to Gosport, a nonowned vehicle, that is, Gosport did not own the 1958 Dodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">By the force of its provisions, Code \u00a7 38.1-381(a) is made a part of each motor vehicle liability policy to which it applies. \u201cBut even so, we must look to the words used in the statute to determine its meaning, and only the meaning of the statute as determined should be given effect.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>209 Va. 755, 758, 167 S.E.2d 339, 342 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Insofar as pertinent here, the statute is applicable when a policy covering bodily injury liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle is \u201c (1) \u2018issued or delivered in this State to the <em>owner </em>of such vehicle,\u2019 or (2) when \u2018issued or delivered by any insurer licensed in this State upon <em>any </em>motor vehicle . .. <em>then </em>principally garaged ... or principally used in this State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">In this case, since Nationwide\u2019s policy was not issued to the \u201cowner\u201d of the 1958 Dodge, the statute does not apply under the first category <em>supra, </em>and this policy contains a valid restriction on the scope of coverage granted to the permissive user of a nonowned vehicle and is not repugnant to the omnibus clause. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Harleysville Mut. Casualty Co., </em>123 F.2d 499 (4th Cir. 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The second category applies to policies upon <em>any </em>motor vehicle, if the insurer is licensed in Virginia and if the vehicle is <em>then </em>principally garaged or used in Virginia. Even assuming that the evidence in this record is sufficient to show that Nationwide was an insurer licensed in Virginia, it nevertheless fails to show that when the Nationwide policy was issued or delivered to Gosport on or about May 4, 1969, the vehicle in question was <em>then </em>principally garaged or <em>then </em>principally used in this State. Such proof is necessary for the statutory provisions to act upon the policy in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Therefore, it is apparent that the omnibus clause is not applicable under either of the foregoing provisions. In order for GEICO to claim the benefit of the statute, so as to render void any policy restriction on the permissive use contemplated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>statute, it must show that the Nationwide policy fell within either of the foregoing two categories. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., supra, </em>209 Va. at 758, 168 S.E.2d at 342. This it has failed to do. Accordingly, the escape clause is valid, and Powell was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under Nationwide\u2019s policy. <em>Grange Mutual Casualty Company </em>v. <em>Criterion Insurance Company, </em>212 Va. 753, 188 S.E.2d 91 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court in favor of GEICO will be reversed and final judgment will be here entered in favor of Nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\"> No contention is made by GEICO that Gosport ever acquired title to the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\"> At the time of this accident, Code \u00a7 38.1-381(a) provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">\u201c\u00a7 38.1-381.
