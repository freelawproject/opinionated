Vol. 1969) against the County Board of Arlington County (Board) seeking relief from the business license tax levied upon them. The trial court granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">In 1949, following a 1948 study conducted by the Bureau of Public Administration for the University of Virginia, the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>enacted a Business Privilege License Ordinance. Section 11-2 of the ordinance provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201cIt is the purpose and policy of the county board, in enacting this chapter imposing license taxes for the privilege of conducting business ... to equalize as far as practicable the burden of such license taxation ... by adopting ... a system of license taxes measured by the gross receipts of the business</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">For taxable year 1959, the Board increased the license tax rate on hotels and motels from $0.36 to $2.00 per $100 of gross receipts. The new rate did not conform to the comparative operating margin standard adopted and applied pursuant to the 1948 study and later studies, but there was a \u201cgentlemen\u2019s agreement\u201d that Taxpayers could pass the tax along to their customers by stating it separately on customer bills. In 1970 the Board enacted an additional ordinance creating a transient occupancy tax payable by customers as a surcharge on their bills. Thereupon, the Commissioner of the Revenue rescinded the \u201cgentlemen\u2019s agreement\u201d and the Board reduced the license tax rate to $0.50 per $100 gross receipts for taxable year 1971. By an amendment to the 1949 ordinance enacted in 1971, the Board increased the license tax rate for taxable year 1972 to $2.00 per $100 gross receipts, and Taxpayers filed their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">By final order entered April 12, 1973, the trial court found that the Board, \u201cwithout evidence of a change in the Hotel-Motel Industry\u2019s profit margin, arbitrarily enacted a rate . . . which increased the rate Three Hundred Percent (300%) above the formula rate, in violation of equalizing provisions....\u201d And, \u201cbeing of the opinion that the ends of justice would be met by making an adjustment\u201d, the trial court \u201cexonerated\u201d Taxpayers from payment of the 1972 license taxes levied under the rate fixed in the 1971 amendment, \u201cestablished\u201d the rate for 1972 at $0.50 per $100 gross receipts, and \u201cdirected\u201d the Treasurer of Arlington County to refund to Taxpayers so much of the taxes paid as exceed taxes due under the rate fixed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The Board and Taxpayers agree that this appeal poses no constitutional issues concerning reasonableness of classification or uniformity of assessment, and Taxpayers concede that the license tax rate fixed in the 1971 amendment is not confiscatory or prohibitive. The Board argues that the statutory authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>granting a court discretion to reduce license and other tax rates, upon which the trial court relied, had earlier been declared unconstitutional and that, absent express authority in a constitutional statute, the trial court had no power to reduce license tax rates fixed by a legislative body which were not confiscatory or prohibitive. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In <em>City of Waynesboro </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>213 Va. 229, 233-34, 191 S.E.2d 196, 199 (1972), we agreed with the City\u2019s argument that \u201cthe portion of the 1968 amendment to [Code \u00a7 58-1145] which permits adjustments \u2018if the court in its discretion finds the ends of justice would be met by making an adjustment. . .\u2019 is unconstitutional.\u201d We found that portion to be vague and overbroad with no decisional guidelines or standards and an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. It is clear, not only from the language of the final order itself, but also from the oral opinion announced at the conclusion of the hearing below, that the trial court relied for its authority to act upon statutory authority which had been invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Nor could the trial court rely for its authority upon the uniformity provisions of the Virginia Constitution for they \u201capply only to a direct tax on property, and not to license taxes.\u201d <em>Bradley </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>110 Va. 521, 525, 66 S.E. 872, 874 (1910), <em>aff'd, </em>227 U.S. 477 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We find no merit in Taxpayers\u2019 contention that the trial court had inherent judicial power to enforce the equalization policy of the 1949 ordinance by setting aside the 1971 amendment. The 1971 amendment, like the ordinance it amended, was a legislative act, and even had it expressly repealed Section 11-2, it would not have been subject to judicial review unless the rate it imposed was confiscatory or prohibitive. <em>See Langston </em>v. <em>Danville, </em>189 Va. 603, 54 S.E.2d 101 (1949).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201cThe power of taxation, under our system of government, rests with the legislative and not with the judicial department, and its province cannot be invaded by the courts. Where the power to tax for revenue purposes exists, the amount of the tax is in the discretion of the legislative body, and it may be carried to any extent within the jurisdiction of the State or corporation which imposes it which the will of such State or corporation may prescribe. If the power is exercised in an unwise, unjust and oppressive manner to any particular class, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the remedy, within constitutional bounds, is by an appeal, not to the courts, but to the justice and patriotism of the representatives of the people. [Citations omitted].\u201d <em>Bradley &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>110 Va. at 525, 66 S.E. at 874.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court acted without authority, and the judgment is reversed and final judgment is entered here for the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-19\"> Dominick Foglio, t/a Airport Motel; Jeswin Operating, Inc., t/a Pentagon Motel; Whitestone Motor Inn, Inc., t/a Holiday Inn of Arlington; Cherry Blossom Motel, Inc., t/a Cherry Blossom Motor Inn; Charles J.
