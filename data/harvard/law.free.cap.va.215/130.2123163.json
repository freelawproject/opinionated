Bailey, refused to submit to a test to determine the alcoholic content of his blood. For his refusal, he was charged with violating Code \u00a7 18.1-55.1, Virginia\u2019s Implied Consent Law. Upon his trial therefor, he was convicted, and his operator\u2019s license was revoked for a period of 90 days. Code \u00a7 18.1-55.1(n). He was granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">On appeal, the defendant contends that under the Implied Consent Law a charge of refusing to submit to a blood test should be dismissed if the failure to take the test is based upon a reasonable ground. Code \u00a7 18.1-55.1(m). His refusal, the defendant asserts, was based upon the advice of counsel \u201cnot to take the test.\u201d This, the defendant concludes, was a reasonable ground within the intendment of the Implied Consent Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-18\">The record supports the defendant\u2019s assertion that he refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>to submit to a blood analysis only after he had received advice of counsel \u201cnot to take the test.\u201d This presents the sole question for decision: whether, under the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s refusal was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In <em>Deaner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 285, 170 S.E.2d 199 (1969), we ruled that the blood test prescribed by the Implied Consent Law is part of a civil rather than a criminal proceeding. Because the proceeding is civil in nature, we held that a person arrested for driving under the influence does not have a constitutional right to consult with counsel before deciding whether to submit to the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We further held in <em>Deaner </em>that an unwillingness to take the test \u201cwithout prior consultation with counsel\u201d does not constitute a reasonable refusal. 210 Va. at 293, 170 S.E.2d at 204. From this holding, the corollary, applicable to the present case, necessarily follows: it is not reasonable to refuse a blood analysis solely because counsel advises \u201cnot to take the test.\u201d As <em>Deaner </em>indicates, there must be some reasonable factual basis for the refusal, for example, endangerment of the health of the accused by the withdrawal of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">In this case, the sole ground for the defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood analysis was the advice of counsel \u201cnot to take the test.\u201d This was not a reasonable ground for refusal. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
