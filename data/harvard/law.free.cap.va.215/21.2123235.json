He was sentenced to a term of five years in the State Penitentiary, and we granted him a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In his assignments of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s rulings in admitting certain evidence and in refusing to set aside the verdict as being contrary to the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s only witness, William D. Spence, an undercover narcotics investigator for the State Police, was on June 30, 1972, driving his automobile in Winchester with Stephen Kremer and Finley Whitlock as his passengers. At approximately 7:30 p.m. Spence stopped his car, and defendant entered it. Defendant sat in the front seat, and Whitlock and Kremer were in the rear seat. Spence testified that defendant stated, \u201che would like to sell all of the \u2018weed\u2019 that day\u201d and asked Kremer and Whitlock how much they had sold. Spence stated that Whitlock replied, \u201che had sold $140 worth at that time.\u201d Defendant then told Kremer and Whitlock that \u201cthey should be able to sell the rest of the \u2018pot\u2019 at the Firestone area or at the park.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Spence further testified that at about 7:45 p.m., Kremer saw Larry Wallace and at Kremer\u2019s suggestion, Spence stopped the car. Kremer asked Wallace if he wanted to buy some marijuana. Wallace joined Kremer and Whitlock in the back seat, and they rode around the block. Wallace criticized the quality of the marijuana and defendant told Wallace, \u201cthat was good \u2018weed\u2019 \u201d and \u201ceither he wanted to buy some or he didn\u2019t.\u201d According to Spence, Wallace then purchased an \u201counce of marijuana from Kremer for $20.\u201d Wallace gave the money to Kremer who handed it to Whitlock. Wallace then left the car. The substance sold to Wallace was contained in a transparent plastic bag similar to a sandwich baggy, but the substance was not chemically analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">After Wallace departed, defendant advised Kremer and Whitlock how to handle people who were hesitant about buying the \u201cpot\u201d and told them to be careful. Defendant further said that \u201cthere was good marijuana and that it came in a brick and that he was supposed to get approximately two pounds again on Saturday.\u201d Defendant left the vehicle after being driven to the vicinity of Cartwright\u2019s Recreation Center where he had been picked up.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Spence also testified that prior to meeting defendant that evening, he was \u201cflagged\u201d by Kremer at approximately 6:25 p.m.; that Kremer asked him if he wanted to buy some \u201cpot\u201d for $20 an ounce; that Kremer got in the car and asked Spence to take him to his residence; and that on the way Kremer took from his pocket three plastic baggies containing a green substance that appeared to be marijuana, laid them on the seat and told Spence to choose one. Spence said that when they arrived at Kremer\u2019s residence at approximately 6:30 p.m., he (Spence) chose one of the baggies and gave Kremer $20; that Kremer placed the remaining two baggies in his coat pocket and went inside his residence; and that in approximately two minutes Kremer returned to the car with Whitlock. The three then drove off and approximately one hour later picked up defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Spence, who had been trained in the identification of marijuana, testified that the baggy he bought from Kremer was the same in appearance as the baggy Kremer later sold to Wallace in defendant\u2019s presence. Over objection of defendant, the Commonwealth introduced evidence of the chemical analysis of the substance Spence bought from Kremer, which showed it to be marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Defendant admitted being in the car with Spence, Kremer and Whitlock when the transaction with Wallace took place but disclaimed any connection with or participation in the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Defendant\u2019s first contention is that the testimony of Spence regarding statements by Whitlock while defendant was present and statements by Kremer before defendant entered the car was inadmissible as hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Spence testified, over objection, that in response to defendant\u2019s question Whitlock told defendant that $140 of the \u201cweed\u201d had been sold. The statement was made immediately before Wallace entered the automobile and the alleged drug sale to him took place. Such a statement is competent, not for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted, but to permit the jury to infer defendant\u2019s state of mind in consequence of the utterance. We hold that the hearsay rule is inapplicable to the statement. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>468 F.2d 1355, 1356 (4th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 969 (1973); VI Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1766 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Spence also testified, over objection, that before defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>entered the car, Kremer asked Spence if he wanted to buy some \u201cpot\u201d and that Kremer took three baggies out of his pocket and told Spence to choose one. Even though declarations, made outside of a defendant\u2019s presence, generally fall within the hearsay rule, they may be admitted in evidence as declarations uttered by a co-conspirator in furtherance of a common, illegal design. <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>21 Gratt. (62 Va.) 871, 895 (1872). <em>See </em>22A C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 754. Such declarations are admissible even though a conspiracy is not charged where the evidence establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of conspiracy. <em>See Cottrell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 554, 557-58, 113 S.E. 728, 729 (1922); <em>State </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>110 Ariz. 135, 144, 515 P.2d 880, 889 (1973). We hold that in the case at bar the evidence established a <em>prima facie </em>case of conspiracy, and that the contested statements were admissible under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Next, defendant argues that evidence relating to the sale of marijuana by Kremer to Spence and to the chemical analysis of the substance was inadmissible as being irrelevant and prejudicial to defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Spence testified that Kremer sold to him what appeared to be marijuana approximately one hour before defendant was picked up. Over objection, Spence said that he had the substance analyzed and that results of the analysis showed it to be marijuana. Also over objection, the Commonwealth introduced in evidence a certificate of the chemical analysis showing the substance to be marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 1009, 1015, 121 S.E.2d 452, 456-57 (1961), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">\u201cIt was incumbent upon the Commonwealth, in proving her case against the defendant as an aider and abettor, to establish the commission of the substantive offense by . . . the principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">\u201cIn establishing the crime of the principal, his actions and declarations immediately after the alleged theft, and in furtherance thereof, connected, as they were, with other evidence of his involvement in the crime, were directly in issue in the case against the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">The same reasoning applies in the case at bar to evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>criminal conduct of Kremer, the principal in the first degree, in the time period immediately before the commission of the crime for which defendant was convicted as a principal in the, second degree. This is true even though defendant was not present. <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 627, 635, 145 S.E.2d 192, 197 (1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 942 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Eccles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 20, 197 S.E.2d 332 (1973), <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 52, 189 S.E.2d 359 (1972), and <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 545, 186 S.E.2d 51 (1972), where this court reversed convictions for controlled drug violations in which evidence was introduced showing defendants\u2019 connection with other drug offenses. Here, the Commonwealth was required to establish commission of the substantive offense by Kremer, the principal in the first degree. This was a vital issue in the case against the defendant as principal in the second degree. Evidence of the prior transaction was relevant to and admissible upon that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Defendant\u2019s final contention is that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction. He argues that the substance which Kremer sold to Wallace was not proved to be marijuana; that there was a break in the chain of evidence linking the substance Kremer sold to Spence with the substance Kremer sold to Wallace; and that, therefore, the Commonwealth did not prove the <em>corpus delicti.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Approximately one hour before the sale for which defendant was convicted as a principal in the second degree, Kremer, the principal in the first degree, made a sale to Spence of a substance that was shown by chemical analysis to be marijuana. When defendant joined Spence, Kremer and Whitlock, he encouraged them by stating that \u201che would like to sell all the \u2018weed\u2019 that day.\u201d He further aided them by suggesting where they should go to sell the \u201crest of the \u2018pot\u2019.\u201d According to Spence, marijuana is commonly referred to as \u201cweed\u201d or \u201cpot.\u201d Kremer asked Wallace if he wanted to buy some \u201cmarijuana,\u201d and defendant told Wallace \u201cthat was good \u2018weed\u2019.\u201d Defendant referred to the substance as \u201cmarijuana\u201d and said that he was supposed to get two pounds more in the near future. Additionally, Spence, a narcotics investigator trained in recognizing marijuana, identified the substance sold to Wallace as marijuana and said that the plastic baggy in which it was sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>was similar to the plastic baggy which contained the marijuana that he bought from Kremer.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Assuming, but not deciding, that there was a break in the chain of evidence linking the chemically analyzed marijuana sold by Kremer to Spence with the substance Kremer sold to Wallace, there was independent evidence sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the substance sold to Wallace was marijuana. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant knew the substance was marijuana, and that he participated in its distribution as a principal in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The judgment appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
