On direct examination, Mrs. Folden, who had previously been convicted on a guilty plea as Largin\u2019s accomplice and was awaiting sentencing, testified that she had participated with Largin in the burglary; that she was not divorced from her husband; that Largin had fathered her month-old child; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>she was still in love with Largin. On cross-examination, she testified that Largin \u201cmay have\u201d told her that he did not want to marry her; that her attorney had told her that the Commonwealth would recommend a suspended sentence in her case; and that she was \u201choping for that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Under the limited writ of error, Largin contends that the trial court erred \u201cin admitting into evidence the allegation of Carolyn Folden that Daniel Bruce Largin was the father of her illegitimate child.\u201d Largin argues that a witness is presumed to be truthful; that this presumption subsists until his truthfulness is attacked; and that the general rule is that until a witness is impeached, evidence designed to enhance his credibility is inadmissible. Conceding the general rule, the Commonwealth argues that when the witness is an accomplice the rule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">We agree with the Commonwealth. As we said in <em>Blount </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 807, 810, 195 S.E.2d 693, 695 (1973), \u201c[although the jury may convict an accused upon the unsupported testimony, of an accomplice, such evidence should be received and acted upon with great caution.\u201d This is so because, in the words of the instruction granted at Largin\u2019s request, \u201cthe source 'of such evidence is tainted with the temptation to exculpate [oneself] by laying the crime upon another\u201d. When a witness confesses complicity in the criminal act with which the defendant is charged, or when his complicity is otherwise shown, the presumption of truthfulness no longer prevails, the witness stands impeached, and evidence enhancing credibility, if otherwise competent, is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">But Largin insists that the evidence used to enhance Mrs. Folden\u2019s credibility was incompetent for other reasons. He says that it was irrelevant and that it \u201chad the effect of accusing the defendant of committing the misdemeanor of fornication, showing him to be a person of poor moral character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">We hold that Mrs. Folden\u2019s testimony that Largin was the father of her illegitimate child tended to show a bias in favor of the defendant and was therefore relevant to enhance the credibility of her testimony incriminating the defendant. Relevance was not impaired by the fact that the act of conception occurred some ten months before the testimony was given, because the witness testified that she was still in love with Largin.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Whether, when the charge is other than a sexual offense, evidence of illicit sexual relations between a witness and a defendant is competent depends upon the probative function it serves. In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>201 Va. 321, 111 S.E.2d 396 (1959), such evidence was adduced by the Commonwealth <em>on </em>cross-examination of the defendant and the wife of the deceased. We rejected Adams\u2019 claim of prejudice and ruled that the Commonwealth\u2019s questions \u201crelated to the credibility of these witnesses and the weight which should be given their testimony, and they were admissible for that purpose.\u201d 201 Va. at 326, 111 S.E.2d at 399-400. <em>See also Rasnake </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 677, 702, 115 S.E. 543, 551 (1923), where we affirmed the rule announced in homicide cases that evidence of \u201cthe illicit relations of a witness to the deceased ... is always admissible, as tending to show the bias of the witness, whether elicited upon the examination or cross-examination of the witness.\u201d While in both <em>Adams </em>and <em>Rasnake </em>the probative function of the evidence was to <em>impeach </em>the witness\u2019 credibility, the logic of the rule applies with equal force when the probative function is to <em>enhance </em>the witness\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Such was the primary probative function here. For that function, the evidence was competent. Where the <em>sole </em>probative function served by evidence of former criminal conduct unrelated to the crime charged is to show the defendant\u2019s general propensity to engage in criminal activities, the evidence is incompetent. <em>See Day </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 907, 86 S.E.2d 23 (1955); <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 426, 53 S.E.2d 141 (1949). But where such evidence also serves another probative function for which it is competent, admission of the evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. If he determines that the evidence is admissible, he must, upon request, grant an appropriate instruction cautioning the jury not to consider it for any purpose other than the purpose for which it is competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Here, that purpose was to enhance the credibility of Mrs. Folden\u2019s testimony incriminating the defendant. The primary probative function of her testimony concerning her intimate relationship with the defendant was to show her bias in favor of the defendant flowing from that relationship, not to show defendant\u2019s iVegal act in participating in that relationship. The trial judge determined that the value of that probative function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>outweighed any incidental prejudicial effect the evidence may have had. We cannot say that he abused his discretion. And since Largin made no request-for a cautionary instruction, its omission does not constitute reversible error. <em>See Blount </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>213 Va. at 811, 195 S.E.2d at 696 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
