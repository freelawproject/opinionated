Supp. 1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By final judgment order entered April 16, 1973, the trial court imposed a penalty of 10 years in the penitentiary to run concurrently with another sentence imposed the same day upon a November 3, 1972 conviction of a malicious wounding offense committed January 7. 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Just before midnight, October 13, 1972, at Courtland Recreation Center where a dance was in progress, a group of undetermined number was assembled in the parking lot watching two young men, Pete Whitfield and Larry Wrenn, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>were arguing and wrestling. Among the group were James Ford, Ronald Whitney (who was also engaged in argument with Wrenn), and Whitney\u2019s brother. Ronald Whitney testified, \u201cI did hear my brother say, go on James I ain\u2019t got nothing else to say, like that.\u201d Ford left, but the record does not show where he went. However, a short time later, Ronald Whitney also left and, after driving one and one-half miles, met Ford returning to the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Just after midnight, David Price, a deputy sheriff off-duty, stopped by the center to talk with Joseph Harris, Sr., a special policeman in attendance at the dance. Harris assured him that there had been no \u201cdisturbance\u201d at the dance. As the two officers were walking to Price\u2019s car, they heard a \u201ccommotion\u201d near the light in the parking lot. Price testified that \u201csome type of argument\u201d was in progress which \u201cceased as we approached\u201d. Price saw Ford standing behind three young men and noticed that he was holding a \u201csawed-off\u201d shotgun at his side with the muzzle pointed at the ground. Price said that he \u201ccalled to the defendant and asked what he was doing with the gun, and told him he didn\u2019t need it there, and he made about two steps backwards and he turned and ran off in the dark towards the bushes\u201d. Ford returned a few minutes later and, when asked for the shotgun, denied that he had one. Price ordered Ford from the premises and, using a flashlight and the headlights of his car, began searching the area into which Ford had fled. During the search at approximately 1:00 a.m., Price came upon Ford near the edge of a road \u201clooking down like he was looking for something\u201d. Nearby, Price found a \u201csawed-off\u201d, 12-gauge shotgun which he carried to the sheriff\u2019s office and impounded. Ford was not arrested until 6:00 p.m. that afternoon. No other arrests were made on account of anything which occurred at the parking lot that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Price found no shells in the shotgun, in the area where it was discovered, in the parking lot, or on Ford\u2019s person. Other Commonwealth witnesses testified that the shotgun was operable and that the state had no record of its registration in Ford\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Ford testified that he had purchased the shotgun for $20 from an unidentified \u201cdude\u201d in a poolroom about 5:30 p.m. on October 13, 1972; that he placed it in the trunk of his car; that when he stopped by the parking lot after attending a football game, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>took it out to show to two friends; that he knew it was \u201cillegal\u201d and was unaware of the 24-hour registration grace period; and that when Price saw him holding it, he \u201cpanicked\u201d and ran because he was \u201calready out on bond\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Assigning error to the trial court\u2019s rulings against his pretrial motion, his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, and his motion to set aside the \u201cverdict\u201d and relying on <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 85 (1968), and <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 273, 191 S.E.2d 727 (1972), Ford argues first that \u201cthe registration required by Section 18.1-268.7 of the Code of Virginia violates. . .[his] privilege against self-incrimination.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 273, 276, 191 S.E.2d 727, 730 (1972) we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201cIn the case at bar, Riley did not assert his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in the court below. In our view the registry provisions of \u00a7 18.1-268.7 are not unconstitutional per se. The General Assembly may restrict the possession or use of a \u2018sawed-off\u2019 shotgun by requiring its registration with law enforcement authorities, and constitutional objections may be met by a proper assertion of a claim of privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Here, the claim was timely asserted, exception was properly preserved, and error was specifically assigned. Having already decided that the registry provisions are facially constitutional, we must now decide whether application of those provisions to Ford violated the privilege he claims. More precisely, we must consider whether application of those provisions compelled Ford to furnish information which, if furnished, tended to incriminate him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">\u201cTension between the State\u2019s demand for disclosures and the protection of the right against self-incrimination is likely to give rise to serious questions. Inevitably these must be resolved in terms of balancing the public need on the one hand, and the individual claim to constitutional protections on the other; neither interest can be treated lightly.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>402 U.S. 424, 427 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The privilege against self-incrimination does not reach to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>every hazard the registration requirement might conceivably pose. The standard is whether the requirement \u201ccreated for petitioner \u2018real and appreciable,\u2019 and not merely \u2018imaginary and unsubstantial,\u2019 hazards of self-incrimination\u201d, <em>Marchetti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 39, 48 (1968), or \u201cwhether the claimant is confronted by substantial and \u2018real,\u2019 and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination.\u201d 390 U.S. at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Against that standard, we test the merit of Ford\u2019s claim. Ford says that the registration requirements of Code \u00a7 18.1-268.7 expose him, first, to substantial hazards of prosecution under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.1-268.3, -268.4, and, second, to substantial hazards of prosecution under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 85 (1968), upon which Ford principally relies, the Supreme Court was concerned with the hazard, posed by registration under the old National Firearms Act, that registrants would be prosecuted for violations of other sections of that Act. Upholding the defendant\u2019s claim of privilege against self-incrimination, Mr. Justice Harlan found that \u201cthe correlation between obligations to register and violations can only be regarded as exceedingly high, and ... it can scarcely be said that the risks of criminal prosecution confronted by prospective registrants are \u2018remote possibilities out of the ordinary course of law \u2019 \u201d. 390 U.S. at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">So far as Ford is concerned, we find in the Sawed-Off Shotgun Act no such correlation between the obligation to register and violations of its criminal provisions. Only one of the four presumptions created by Code \u00a7 18.1-268.4 is activated by the act of registration; under Code \u00a7 18.1-268.4(2), if, at the time of registration, the registrant is \u201can unnaturalized foreign-born person\u201d or if, prior to registration, he \u201chas been convicted of a crime of violence\u201d, possession of a sawed-off shotgun is \u201cpresumed to be for an offensive or aggressive purpose.\u201d The very act of registration establishes the fact of possession, and the registration records reflect the name and address of the possessor. If law enforcement authorities routinely cross-check that data against other records available to them to determine whether the registrant is a person named in Code \u00a7 18.1-268.4(2) (a practice the evidence does not establish), a prospective registrant would have standing to argue that the registration requirements subject him to a substantial hazard of prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.1-268.3 in violation of his privilege against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>self-incrimination. We do not decide that question. It is not before us. Ford was not such a person and has no standing to complain of such a hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">But Ford argues that registration \u201cwould facilitate the investigation -and prosecution of the defendant under Section 18.1-268.3 if, subsequent to registration, he were convicted of a crime of violence\u201d, thus activating the presumption created by Code \u00a7 18.1-268.4(2). In fact, subsequent to the date registration was required, Ford was convicted of a crime of violence committed before that date. But even if Ford had registered his shotgun, the incriminating presumption would not have arisen and Ford would not have been exposed to a hazard of prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.1-268.3 if he were acquitted of the crime of violence or if, before conviction of the crime of violence, he had dispossessed himself of the shotgun. Such a contingent hazard, one which Ford himself had the power to prevent, is not a substantial hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Nor are we impressed with the self-incrimination argument that registrants of \u201csawed-off\u201d shotguns are members of a select and suspect class likely to commit future crimes and that their identification in registration records exposes them to a conspicuous hazard of investigation and prosecution for such crimes. Ford relies upon the comment in <em>Marchetti </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 54, that \u201c[prospective registrants can reasonably expect that registration . . . will significantly enhance the likelihood of their prosecution for future acts, and that it will readily provide evidence which will facilitate their convictions.\u201d That comment must be viewed in light of the statement which preceded it that \u201cthe acquisition of a federal gambling tax stamp, requiring as it does the declaration of a present intent to commence gambling activities, obliges even a prospective gambler to accuse himself of a conspiracy to violate either state gambling prohibitions, or federal laws\u201d. 390 U.S. at 52-53. Also instructive is the sequent statement in the same paragraph from which Ford quotes that \u201c [insubstantial claims of the privilege as to entirely prospective acts may certainly be asserted, but . . . they need only be considered when a litigant has the temerity to pursue them.\u201d 390 U.S. at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Guided by the following language of Mr. Justice Douglas in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>more recent opinion, we hold that the claims Ford has pursued are \u201cinsubstantial\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">\u201cAppellees\u2019 argument assumes the existence of a periphery of the Self-Incrimination Clause which protects a person against incrimination not only against past or present transgressions but which supplies insulation for a career of crime about to be launched. We cannot give the Self-Incrimination Clause such an expansive interpretation.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 606-7 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We turn now to Ford\u2019s argument that the registration requirement exposes him to the hazard of prosecution under federal law. As he points out, it is a violation of federal law for a person \u201cto receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him\u201d by the person from whom he acquired it. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). Assuming that Ford was guilty of such a violation, the question remains whether registration under the Virginia Act would have exposed him to a \u201creal and appreciable\u201d hazard of prosecution for that violation. In <em>Marchetti </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Grosso </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 62 (1968); <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>United States, supra; </em>and <em>Leary </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U.S. 6 (1969), the registration or tax information required by the federal laws was, as a matter of Congressional purpose or as a matter of administrative practice, disclosed to federal or state law enforcement authorities, and the Supreme Court held that such disclosures exposed the registrant or taxpayer to a substantial hazard of prosecution under federal or state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Where there is no such purpose or practice, those cases do not control. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>411 F.2d 1109 (4th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 931 (1969). In <em>Walden, </em>the defendants claimed that federal registration of their distillery would have incriminated them under state law which prohibited the manufacture of all liquor. Although the federal alcohol tax laws were silent as to dissemination or suppression of registration information, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\u201cHowever, unlike the situation in <em>Marchetti, </em>the record does not suggest a practice nor a congressional purpose of making available to state officers the information obtained. . . . Absent proof of such a practice, or at the very least, proof of purpose of federal agents to report still registrations to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>prosecuting authority, appellants Walden fail to establish that they would have been substantially endangered by compliance with the federal statutes. That alone distinguishes <em>Marchetti-Grosso-Haynes.\u201d </em>411 F.2d at 1112-13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><em>See also United States </em>v. <em>20 \u201cDealer's Choice\u201d Mach. </em>&amp; <em>C. Con. of $3.50, </em>483 F.2d 474 (4th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Except for the provision in Code \u00a7 18.1-268.7 that \u201cregistration data shall not be subject to inspection by the public\u201d, the Sawed-Off Shotgun Act is silent as to dissemination or suppression of that data. As in <em>Walden, </em>nothing in the record reveals any administrative practice of disclosing that data to the law enforcement authorities of another sovereign. From this record, we hold that the registration requirements of the Act did not expose Ford to a substantial hazard of federal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Finding no merit in Ford\u2019s claim that the registration requirements violate his privilege against self-incrimination, we consider next whether the evidence is sufficient to raise any of the presumptions created by the four subsections of Code \u00a7 18.1-268.4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">As to the first and second presumptions, the Commonwealth concedes on appeal that the evidence is insufficient and relies on the third and fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">As to the third, Ford contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the presumption raised by non-registration because there was no proof that the weapon introduced as an exhibit was a \u201c \u2018sawed-off\u2019 shotgun\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 18.1-268.1. Since that question is raised for the first time on appeal, we do not notice it. Rule 5:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Ford further contends that the third presumption is not supported by the evidence because the Commonwealth did not prove that he possessed the shotgun longer than the 24-hour registration grace period, and therefore there was no proof of failure to register within the meaning of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.1-268.4(3), -268.7. The general rule is that when the defendant claims that he falls within an exception to a penal statute, he has the burden of proving that defense. <em>McKelvey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>260 U.S. 353, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>357 (1922); <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>107 Va. 860, 864, 60 S.E. 37, 39 (1922). The logic of the rule is reinforced where, as here, the facts and circumstances underlying the exception (or grace period) are matters peculiarly within the defendant\u2019s knowledge. <em>See </em>C. Torcia, 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 14 (21-23) (13th ed. 1972). Although Ford testified that he had acquired the shotgun for $20 from a \u201cdude\u201d in a poolroom and had possessed it only nine hours before it was taken from him, we cannot say that the trial court erred in disregarding that evidence as incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Accordingly, we believe that the evidence was sufficient to show that Ford failed to register the shotgun as required by law and was, therefore, sufficient to raise the presumption created by Code \u00a7 18.1-268.4(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">However, we hold that the evidence was insufficient to raise the presumption created by Code \u00a7 18.1-268.4(4), because it was insufficient to support a finding that Ford possessed the shotgun \u201cunder circumstances indicating his preparation to participate in a riot or civil disturbance or his preparation for the commission of a crime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The record shows that at the time Ford was seen in possession of the shotgun, there was no wrestling or other physical conflict in progress. What attracted the attention of the officers was a verbal altercation which ceased as they approached the group. They witnessed no conduct which prompted them to make an arrest for disorderly conduct, breach of the peace, or any other offense. But we need not decide whether a \u201criot\u201d or \u201ccivil disturbance\u201d was in progress or whether either was imminent, for we are of opinion that the evidence does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201ccircumstances indicating\u201d that Ford was preparing to participate in a riot or civil disturbance or to commit a crime of violence. Ford was seen standing in the group with the muzzle of the shotgun pointed at the ground. No shells were found in the shotgun, on Ford\u2019s person, or elsewhere. There was no evidence that Ford engaged in the verbal altercation or that he made any verbal threat or menacing gesture. Possession of a \u201csawed-off\u201d shotgun under the circumstances disclosed by this record is not sufficient to show preparation to participate in unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The record does not tell us upon what statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>presumption the trial judge relied in finding Ford guilty. It may be that he relied upon the presumption created by Code \u00a7 18.1-268.4(3) which we have said the evidence supports. But it may be that he relied upon one of the other presumptions created by the statute. We cannot speculate at Ford\u2019s expense. As we said in reversing a jury conviction under this Act which may have been based upon an unsupported presumption, \u201cit cannot be known upon which presumption the jury based its verdict.\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>213 Va. at 277, 191 S.E.2d at 730. For the same reason, the judgment here must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> Insofar as relevant, the \u201cSawed-Off Shotgun Act\u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201c\u00a7 18.1-268.3.
