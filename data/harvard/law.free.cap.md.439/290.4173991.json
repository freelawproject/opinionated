On March 22, 2011, Capital One, N.A. (\u201cCapital One\u201d), the holder of Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account, notified the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner, that a check in the amount of $2,000 had been presented without sufficient funds present in the attorney trust account, resulting in an overdraft in the amount of $1,548.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">On February 26, 2013, on the Commission\u2019s behalf, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Mungin, charging him with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 1.1 (Competence), 1.15 (Safekeeping Property), 8.4(b) (Criminal Act), 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation), 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice), and 8.4(a) (Violating the MLRPC), Maryland Rule 16-607 (Commingling of Funds), Maryland Rule 16-609 (Prohibited Transactions), and Md.Code Ann., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Bus.

On July 8 and 25, 2013, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On October 18, 2013, the hearing judge filed in this Court findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Mungin had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 8.4(d), and 8.4(a), Maryland Rule 16-609(a)-(c), and BOP \u00a7 10-306, but had not violated MLRPC 8.4(b) or MLRPC 8.4(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On June 4, 2014, we heard oral argument. For the below reasons, we indefinitely suspend Mungin from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In her opinion, the hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">On March 7, 2005, this Court admitted Mungin to the Bar of Maryland. In 2006, Mungin became a solo practitioner and opened an office in Greenbelt, Maryland. On or about March 21, 2011, Mungin presented a check in the amount of $2,000, drawn on his attorney trust account, for payment to Capital One, the holder of his attorney trust account. Presentment of the check caused an overdraft of the attorney trust account in the amount of $1,548.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">On or about April 7, 2011, Mungin received from Bar Counsel a certified letter requesting an explanation for the overdraft. On August 30, 2011, Bar Counsel subpoenaed Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account records for the period be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>tween May 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011. The records revealed that, in May 2010, Mungin made three cash withdrawals from his attorney trust account totaling $500: one withdrawal of $100 in cash and two withdrawals of $200 in cash. Bar Counsel discovered that Mungin had mishandled his attorney trust account in connection with nine separate client matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>Trina Coore Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On May 11, 2009, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $8,000 on behalf of his client, Trina Coore (\u201cCoore\u201d), received pursuant to a settlement in Coore\u2019s personal injury case. Of the settlement funds, $1,743.83 was to be paid to Coore\u2019s medical providers, and $2,665 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, $1,146 was to be paid to Physiotherapy Associates, $561.09 was to be paid to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital, and $36.74 was to be paid to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital/ER Division. On May 13, 2009, Mungin transferred $5,000 in funds from his attorney trust account to his operating account. On May 20, 2009, Mungin issued to Coore a check in the amount of $3,219.90, drawn on Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In June 2009, Mungin failed to maintain $1,743.83 in the attorney trust account for the outstanding balances owed to Coore\u2019s medical providers. On June 9, 2009, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to $565. On June 24, 2009, Mungin was out of trust<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Coore matter, and Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to $28.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">On July 7, 2009, Mungin issued a second check to Coore in the amount of $451.97, drawn on Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account. On the same day, Coore and Mungin signed Coore\u2019s settlement report, which stated: \u201cI hereby approve the entire settlement and distribution made herein and assume full responsibility for all bills incurred by me in connection with this accident not listed above[.]\u201d (Capitalization omitted). Coore\u2019s settlement report also stated: \u201cAmended Settlement because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital partial payment bill.\u201d The settlement report listed the partial payment to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital as $109.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">On July 14, 2009, Mungin issued checks to Coore\u2019s medical providers on Coore\u2019s behalf in the following amounts: $1,146 to Physiotherapy Associates; $109.12 to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital; and $36.74 to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital/ER Division. The check issued to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital on Coore\u2019s behalf was mistakenly issued in the amount of $109.12, instead of $561.09. Mungin did not pay the remaining balance of $451.97 owed to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital; and the second check to Coore on July 7, 2009, in the amount of $451.97, was issued in error and should have been issued to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\n<em>Bruce Joyner Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">On June 29, 2009, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $7,200 on behalf of his client, Bruce Joyner (\u201cJoyner\u201d), received pursuant to a settlement in Joyner\u2019s personal injury case. Of the settlement funds, $4,678.32 was to be paid to Joyner\u2019s medical providers, and $2,258.68 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, $142.32 was to be paid to Laurel Regional Hospital Emergency Room, $299 was to be paid to Laurel Regional Hospital Doctors Visit, and $4,237 was to be paid to New Carrollton Therapy Center. On June 29, 2009, Joyner and Mungin signed Joyner\u2019s settlement report, which stated: \u201cI hereby approve the entire settlement and distribution made herein and assume full responsibility for all bills incurred by me in connection with this accident not listed above.\u201d (Capitalization omitted). Joyner\u2019s settlement report listed distributions to the three medical providers, even though the liens were not satisfied until February 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">On July 6, 2009, Mungin issued to Joyner a check in the amount of $3,500, drawn on his attorney trust account. On October 22, 2009, Mungin issued to Joyner a second check in the amount of $298 as reimbursement of funds that Joyner had paid to an emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Between June 29, 2009, and December 11, 2009, Mungin transferred funds from his attorney trust account to his operating account. On December 11, 2009, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to - $4.92. Mungin was out of trust in the Joyner matter. On February 16, 2010, Mungin issued a check to New Carrollton Therapy Center on Joyner\u2019s behalf in the amount of $1,000, and issued a second check to Laurel Regional Hospital on Joyner\u2019s behalf in the amount of $139.47. After receiving the settlement funds in the Joyner matter on June 29, 2009, Mungin paid himself $64,200 in attorney\u2019s fees,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but failed to timely satisfy the liens owed to Joyner\u2019s medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>Waikia Williams Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">On July 21, 2009, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $8,700 on behalf of his client, Waikia Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d), received pursuant to a settlement in Williams\u2019s personal injury case. Of the settlement funds, $1,250.50 was to be paid to Williams\u2019s three medical providers, and $2,900 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. From July 23, 2009, through July 29, 2009, Mungin transferred $3,850 from his attorney trust account to his operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">On July 29, 2009, Mungin issued to Williams a check in the amount of $4,549.50, drawn on his attorney trust account. On the same day, Mungin issued checks to two of Williams\u2019s medical providers on Williams\u2019s behalf in the amounts of $100.50 and $150. On December 11, 2009, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to -$4.92, and the third medical provider had an outstanding lien in the amount of $1,000. From July 21, 2009, until February 16, 2010, Mungin was required to continuously maintain $1,000 in trust for payment to the third medical provider; Mungin failed to do so. On February 16, 2010, Mungin issued a check to the third medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>provider on Williams\u2019s behalf in the amount of $1,000. The issuance of the check to the third medical provider invaded trust monies held for other clients and/or third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\n<em>Jonathan Roberts Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">On August 7, 2009, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $8,500 on behalf of his client, Jonathan Roberts (\u201cRoberts\u201d), received pursuant to a settlement in Roberts\u2019s personal injury case. Of the settlement funds, $3,719.20 was to be paid to Roberts\u2019s medical providers, and $2,300 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, $1,719.20 was to be paid to Physiotherapy Associates (\u201cPhysiotherapy\u201d), and $2,000 was to be paid to Bezak Chiropractic and Rehabilitation (\u201cBezak\u201d). From August 7, 2009, through August 13, 2009, Mungin transferred $4,000 from his attorney trust account to his operating account. After receiving the settlement funds, Mungin received telephone calls from Physiotherapy and Bezak, which requested payment of their outstanding liens. Mungin failed to satisfy the liens at that time, and instead transferred funds that should have been used to satisfy the liens from his attorney trust account to his operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On December 11, 2009, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to -$4.92. On May 20, 2010, for the first time, Mungin disbursed settlement funds in the Roberts matter, when he issued to Roberts a check in the amount of $2,480, drawn on his attorney trust account. In September 2012, over three years after receiving the settlement funds, Mungin satisfied the medical liens owed to Physiotherapy and Bezak on Roberts\u2019s behalf. Specifically, on September 28, 2012, Mungin issued checks to Physiotherapy and Bezak on Roberts\u2019s behalf, drawn on his operating account because the funds had not been maintained in his attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\n<em>Tekema Baker Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">On or about October 29, 2009, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $4,000 on behalf of his client, Tekema Baker (\u201cBaker\u201d), received pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ant to a settlement in Baker\u2019s personal injury case. Of the settlement funds, $1,000 was to be paid to Rising Health Chiropractors (\u201cRising Health\u201d), Baker\u2019s medical provider, and $1,333.33 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. On October 30, 2009, Mungin transferred $2,600 from his attorney trust account to his operating account. On November 6, 2009, Mungin issued to Baker a check in the amount of $1,556.67, drawn on Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account. On the same day, Baker and Mungin signed Baker\u2019s settlement report, which stated: \u201cI hereby approve the entire settlement and distribution made herein and assume full responsibility for all bills incurred by me in connection with this accident not listed above[.]\u201d (Capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In December 2009, there were several dates on which Mungin failed to maintain $1,000 in his attorney trust account for the outstanding balance owed to Rising Health. On December 11, 2009, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to - $4.92. Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance remained below $1,000 until December 15, 2009, when other client funds replenished Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account. On December 24, 2009, on Baker\u2019s behalf, Mungin finally issued to Rising Health a check in the amount of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\n<em>Michael Jenkins Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">On November 24, 2009, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $4,200 on behalf of his client, Michael Jenkins (\u201cJenkins\u201d), received pursuant to a settlement in Jenkins\u2019s personal injury case. Of the settlement funds, $1,830 was to be paid to Rising Health, Jenkins\u2019s medical provider, and $1,300 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Between November 24, 2009, and December 9, 2009, Mungin transferred funds from his attorney trust account to his operating account. On December 9, 2009, after receiving a reduction from Rising Health (from $1,830 to $1,500), Mungin issued to Jenkins a check in the amount of $1,500, drawn on Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">On December 11, 2009, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to - $4.92. As of March 19, 2010, Mungin\u2019s attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ney trust account balance was $283.10. At various times since receiving the settlement funds on November 24, 2009, Mungin was out of trust in the Jenkins matter in the amount of $1,500. On April 13, 2010, on Jenkins\u2019s behalf, Mungin finally issued to Rising Health a check in the amount of $1,500, using other client funds deposited into the attorney trust account after March 19, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\n<em>Robin Whitehurst Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On February 2, 2010, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $7,000 on behalf of his client, Robin Whitehurst (\u201cWhitehurst\u201d), received pursuant to a settlement in Whitehurst\u2019s personal injury case. Of the settlement funds, $1,000 was to be paid to Optimum Care Center, Whitehurst\u2019s medical provider, and $2,800 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. From February 2, 2010, through March 12, 2010, Mungin transferred $19,600 from his attorney trust account into his operating account. On March 12, 2010, Mungin issued to Whitehurst a check in the amount of $3,050, drawn on his attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">From February 2, 2010, until June 4, 2010, Mungin was required to continuously maintain $1,000 in trust for the Whitehurst matter for payment to Optimum Care Center; Mungin failed to do so. As of March 19, 2010, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance was $283.10. On April 22, 2010, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to $6.77. On June 4, 2010, on Whitehurst\u2019s behalf, Mungin finally issued to Optimum Care Center a check in the amount of $1,000. The check\u2019s issuance invaded funds deposited after receipt of the settlement funds in the Whitehurst matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\n<em>Troy James Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">On May 14, 2010, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $14,000 on behalf of his client, Troy James (\u201cJames\u201d), received pursuant to a settlement in James\u2019s personal injury case. Of the settlement funds, $2,501.80 was to be paid to Optimum Care, James\u2019s medical provider, and $4,666.66 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>fees. From May 17, 2010, until May 21, 2020, Mungin transferred $6,400 in attorney\u2019s fees from his attorney trust account to his operating account. On May 18, 2010, Mungin received confirmation from Optimum Care that the total outstanding balance owed by James would be reduced from $2,501.80 to $2,000. On May 19, 2010, Mungin issued to James a check in the amount of $6,431.54, drawn on Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account. On May 26, 2010, Mungin issued to James a second check in the amount of $500, drawn on his attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">From May 28, 2010, through June 2, 2010, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance was $18.98. During that time period, Mungin failed to maintain $2,000 in his attorney trust account for the outstanding balance owed to Optimum Care. On June 4, 2010, using other client funds deposited into his attorney trust account, on James\u2019s behalf, Mungin issued to Optimum Care a check in the amount of $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\n<em>LaToya Evans Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On August 2, 2010, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $4,750 and on August 3, 2010, Mungin deposited into his attorney trust account a check in the amount of $4,750; both checks were deposited on behalf of his client, LaToya Evans (\u201cEvans\u201d), received pursuant to a settlement in Evans\u2019s personal injury case. Of the settlement funds (totaling $9,500), $3,200 was to be paid to Align Spine Health Center (\u201cAlign Spine\u201d), Evans\u2019s medical provider, and $3,000 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Between August 4, 2010, and August 14, 2010, Mungin transferred $6,350 from his attorney trust account to his operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">On August 30, 2010, Mungin issued a check to Evans in the amount of $3,500, drawn on Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account. Mungin should have maintained an additional $3,200 in his attorney trust account for the outstanding balance owed to Align Spine. As of September 2, 2010, however, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance was $250.78. Thus, Mungin failed to continuously maintain $3,200 in trust for Align Spine. As of September 7, 2010, other client funds had replenished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account. On September 7, 2010, Mungin issued to Align Spine on Evans\u2019s behalf a check in the amount of $3,200. The check\u2019s issuance invaded trust monies held for other clients and/or third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\n<em>Hearing Judge\u2019s Other Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Starting in late 2008, Mungin began experiencing a series of personal difficulties that impacted his ability to maintain the business portion of his solo practice. During that time period, Mungin reconciled his attorney trust account once a month, at best. In Fall 2008, Mungin\u2019s wife was arrested for drunk driving following a single-car accident. It was discovered that Mungin\u2019s wife suffered from alcoholism and would need to undergo treatment. This caused a strain on the marriage and eventually led to Mungin\u2019s and his wife\u2019s divorce in 2011. And, starting in 2009, Mungin\u2019s son<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> began exhibiting symptoms of serious substance abuse, eventually leading to his son\u2019s placement into rehabilitation facilities. As a result of these difficulties, at the end of 2008, on numerous occasions, Mungin visited a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Mungin did not deny that he mishandled his attorney trust account with respect to nine separate client matters. Mungin has since hired an accounting firm to help keep track of his books and reconcile his accounts. Mungin reconciles his attorney trust account weekly, and has not had any problems with his attorney trust account since Bar Counsel filed the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Numerous character reference letters were submitted on Mungin\u2019s behalf, including letters from judges in Prince George\u2019s County and from practicing attorneys.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All of the letters\u2019 authors describe Mungin as trustworthy. The evidence was insufficient to support a finding that Mungin en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>gaged in dishonesty, fraud, or deceit in handling his attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md.

The Commission excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Mungin did not violate MLRPC 8.4(c). For the below reasons, we overrule the exception and uphold all of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">MLRPC 1.1 (Competence)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\u201cA lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.

James, </em>385 Md. 637, 662, 870 A.2d 229, 244 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in original). A lawyer fails to properly maintain a client\u2019s settlement monies in an attorney trust account by having a negative attorney trust account balance and not maintaining sufficient funds in the attorney trust account for payment to clients. <em>See id. </em>at 662, 870 A.2d at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Mungin violated MLRPC 1.1. Mungin failed to properly maintain clients\u2019 settlement monies in his attorney trust account. On two occasions, December 11, 2009, and March 21, 2011, Mungin\u2019s lack of attention to, and proper maintenance of, his attorney trust account resulted in a nega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>tive balance. Mungin also failed to promptly and accurately disburse settlement funds to third-party medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Specifically, on Coore\u2019s behalf, Mungin erroneously issued to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital a check in the amount of $109.12, instead of $561.09, the amount owed. Mungin failed to pay the remaining balance, resulting in a lien owed to Doctor\u2019s Community Hospital. In addition, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on May 11, 2009, Mungin did not issue checks to medical providers on Coore\u2019s behalf until July 14, 2009. In the Joyner matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on June 29, 2009, Mungin did not issue checks to medical providers on Joyner\u2019s behalf until February 16, 2010. In the Williams matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on July 21, 2009, Mungin did not issue a check to one of Williams\u2019s three medical providers on Williams\u2019s behalf until February 16, 2010. In the Roberts matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on August 7, 2009, Mungin did not issue checks to Physiotherapy and Bezak on Roberts\u2019s behalf until September 28, 2012, over three years after receipt of the funds. In the Baker matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on October 29, 2009, Mungin did not issue a check to Baker\u2019s medical provider on Baker\u2019s behalf until December 24, 2009. In the Jenkins matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on November 24, 2009, Mungin did not issue a check to Jenkins\u2019s medical provider on Jenkins\u2019s behalf until April 13, 2010. In the Whitehurst matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on February 2, 2010, Mungin did not issue a check to Whitehurst\u2019s medical provider on Whitehurst\u2019s behalf until June 4, 2010. In the James matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on May 14, 2010, Mungin did not issue a check to James\u2019s medical provider on James\u2019s behalf until June 4, 2010. And, in the Evans matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on August 2, 2010, and August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>3, 2010, Mungin did not issue a check to Evans\u2019s medical provider on Evans\u2019s behalf until September 7, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Finally, Mungin failed to maintain sufficient funds in his attorney trust account for payment to medical providers; <em>i.e., </em>Mungin was out of trust in client matters. For example, in the Baker matter, in December 2009, there were several dates on which Mungin failed to maintain $1,000 in his attorney trust account for the outstanding balance owed to Rising Health. On December 11, 2009, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to -$4.92. Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance remained below $1,000 until December 15, 2009, when other client funds replenished Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account. On December 24, 2009, on Baker\u2019s behalf, Mungin finally issued to Rising Health a check in the amount of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">MLRPC 1.15(a) and 1.15(d) (Safekeeping Property)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">MLRPC 1.15(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property.

As to MLRPC 1.15(a), Mungin failed to hold property of clients or third parties in trust separate from his own property. Indeed, on several occasions, Mungin transferred funds from his attorney trust account to his operating account, even though the funds should have been held in trust for the third-party medical providers. For example, in the Williams matter, on July 21, 2009, Mungin deposited the settlement cheek received on Williams\u2019s behalf. Of the settlement funds received, $1,250.50 was to be paid to Williams\u2019s three medical providers and $2,900 comprised Mungin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. From July 23, 2009, through July 29, 2009, Mungin transferred $3,850 from his attorney trust account to his operating account. In other words, Mungin transferred funds due and owing to Williams\u2019s medical providers to himself via his operating account instead of holding the funds in his attorney trust account for payment to Williams\u2019s medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">As to MLRPC 1.15(d), Mungin failed to promptly deliver to clients and third-party medical providers settlement funds to which they were entitled. For example, in the Roberts mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on August 7, 2009, Mungin did not disburse settlement funds to Roberts until May 20, 2010, almost ten months after the funds had been received, and he did not issue checks to Physiotherapy and Bezak on Roberts\u2019s behalf until September 28, 2012, more than three years after the funds had been deposited. In another example, in the Jenkins matter, despite depositing settlement funds into the attorney trust account on November 24, 2009, Mungin did not issue a check to Rising Health on Jenkins\u2019s behalf until April 13, 2010, almost five months after the funds had been received. In the Joyner matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on June 29, 2009, Mungin did not issue checks to medical providers on Joyner\u2019s behalf until February 16, 2010, more than seven months after the funds had been deposited. In the Williams matter, despite depositing settlement funds into his attorney trust account on July 21, 2009, Mungin did not issue a check to one of Williams\u2019s three medical providers on Williams\u2019s behalf until February 16, 2010, nearly seven months after the funds had been deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">MLRPC 8.4(b) provides: \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Here, the hearing judge was correct in concluding that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that Mungin had violated MLRPC 8.4(b).

DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 684, 802 A.2d 1014, 1026 (2002) (citations omitted). For example, in <em>DiCicco, id. </em>at 685, 802 A.2d at 1027, we overruled Bar Counsel\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the respondent had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c), explaining: \u201cWhile the evidence presented supports [the hearing judge]\u2019s finding of negligence or sloppiness, there is no clear and convincing evidence on this record to support a finding of dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation on [the Respondent\u2019s part. We further note the lack of clear and convincing evidence of misappropriation or actual financial loss to any of [the Respondent\u2019s clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Here, the hearing judge concluded that Mungin had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c), reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">There is no evidence in this case that supports a finding that [Mungin] engaged in any conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. It is this Court\u2019s finding that [Mungin] negligently mishandled his trust account on numerous occasions which led to the Rule violations enumerated above. The sole evidence that Bar Counsel presented to provide a violation of [MLRPC] 8.4(c) was the fact that [Mungin] had his clients sign statements of account which showed amounts due to healthcare providers which had not yet been paid. The uncontroverted testimony in this case was that [Mungin] never told his clients that those funds had already been paid at the time they signed the statements of account. Therefore, the Court does not find any evidence of dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in the handling of those statements of account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Bar Counsel contends that the hearing judge\u2019s findings establish that Mungin engaged in intentional misappropriation of funds in violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) by failing to pay third-party medical providers funds held in his attorney trust account and instead paying himself (by transferring those funds from his attorney trust account to his operating ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>count), despite notice of the outstanding liens owed to medical providers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Mungin responds that, before the hearing judge, Bar Counsel argued only that he violated MLRPC 8.4(c) by creating settlement reports, which reflected that the third-party medical providers had been paid when, in actuality, the liens owed to those medical providers had not been satisfied at the time the settlement reports were signed. Mungin contends that the argument now advanced by Bar Counsel was not made before the hearing judge and that, in any event, Bar Counsel failed to produce evidence that he engaged in intentional \u2014 as opposed to negligent \u2014 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We overrule Bar Counsel\u2019s exception and explain. At the hearing, during opening statement, Bar Counsel argued that Mungin violated MLRPC 8.4(c) \u201cby creating settlement memoranda and having [his clients] sign that reflected that the third party lien holders had been paid when [Mungin] had not yet satisfied those liens at the time.\u201d During the hearing, Mungin testified that he never represented to clients that the settlement reports meant that the medical providers had already been paid.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the extent that Bar Counsel argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>that Mungin had violated MLRPC 8.4(c) based on dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation related to the settlement reports, on this record, we do not disturb the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the evidence did not demonstrate that Mungin had lied to or deceived his clients \u2014 or that he had misrepresented information to clients \u2014 concerning the settlement reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">During closing argument, Bar Counsel contended that the errors with Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account were not \u201csmall errors just based on negligence[,]\u201d and that Mungin had knowledge of outstanding liens owed to medical providers, but \u201cintentionally did not pay the lien holders and, instead, [] transferred his fees from the trust account to the operating account.\u201d Bar Counsel specifically argued that Mungin violated MLRPC 8.4(c) by \u201cfraudulently misappropriat[ing] funds intended for third parties for his personal benefit[J\u201d In arguing that Mungin\u2019s conduct was intentional, Bar Counsel identified only the bank records and settlement reports as evidence of Mungin\u2019s intent; <em>i.e., </em>Bar Counsel offered no other evidence substantiating the argument that Mungin\u2019s actions were intentionally dishonest, fraudulent, or deceitful.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he number of times [an attorney trust] account was out of trust, standing alone, does not compel finding a violation of M[L]RPC 8.4(c) if other evidence supports a finding that the misconduct is the result of negligence, as opposed to fraud or dishonesty.\u201d <em>DiCicco, </em>369 Md. at 682-83, 802 A.2d at 1025 (citations omitted). On this record, we decline to conclude that the hearing judge erred in concluding that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that Mungin had violated MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Here, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Mungin\u2019s mishandling of his attorney trust account was negligent rather than intentional. Mungin testified about the personal issues that he experienced beginning in 2008, and the hearing judge made findings of fact concerning those difficulties. Specifically, at the hearing, Mungin testified that the personal difficulties in his life occurred during the same period of time when he had issues with his attorney trust account. According to Mungin, he was \u201coverwhelm[ed,]\u201d but \u201cdid what [he] could to work professionally, but the business part of [his] practice was suffering.\u201d In addition, numerous character reference letters were submitted by judges and practicing attorneys on Mungin\u2019s behalf attesting to his trustworthiness. In light of Mungin\u2019s testimony and the character letters submitted on his behalf, absent additional evidence of intent, the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Mungin\u2019s misconduct was negligent rather than intentional was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">As to the transfer of funds from his attorney trust account to his operating account, the Joint Stipulation of Facts that the parties submitted to the hearing judge states that the transfers of funds from Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account to his operating account following disbursement of settlement funds involved transfer of attorney\u2019s fees arising from various client matters, not just in connection with the personal injury matter that had been settled. Thus, clear and convincing evidence does not establish that Mungin intentionally misappropriated funds in a particular client matter after receipt and deposit of the settlement funds by, for example, transferring all or more than his attorney\u2019s fees in that particular client matter. And, in the Roberts matter, as to the liens that were paid to Physiotherapy and Bezak years after settlement funds had been received, at the hearing, Mungin testified that, although he received telephone calls from the medical providers concerning the liens after the settlement funds were deposited into his attorney trust account, it was not until Bar Counsel\u2019s audit in 2012 that he realized the medical providers had not been paid. Mungin testified that, once he realized the liens had not been paid, he paid them on Roberts\u2019s behalf. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>words, with his testimony, Mungin sought to establish that the non-payment of the two liens was due to an oversight, <em>i.e., </em>negligence, not an intent to withhold or misappropriate the monies from the medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">On this record, we will not disturb the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that Mungin had violated MLRPC 8.4(c), and did not clearly err in finding that Mungin\u2019s misconduct was negligent rather than intentional. <em>Cf.

Mun-gin mishandled his attorney trust account with respect to nine separate client matters. Mungin was out of trust in each of the nine client matters, and failed to properly account for and disburse funds in a prompt fashion. Several disbursements to clients and third-party medical providers resulted in an invasion of trust monies held for other clients and/or third parties. And, medical providers did not receive prompt payment of liens as a result of Mungin\u2019s misconduct.

As to Maryland Rule 16-609(a), Mungin used funds from his attorney trust account for unauthorized purposes. Mungin transferred funds from his attorney trust account to his operating account, despite that the funds should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>held in trust for third-party medical providers; <em>i.e., </em>Mungin transferred funds due and owing to clients\u2019 medical providers to himself via his operating account instead of holding the funds in the attorney trust account for payment to the medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">As to Maryland Rule 16 \u2014 609(b), in May 2010, Mungin made three cash withdrawals from his attorney trust account totaling $500. Specifically, on May 7, 2010, Mungin withdrew $100 in cash from the attorney trust account; on May 10, 2010, Mungin withdrew $200 in cash from the attorney trust account; and on May 12, 2010, Mungin withdrew $200 in cash from the attorney trust account. These cash withdrawals violated Maryland Rule 16-609(b)\u2019s prohibition against cash withdrawals from attorney trust accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Finally, as to Maryland Rule 16 \u2014 609(c), on two occasions, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account\u2019s balance was negative. On December 11, 2009, Mungin\u2019s attorney trust account balance fell to \u2014$4.92. And, on March 22, 2011, Mungin presented a check in the amount of $2,000 for payment, drawn on his attorney trust account, even though there were insufficient funds in his attorney trust account. Presentment of the check caused an overdraft of his attorney trust account in the amount of $1,548.84.

At oral argument, Bar Counsel conceded that, if we overrule the exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Mungin had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c), then this Court should indefinitely suspend Mungin.

In concluding that the lawyer\u2019s misconduct warranted an indefinite suspension, we considered several mitigating factors, including the absence of fraudulent intent, the lack of evidence that any client suffered a financial loss due to the lawyer\u2019s misconduct, and the lack of a prior disciplinary record. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 802 A.2d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Mungin\u2019s misconduct, however, was determined to be due to negligence; <em>i.e., </em>Mungin\u2019s misconduct did not result in a finding of intentional dishonesty, fraud, or deceit. Mungin\u2019s character for trustworthiness was attested to in numerous character letters submitted on Mungin\u2019s behalf from judges and practicing lawyers. In addition, Mungin\u2019s misconduct occurred during a period of personal difficulties in his life involving his wife and teenaged son. The hearing judge found that Mungin\u2019s personal life has stabilized, and Mungin has taken steps to ensure that his attorney trust account is properly maintained, including reconciling his account on a weekly basis and hiring an accounting firm to assist with bookkeeping and reconciliation. Considering these circumstances, and determining that Mungin\u2019s misconduct merits a sanction that is greater than the indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after ninety days in <em>DiCicco </em>and <em>Sperling, </em>we conclude that the appropriate sanction for Mungin\u2019s violations of MLRPC 1.1, 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 8.4(d), and 8.4(a), Maryland Rule 16-609(a)-(e), and BOP \u00a7 10-806 is an indefinite suspension from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after six months.

Later, during closing argument, Bar Counsel also contended that Mungin violated MLRPC 8.4(c) by knowingly transferring funds in the Roberts matter from his attorney trust account to his operating account despite knowledge of the outstanding liens due to Bezak and Physiotherapy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">.

We are aware of Bar Counsel\u2019s argument that Mungin knew not to transfer funds from his attorney trust account after receiving telephone calls from Physiotherapy and Bezak. At oral argument, however, Bar Counsel candidly acknowledged a dearth of information as to the timing of the telephone calls from Physiotherapy and Bezak in relation to Mungin\u2019s conduct.

Calhoun, </em>391 Md. 532, 570, 894 A.2d 518, 540 (2006), this Court held that a lawyer violated MLRPC 8.4(c) where the lawyer violated her representation agreement by failing to properly communicate with her client regarding legal fees and costs.

In other words, Bar Counsel contended only that Mungin violated MLRPC 8.4(c) through intentional conduct, and never asserted that Mungin violated MLRPC 8.4(c) through negligent conduct. Although Mungin's negligent mishandling of his attorney trust account certainly constitutes misconduct, based on the record in this <em>case </em>\u2014 i.e., Bar Counsel\u2019s not having argued that Mungin violated MLRPC 8.4(c) through negligent conduct, and the hearing judge\u2019s not having found that Mungin\u2019s negligent conduct involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation \u2014 we refrain from concluding that the hearing judge erred in determining that Mungin had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>HARRELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4y\">concurring, which BATTAGLIA, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">I join reluctantly the Court\u2019s opinion. Although I can find no fault with the opinion, I write separately to note that, on this record, although no MLRPC 8.4(c) violations were proved, I am left to wonder whether such a violation occurred. Under the circumstances, to doubt is to affirm the hearing judge. Nonetheless, I wish to highlight the basis of my mixed emotions for consideration in the prosecution of future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">At oral argument, we posed to Bar Counsel and Mungin\u2019s Counsel several questions regarding the three cash withdrawals Mungin made from his trust account within a six-day span in May 2010. Although the lawyers were in agreement that those three cash withdrawals violated Maryland Rule 16-609(b), they offered very little explanation for why the withdrawals were made or the documentary vehicle(s) by which they were accomplished. Mungin\u2019s Counsel supposed that the record might reflect that the cash withdrawals were made by Mungin in the belief that they represented earned fees. If so, the fees would have been associated necessarily with specific client matters. When pressed, however, Mungin\u2019s Counsel could not recollect whether the record identified the particular client matters for which Mungin may have believed that he earned such fees; nor could he explain whether the timing of Mungin\u2019s work on any client\u2019s behalf coincided with the \u201ctaking\u201d of such fees, in the form of cash, from trust monies. Similar questioning of Bar Counsel about the record shed no additional light on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Upon my post-argument review of the record, it turns out that the state of counsels\u2019 recollection at argument could be explained by a dearth of evidence regarding the cash withdrawals. I located only two pieces of evidence regarding the cash withdrawals: (1) a transactional summary of Mungin\u2019s trust account showing, among all of his other transactions, that he made cash withdrawals of $100.00, $200.00, and $200.00 on 7, 10, and 12 May 2010, respectively; and, (2) an entry in the parties\u2019 Joint Stipulations before the hearing judge stating that \u201c[i]n May 2010, [Mungin] made three (3) cash withdrawals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>from his trust account totaling $500.00.\u201d Although Mungin testified at the hearing in the Circuit Court, and in a pre-trial deposition (the transcript of which was offered into evidence at the hearing), not a snippet of his direct or cross-examination testimony in either circumstance touched on the three cash withdrawals. Furthermore, no withdrawal slip, check, or other demonstrative record of the modality by which either cash withdrawal transaction was accomplished could be found in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In my view, the cash withdrawals are highly suggestive of intentional misappropriations of trust funds. Intentional misappropriations violate MLRPC 8.4(c). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Whitehead, </em>405 Md. 240, 257, 950 A.2d 798, 808 (2008) (collecting cases). Such misappropriations are \u201c \u2018act[s] infected with deceit and dishonesty and will result in disbarment in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 490, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 608-09, 541 A.2d 966, 969 (1988)). I do not contend that every Rule 16-609(b) violation constitutes an intentional misappropriation of trust monies. There must still be some evidence (direct or circumstantial) from which at least an inference may be drawn reasonably that MLRPC 8.4(c) was violated also. Had there been some evidence to show that the cash withdrawals constituted intentional misappropriations, I would have agreed with Bar Counsel that, despite Mungin\u2019s personal problems occurring at the time of the cash withdrawals, disbarment would be the appropriate sanction. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 415, 773 A.2d 463, 486 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Bar Counsel did not argue, however, that the cash withdrawals constituted MLRPC 8.4(c) violations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, Bar Counsel argued that the alleged MLRPC 8.4(c) violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>occurred when Mungin executed settlement agreements with certain clients that contained inaccurate lien information. <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 310-13, 96 A.3d at 133-35. As a result, we are left to swallow the hearing judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that inferentially the cash withdrawals were just another result of the pervasive negligent conduct of Mungin in this case. Thus, I am constrained to concur in the Court\u2019s opinion that Bar Counsel failed to prove the alleged MLRPC 8.4(c) violations, as the hearing judge concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Judge BATTAGLIA authorizes me to state that she joins the views expressed in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">. This is understandable, with the benefit of hindsight, because the record was undeveloped on the underlying circumstances of the cash withdrawals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
