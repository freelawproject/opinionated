Law (1975, 2013 RepLVol.) (\u201cCL\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 12-801 to 12-809,] a[n] \u2018[other] specialty\u2019 ... under [Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.

Law (1975, 2013 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 12-805(d) an \u2018other specialty\u2019 under Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (1973, 2013 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-102(a)(6), which is a twelve-year statute of limitations?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">We answer the reformulated certified question of law \u201cno\u201d and hold that that an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6), and thus is subject to CJP \u00a7 5-101, which is the default three-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">In the certification order, the federal court stated the following facts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">In 2004, Soren Carlsen (\u201cCarlsen\u201d), Appellee, and NVR, Inc., Appellant, entered into a contract under which NVR, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>would build a home for Carlsen, who would use NVR Mortgage Finance, Inc. (\u201cNVR Mortgage\u201d), Appellant,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to obtain financing for the home. Carlsen applied for a mortgage from NVR Mortgage, but Carlsen and NVR Mortgage did not close on the mortgage. Afterward, Carlsen used NVR Mortgage to apply for a mortgage from C &amp; F Mortgage Corporation. In 2005, Carlsen and C &amp; F Mortgage Corporation closed on the mortgage, and Carlsen paid NVR Mortgage a broker fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">More than three but fewer than twelve years later, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Carlsen sued NVR Mortgage and NVR, Inc. (together, \u201cNVR\u201d), for allegedly violating CL \u00a7 12-805(d) by failing to make certain disclosures to Carlsen and similarly situated homebuyers before collecting finder\u2019s fees for brokering mortgages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> NVR removed this case to the federal court, in which NVR moved to certify a question of law to this Court. The federal court granted the motion to certify and stayed proceedings in the federal court pending this Court\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">NVR contends that an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) because, in an action for an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d), the duty sought to be enforced exists as a matter of common law, rather than having been created solely by CL \u00a7 12-805(d). Alternatively, NVR argues that the General Assembly intended an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) not to be an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5 \u2014 102(a)(6), as the General Assembly enacted CJP \u00a7 5-101 (which is the default three-year statute of limitations) in 1973, and enacted CL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u00a7 12-805(d) in 1979. Alternatively, NVR asserts that, here, the alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12 \u2014 805(d) is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5 \u2014 102(a)(6) because Carlsen does not seek damages that are liquidated, fixed, or readily ascertainable by applying clear statutory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Carlsen responds that an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) because, in an action for an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12 \u2014 805(d), the duty sought to be enforced is created solely by CL \u00a7 12-805(d), rather than existing as a matter of common law. Carlsen contends that the General Assembly intended an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) to be an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6), as, during the General Assembly\u2019s 2012 Regular Session, the House Economic Matters Committee gave an unfavorable report to House Bill 674, which would have added a three-year statute of limitations to the FFA. Carlsen argues that, here, the alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) because he seeks damages that are readily ascertainable by applying clear statutory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Unabridged, CL \u00a7 12-805(d) (which is part of the FFA) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">(1) A finder\u2019s fee may not be charged unless it is pursuant to a written agreement between the mortgage broker and the borrower which is separate and distinct from any other document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">(2) The terms of the proposed agreement shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">(i) Be disclosed to the borrower before the mortgage broker undertakes to assist the borrower in obtaining a loan or advance of money;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">(ii) Specify the amount of the finder\u2019s fee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">(iii) Contain a representation by the mortgage broker that the mortgage broker is acting as a mortgage broker and not as a lender in the transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">(3) A copy of the agreement, dated and signed by the mortgage broker and the borrower, shall be provided to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>borrower within 10 business days after the date the loan application is completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u201cAny mortgage broker who violates any provision of [the FFA] shall forfeit to the borrower the greater of: (1) Three times the amount of the finder\u2019s fee collected; or (2) The sum of $500.\u201d CL \u00a7 12-807 (paragraph breaks omitted). The FFA does not contain a statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">CJP \u00a7 5-101 provides: \u201cA civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues unless another provision of the Code provides a different period of time within which an action shall be commenced.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-102(a) states: \u201cAn action on one of the following specialties shall be filed within 12 years after the cause of action accrues ... (1) Promissory note or other instrument under seal; (2) Bond except a public officer\u2019s bond; (3) Judgment; (4) Recognizance; (5) Contract under seal; or (6) Any other specialty.\u201d (Paragraph breaks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Whether an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) is the basis of the reformulated certified question of law. CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) is a \u201c \u2018relatively narrow catchall[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>AGV Sports Grp., Inc. v.

An alleged violation of a statute is an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) if and only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab4\">(1) the duty, obligation, prohibition, or right sought to be enforced is created or imposed solely by the statute, or a related statute, and does not otherwise exist as a matter of common law; (2) the remedy pursued in the action is authorized solely by the statute, or a related statute, and does not otherwise exist under the common law; and (3) if the action is one for civil damages or recompense in the nature of civil damages, those damages are liquidated, fixed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>or, by applying clear statutory criteria, are readily ascertainable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><em>AGV Sports Grp., </em>417 Md. at 395-96, 10 A.3d at 750 (quoting <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 70, 972 A.2d at 875).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 55, 70-72, 972 A.2d at 867, 875-76, this Court held that certain alleged violations of the Maryland Secondary Mortgage Loan Law (\u201cthe SMLL\u201d), CL \u00a7\u00a7 12-401 to 12-415, were \u201cother specialties]\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6). This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">(1) the duties, obligations, prohibitions, and rights sought to be enforced by the plaintiffs [were] created and imposed solely by the SMLL, (2) the remedy pursued \u2014 forfeiture of all interest and unlawfully assessed fees, or, in the class action cases, forfeiture of three times the amount of interest charged \u2014 [was] authorized solely by the SMLL, and (3) ... those amounts [were] readily ascertainable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 72, 972 A.2d at 876 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">By contrast, in <em>AGV Sports Grp., </em>417 Md. at 389, 398, 10 A.3d at 746, 752, this Court held that an alleged violation of the Maryland Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cthe MTCPA\u201d), CL \u00a7\u00a7 14-3201 to 14-3202, is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) because, in an action for an alleged violation of the MTCPA, a plaintiff can seek actual damages instead of liquidated damages. In <em>dicta, </em>this Court observed that \u201cthe common law actions of trespass to chattel and conversion\u201d \u201caddressed\u201d both the duty sought to be enforced in an action for an alleged violation of the MTCPA and the remedy pursued in an action for an alleged violation of the MTCPA. <em>Id. </em>at 400, 10 A.3d at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Here, we conclude that an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) because, in an action for an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d), the duty sought to be enforced exists as a matter of common law, rather than having been created solely by CL \u00a7 12-805(d). A mortgage broker owes to a borrower a common law duty to \u201cdisclose ... all facts or information which may be relevant or material in influencing the judgment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>action of the [borrower] in the matter.\u201d <em>St. Paul at Chase Corp. v.

An alleged violation of a statute is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) where, in an action for an alleged violation of the statute, \u201cthe duty ... sought to be enforced ... exist[s] as a matter of common law[,]\u201d rather than having been \u201ccreated ... solely by the statute[.]\u201d <em>AGV Sports Grp., </em>417 Md. at 395-96, 10 A.3d at 750 (quoting <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 70, 972 A.2d at 875); <em>see also AGV Sports Grp., </em>417 Md. at 389, 400, 10 A.3d at 746, 753 (This Court held that an alleged violation of the MTCPA is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6), and observed that \u201cthe common law actions of trespass to chattel and conversion\u201d \u201caddressed\u201d both the duty sought to be enforced in an action for an alleged violation of the MTCPA and the remedy pursued in an action for an alleged violation of the MTCPA.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Accordingly, an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5 \u2014 102(a)(6), and thus is subject to CJP \u00a7 5-101, which is the default three-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">We reject Carlsen\u2019s contention that an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) because, in an action for an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d), the duty sought to be enforced is created solely by CL \u00a7 12-805(d), rather than existing as a matter of common law. Carlsen points out that, for example, under CL \u00a7 12 \u2014 805(d)(1), a mortgage broker must disclose a finder\u2019s fee\u2019s existence in a \u201cwritten agreement])]\u201d CL \u00a7 12-805(d) did not create a statutory duty for mortgage brokers; instead, CL \u00a7 12-805(d) prescribed the manner in which a mortgage broker must fulfill the mortgage broker\u2019s common law duty to the borrower to \u201cdisclose [certain] facts or information which may be relevant or material in influencing the judgment or action of the [borrower] in the matter.\u201d <em>St. Paul at Chase, </em>262 Md. at 215-16, 278 A.2d at 24 (citations omitted). The duty sought to be enforced in an action for an alleged violation of a statute exists as a matter of common law, rather than having been created solely by the statute, where the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>prescribes the manner in which a common law duty must be fulfilled. <em>See AGV Sports Grp., </em>417 Md. at 389, 400, 10 A.3d at 746, 753 (This Court held that an alleged violation of the MTCPA is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6), and observed that \u201cthe common law actions of trespass to chattel and conversion\u201d \u201caddressed\u201d both the duty sought to be enforced in an action for an alleged violation of the MTCPA and the remedy pursued in an action for an alleged violation of the MTCPA, which prescribes the manner in which telemarketers must fulfill common law duties.). As NVR points out, if we accepted Carlsen\u2019s contention, then an alleged violation of any statute that supplements the common law in any superficial way would be an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6), which would no longer be a \u201c \u2018relatively narrow catchall[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>AGV Sports Grp., id. </em>at 399, 10 A.3d at 753 (quoting <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 70, 972 A.2d at 875).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">We are unpersuaded by Carlsen\u2019s reliance on <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 68, 972 A.2d at 874 (\u201cIf the statute imposes an obligation, and gives a special remedy therefor, which otherwise could not be pursued, but at the same time a remedy for the same matter exists at common law independently of the statute, and the statute does not take away the common law remedy, the bar of the statute [of limitations] is effectual when the common-law duty or liability is pursued, but is not applicable when the special statutory remedy is employed.\u201d (Alteration in original) (citation omitted)) for the contention that an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) even if, in an action for an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d), the duty sought to be enforced exists as a matter of common law, rather than having been created solely by CL \u00a7 12-805(d). An alleged violation of a statute is an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) only if the statute creates both \u201cthe duty ... sought to be enforced\u201d in an action for an alleged violation of the statute and \u201cthe remedy pursued in [an] action\u201d for an alleged violation of the statute. <em>AGV Sports Grp., </em>417 Md. at 395, 10 A.3d at 750 (quoting <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 70, 972 A.2d at 875); <em>see also Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 73, 972 A.2d at 877 (This Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>certain alleged violations of the SMLL were \u201cother specialties]\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5 \u2014 102(a)(6) only insofar as the plaintiffs sought the statutory remedy of civil penalties instead of the common law remedy of having the loans declared void or voidable.).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">We are unpersuaded by Carlsen\u2019s reliance on <em>Minter v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>274 F.R.D. 525, 553 (D.Md.2011), in which the federal court held that an alleged violation of the FFA is an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6). Although the federal court stated that \u201c[t]he [FFA] meets [the <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 70, 972 A.2d at 875] requirements^]\u201d <em>Minter, </em>274 F.R.D. at 553 (quoting <em>Minter v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>675 F.Supp.2d 591, 595 n. 4 (D.Md.2009)), the federal court did not address whether, in an action for an alleged violation of the FFA, the duty sought to be enforced exists as a matter of common law, rather than having been created solely by the FFA. In <em>Minter, </em>274 F.R.D. at 553, the federal court stated that, in a previously issued memorandum opinion, it had \u201caddressed\u201d the defendants\u2019 contention that \u201cthe fees proscribed and recoverable under the FFA are also recoverable under common law claims of unjust enrichment and for restitution^]\u201d In <em>Minter, id. </em>at 553, the federal court addressed only the remedy pursued in an action for an alleged violation of the FFA, not the duty sought to be enforced in an action for an alleged violation of the FFA. Thus, we decline to adopt Minter\u2019s reasoning insofar as it applies to CL \u00a7 12-805(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Carlsen points out that, during the General Assembly\u2019s 2012 Regular Session (ie., after the federal court issued <em>Minter, </em>274 F.R.D. 525), members of the General Assembly sponsored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>House Bill 674 and Senate Bill 451, which would have added a three-year statute of limitations to the FFA. The House Economic Matters Committee gave an unfavorable report to House Bill 674, which its sponsors withdrew. Thus, Carlsen contends, the General Assembly intended an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) to be an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">We disagree. Because a bill might fail \u201cfor a myriad of [ ] reasons[,]\u201d the bill\u2019s failure \u201cis a rather weak reed upon which to lean in ascertaining [the General Assembly\u2019s] intent[.]\u201d <em>City of Balt. Dev. Corp. v. Carmel Realty Assocs., </em>395 Md. 299, 329, 910 A.2d 406, 424 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This principle is especially true here, as the record indicates that House Bill 674 and Senate Bill 451 failed primarily because they would have amended the FFA to allow finder\u2019s fees for \u201ctable funding.\u201d \u201cA \u2018table-funded\u2019 transaction is a closing at which a loan is funded by a contemporaneous advance of loan funds and an assignment of the loan to the person advancing the funds.\u201d <em>Petry v.

Carlsen directs our attention to seven letters in which stakeholders urged the House Economic Matters Committee to give an unfavorable report to House Bill 674. In all seven letters, stakeholders opposed House Bill 674 on the ground that House Bill 674 would have amended the FFA to allow finder\u2019s fees for table funding. However, in fewer than half of the seven letters did stakeholders also oppose House Bill 674 on the ground that House Bill 674 would have added a three-year statute of limitations to the FFA. In most of the seven letters, stakeholders \u2014 including the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General and a law firm that identified itself as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in <em>Bradley Petry, et al. v. Prosperity Mortgage Co., et al., </em>which, at one point, was consolidated into <em>Minter, </em>274 F.R.D. at 553, in which the federal court held that an alleged violation of the FFA is an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) \u2014 did not even mention that House Bill 674 would have added a three-year statute of limitations to the FFA. Thus, the failure of House Bill 674 and Senate Bill 451 does not indicate that the General Assembly intended an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) to be an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Indeed, there is evidence that the General Assembly intended an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) not to be an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6). The General Assembly enacted CJP \u00a7 5-101 (which is the default three-year statute of limitations) in 1973, and enacted CL \u00a7 12-805(d) in 1979. CJP \u00a7 5-101\u2019s predecessor \u2014 Md. Code Ann., Art. 57 \u00a7 1 (1957) \u2014 listed multiple causes of action with a three-year limitations period. By contrast, CJP \u00a7 5-101 is \u201ca blanket three-year provision, with exceptions for other limitations^]\u201d Revisor\u2019s Note, CJP \u00a7 5-101; <em>see also </em>Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Annotated Code, Commission Report No. 3F to the General Assembly of Maryland, at 40 (July 16, 1973) (CJP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u00a7 5-101 \u201cis a blanket three[-]year limitation covering all civil causes of action for which no other limitation is specifically provided.\u201d); <em>Greene Tree Home Owners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Greene Tree Assocs., </em>358 Md. 453, 461 n. 1, 749 A.2d 806, 810 n. 1 (2000) (CJP \u00a7 5-101 is \u201ca \u2018catch all\u2019 for actions based on statutes that internally did not provide a period of limitations.\u201d). Thus, in enacting statutes after enacting CJP \u00a7 5-101, the General Assembly has been aware that, generally, CJP \u00a7 5-101 applies to alleged violations of statutes that, like the FFA, do not contain statutes of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">It is reasonable to infer that the General Assembly intended CJP \u00a7 5-101 to generally apply to alleged violations of statutes that the General Assembly enacted after enacting CJP \u00a7 5-101, whereas CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) (which is the statute of limitations for \u201cother specialties]\u201d) would apply only to alleged violations of statutes that the General Assembly had enacted before enacting CJP \u00a7 5-101. Such an inference would comport with this Court\u2019s holdings in this and every other case in which this Court has considered CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) after the General Assembly enacted CJP \u00a7 5-101 in 1973. <em>Compare AGV Sports Grp., </em>417 Md. at 389, 10 A.3d at 746 (This Court held that an alleged violation of the MTCPA\u2014 which the General Assembly enacted in 2004 \u2014 is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6).) <em>with Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 55, 70-72, 972 A.2d at 867, 875-76 (This Court held that certain alleged violations of the SMLL \u2014 which the General Assembly enacted in 1967 \u2014 were \u201cother specialties]\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6).).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>For the above reasons, an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is not an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6), and thus is subject to CJP \u00a7 5-101, which is the default three-year statute of limitations.

In 2014, the General Assembly amended CJP \u00a7 5-102(c). <em>See </em>2014 Md. Laws Ch. 592.

In the complaint, Carlsen alleged that NVR \u201ccollected, directly or indirectly, at least []$7,782.48 in illegal and undisclosed fees from [Carlsen], and may have collected additional illegal fees.\u201d In the certification order, the federal court stated that, despite a \"significant amount of discovery[,]\u201d \"Carlsen states that he cannot yet ... determine the amount of finder\u2019s fees he has paid until additional discovery is completed.\u201d Similarly, in his brief, Carlsen stated: \"[B]ecause of the state of discovery in this case,\u201d Carlsen \u201chad not obtained a definitive answer to what indirect amounts ...

At oral argument, however, Carlsen\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>sel conceded that Carlsen \"may not be entitled to [indirect] damages.\" Thus, as this case illustrates, damages based on a finder\u2019s fee that a broker allegedly indirectly imposed may not be readily ascertainable in an action for an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d).</p>\n<p id=\"ARf\">Moreover, it is unclear whether, in an action for an alleged violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d), CL \u00a7 12-807(1), like similar statutes which provide for treble damages, caps damages at \"[t]hree times the amount of the finder\u2019s fee collected[.]\u201d CL \u00a7 12-807(1) does not state whether treble damages constitute the sole remedy. This Court has not addressed whether treble damages are the sole remedy for a violation of CL \u00a7 12-805(d). <em>Cf. Stevenson v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Corp., </em>159 Md.App. 620, 659, 861 A.2d 735, 758 (2004) (Writing for the Court of Special Appeals, the Honorable Sally D.

Although we acknowledge that CL \u00a7 12-805(d)\u2019s purpose is to protect borrowers, a court cannot create an \"equitable exception\u201d to a statute of limitations. <em>Anderson v.

As noted above, this case involves only CL \u00a7 12-805(d). Thus, we do not address whether an alleged violation of any part of the FFA other than CL \u00a7 12-805(d) is an \"other specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b472-5\">.
