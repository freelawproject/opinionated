Kirson, </em>No. 78, September Term, 2013, and <em>Alston v. 2700 Virginia Avenue Associates, </em>No. 100, September Term, 2013, for purposes of this opinion. In each case, a plaintiff or plaintiffs brought, among other claims,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a negligence action against landlords to recover for his or her injuries resulting from lead paint poisoning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither plaintiff adduced direct evidence that the respective demised premise was a substantial contributor to the injuries or that the interiors of the homes contained lead paint, but rather relied on circumstantial evidence in an effort to satisfy the causation element of a <em>prima facie </em>negligence claim. After discovery was conducted, the landlords filed motions for summary judgment, which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted. In both cases, the trial judges reasoned that the respective plaintiffs failed to produce sufficient evidence to present a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case with regard to the causation element. Our review on appeal focuses on evaluating what quantum or quality of circumstantial evidence in lead paint poisoning cases is sufficient to satisfy the eausa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tion element of a <em>prima facie </em>negligence claim, so as to submit the case to the fact-finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Because the facts and issues presented in the consolidated cases differ slightly, we set forth first the background of each case. Then, we shall address collectively the shared relevant legal precedents, applying the relevant case law and legal principles to each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">A. <em>Alston v. 2700 Virginia Avenue Assocs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">On 26 January 2010, Candace Alston filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against 2700 Virginia Avenue Associates, Theodore Julio, Lawrence Julio, and others, alleging that the defendants acted negligently as landlords in providing premises containing chipping, peeling, and flaking lead paint in violation of the Baltimore City Housing Code (hereinafter, \u201cHousing Code\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, an Amendment by Interlineation added to the causes of action Brian Alston (Candace\u2019s sibling) and his claims. The Complaint and amendments alleged that Candace and Brian (hereinafter, collectively the \u201cAlstons\u201d) suffered lead-based paint poisoning, Candace while residing for consecutive periods at dwellings located at 2752 Virginia Avenue and 2810 Virginia Avenue and Brian at 2752 Virginia Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">For her part, the Alstons\u2019 mother, Leslie Sidbury, could not remember the exact time periods and locations of their resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>dences during the relevant times. The Complaint alleged that the Alstons\u2019 mother and her children resided at a number of properties between 1989 and 1995. Specifically, Candace, who was born on 27 January 1989, \u201clived in the dwelling or frequented the dwelling as an invitee of the tenant during 1989-1995\u201d for the following properties: (1) 3006 Woodland Avenue; (2) 3501 Oakmont Avenue; (3) 303 N. Gilmor Street; (4) 2752 Virginia Avenue; and, (5) 2810 Virginia Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Subsequently, in the Amendment by Interlineation adding as a victim Brian Alston, who was born on 13 August 1990, the Alstons narrowed the matter somewhat that their mother lived at the 2810 Virginia Avenue property between 1992-1993. Then, they lived as a family at 2752 Virginia Avenue between 1993-1995. During the defendants\u2019 later deposition of Ms. Sidbury, it was discovered that she did not remember the exact location of their residence, but approximated that the house was located in the 2800 block on Virginia Avenue. Plaintiffs\u2019 blood lead level testing slips listed, however, only 3006 Woodland Avenue as their address.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">During discovery, the Alstons identified Dr. Michael Weitzman as their expert witness. Dr. Weitzman opined, relying on circumstantial evidence solely, that 2752 Virginia Avenue and 2810 Virginia Avenue (hereinafter, the \u201csubject properties\u201d) were a source of, and a substantial contributing factor to, the Alstons\u2019 lead paint poisoning and resulting injuries. To support this opinion, Dr. Weitzman relied on the following facts: (1) the Alstons lived in and/or visited the subject properties during the time period that they demonstrated elevated blood lead levels; (2) the residences had chipping, peeling, or flaking paint during the relevant time period; (3) the residences were older homes in Baltimore, built before 1979;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (4) the Alstons exhibited elevated blood lead levels at the time they lived in the subject properties. No scientific testing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>conducted of the paint (chipping, flaking, peeling, or otherwise) at the residences for the presence of lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Defendants (Respondents here) filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on 22 December 2010, arguing that the Plaintiffs \u201cfailed to sustain their burden of proving that they were exposed to and ingested chipping, peeling, or flaking lead-based paint in violation of the Baltimore City Housing Code at the Defendants\u2019 properties----\u201d Specifically, Respondents argued that Plaintiffs\u2019 expert relied on insufficient assumptions to provide a factual basis for his opinion that Plaintiffs were exposed to a lead paint hazard at Defendants\u2019 properties. Respondents emphasized that there is no direct evidence that Plaintiffs resided at Defendants\u2019 properties or \u201cthat Defendants\u2019 properties contained lead paint hazards, or defective lead-based paint, during Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged tenancy at the properties.\u201d Moreover, Respondents pointed out that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 source expert also cannot eliminate [other] potential source[s] of Plaintiffs\u2019 recorded [blood] lead levels, which precludes Plaintiffs from providing adequate circumstantial evidence of exposure at the properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">After a hearing on the motion on 6 February 2012, the trial judge granted summary judgment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">In this case, the identification of the address is an interesting issue. I\u2019m not going to grant summary judgment on that basis, because I believe that the plaintiff has come up\u2014 has come forward with, it may be the barest showing, but it\u2019s a bare showing to tie herself to these two addresses on Virginia Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">And this is unlike a case where the defendant comes forward with sworn statements in whatever form; interrogatories, affidavits, depositions that refute any possibility that the plaintiff actually lived or spent time at those addresses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">So although it is extremely sketchy in this case, both the identification of the specific properties and the years when the plaintiffs were living there, I don\u2019t think the defendant prevails on that basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>I do think the defendant prevails on the basis that as to these properties the plaintiffs cannot show the requisite causation of any elevated blood lead levels derived from these properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">I accept that the plaintiffs have shown that there was deteriorating paint at the properties. And I will even, for purposes of the motion go so far as to accept that the plaintiffs have shown that they exhibited elevated blood lead levels at around the time that they say they were living in these properties. What is missing is evidence that would tie those elevated blood lead levels to the specific conditions in these properties. And I accept the possibility that that could be proven indirectly by circumstantial means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">But I think the essential logical ingredient that must be present in order for <em>Dow </em>or a theory like <em>Dow </em>to apply is that logically there must be a \u2014 a very strong conclusion that the lead that the plaintiffs were experiencing had to come from this source because there is no other logical source that is available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">Now, there may be a number of ways that could be done. I\u2019ve suggested one of them would be if there were visitation properties, that there is some evidence that tends to exclude those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">There might be evidence that the paint wasn\u2019t deteriorating in those. There might be evidence that they were built after a period when lead paint was likely present. There might be evidence that the visits were very short, were supervised closely and the children didn\u2019t ingest paint. There may be a number of bases that might be advanced by plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">But here you simply have two wide open possible properties at the same time, either of which could have been the source of the lead that is alleged. And that is insufficient to establish the <em>prima facie </em>case that the plaintiff would have to show on negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>For those reasons, I think that the moving defendants with respect to these two addresses on Virginia Avenue are entitled to summary judgment. And I\u2019ll grant summary judgment as to both plaintiffs as to these defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqd\">(Emphasis added.) The trial judge issued a written order to like effect, stating that the Motion for Summary Judgment was granted \u201c[f|or the reasons stated on the record at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Plaintiffs appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in an unreported opinion filed on 10 July 2013. Plaintiffs-Petitioners filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, which this Court granted, 435 Md. 266, 77 A.3d 1084 (2013), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">(1) By following its decision in <em>West v. Rochkind, </em>212 Md.App. 164, 66 A.3d 1145 (2013), did [the] CSA [Court of Special Appeals] [here] improperly undermine the common law principle that the law makes no distinction between the weight to be given to circumstantial evidence and direct evidence and that no greater degree of certainty is required of circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">(2) Did [the] CSA\u2019s decision in <em>West </em>improperly change a Plaintiffs burden of proof in a circumstantial evidence case from \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d to greater than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">(3) Does [the] CSA\u2019s holding improperly require a Plaintiff in a lead-paint ease to prove that a given property was \u201cthe only possible explanation\u201d for a Plaintiffs injuries in order to make a circumstantial case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">B. <em>Hamilton v. Kirson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">On 28 May 2009, Christopher Hamilton filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City his initial complaint alleging several negligence claims against Lola Singer, the previous owner of property at 2231 Barclay Street (hereinafter, the \u201cSinger property\u201d), and Benjamin and Karen Kirson (hereinafter, collectively the \u201cKirsons\u201d), the previous owners of property at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>754 Bartlett Avenue (hereinafter, the \u201cKirson property\u201d or the \u201csubject property\u201d). According to the Complaint, these properties \u201ccontained lead-based paint in such deteriorated conditions that it was peeling, chipping and flaking from the walls, baseboards, windowsills and other areas of the premises,\u201d as well as the presence of lead paint dust and powder. It was alleged that Christopher, while living at these residences, ingested lead-based paint chips and dust and, as a consequence, suffered permanent brain damage resulting in developmental and behavioral injuries. The Complaint alleged that Christopher resided at 2231 Barclay Street from 1992-1993, and at 754 Bartlett Avenue from 1993-1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On 21 August 2009, the Complaint was amended to add a second plaintiff \u2014 Christopher\u2019s brother, Rickey \u2014 as well as additional defendants and allegations. Specifically, the Hamiltons added allegations that they were exposed to lead-based paint at 445 E. Lanvale Street, where they lived from 1991-1992 and which was owned and managed by Ralph Small and the Patella Realty Corporation, the added defendants. On 2 April 2010, the Hamiltons amended their complaint again to add allegations involving two additional properties which Plaintiffs visited as children and which were owned and managed by other newly-added defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Rickey was born on 5 April 1989. From his birth until approximately April of 1990, Rickey lived with his mother, maternal grandparents, sister, and uncle somewhere on the 2300 block of Barclay Street. Rickey moved with the same family members to 445 East Lanvale Street approximately in the summer of 1990. A short time later, on 5 September 1990, Christopher was born and lived in the same house as Rickey from that point in time. At some point in 1992, the family moved to 2231 Barclay Street where they resided until ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>proximately the fall of 1993, at which time the family moved again to 754 Bartlett Avenue. The family lived at that address until some point in 1995. Then, the family moved to 1604 Gorsuch Avenue, where they resided until 1998. Between 1990 and 1994, Rickey was tested six times for blood lead levels (\u201cBLL\u201d). Between 1991 and 1995, Christopher was tested nine times. The results of these tests are detailed in the following chart:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b545-41\">[Editor\u2019s Note: The preceding image contains the reference for footnotes * and * *.]</p>\n<p id=\"b545-42\">* The 2231 Barclay house was owned by Singer.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-43\">* * The 754 Bartlett Ave. house was owned by the Kirsons and is the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-44\"><em>Shaded blocks represent those test results which indicate elevated blood lead </em>levels,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>During discovery, the Hamiltons retained Arc Environmental, Inc., to survey the 754 Bartlett Avenue property for lead-based paint. On 4 March 2011, Arc tested (or attempted to test) the property and issued a report of its findings on 9 March 2011. According to the report, the X-ray fluorescence analyzer detected lead-based paint, above the Maryland standard (&gt;0.7 mg/cm2),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on four of the fourteen surfaces tested\u2014 the front porch wall, the front window apron and casing, and the front basement window header. The report noted that the property is \u201can occupied two story brick row home. The inspector knocked on the front door of the property and spoke with a female resident who stated that she has lived at the property for many years and subsequently denied the inspectors [sic] request to test the interior of the property, but allowed exterior testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Additionally, as part of discovery, the Hamiltons identified Dr. Jacalyn Blackwell-White, a board-certified pediatrician, as a medical causation expert and Dr. Robert Simon as an industrial hygiene expert and environmental lead risk assessor. Drs. Blackwell-White and Simon authored causation reports and were deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Dr. Blackwell-White opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">Rickey Hamilton experienced toxic levels of lead elevation during his younger years. Within a reasonable degree of medical probability, he suffered brain damage as a result of that exposure. The most likely source/sources of Rickey\u2019s exposure include 2231 Barclay Street and 754 Bartlett Avenue. However, the visitation properties of 417 E. North Avenue and 510 E. 20th Street cannot be excluded. There was a paucity of descriptive interior surface information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>lead paint information and details about the visits included concerning these properties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">With regard to Christopher Hamilton, Dr. Blackwell-White opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">It is my opinion that Christopher Hamilton was exposed to sustained levels of lead at an early age. The possible sources of Christopher\u2019s lead exposure include 445 E. Lanvale Street, 2231 Barclay Street, 754 Bartlette [sic] Avenue, 417 E. North Avenue and 510 E. 20th Street. Based on the information available to me, more likely than not, Christopher was exposed to lead based paint at 2231 Barclay Street and 754 Bartlette [sic] Avenue because he experienced a significant rise in lead levels which was sustained during his residence at these two addresses. There was no significant change in blood lead level after moving from 2231 Barclay Street to 754 Bartlette [sic] Avenue. There is not enough information available to me to implicate the Lanvale Street property over the visitation properties as a source of lead exposure for the first three lead level elevations. It is my opinion that within a reasonable degree of medical probability, he sustained brain damage as a result of early lead exposure and that his impairment is lifelong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Plaintiffs asked Dr. Simon \u201cto determine if [Rickey\u2019s and Christopher\u2019s] residency at 2231 Barclay Street and 754 Bartlett Street, Baltimore, MD, during their early childhood, were substantial contributing sources of lead exposure during that time period.\u201d Dr. Simon stated that the 754 Bartlett Avenue house \u201cwas built in 1920 and would more likely than not have had LBP [lead-based paint] based upon the age and use of lead paint during that time period....\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, Dr. Simon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>noted that the 754 Bartlett Avenue house contained paint in deteriorated condition. Based on that information, Dr. Simon concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">[T]he residences at 2231 Barclay Street and 754 Bartlett Avenue, Baltimore, MD were the substantial, contributing locations and sources for elevated blood lead levels (EBLs) and lead poisoning exposure for both Ricky, Jr. [sic] and Christopher Hamilton during the first 6+ years of their childhoods. There was no indication in the data file that any other locations contributed to their EBLs [elevated blood lead levels] and lead poisoning during this time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">After discovery was completed, the Kirsons moved for summary judgment on several grounds. First, they argued that there was no Housing Code violation demonstrating a negligent act on the part of Defendants and, thus, Plaintiffs did not have an actionable negligence claim. Specifically, the Kirsons pointed out that Plaintiffs\u2019 medical causation expert, Dr. Blackwell-White, stated that the blood lead levels were consistent with exposure to airborne lead dust. Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims, however, are based on violations of the Housing Code\u2019s prohibition of peeling or chipping paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Second, the Kirsons argued that summary judgment was appropriate because there was no direct evidence that the subject property was the source of the Hamiltons\u2019 lead poisoning and, moreover, Plaintiffs\u2019 source experts\u2019 opinions that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Hamiltons\u2019 blood lead levels were caused by exposure to lead hazards at the subject property, 754 Bartlett Avenue, had an insufficient factual basis. The Kirsons maintained that, in order for the Hamiltons to prove that the property had lead-based paint, testing was required for the specific locations alleged as peeling, flaking, or chipping at the time of Plaintiffs\u2019 elevated blood lead levels. The testing undertaken by Plaintiffs, however, was only of locations on the exterior of the subject property. The Hamiltons\u2019 mother stated in her deposition that the exterior of the house was not in disrepair and, thus, according to the Kirsons, the Hamiltons failed to produce the direct evidence that they were exposed to hazardous lead-based paint at the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Moreover, the Kirsons argued that the Hamiltons\u2019 experts based their opinions of the source of the Hamiltons\u2019 lead exposure on the assumption that, if the exterior of the house had lead paint, the interior of the house also contained lead-paint. According to the Kirsons, the experts based this assumption (and, therefore, their opinions) on the age of the house, the condition of the house, and the age and recorded blood lead levels of the Hamiltons at the time of the tenancy. Such assumptions, it was claimed, were insufficient to form the factual basis of an expert opinion. Additionally, the Kirsons contended that the Hamiltons\u2019 source experts lacked a sufficient factual basis to conclude that the subject property was the source because they \u201cdid not rule out other potential sources of Plaintiffs\u2019 blood lead levels that were recorded while they lived at [the subject property].\u201d Specifically, the Kirsons pointed out that the Hamiltons\u2019 source experts failed to consider the three other properties that the Hamiltons visited frequently or lived in during the time period before and during their lead poisoning<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and failed to rule out that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>blood lead levels were the result of environmental or ambient sources, even though both experts acknowledged that lead poisoning may be caused by these other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The Hamiltons filed a Response in Opposition to the Kirsons\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, insisting that a sufficient factual basis existed to support the opinions of their experts. The Hamiltons emphasized that experts are permitted to use a combination of direct and circumstantial evidence to support their opinions. They maintained that, particularly in cases such as lead-paint poisoning, where often injured persons do not have the ability to obtain direct evidence through testing of the properties contemporaneously with their tenancy or afterwards in certain circumstances, circumstantial evidence is the only recourse. Specifically, in this case, the Hamiltons stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">[T]he subject property was built in 1920, circumstantially leading to a finding that the structure contained lead-based paint. Both Christopher and Rickey Hamilton ate paint chips while living there. During their tenancy, Plaintiffs\u2019 blood lead levels remained elevated; significant because of Dr. Simon\u2019s testimony regarding the half-life of lead in a person\u2019s blood. Neither Plaintiff had enough contact with the visiting properties to allow those houses to be considered significant contributing factors. Lastly, a 2010 ARC Environmental test of the exterior of the property found lead-based paint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Thus, according to the Hamiltons, \u201cthere is sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence to support the opinions of Dr. Blackwell-White and Dr. Simon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The Circuit Court held a hearing on 10 August 2011. After hearing argument, the Circuit Court stated, in pertinent part, on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">I\u2019m going to grant the motion. I\u2019m, you know. Actually, I guess, eventually we\u2019re going to get some more on a post-Dow[<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]. cases from the Appellate Courts. But basically, my understanding, this is not enough for the circumstantial evidence.... [T]he Court\u2019s not convinced that there\u2019s enough circumstantial evidence under <em>Dow </em>and I realized that that\u2019s something that, you know, as a city, eventually we\u2019ve got some clarification. But it\u2019s my understanding that there\u2019s sufficient, based upon the record here, that there\u2019s sufficient evidence about so many other, not abstract sources, but very real sources, that it\u2019s not sufficient. So for that reason, I will grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On the next day, 11 August 2011, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Kirsons\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment \u201cfor the reasons stated on the record in open court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The Hamiltons appealed timely. On 30 April 2013, the Court of Special Appeals issued an unreported opinion affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment. We granted a Writ of Certiorari, on the Hamiltons\u2019 petition, 433 Md. 513, 72 A.3d 172 (2013), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">(1) Did the trial court err by refusing to allow plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses to testify that the defendant\u2019s property was a substantial contributing cause to plaintiffs\u2019 injurious lead exposure on the grounds that they did not sufficiently rule out other potential sources of lead exposure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">(2) Did the trial court err by granting summary judgment for defendant on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence as to causation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">(3) Is a <em>Daw </em>analysis applicable to a lead paint claim involving possible exposure at multiple properties?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">C. Consolidation</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">We consolidate these cases for decision because they present a common, over-arching inquiry \u2014 under what circumstances, if any, will circumstantial evidence alone of the possible presence of lead-based paint inside a residential property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>be sufficient to survive a defense motion for summary judgment challenging the sufficiency of proof of the causation element of a negligence claim against the landlord. There is much recent case law, particularly from the Court of Special Appeals, on the proof of lead paint poisoning causation through circumstantial evidence. We aspire here to consider these cases, add our judicial gloss to them, and resolve any inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In the present cases, the Circuit Court granted defense motions for summary judgment, concluding that Plaintiffs failed to produce sufficient circumstantial evidence to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case regarding the causation element of a negligence claim. The Circuit Court, in granting the motions for summary judgment, rejected implicitly or explicitly Plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 conclusions that the subject properties were a substantial contributing source of Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. The Court of Special Appeals, in its unreported opinion in <em>Hamilton, </em>noted aptly the dual nature of the Circuit Court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">The Hamiltons argue that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because their experts had a sufficient factual basis for their opinions. They further assert that even without expert opinions, the other evidence was sufficient to show that the Bartlett address was a substantial contributing cause of their injuries. These two arguments go hand in hand because the evidence that the Hamiltons presented on causation was the same evidence the experts used to form their opinions. Thus, the circuit court decision contains two findings: 1) that the experts did not have a sufficient factual basis for their conclusions that the Bartlett property was a substantial contributing source, and 2) that the evidence the experts used as their factual basis was not enough to independently establish causation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\"><em>Hamilton v.

Where an applicable statutory scheme is designed to protect a class of persons which includes the plaintiff, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s duty ordinarily \u2018is prescribed by the statute\u2019 or ordinance and ... the violation of the statute or ordinance is itself evidence of negligence.\u201d <em>Brooks v.

Proximate cause is established by determining whether the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent....

In <em>Brooks, </em>we summarized that, to establish a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case for lead-paint poisoning based on violation of the Housing Code, a plaintiff must show that there was flaking, loose, or peeling paint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag2\">In sum, the presence of flaking, loose, or peeling paint is a violation of the Housing Code. <em>Brown v. Dermer, </em>357 Md. at 361, 744 A.2d at 56-57 (\u201cTo be a violation, all that must be shown is that there was flaking, loose or peeling paint\u201d). As earlier pointed out, certain provisions of the Housing Code were clearly enacted to prevent lead poisoning in children. Therefore, the plaintiff ... is in the class of people intended to be protected by the Housing Code, and his injury, lead poisoning, is the kind of injury intended to be prevented by the Code. This is all that the plaintiffs must show to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case sounding in negligence. Therefore, the notices of violation issued to Lewin Realty by the Department of Housing for unrelated properties were irrelevant and there should be a new trial as directed by the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">378 Md. at 89, 835 A.2d at 627 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Although peeling, chipping, or flaking paint (of any kind) constitutes a violation of the Housing Code, such a Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>violation permits merely an inference of <em>prima facie </em>negligence on the part of the homeowner or landlord. Such an inference, however, does not eliminate the requirement that the plaintiff prove that the landlord\u2019s negligence <em>caused proximately </em>the injury. As the Court of Special Appeals explained in <em>Hamilton v. Dackman, </em>213 Md.App. 589, 613, 75 A.3d 327, 340-41 (2013) (hereinafter, <em>\u201cRaymond Hamilton\u201d), </em>\u201calthough the Court of Appeals suggested in <em>Brooks </em>that a statutory violation may constitute a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence, 378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d 616, that holding does not relieve a plaintiff of the obligation to establish causation.\u201d More specifically, the intermediate appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\"><em>Brooks </em>eliminated notice of a lead-paint violation as <em>one element </em>of a negligence claim. 378 Md. at 72, 835 A.2d 616.

This meant, in <em>Brooks, </em>that where a child had been seen chewing repeatedly on a windowsill in a home that upon later inspection specifically was found to contain lead-based paint, <em>id. </em>at 73-74, 835 A.2d 616 (and whom the record did not reflect lived or visited any property other than the one that was the subject of the litigation), she could submit her case to the jury without having to show that the defendant had notice of the condition. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 835 A.2d 616; <em>see also Polakoff v.

Causation Analysis in Maryland Lead Paint Cases</p>\n<p id=\"Aj0\">\u201cIt is fundamental that in a negligence action the plaintiff has the burden of proving all the facts essential to constitute the cause of action.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Underwood, </em>258 Md. 9, 15, 264 A.2d 851, 854 (1970). One element of a negligence case is that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of the accident or injury. <em>See, e.g., Raymond Hamilton, </em>213 Md.App. at 613, 75 A.3d at 341. The inquiry here focuses on \u201ccausation in fact,\u201d one aspect of proximate cause, \u201cconcerned with the more fundamental (and some have thought metaphysical) inquiry of whether defendant\u2019s conduct actually produced an injury.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>258 Md. at 16-17, 264 A.2d at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We have recognized repeatedly that a plaintiff may prove causation in fact through circumstantial evidence, as well as direct evidence or a mixture of the two. For example, in <em>Peterson, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">If lay testimony together with reasonable inferences does not directly show this causal relation (such as a witness\u2019s observing a brick hurled through a plate glass window) it may be shown in a number of other ways. The most familiar method today is through the opinion of the expert who states that, based on facts in evidence, X was the efficient cause of the injury. Such opinion testimony is not always required, and the plaintiff produces legally sufficient proof to get to the jury once he shows it is more probable than not that defendant\u2019s act caused his injury. This does not mean plaintiff is required to exclude every other possible cause of the accident. But where plaintiff by his own evidence shows two or more equally likely causes of the injury, for only one of which defendant is responsible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>plaintiff can not recover. The situation before us is somewhat analogous, except that instead of showing two evenly balanced probable causes, plaintiff has shown none.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">In the trial below plaintiff apparently relied on an inference that defendants\u2019 acts were the cause or proximate cause of the injury. An \u2018inference\u2019 is a deduction or conclusion which reason and common sense lead a jury to draw from the facts proved. <em>United States v. Schneiderman, </em>106 F.Supp. 906, 928 (S.D.Cal.1952), cf. 21 Words and Phrases, \u2018inference\u2019 (1960). This attempted reliance amounts to proof of causation by circumstantial rather than direct evidence. In accordance with the general rules stated above, this type of evidence is not inherently insufficient; all that is necessary is that it amount to a reasonable likelihood or probability rather than a possibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">258 Md. at 17, 264 A.2d at 855 (emphasis added) (some internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">When a plaintiff does not offer a direct explanation of the cause of the injury or accident, a plaintiff is \u201ccompelled to rely entirely on the inference.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>258 Md. at 18-19, 264 A.2d at 856. The validity of an inference \u201cdepends on commonly experienced relationships of acts and forces,\u201d <em>id., </em>258 Md. at 18, 264 A.2d at 856, or \u201cdepends on logical deduction from an established fact.\u201d <em>Id., </em>258 Md. at 19, 264 A.2d at 856. Certain sets of facts may make an inference less valid than other sets of facts. <em>See, e.g., id., </em>258 Md. at 21, 264 A.2d at 857 (concluding that the passage of time between the negligent act and the injury rendered the inference of causation illogical and thus concluded that the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment was proper). The conclusion that an inference is not valid due to a lack of supporting facts or an articulable logical relationship does not mean that we place greater weight on direct evidence than on circumstantial evidence. Rather, it means that we require inferences to be sound logically, and we refuse to allow a jury of laymen to engage in \u201c \u2018guesswork, speculation and conjecture.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>258 Md. at 21, 264 A.2d at 857 (quoting <em>Wilhelm v.

Housing Authority of Baltimore City, </em>430 Md. 648, 63 A.3d 1 (2013). In <em>Ross, </em>the Court recognized aptly that, in the typical lead-paint case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the theory of causation has multiple analytical layers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">The theory of causation presented in this case can be conceived of as a series of links: (1) the link between the defendant\u2019s property and the plaintiffs exposure to lead; (2) the link between specific exposure to lead and the elevated blood lead levels, and (3) the link between those blood lead levels and the injuries allegedly suffered by the plaintiff. To be a substantial factor in causing Ms. Ross\u2019 alleged injuries, the Payson Street home must have been a source of Ms. Ross\u2019 exposure to lead, that exposure must have contributed to the elevated blood lead levels, and the associated increase in blood lead levels must have been substantial enough to contribute to her injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\"><em>Ross, </em>430 Md. at 668, 63 A.3d at 12-13 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). In the present cases, we are concerned with the first link. To prove this link, circumstantial evidence may be used, \u201cso long as it creates \u2018a reasonable likelihood or probability rather than a possibility\u2019 supporting a \u2018rational inference of causation,\u2019 and is not \u2018wholly speculative.\u2019 \u201d <em>West, </em>212 Md.App. at 170-71, 66 A.3d at 1150 (citations omitted). The Hamiltons\u2019 and Alstons\u2019 cases hinge on that fine distinction between circumstantial evidence that amounts to a reasonable likelihood or probability and circumstantial evidence that amounts only to a possibility and speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">To connect the dots between a defendant\u2019s property and a plaintiffs exposure to lead, the plaintiff must tender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>facts admissible in evidence that, if believed, establish two separate inferences: (1) that the property contained lead-based paint, and (2) that the lead-based paint at the subject property was a substantial contributor to the victim\u2019s exposure to lead. At times, these separate inferences may be drawn from the same set of facts, but parties would do well to remember that these inferences are separate and often will require different evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">In an effort to contribute to clarification of any confusion, we consider first <em>Dow v. L &amp; R Properties Inc., </em>144 Md.App. 67, 796 A.2d 139 (2002), which represents a scenario where multiple inferences seek to draw succor from the same factual reservoir:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">In <em>[Dow], </em>a child and her mother sued their landlord for injuries the child allegedly suffered as a result of ingesting lead paint in their home. The discovery materials and an affidavit of the mother indicated that the home had been built prior to 1950 and thus likely had lead paint, that there was chipping and peeling paint in areas where the child played and that the child placed paint chips in her mouth, that the child spent most of her time in the home while she lived there and did not have contact with other sources of lead during that period, and that the child developed lead poisoning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">The landlord in <em>Dow </em>moved for summary judgment, arguing that (1) the plaintiff had not identified an expert who would testify that there was lead paint on the premises and (2) there was no other direct evidence that the paint contained lead. As a result, the landlord argued, there was insufficient evidence to prove causation and the landlord was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court of Special Appeals rejected that argument and concluded that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to generate a genuine issue of material fact and thus defeat the landlord\u2019s motion for summary judgment. 144 Md.App. at 74-75, 796 A.2d 139. The court reasoned that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove causation by direct evidence; circumstantial evidence that \u201camounts to a reasonable likelihood or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>probability rather than a possibility\u201d would suffice. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Peterson v. Underwood, </em>258 Md. 9, 17, 264 A.2d 851 (1970)). The court held that evidence offered by the plaintiff in opposition to the motion, if believed by the fact-finder, could support an inference that the property was the only possible source of the child\u2019s lead poisoning. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 796 A.2d 139.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>Ross, </em>430 Md. at 669-70, 63 A.3d at 13 (summarizing <em>Dow).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In sum, the facts in <em>Dow </em>showed that (1) the child victim spent most of her time at the subject property where she lived and did not have contact with other possible sources of lead during the relevant period; (2) the child was observed ingesting regularly flaking or chipping paint at that property; (3) the child played frequently in the area of the flaking or chipping paint; and (4) the child had high blood lead levels during that time period, i.e., developed lead poisoning. The court concluded that, under those circumstances, there was more than a mere possibility that the house where the child resided <em>and spent most of her time </em>was the <em>only </em>possible source of the lead exposure. As such, because the child spent almost all of her time at the house, the court concluded additionally that it was more than a mere possibility that the house contained lead-based paint. Even though there was no direct evidence of lead at that property, i.e., no scientific testing, it was reasonable to infer that there had to be lead at that property because the child would not have suffered otherwise from lead poisoning. In that sense, the plaintiff eliminated all other possible sources of lead poisoning in order to make reasonable and probable those conclusions. Thus, the court drew two necessary, separate inferences on the basis of the same set of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In a very instructive case, <em>Ross, </em>this Court found, in reviewing the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants, that a reasonable inference would be \u201cthat the lead investigation reports for the [plaintiffs\u2019] home accurately identified lead on the property.\u201d 430 Md. at 670, 63 A.3d at 14. The <em>Ross </em>Court detailed the facts supporting this inference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The 1992 inspection returned positive results for exterior lead as well as \u201csurface dust\u201d on the interior. The 1994 inspection again indicated the presence of lead on exterior walls. The only direct evidence of an indoor source of lead was the 2009 ARC [Environmental survey that indicated the presence of lead on an interior stair riser, though it is not indicated in the record whether that location was tested earlier or whether it was in a deteriorating condition in the early 1990s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Ross, </em>430 Md. at 671 n. 23, 63 A.3d at 14 n. 23.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As such, Ross and <em>Dow </em>are examples of cases with sufficient circumstantial evidence for the drawing of separate and reasonable inferences of the presence of lead at the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The present cases, in contrast, lack the same or similar quality of circumstantial evidence undergirding the desired inferences. Despite this difference, Plaintiffs here cling to the same theory of causation advanced by the plaintiffs in <em>Dow. </em>Specifically, Plaintiffs ask this Court to permit a fact-finder to draw multiple inferences from a singular group of facts, even though Plaintiffs failed to exclude other potential sources of lead in these cases. Moreover, Plaintiffs declined to use seemingly available judicial methods<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> for testing the interior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>of the houses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We have yet to address this scenario, but the Court of Special Appeals addressed it in <em>West v.

We consider those cases now.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In <em>West, </em>the plaintiff alleged that he sustained injuries from ingesting chipping and flaking paint while living with his grandmother in a property owned and leased out by the defendants. West\u2019s negligence claim was based on circumstantial evidence because the property, since razed, had not been the subject of lead testing. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted, concluding that West failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case because, unlike in <em>Dow, </em>West\u2019s mother stated during deposition that West either resided or spent substantial amounts of time at a variety of houses during the first six years of his life, during which he experienced lead poisoning. The Circuit Court reasoned that, in light of West\u2019s \u201cuncertain residential history and the lack of any direct evidence that [the subject property owned by the defendants] ever contained lead paint, [West] could not point to [the subject property] as the source of his lead poisoning.\u201d <em>West, </em>212 Md.App. at 166, 66 A.3d at 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals agreed. The intermediate appellate court acknowledged that \u201c[a] lead paint plaintiff may, of course, establish a prima facie case of negligence based solely on circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>West, </em>212 Md.App. at 175, 66 A.3d at 1151. For example, the court cited <em>Dow, </em>in which there was also no direct evidence that lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>paint was present at the subject property. The court distinguished <em>Dow, </em>however, on the grounds that \u201cthe process of elimination showed ineluctably that [the subject property] had to have been (not could have been, but had to have been), a place containing lead paint.\u201d <em>Id., </em>212 Md.App. at 172, 66 A.3d at 1149. The <em>West </em>court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">The evidence showed indisputably that the only place where she could have been exposed to lead paint was at [the subject property]. There was only one possible cause for the undisputed effect [because deposition testimony indicated that the plaintiff did not live or spend substantial time at any other property]. By process of elimination, there was no other possible source of exposure. That, we held, constituted solid circumstantial evidence that the house contained lead paint....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\"><em>Id., </em>212 Md.App. at 172, 66 A.3d at 1149-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">That the facts in <em>Dow </em>permitted the court to derive two analytic steps from a singular set of facts, the <em>West </em>court cautioned, \u201cshould not obscure the fact that there was still involved a two-step analytic process, and that what may be said about one step in that analytic process does not necessarily apply to the other step.\u201d <em>West, </em>212 Md.App. at 173, 66 A.3d at 1150. Reiterating, the necessary two-steps are (1) the plaintiff must show first that the subject property had lead-based paint, and (2) then the plaintiff must show that his or her exposure at the subject property \u201cwas an effective cause of his lead poisoning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the <em>West </em>court, the second step, \u201c[t]he proof of ultimate causation[,] does not demand exclusivity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first step, the proof that the subject property had lead paint, however, does demand exclusivity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Based on the distinction between the proof required to satisfy these two steps, the <em>West </em>court concluded that \u201cwhere no direct evidence that [the subject property] even contained lead paint, [West] may only rely on that critical fact, as a necessary part of his circumstantial evidence, if he can show by the process of elimination that [the subject property] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the only possible cause for the critical effect of lead poisoning.\u201d <em>West, </em>212 Md.App. at 175, 66 A.3d at 1151. In other words, \u201c[the court] may only infer the existence of lead paint at [the subject property] from [West]\u2019s condition if lead paint at [the subject property] is shown to have been the only possible explanation for [West]\u2019s condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To expound on this \u201csubtle,\u201d \u201ccritical\u201d distinction, the <em>West </em>court explained further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">The distinction that Dominique [the victim] fails to grasp is a subtle one; it is nonetheless a critical one. In Dominique\u2019s forensic syllogism, his conclusion of ultimate liability does not, to be sure, depend upon the exclusivity of 1814 Lorman Street as a source of his lead poisoning. Lorman Street could readily share liability with two or three other places of exposure. That, however, is not the point. Before even getting to a syllogism\u2019s conclusion, one must first establish the premises out of which the conclusion arises. A necessary premise in this case is that there was, indeed, lead paint at 1814 Lorman Street. It is with respect to that antecedent premise, not with respect to the ultimate conclusion, that the lack of exclusivity is Dominique\u2019s Waterloo. It is the teaching of <em>Dow </em>that, even in the absence of direct proof, the presence of lead paint at a particular site can be inferred by the process of elimination, but only if we have 1) the effect of lead poisoning in the plaintiff and 2) the fact that the site in question was the exclusive possible source of the plaintiffs lead paint exposure. It was the truth of that premise that Dominique failed to establish in this case, not the validity of the conclusion proceeding from the premises. Exclusivity was not required at B. It was required at A, before one even gets to B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><em>West, </em>212 Md.App. at 175-76, 66 A.3d at 1151-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We agree with the <em>West </em>court\u2019s analysis for application to those cases where a plaintiff relies on a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation. Under a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation, a plaintiff must rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure in order to prove that it is probable that the subject property contained lead-based paint. Where the plaintiff fails to rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>out other reasonably probable sources, the necessary inferences for a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation cannot be drawn with sufficient validity to allow the claim to survive summary judgment. <em>See also Taylor, </em>207 Md.App. at 136, 150, 51 A.3d at 752, 760-61 (concluding that the trial court granted aptly the defense motion for summary judgment on the grounds that \u201c[t]he evidence in this case does not come close to the kind of circumstantial evidence that the Court found sufficient in <em>Dow </em>and that .. . it\u2019s not simply the age of the house and even the peeling\u201d). That certain facts are missing to establish a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation, however, does not mean that the lead-poisoned plaintiff has no way to prove circumstantially a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case. To the extent that <em>West </em>suggests that a lead-paint plaintiff must exclude all other sources of lead exposure in every instance of circumstantial proof, we do not agree necessarily with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">A lead-paint poisoned plaintiff may prove circumstantially that the subject property contained lead-based paint in a number of ways. As discussed above, if a plaintiff is able to exclude other reasonably probable sources of lead, such as in <em>Dow, </em>then the plaintiff presents a <em>prima facie </em>case. By way of another example, consider this illustration representing a traditional short series of row houses in Baltimore:</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>In this hypothetical, row house \u201cB\u201d is the subject property (designated with the \u201cX\u201d) that a plaintiff hopes to prove, through circumstantial evidence, contains lead-based paint. Perhaps the row house was razed, however, and direct testing is impossible at the time of the litigation. There exists, however, evidence that these four row houses were built at the same time in the 1920\u2019s and that they were owned as a group by a series of persons or entities through the 1950\u2019s. Moreover, the City\u2019s records reveal that row houses \u201cA\u201d and \u201cC\u201d (designated with stripes) tested positive previously for lead paint on the interior of the houses. Thus, in this hypothetical (at least in the absence of evidence of lead abatement measures), the plaintiff is able to present circumstantial evidence from which a jury could infer reasonably that the subject property contained lead-based paint \u2014 without having to exclude all other sources of potential exposure to lead-paint poisoning.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Where a plaintiff who does not produce evidence to support another theory, of causation and, instead, relies on a causation theory similar to that espoused in <em>Dow, </em>the validity of the necessary inference is limited to those circumstances where the plaintiff is able also to exclude other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">B. Bridging the Inference Link with Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Plaintiffs in the present cases argue that their experts\u2019 testimony bridged any evidentiary gap in their circumstantial proof. Specifically, their experts opined that the subject properties were probably a substantial contributor to Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The Court of Special Appeals addressed a similar contention in <em>Raymond Hamilton, </em>213 Md.App. 589, 75 A.3d 327. In that case, the plaintiff lived at three leased dwellings: (1) a house on Gilmor Street from birth until 1993; (2) a house on Harlem Avenue from 1993 to 1995; and (3) a house on Fulton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Avenue from 1995 to 1999. None of those houses, however, was the subject of Raymond\u2019s claim of lead poisoning, but rather a property on Appleton Street, the home of the plaintiffs father, where the plaintiff visited often and stayed sometimes overnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">During discovery in <em>Raymond Hamilton, </em>the plaintiff presented a report of the results of a technician\u2019s lead testing on eight exterior surfaces of the Appleton property. Of the eight areas tested, only one \u2014 the rear exterior door transom\u2014 tested positive for the presence of lead paint. Additionally, the plaintiff identified two experts: Dr. Robert K. Simon, Ph.D., a chemist and industrial hygienist (the same expert as appears in <em>Hamilton v. </em>Kirson), and Dr. Jacalyn Blackwell-White, M.D., a board-certified pediatrician (the same expert as appears in <em>Ross, </em>430 Md. at 656, 63 A.3d at 5, as well as in <em>Hamilton v. </em>Kirson). The Court of Special Appeals described Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">[Dr. Simon] opined that the Appleton Street property was a source of [the plaintiffs] exposure to lead-based paint. He assumed from the age of the Appleton Street property that it contained lead-based paint (invoking Md.Code Regs. 26.16.01.03(A) (2013)).[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] When asked to describe the basis for his opinion that the Appleton Street property contained lead-based paint, Dr. Simon admitted that he assumed the presence of lead both there and at the Harlem Avenue property from the properties\u2019 age....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\"><em>Raymond Hamilton, </em>213 Md.App. at 595-96, 75 A.3d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Dr. Blackwell-White \u201copined that the Appleton Street, Harlem Avenue, and Fulton Avenue properties all were sources of lead-based paint and that [the plaintiff]\u2019s injuries were caused by exposure at the sites----\u201d <em>Id., </em>213 Md.App. at 597, 75 A.3d at 331. She explained, in part: \u201cBoth properties [the Apple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ton Street and Harlem Avenue properties] were old and in the absence of physical lead assessment information, are presumed to have contained lead based paint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>During a deposition of Dr. Blackwell-White, defense counsel asked repeatedly whether Dr. Blackwell-White could rule out the other properties as a contributing source. Dr. Blackwell-White replied that she could not. When she was asked what was the basis of her opinion, she stated: \u201cThat [the Harlem Avenue property] too, was an older property in disrepair. And it was the property of residence when the elevated lead levels were found.\u201d <em>Id., </em>213 Md.App. at 600, 75 A.3d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Dackman moved for summary judgment, arguing (1) that the plaintiff \u201chad failed to provide either direct or circumstantial evidence demonstrating the presence of lead at the Appleton Street property during the relevant time period, and (2) that he could not rule out other properties as potential sources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In particular, \u201cDackman also claimed that because Raymond\u2019s experts admitted they were unable to rule out other sources of lead exposure or other properties as containing lead, they lacked an adequate factual basis to conclude that the Appleton Street property was <em>the </em>source of his lead exposure.\u201d <em>Id., </em>213 Md.App. at 600-01, 75 A.3d at 333 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The plaintiff retorted that there was abundant evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">He argued that the Arc Report\u2019s single positive test demonstrated he was exposed to lead at the Appleton Street property. And he claimed that this evidence coupled with the testimony of his experts established a <em>prima facie </em>case that the Appleton Street property was a \u2018substantial contributing factor\u2019 to his injuries because he was required only to show that \u2018he was, more likely than not, exposed to lead paint at a given subject property.\u2019 He argued that he was not required to prove only a single source of lead exposure or a single cause of his injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\"><em>Id., </em>213 Md.App. at 601, 75 A.3d at 333. The Circuit Court granted the defense motion for summary judgment, holding that the plaintiff \u201chad not produced evidence sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>establish a prima facie case of lead exposure at the one property at issue here, and the court declined to allow [the plaintiffs expert] to fill the causal gaps.\u201d <em>Id., </em>213 Md.App. at 591-92, 75 A.3d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals stated that \u201can expert cannot transform thin evidence or assumptions into viable causal connections simply by labeling them an expert opinion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>213 Md.App. at 608, 75 A.3d at 338; <em>see also Taylor v. Fishkind, </em>207 Md.App. 121, 142, 51 A.3d 743, 756 (2012) (\u201c ![a]n expert\u2019s opinion testimony must be based on [an] adequate factual basis so that it does not amount to conjecture, speculation, or incompetent evidence.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Booker, </em>152 Md.App. 166, 182-83, 831 A.2d 481 (2003) (alterations in original)). Moreover, the court stated that Maryland courts \u201chave for some time required more of a plaintiff than simply a showing that he lived in an old house in an area where lead-based paint historically was present.\u201d <em>Raymond Hamilton, </em>213 Md.App. at 612, 75 A.3d at 340; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c \u2018[T]he mere fact that most old houses in Baltimore have lead-based paint does not mean that a particular old Baltimore house has a similar deficiency.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Davis v. Goodman, </em>117 Md.App. 378, 393, 700 A.2d 798, 805 (1997)).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, the court emphasized that \u201ca plaintiff bears the burden to establish the presence of lead in the child\u2019s environment, and cannot just assume it merely from the age or location of the house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In applying those principles to the experts\u2019 opinions in <em>Raymond, Hamilton, </em>the Court of Special Appeals concluded that neither of the experts possessed the qualifications necessary, nor the factual basis, to render an opinion as to the source of the lead that the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ingested. Moreover, the court reasoned that, similar to <em>Ross, </em>because the expert \u201creached a conclusion as to the source notwithstanding the presence of other potential sources of lead, and as such her opinion \u2018was as likely to confuse as to assist a jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ross, </em>430 Md. at 664, 63 A.3d at 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The intermediate appellate court held that, without the experts\u2019 testimonies, \u201cthe evidence proffered here would have allowed a jury at most to find a <em>possibility </em>that the circumstantially-established lead exposure at the Appleton Street property was a source <em>of </em>[the plaintiffs] alleged injuries. That is not enough: a plaintiff must establish ... a <em>probability </em>that a property exposed him or her to injury-causing lead paint.\u201d <em>Id., </em>213 Md.App. at 605, 75 A.3d at 336 (citing <em>Ross, </em>430 Md. at 664, 63 A.3d at 10) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In sum, <em>Dow </em>does not define the only set of circumstantial facts that may satisfy a plaintiffs burden to establish a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case for lead paint poisoning. The pertinent question to be asked is whether the particular circumstantial evidence permits an inference or inferences of the desired ultimate fact or facts as a \u201creasonable likelihood or probability,\u201d and not a mere \u201cpossibility.\u201d To the extent that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinions discussed in this opinion suggest that the only way to prove a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case circumstantially is to eliminate every other reasonable possibility as an alternative source, we do not agree with the exclusivity of such a conclusion. With this understanding and these principles in mind, we shall apply them to the present cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"ArF\">i. <em>Hamilton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">There was no direct evidence adduced of lead-based paint in the interior of 754 Bartlett Avenue. Moreover, there was no evidence, as there was in <em>Dow, </em>that the children spent substantially all of their time in one house, the subject property, such that the Circuit Court could conclude that a fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>finder could be persuaded that there was a reasonable probability that the subject property contained lead-based paint. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, emphasized that, in order to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case, \u201cthe evidence ... would have had to provide the experts with enough information to rule out other possible sources of lead exposure to create the circumstantial evidence that the Hamiltons were exposed to lead at the Bartlett house.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>slip op. at 21. The intermediate appellate court held that the evidence in the Hamiltons\u2019 case did not do so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">Here, the Hamiltons presented an Arc report regarding exterior surfaces, the mother\u2019s statements that the boys put paint chips in their mouths at the Bartlett house, the elevated blood levels, and the age of the house. This evidence suggests, but is not sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to whether the Bartlett address contained lead paint unless the Bartlett property was the only place where the Hamiltons could have been exposed to lead paint.... Dr. Blackwell-White and Dr. Simon conceded that ... two [other visiting] properties could not be ruled out as potential sources because there was some information that suggested they contained lead, and Dr. Simon specifically stated that the time spent at those houses increased the possibility of lead exposure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 20-21. In so holding, the court acknowledged that \u201cmore than one home can be a substantial contributing source of lead and therefore, more than one landowner could be liable for a child\u2019s lead poisoning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. The court went on, though, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">However, the underlying assumption in that statement is that both houses had the potential to cause injury because they actually contained lead. Based on our case law, to even enter the realm of \u2018substantial contributing source,\u2019 a house has to be shown to have had lead-based paint\u2014 almost invariably in the interior of the building. Without direct evidence that the Bartlett house contained lead, the Hamiltons\u2019 only option was to eliminate other sources of lead poisoning, not to establish that the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>place responsible for the Hamiltons\u2019 lead poisoning was the Bartlett house, but to show that the Bartlett house contained lead. However, neither of Hamiltons\u2019 experts could eliminate the other potential sources of lead. In fact, they were provided with little information on those other potential sources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 21-22 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The Court of Special Appeals recognized aptly the multilayered nature of the causation analysis in circumstantial evidence cases. The court stated that the Hamiltons were not required \u201cto establish that the only place responsible for the Hamiltons\u2019 lead poisoning was the Bartlett house, but [were required] to show that the Bartlett house contained lead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. We depart from the reasoning of the intermediate appellate court, however, that, without direct evidence, \u201cthe Hamiltons\u2019 only option was to eliminate other sources of lead poisoning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we discussed above at 587-38, 96 A.3d at 735-37 in our hypothetical of the block of row houses, there may be other ways that an injured plaintiff may establish that it was probable that the interior of a subject house contained lead. Accordingly, the sole concern should not be that the Hamiltons\u2019 experts were provided with little information on other potential sources of lead exposure. Rather, the concern should be that the Hamiltons\u2019 experts reached the conclusion that the house contained lead-based paint on a presumption that houses built during a certain time period contain typically lead-based paint. Such a factual basis is insufficient for an expert to reach the conclusion that the interior of a specific property contained lead-based paint during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">ii. <em>Alston</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">In <em>Alston, </em>at the end of the motions hearing, the Circuit Court concluded that the defense motion for summary judgment should not be granted on the basis of uncertainty over where Plaintiffs lived, even though there was very little evidence and that which was adduced was \u201cextremely sketchy in this case.\u201d Instead, the judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of a failure to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>sufficient proof of causation linking the plaintiffs elevated blood lead levels and the specific conditions of the subject properties. The Circuit Court\u2019s reasoning is important to our (and its) analysis and, thus, we expound further.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The Circuit Court accepted that Plaintiffs showed that the subject properties had \u201cdeteriorating paint\u201d and that, at least for purposes of the summary judgment motion, Plaintiffs \u201cexhibited elevated blood lead levels at around the time that they say they were living in these properties.\u201d Moreover, the Circuit Court acknowledged correctly that generally Plaintiffs could prove a causal link \u201cindirectly by circumstantial means.\u201d The Circuit Court concluded, however, that the plaintiffs failed to forge the first inferential link because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">I think the essential logical ingredient that must be present in order for <em>Dow </em>or a theory like <em>Dow </em>to apply is that logically there must be a \u2014 a very strong conclusion that the lead [poisoning] that the plaintiffs were experiencing had to come from this source because there is no other logical source that is available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">(Emphasis added.) The Circuit Court stated on the record that \u201cthere may be a number of ways that could be done\u201d and then provided several examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">Pve suggested one of them would be if there were visitation properties, that there is some evidence that tends to exclude those. There might be evidence that the paint wasn\u2019t deteriorating in those. There might be evidence that they were built after a period when lead paint was likely present, [sic] There might be evidence that the visits were very short, were supervised closely and the children didn\u2019t ingest paint. There may be a number of bases that might be advanced by plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The problem, the Circuit Court stated, was that \u201cyou simply have two wide open possible properties at the same time, either of which could have been the source of the lead that is alleged. And that is insufficient to establish the <em>prima facie </em>case that the plaintiff would have to show on negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>On appeal, the Alstons argue that this analysis was defective. We disagree. Plaintiffs bear the initial burden of proving circumstantially a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case.' Part of that burden is to advance a viable theory of causation. In the Alstons\u2019 case, they argued a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation, but, as the Circuit Court noted, the Alstons failed to produce the quantum or quality of evidence noted in <em>Dow, </em>namely, they failed to eliminate other reasonably probable identified sources of lead exposure. Thus, the Circuit Court\u2019s comparison of the Alstons\u2019 case to <em>Dow </em>was appropriate and its ultimate conclusion that the Alstons\u2019 failed to meet their initial burden was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Thus, our discussion of the relevant facts focuses on the claims involving the Kirson property primarily and the Singer property only to the extent relevant and necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b545-45\">.

Dackman, </em>213 Md.App. 589, 75 A.3d 327 (2013), and <em>Taylor v. Fishkind, </em>207 Md.App. 121, 51 A.3d 743 (2012), reviewed the Circuit Court's grant of motions for summary judgment on the grounds of an insufficient basis for the expert's testimony under two standards of review. The intermediate court reviewed the trial court's decisions regarding the sufficiency of the experts\u2019 opinions under an abuse of discretion standard, and the decisions regarding the summary judgment without deference. That is not the standard to be employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">This Court recognizes that \u201cin order to pass muster at a summary judgment proceeding, the opponent must produce evidence that would be admissible at trial.\u201d <em>Helinski v. Rosenberg, </em>90 Md.App. 158, 166, 600 A.2d 882, 886 <em>rev\u2019d, </em>328 Md. 664, 616 A.2d 866, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Rosenberg v. Helinski, </em>328 Md. 664, 616 A.2d 866 (1992) (citing <em>Gooch v.

Maryland Rule 5-702, which governs the admissibility of expert testimony, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, where a circuit court grants a summary judgment motion on the grounds that the plaintiffs expert lacks a sufficient factual basis of admissible facts and the admissible evidence (if any) is insufficient independently to prove causation, the circuit court is making a decision on the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony as part of its summary judgment decision and, thus, is making a legal decision. Such a decision is reviewed on appeal without deference, as the grant of all summary judgment motions are. <em>See, e.g., Giant Food, Inc. </em>v. <em>Booker, 152 </em>Md.App. 166, 176-78, 831 A.2d 481, 486-87 (2003) (reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict without deference, even though the reasoning for the trial judge\u2019s decision was based upon the admissibility of the expert testimony due to an allegedly sufficient factual basis for concluding that accidental exposure to Freon caused the plaintiff\u2019s asthma).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\">. In several other jurisdictions, plaintiffs in lead paint poisoning negligence actions are required additionally to adduce evidence that the tort defendant had knowledge that he or she violated the statute. In Maryland, however, <em>Brooks </em>makes clear that \u201conce it is established that there was a statutory violation, the tort defendant's knowledge that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>or she violated the statute is not part of the tort plaintiff's burden of proof. It is the violation of the statute or ordinance alone which is evidence of negligence.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Lewin Realty III, Inc., </em>378 Md. 70, 80, 835 A.2d 616, 622 (2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b557-9\">.

Specifically, as noted earlier in this opinion, the plaintiffs relied on Housing Code, Baltimore City Code (2000 Repl.VoL), Art. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 702, 703, &amp; 706. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">. In reiterating this multi-level causation approach, we repeat also the admonition in <em>Ross: </em>\u201cWe do not mean to rule out the possibility of other ways that a plaintiff might demonstrate that lead exposure is a substantial factor in a resulting harm to an individual.\" 430 Md. at 668 n. 20, 63 A.3d at 13 n. 20. In these consolidated cases, however, both sets of plaintiffs relied on the same causation theory as in <em>Ross. </em>Thus, we do not dwell on hypotheticals beyond those deemed necessary to clarify or illuminate the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">. In <em>Ross, </em>the Circuit Court refused to let the case go to the fact-finder in the absence of an expert\u2019s admissible testimony. We held, however, that an expert was not necessaiy to connect the dots between the lead on the property and the child\u2019s exposure to lead and, therefore, remanded the case to the Circuit Court. We cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">[I]t may well be that, once the parties have marshaled the evidence without the expert opinion on source, it is clear which facts are disputed and which are not, and the limits of the inferences in plaintiff's favor are evident, summary judgment might still b.e warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\"><em>Ross, </em>430 Md. at 671, 63 A.3d at 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\">. For example, where a defendant owns still the subject property, Md. Rule 2-422(a) supplies a mechanism for the inspection and testing of the property for the presence of lead-based paint, providing in pertinent part: \u201c[a]ny party may serve one or more requests to any other party ... (2) to permit entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspection, measuring, surveying, photographing, test<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ing, or sampling the property....\u201d <em>See also Butler v. S &amp; S P\u2019ship, </em>435 Md. 635, 645-49, 80 A.3d 298, 305-07 (2013) (discussing the application of this Rule in-depth).</p>\n<p id=\"A7c\">In contrast, though, in those lead-paint cases in which the defendant is a former owner and a different person or entity owns the subject property at the time of the litigation, such as the present cases, the plaintiffs may not avail themselves of Md. Rule 2-422. <em>See Webb v. Joyce Real Estate, Inc., </em>108 Md.App. 512, 517 n. 2, 672 A.2d 660, 662 n. 2 (1996) (concluding that Md. Rule 2-422 did not authorize entry onto property owned by a nonparty because, under Rule 2-422, \"nonparties may not be compelled to submit to an inspection of their property\u201d). The Court of Special Appeals made clear in <em>Stokes v. 835 N. Washington Street, LLC, </em>141 Md.App. 214, 784 A.2d 1142 (2001), however, that a plaintiff so situated may have other judicial avenues through which he or she may seek testing of the interior of a house owned by a non-party.</p>\n<p id=\"ApI\">In <em>Stokes, </em>the defendant was the former owner of the subject property. The current owner of that property refused the plaintiffs' request for access to that property in order to conduct a test for the presence of lead-based paint. The plaintiffs filed an action against the current owner, seeking an order for .entry upon the property to conduct a \u201cnoninvasive and nondestructive test\u201d on the paint in the interior of the residence. The Circuit Court denied that motion. Plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"AuKm\">The Court of Special Appeals recognized that the plaintiffs were not permitted under Md. Rule 2-422 to enter onto the property owned by a non-party, and that no other Maryland rule provided explicitly for the circuit court to grant such relief. Despite the absence of a rule, however, the court held that the plaintiffs were permitted to request such relief from the circuit court, and \"the circuit courts have the power to order inspection of a non-party\u2019s property on a case-by-case basis through the equitable bill of discovery.\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>141 Md.App. at 221, 784 A.2d at 1146-47. The intermediate appellate court reasoned that \"the absence of a rule expressly authorizing an inspection does not preclude the circuit court from granting that relief when it is in the interest of justice to do so.\u201d <em>Id., </em>141 Md.App. at 222, 784 A.2d at 1147-48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\">. We recognize that practical difficulties may preclude a plaintiff from testing the interior of a dwelling, particularly if the home has been razed since the victim ceased living there. In the present cases, however, we have no evidence of any grave difficulty that would have precluded Plaintiffs from obtaining testing. In <em>Alston, </em>there is no evidence that Plaintiffs made any attempt to test the exterior or the interior of the home alleged to be a source of Plaintiff\u2019s injuries. In <em>Hamilton, </em>Plaintiffs hired a lead investigator to test the relevant subject property. When the investigator arrived at the home, the current resident permitted the investigator to test only the exterior of the house, but would not permit him to enter for testing. Even in <em>Hamilton, </em>however, there is no evidence in the record that Plaintiffs attempted to use judicial devices to obtain testing of the interior.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>We note the lack of direct evidence not because it is required <em>per se. </em>We note it in response to the Hamiltons' and the Alstons' arguments that to require more evidence than Plaintiffs presented in these cases is an \"insurmountable burden\" for lead-paint plaintiffs generally. Without evidence that Plaintiffs exhausted reasonable avenues to gather direct or circumstantial evidence of the presence of lead paint, we find it impossible to conclude that this standard is \"insurmountable.\u201d Moreover, this Court acknowledged in many negligence cases that some cases simply do not have enough information to hold the defendant to trial. In this regard, an \"insurmountable burden\u201d is appropriate for cases that would leave the jury to guesswork and speculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">.

The regulation provides: \"The presence of a lead-containing substance is presumed in any residential building constructed before 1950 unless a person determines that all painted surfaces are lead-free in accordance with \u00a7 B of this regulation.\u201d Md.Code Regs. 26.16.01.03(A) (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\">. These statements in <em>Raymond Hamilton </em>and <em>Davis </em>\u2014 that the presence of lead paint cannot be determined based on the general area of an \u201cold\" house \u2014 were in response to the argument that the presence of lead paint should be presumed in all houses built in Baltimore City during certain time periods, in light of reports that indicate a high percentage of similarly situated houses contained lead paint. The court concluded aptly that the inference had an insufficient factual basis. In contrast, the hypothetical we presented earlier in this opinion at 537-38, 96 A.3d at 735-37 differs in the type of factual basis upon which the inferences rely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
