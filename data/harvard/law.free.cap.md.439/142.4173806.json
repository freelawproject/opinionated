Wentworth Originations, LLC (\u201cJ.G. Wentworth\u201d), for, <em>inter alia, </em>defama<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tion and false light.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Springer claimed that, under the personal injury liability coverage provisions of his Erie homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, Erie had a duty to provide him with a legal defense in the J.G. Wentworth lawsuit. Erie refused and filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief on its own behalf, arguing that the J.G. Wentworth lawsuit was triggered by Mr. Springer\u2019s business interests and that his insurance policy included a \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion, which specifically barred claims based on the insured\u2019s business pursuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">After the Circuit Court heard oral arguments on cross motions for summary judgment, it issued a declaratory judgment and summary judgment in favor of Erie, declaring, in part, that \u201cErie Insurance Exchange did not have a duty to defend or indemnify David Springer\u201d and that Erie was not obligated \u201cto pay for the costs of that defense or this action.\u201d Mr. Springer noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and before the intermediate appellate court could decide the case, we issued a writ of certiorari on our own initiative, 433 Md. 513, 72 A.3d 172, to consider whether an insurer can rely solely on allegations contained within a complaint filed by a third party when denying an insured\u2019s claim for coverage under the insurance policy\u2019s \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>We shall hold that in order to determine if a third party complaint triggers the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion in a homeowner\u2019s liability insurance policy, an insurer must consider the continuity of the insured\u2019s alleged business interests and the insured\u2019s profit motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">J.G. Wentworth brought suit in 2011 against David Springer and the Sovereign Funding Group in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, alleging that they had used two websites, jgw-sucks.com and jgwentworth-scam.com, to spread defamatory and false light information in an attempt to lure customers away from J.G. Wentworth. Mr. Springer then contacted Erie, his insurer, for the first time to request that Erie provide him with a legal defense in the J.G. Wentworth action, because he asserted that, under the terms of his \u201cUltracover HomeProtector\u201d insurance policy, Erie had a duty to defend him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Erie refused to provide him with a defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>stating that his claim was precluded by, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion in his policy, Mr. Springer retained his own lawyer, thereafter instituting this suit against Erie, in which he sought a declaratory judgment that Erie was obligated to defend him and that Erie had breached its duty by failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">In his complaint against Erie, Mr. Springer cited numerous provisions of his \u201cUltracover HomeProtector\u201d insurance policy issued by Erie, effective in July 2009 and renewed annually thereafter. Section II of the policy described the \u201cHome and Family Liability Protection\u201d offered under the policy and explained that \u201cPersonal Liability Coverage includes Bodily Injury Liability Coverage, Property Damage Liability Coverage and Personal Injury Liability Coverage.\u201d \u201cPersonal injury\u201d was defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201cpersonal injury\u201d means injury arising out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">1. libel, slander or defamation of character;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">2. false arrest, wrongful detention or imprisonment, malicious prosecution, racial or religious discrimination, wrongful entry or eviction, invasion of privacy, or humiliation caused by any of these.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The policy also contained the following assurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">PERSONAL INJURY LIABILITY COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">OUR PROMISE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">We will pay all sums up to the amount shown on the Declarations which anyone we protect becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury caused by an offense committed during the policy period. We will pay for only personal injury covered by this policy. We may investigate or settle any claim or suit for damages against anyone we protect, at our expense. If anyone we protect is sued for damages because of personal injury covered by this policy, we will provide a defense with a lawyer we choose, even if the allegations are not true. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>are not obligated to pay any claim or judgment or defend any suit if we have already used up the amount of insurance by paying a judgment or settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Erie defended against Mr. Springer\u2019s action, and as its own basis for declaratory relief, argued that Mr. Springer\u2019s claim for coverage was precluded by the policy\u2019s exclusions, which were detailed in a section of the policy entitled, \u201cWhat We Do Not Cover-Exclusions.\u201d Specifically, the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">We do not cover under ... Personal Injury Liability Coverage ...:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">2. .. .personal injury arising out of business pursuits of anyone we protect.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The policy defined \u201cbusiness\u201d as \u201cany full-time, part-time or occasional activity engaged in as a trade, profession or occupation, including farming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">In its counterclaim, Erie also cited another portion of its policy Erie asserted precluded Mr. Springer\u2019s claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">19. The policy further excludes from the Personal Injury Liability Coverage \u201cBodily injury or personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>arising out of business pursuits of anyone we protect, other than business pursuits covered by this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">21. The policy further excludes from the Personal Injury Liability Coverage \u201cSuits for libel, slander or defamation of character made against anyone we protect if the publication or statement\u201d a. took place before the effective date of this insurance or; b. was knowingly untrue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The basis for Mr. Springer\u2019s claim, and Erie\u2019s claim of exclusion, was the action brought against Mr. Springer by J.G. Wentworth. J.G. Wentworth, a business specializing in purchasing structured settlements and annuities from individuals, sued Mr. Springer and Sovereign Funding Group, a company allegedly specializing in purchasing structured settlements and annuities, in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, alleging that Mr. Springer and the Sovereign Funding Group had engaged in false and misleading advertising in violation of Section 1125 of Title 15 of the United States Code, entitled the \u201cLanham Act,\u201d unfair and deceptive trade practices under Section 13-303 of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2013 Repl.Vol.) entitled \u201cPractices generally prohibited\u201d under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, defamation <em>per se, </em>injurious falsehood,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> false light, tortious interference with prospective business advantage, and tortious interference with contractual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Specifically, J.G. Wentworth alleged in the complaint that Mr. Springer and the Sovereign Funding Group had created, maintained, and publicized two websites that disseminated false and defamatory information regarding J.G. Wentworth, specifically that Mr. Springer and the Sovereign Funding Group had sought, through the websites, \u201cto mislead and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>misrepresent facts to the public, unfairly and deceptively compete, defame, disparage, and tortuously interfere with the business interests of J.G. Wentworth.\u201d The scheme was defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">2. Upon information and belief, Defendants intentionally and maliciously use or used the websites jgw-sucks.com (\u201cjgw-sucks site\u201d) and jgwentworth-scam.com (\u201cjgw-scam site\u201d) to deliver web content to J.G. Wentworth\u2019s customers and potential customers that Defendants know contains false and misleading statements about J.G. Wentworth. The Defendants also intentionally and maliciously link J.G. Wentworth\u2019s name with the word \u201cscam\u201d in a large number of bogus Internet articles for the sole purpose of creating a false belief on the part of customers and potential customers that J.G. Wentworth\u2019s business is a \u201cscam\u201d when Defendants know that J.G. Wentworth is, in fact, a legitimate business and not a scam. Defendants personally instructed, and continue to instruct, a large number of potential customers, through direct telephone communication, to visit the jgw-scam site and the jgw-sucks site, while misrepresenting to the potential customers that these are independent sites not controlled by the Defendants. Defendants, in fact, control these sites.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">3. Defendants, through their scheme, attempted to conceal their role and avoid attribution by using Internet practices designed to keep their true identities, and tortious, anti-competitive purpose, hidden from potential customers. The Defendants intended to thereby endow their untrue, defamatory, and anti-competitive statements with a false aura of credibility. The Defendants know that if they claimed authorship of the jgw-sucks site, the jgw-scam-site, and the larger number of feeder sites and bogus articles containing reference to \u201cjgwentworth\u201d and \u201cscam,\u201d then potential customers would have given these materials the credence they deserved: none. Defendants\u2019 unlawful conduct is ongoing and continuing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">4. Defendants, through direct, personal contact with potential customers, use these websites, domains, and bogus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>articles to distribute negative content about J.G. Wentworth to actual and potential customers, as well as to the public at large, in order to purposefully and dramatically damage J.G. Wentworth\u2019s online brand and business reputation and discourage customers from doing business with J.G. Went-worth. Defendants engage in this conduct knowing that their conduct is misleading, unfair, and unlawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Although the complaint contained numerous counts and factual allegations, the two counts, \u201cdefamation <em>per se </em>\u201d and \u201cfalse light,\u201d with which we are concerned, contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">93. Defendants published false and defamatory statements concerning J.G. Wentworth on websites that they operated, including the jgw-scam site, the jgw-sucks site, and the scam-related sites.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">94. The statements published by Defendants portray J.G. Wentworth in a negative light and discourage potential customers from doing business with J.G. Wentworth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">95. Among other false and defamatory statements, Defendants published statements accusing J.G. Wentworth of being \u201cguilty\u201d of criminal conduct, \u201cfraud, misrepresentation and practices that were oppressive and unconscionable,\u201d \u201cdeceptive marketing practices,\u201d being liars, and that the company is a \u201cscam.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">96. The statements published by Defendants concerning J.G. Wentworth are defamatory <em>per se </em>because the statements falsely accuse J.G. Wentworth of criminal conduct, of immorality, and tend to injure J.G. Wentworth\u2019s profession or trade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">97. Defendants published the statements with actual malice, <em>i.e. </em>with knowledge of their falsity and/or reckless disregard for the truth and with the intention to gain an unfair business advantage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">98. Despite multiple demands to cease and desist operation of the websites by Defendants and remove the false and defamatory statements, Defendants refuse to remove the false statements from their websites.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>99. As a direct result of Defendants\u2019 false and defamatory publications, J.G. Wentworth has suffered and continues to suffer actual business losses as well as irreparable injury to its reputation, good will, and business interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Many similar allegations were made in the complaint regarding the second claim at issue, \u201cfalse light\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">111. Defendants published false statements about J.G. Wentworth on the jgw-scam site, the jgw-sucks site, and the scam-related domains.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">112. The statements published by Defendants portray J.G. Wentworth in a negative light and discourage potential customers from doing business with J.G. Wentworth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">113. Defendants published the statements with actual malice, <em>i.e., </em>with knowledge of their falsity and/or reckless disregard for the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">114. Despite multiple demands to cease and desist operation of the websites by Defendants and to remove the false statements which portray J.G. Wentworth in a negative light, Defendants refused to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">115. J.G. Wentworth has suffered and continues to suffer actual harm to its reputation and business interests as a direct result of Defendants\u2019 conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">The J.G. Wentworth complaint is terse regarding Mr. Springer\u2019s involvement with the structured\" settlement business as he was sued individually, and the Sovereign Funding Group was sued as a corporation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> J.G. Wentworth, however, did allege that Mr. Springer \u201cis the CEO of Sovereign Funding Group and is associated with other entities or associations in the business of buying structured settlement payment streams\u201d and that Mr. Springer and the Sovereign Funding Group benefitted from business lost by J.G. Wentworth, because of the alleged defamation. The viability of Sovereign as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>an entity, however, was questioned in the first footnote in the J.G. Wentworth complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">The Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (\u201cSDAT\u201d) online Business Records Search did not result in any matches for a business entity call \u201cSovereign Funding Group.\u201d The SDAT Business Records Search did result in a record for the \u201cSovereign Group,\u201d which was registered at an address in Columbia, Maryland to Melissa Springer, who, upon information and belief, is the wife of Defendant David Springer. According to SDAT, the corporate status for the Sovereign Group was forfeited in April 2009....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Eventually, however, pursuant to a joint stipulation between Mr. Springer and J.G. Wentworth, the case was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">After the J.G. Wentworth litigation had been dismissed, Mr. Springer again contacted Erie in an attempt to recover the funds that he had expended in defending himself. When Erie refused to pay, Mr. Springer brought the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Appended to Mr. Springer\u2019s complaint is a letter from his attorney responding to Erie\u2019s earlier denial of his claim for legal coverage and informing Erie of the outcome of J.G. Wentworth litigation. The letter also sought reimbursement of Mr. Springer\u2019s legal costs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">At the outset, I am happy to advise that this [J.G. Went-worth] matter has been successfully resolved. With a modest amount of attorney time and expense, we successfully defended against the preliminary injunction and raised such significant legal impediments to the plaintiffs claim that, following a conference with the court, an agreement was reached by which the plaintiff took a voluntary dismissal with prejudice. The matter is fully resolved, except of course for recovering the defense costs and expenses from Erie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Also appended to the complaint is a letter in which Erie had denied coverage under Mr. Springer\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>indicated that it had \u201creviewed all policy periods from inception forward in consideration of coverage\u201d and that it had \u201cdetermined the policy does not provide coverage for defense or indemnification of any potential judgment.\u201d The letter from Erie also duplicated portions of the policy related to personal injury liability exclusions and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">The cited exclusions serve to preclude coverage for this matter. Erie Insurance will not make a defense referral. The policy does not provide coverage for defense or indemnification of any potential judgment. Again, this letter is written to serve as a full denial of coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The letter concluded that it was \u201cnot meant to be exhaustive\u201d and that Erie reserved the right \u201cto deny coverage under any of the terms conditions or exclusions set forth in its policies.\u201d Mr. Springer, thereafter, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Frederick County seeking declaratory relief, which Erie also sought in a counterclaim, as well as $70,337 to compensate him for legal fees expended and $3,920.07 in costs incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Both Mr. Springer and Erie filed motions for summary judgment in the Circuit Court. After hearing argument, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Erie and entered a declaratory judgment which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">1. That the allegations in the underlying suit filed against David Springer ... were not potentially covered under the terms and conditions of the insurance policy....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">2. That the Underlying Action alleged wrongful acts that were expected or intended by David Springer and that arose out of the business pursuits of David Springer (as business is defined by the policy cited herein); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">3. That Erie Insurance Exchange did not have a duty to defend or indemnify David Springer in the Underlying Action, or to pay for the costs of that defense or this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">On the same day, the Circuit Court issued an opinion and order explaining, in part, the rationale underlying the declaratory judgment and the granting of summary judgment in favor of Erie. The judge explained that, \u201cIt is quite clear from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>underlying Complaint ... that the allegations involved arose from the business pursuits of Mr. Springer\u201d and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">Each of the allegations against Mr. Springer in the underlying case are derived from his position as a business competitor with Mr. Wentworth. It is asserted in the underlying complaint that the purpose of Mr. Springer\u2019s actions ... was to gain a business advantage over Mr. Wentworth by dissuading customers from choosing Went-worth Originations, LLC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Citing <em>Northern Assurance Co. of America v. EDP Floors, Inc., </em>311 Md. 217, 230, 533 A.2d 682, 688 (1987), the court explained that, pursuant to the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbusiness,\u201d it was established \u201cvery clearly\u201d that the J.G. Went-worth litigation \u201carose from [Mr. Springer\u2019s] \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d and noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">There is no requirement that Plaintiff be currently engaged in such business, but rather that the action, \u201carose out of\u2019 Plaintiffs business pursuits. <em>See Northern Assurance Co. of America, </em>311 Md. at 230 [533 A.2d 682], Therefore, because [ ] Springer\u2019s conduct, as alleged by Wentworth, originated from Springer\u2019s motive to gain an unfair business advantage/profits, the very description of Springer\u2019s actions fit neatly into the definition of business as it was done, \u201cfor the purpose of a livelihood or profit.\u201d <em>Zurich Insurance Co., </em>261 Md. at 616 [276 A.2d 658].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Because the Circuit Court determined that Mr. Springer\u2019s claim was \u201cexcluded for coverage under the business pursuits provision,\u201d it did not address the applicability of the \u201cintended or expected\u201d exclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">With regard to the standard of review used by this Court when considering a declaratory judgment entered in tandem with summary judgment, we consider \u201c \u2018whether that declaration was correct as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Catalyst Health Solutions, Inc. v. Magill, </em>414 Md. 457, 471, 995 A.2d 960, 968 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>(2010), quoting <em>Olde Severna Park Improvement Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

We review a grant of summary judgment on the following basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">The question of whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment is a question of law and is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. <em>Standard Fire Ins.

Twigg, </em>396 Md. 527, 541-42, 914 A.2d 770, 778-79 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Before this Court, Mr. Springer argues that the \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d exclusion of his policy does not apply because, he asserts, he was not \u201cactively managing or operating, or participating in the management or operation of a business\u201d at the time of the events alleged in the J.G. Wentworth litigation. Mr. Springer points to the \u201ccontradictory and ambiguous\u201d allegations in the J.G. Wentworth complaint, which stated Sovereign Funding Group had forfeited its corporate status as of 2009 and that Mr. Springer\u2019s wife, not Mr. Springer himself, had served as its CEO. Mr. Springer also emphasizes that he provided extrinsic evidence to Erie, in the form of a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>from his attorney, demonstrating that he was no longer affiliated with the Sovereign Funding Group and that he was only acting in his personal capacity during the time period subject to J.G. Wentworth\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Moreover, Mr. Springer urges this Court to require Erie to consider more than the face of the complaint before denying his claim, stating two factors explored by various tribunals when determining whether a business pursuits exclusion applies: continuity and profit motive. Mr. Springer, relying on such cases, argues that the business pursuits exclusion is inapplicable without a finding that an individual has continuously engaged in a certain field of business without a significant break. In the present case, Mr. Springer asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">Here, there is no continuity in the business pursuits Springer was alleged to have engaged in. No evidence demonstrated that Springer was acting within his \u201ccustomary engagement\u201d or \u201cstated occupation\u201d when he engaged in the alleged defamation. Rather, the evidence demonstrated only that Springer was <em>previously </em>in the business of structured settlements in connection with [Sovereign Funding Group], but that he had discontinued his involvement in that business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Similarly, when addressing the profit that Mr. Springer stood to gain from his alleged defamation against J.G. Wentworth, he again focuses on the scant record developed in the trial court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">Nor is there evidence of a \u201cprofit motive\u201d for the alleged defamation.... The Underlying [J.G. Wentworth] Complaint contained a bare allegation that Springer was connected to the structured settlement business, but that allegation was refuted by Springer himself when he, through counsel, informed his Erie agent that he was not ... The only evidence before Erie when it denied coverage was that Springer was <em>not </em>engaged in business pursuits related to structured settlements or [Sovereign Funding Group]. Thus, Springer would have had no profit motive to engage in the alleged defamation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The evidence presented to Erie demonstrated that Springer was not engaged in business pursuits, was not actively managing or operating a business, and was not motivated by profit. At best, the evidence was contradictory on this issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">In response to Mr. Springer\u2019s argument, Erie relies primarily on the language of the policy to argue that the Circuit Court properly granted its motion for summary judgment. Erie also contends that \u201cthere is no need to refer\u201d to evidence outside of the J.G. Wentworth complaint, because a court should first interpret the policy and determine \u201cwhether there is coverage for the allegation actually made in the tort complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">When examining an insurance policy, we begin by applying established contract principles to its language. <em>Moscarillo v. Professional Risk Management Services, Inc., </em>398 Md. 529, 540, 921 A.2d 245, 251 (2007). In deciding an issue of coverage under an insurance policy, the foremost rule \u201cof construction is to apply the terms of the insurance contract itself.\u201d <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 758, 779, 625 A.2d 1021, 1031 (1993); <em>Mitchell v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>324 Md. 44, 56, 595 A.2d 469 (1991); <em>Mut. Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Ins. Co. v. Vollmer, </em>306 Md. 243, 250, 508 A.2d 130, 133 (1986). When interpreting an insurance policy, we give the words of the policy their \u201c \u2018customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>MAMSI Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Callaway, </em>375 Md. 261, 279, 825 A.2d 995, 1005 (2003), quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>324 Md. at 56, 595 A.2d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion states that Erie will not cover personal injuries \u201carising out of business pursuits,\u201d and contains two key phrases, \u201carising out of\u2019 and \u201cbusiness pursuits.\u201d The term \u201carising out of\u2019 is undefined in the policy, and the parties suggest different meanings to us. Mr. Springer argues that he was \u201cnot actively engaged in business\u201d with the Sovereign Funding Group at the time of the alleged torts and he specifically argues that he did not \u201c \u2018actively manage[ ] or operate[], or participate[ ] in the management or opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tiori \u201d of a business, quoting our opinion in <em>Zurich Insurance Co. v. Friedlander, </em>261 Md. 612, 617, 276 A.2d 658, 660 (1971). Erie counters this argument by pointing to our broad definition of \u201carising out of\u2019 and noting that the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion does not require an active engagement. The Circuit Court found, citing <em>Northern Assurance Co. of America v. EDP Floors, Inc., </em>311 Md. 217, 230, 533 A.2d 682, 688 (1987), that \u201c[t]here is no requirement that Plaintiff be currently engaged in such business, but rather that the action \u2018arose out of Plaintiffs business pursuits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In <em>EDP Floors, </em>we did construe the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 to equate to \u201coriginating from, growing out of, flowing from, or the like.\u201d 311 Md. at 230, 533 A.2d at 688. The case itself was a claim filed against EDP by an individual who was injured by the alleged negligence of an employee of EDP while assisting in the unloading of a truck. EDP sought coverage from its insurer in the tort action, despite an exclusion in the insurance policy stating that the insurer would not cover \u201cbodily injury . .. arising out of the ... loading or unloading\u201d of a truck. <em>Id. </em>at 224-25, 533 A.2d at 686. According the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d its plain meaning, we held that the policy exclusion clearly provided that there would be no coverage for injuries arising out of the loading or unloading of a vehicle, regardless of the intervening negligence of the employee. We explained that while the \u201carising out of\u2019 phrase \u201cplainly import[s] a causal relation of some kind,\u201d it does not require that unloading of the truck to be the <em>\u201csole </em>\u2018arising out of cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 533 A.2d at 689 (emphasis added). Negligence of the employee contributing to the injury did not vitiate the relationship of the unloading of the truck to the insurance policy. <em>See also Aragona v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Mar. Ins. Co., </em>281 Md. 371, 378 A.2d 1346 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In <em>Mass Transit Admin. v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>349 Md. 299, 708 A.2d 298 (1998), we interpreted a clause in a state procurement contract which required the Mass Transit Administration to indemnify CSX Transportation (CSXT) from \u201cliability of every kind <em>arising out of </em>the Contract Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>under this Agreement.\u201d 349 Md. at 301, 708 A.2d at 300 (emphasis in original). After a MARC passenger train collided with a backhoe being operated in the area, CSXT sought indemnification from MTA for the damages. In denying the claim, the MTA argued that the negligence of CSXT caused the accident. We rejected that argument, however, and stated that the negligence did not \u201cdiminish the fact that the damage to the backhoe <em>arose out </em>o/the collision with the MARC train, just as the insured\u2019s negligence in <em>EDP Floors </em>... did not diminish the fact that the personal injuries in that case <em>arose out of </em>unloading the truck.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 708 A.2d at 305 (emphasis added). We reaffirmed our interpretation of \u201carising out of,\u201d noting that oft-cited insurance treatises also embrace that \u201carising out of\u2019 equates to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201coriginating from, growing out of, flowing from, or the like.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>6B J.A. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 4317, at 360-63 (R.B. Buckley ed., 1979) (in the context of automobile insurance, the words \u201carising out of\u2019 have \u201cbroader significance than the words \u2018caused by\u2019, and are ordinarily understood to mean originating from, incident to, or having connection with the use of the vehicle\u201d); 12 G.J. Couch, <em>Couch Cyclopedia of Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 45:61, at 294 (2d ed. 1981) (\u201c[T]he words \u2018arising out of ... generally mean \u2018originating from,\u2019 \u2018growing out of,\u2019 or \u2018flowing from.\u2019 \u201d); 1 R.H. Long, <em>The Law of Liability Insurance </em>\u00a7 1.22, at 1-57 (1972) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018arising out of is not to be construed to mean \u2018proximately caused by.\u2019 ...

Christie, </em>622 N.W.2d 138, 140 (Minn.App.2001) (\u201cThe function of a business pursuits exclusion is to confine the homeowner\u2019s policy coverage to nonbusiness risks and to relegate business coverage to a commercial policy.\u201d); <em>Wiley v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>534 P.2d 1293, 1295 (Ok.1974) (\u201cThe object to be accomplished by the homeowner\u2019s policy was to insure a home and not a business.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Although a business pursuits exclusion is often a standard clause in a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, we have not had the opportunity to explore its function. <em>See, e.g., Pettit v. Erie Insurance Exchange, </em>349 Md. 777, 789 n. 7, 709 A.2d 1287, 1294 n. 7 (1998); <em>Litz v. State Farm Fire and Cas.

Co. v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, </em>435 F.3d 431, 437 (3d Cir.2006) (explaining that \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusions are standard in many homeowners\u2019 insurance policies).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Our own intermediate appellate court has had the opportunity to construe a \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion in a number of contexts, one being that of a woman who sought coverage from her homeowner\u2019s insurance policy when one of the seven children she was babysitting in her home died due to her alleged negligence. <em>McCloskey v. Republic Ins. Co., </em>80 Md. App. 19, 22-25, 559 A.2d 385, 386-88 (1989). The babysitter argued that because she was not licensed as a child care provider, she was not engaging in a business pursuit or operating a business. <em>Id. </em>at 23, 559 A.2d at 386. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>of Special Appeals rejected that argument, however, and found that where the insured \u201cactively engaged in an occupational pursuit requiring the devotion of her energy, time and thought, and for which she received compensation,\u201d her activity \u201c[unquestionably\u201d constituted a business pursuit. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26, 559 A.2d at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The Court of Special Appeals also considered the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion in the context of a policy which failed to define \u201cfarming\u201d as a business with regard to an incident that occurred on a farm which bred and raised horses. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>38 Md.App. 197, 205, 379 A.2d 1234, 1239 (1977). Our brethren examined the activities of the farm and, even after construing \u201cthe ambiguity in this case ... against the company which prepared the policy and in favor of the insured,\u201d held that the trial court erred in not upholding the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 214, 379 A.2d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion, however, did not analyze what variables, if any, must enter an insurer\u2019s analysis when determining the effect of the business pursuits exclusion. Commentators, as well as a variety of our sister courts, have done a functional analysis of the phrase to encompass continuity and profit motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The oft-cited <em>Appleman on Insurance </em>has enumerated continuity and profit motive as components of a two-pronged test to determine if an activity is a \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">Courts will frequently utilize a two-pronged test in deciding whether an activity qualifies as a \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d: whether the insured has (1) continuity, that is, a continued or regular activity for the purpose of earning a livelihood; and (2) a profit motive, or the showing that the activity is undertaken for a monetary gain. Moreover, the \u201cusual non-business pursuits\u201d provision \u201cfocuses on the objective nature of the activity itself rather than on the motivation of the policy holder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">New Appleman on Insurance Law Library Edition \u00a7 53.06[2][d][i] (footnotes omitted). In this regard, continuity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>is identified as \u201ca continued or regular activity for the purpose of earning a livelihood,\u201d and profit motive as \u201cthe showing that the activity was undertaken for a monetary gain.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Some of our sister courts have embraced this functional analysis. In <em>AMCO Ins. Co. v. Beck, </em>261 Kan. 266, 929 P.2d 162 (1996), for instance, a couple sought coverage under their homeowners\u2019 insurance policy when their teenage daughter was babysitting at their home and the child she was babysitting was injured in an accident. <em>Id. </em>at 164. The parents of the injured child sued the teenager\u2019s parents who then sought coverage under their homeowners\u2019 policy. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Kansas held that the business exclusion in the policy did not preclude coverage and adopted a rule which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOZ\">To constitute a business pursuit, there must be two elements: first, continuity, and secondly, the profit motive; as to the first, there must be a customary engagement or a stated occupation; and, as to the latter, there must be shown to be such activity as a means of livelihood, gainful employment, means of earning a living, procuring subsistence or profit, commercial transactions or engagements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 166 (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Sun Alliance Ins. Co. of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Soto, </em>836 F.2d 834, 836 (3d Cir.1988) (an activity is a \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d when there is both continuity and a profit motive); <em>Heggen v. Mountain West Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>220 Mont. 398, 715 P.2d 1060, 1062 (1986) (stating that in defining \u201cbusiness pursuit,\u201d jurisdictions often address \u201cthe idea of profit or profit motive, and most have required some level of continuity or regularity of the activity\u201d); <em>Industrial Indem. Co. v. Goettl, </em>138 Ariz. 315, 674 P.2d 869, 872 (1983) (\u201c \u2018[Bjusiness pursuits\u2019 denotes \u2018a continued or regular activity for the purpose of earning a livelihood....\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Other courts have held that seasonal or occasional activities do not meet the continuity requirement. <em>See, e.g., MFA Mut. Ins. Co. v. Nye, </em>612 S.W.2d 2, 4 (Mo.App.1980) (finding occasional summer lawn maintenance by insured\u2019s son did not qualify as business pursuit); <em>but see also Rufener v. State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>221 Wis.2d 500, 585 N.W.2d 696, 698 (1998) (noting that \u201cpart-time businesses are businesses for the purposes of the exclusion\u201d). Activities that only occupy the insured\u2019s spare time, without a regular commitment, have been found not to constitute business pursuits, as have cases where the insured only engaged in the alleged activity once. <em>See, e.g., Millers\u2019 Mut. Ins. Ass\u2019n of Illinois v. Pennington, </em>888 S.W.2d 406, 407 (Mo.App.E.Dist.1994) (reasoning that where a babysitter\u2019s services were not \u201coccasional, casual or temporary or for the convenience of friends or relatives,\u201d the activity met the continuity requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">With respect to profit motive, our sister courts are divided regarding whether the activity under scrutiny must be the insured\u2019s sole means of income or whether the business pursuits exclusion may apply to part-time or occasional work. <em>See, e.g., Stuart v. American States Ins. Co., </em>85 Wash.App. 321, 932 P.2d 697, 699 (1997) (\u201cA profit motive is a necessary consideration in evaluating whether a pursuit is in fact a business.\u201d); <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. Fantozzi, </em>825 F.Supp. 80, 85 (E.D.Pa.1993) (babysitting had a profit motive because it was a way to earn income); <em>Stoughton v. Mut. of Enumclaw, </em>61 Wash.App. 365, 810 P.2d 80, 83 (1991) (holding that the activity need not be solely motivated by profit, nor a major source of livelihood to demonstrate profit motive); <em>Wiley v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>534 P.2d 1293, 1295 (Ok.1974) (\u201cProfit motive, not actual profit, makes a pursuit a business pursuit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Adopting the functional tests of continuity and profit motive to interpret the business pursuits exclusion requires that we review our cases in the duty to defend area to determine what standards we have applied to insurers when they review third party complaints filed against their insured. In our duty to defend jurisprudence, we have limited situations in which we have permitted visceral denials of an insured\u2019s duty to defend or those that rely solely on the four corners of a third party complaint. For example, in <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 397-98, 347 A.2d 842, 844 (1975), we were faced with the question of whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>insurance company, Transamerica, \u201cwas entitled to a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to either defend or indemnify its insured,\u201d Mrs. Mary Brohawn, in tort actions brought by a third party after Mrs. Brohawn had pled guilty to a criminal charge resulting from the same incident. After Mrs. Brohawn pled guilty to an assault charge, she then requested a legal defense from her homeowners\u2019 insurer in a civil suit brought against her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Transamerica sought a declaratory judgment that it was not required to defend, because, it asserted, in light of the guilty plea, it was clear that Mrs. Brohawn\u2019s actions constituted torts which were excluded from coverage. Mrs. Brohawn, however, argued that her plea did not constitute an admission of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">We held that Mrs. Brohawn\u2019s guilty plea did not conclusively establish her liability and that she should have had her day in court to establish her entitlement to a legal defense provided by her insurer in the civil action. In discussing whether a declaratory judgment was proper, we explained that \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d a declaratory judgment action would be appropriate where, \u201can insurance company claims lack of coverage because of the insured\u2019s failure to comply with contract provisions such as the cooperation or notification clause, or failure to pay premiums\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 405, 347 A.2d at 848. We abjured, however, the entry of a declaratory judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">If the issue upon which coverage is denied were not the ultimate issue to be determined in a pending suit by a third party, a declaratory judgment would be appropriate. But where, as here, the question to be resolved in the declaratory judgment action will be decided in pending actions, it is inappropriate to grant a declaratory judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 406, 347 A.2d at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">In <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 194, 438 A.2d 282, 286 (1981), we held that when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201cquestion of coverage or defenses under the language or requirements of the insurance policy is separate and distinct from the issues involved in the tort suit,\u201d it is our function \u201cto interpret the policy and decide whether or not there is coverage.\u201d Mr. Pryseski was accused of, <em>inter alia, </em>tortious assault and battery while he was collecting a monthly payment from a client. Mr. Pryseski\u2019s employer was insured by St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance and, even though St. Paul provided a defense for Mr. Pryseski\u2019s employer, it refused to provide Mr. Pryseski with a legal defense. St. Paul claimed that Mr. Pryseski was not acting within the scope of his employment when he allegedly committed the assault and battery, and that his actions constituted \u201cwillful acts\u201d which were not covered by the policy. Mr. Pryseski instituted his own legal defense and then brought suit against St. Paul seeking a declaratory judgment that it was required to defend. Before trial began in either the tort suit or the declaratory judgment action, St. Paul settled the lawsuit on behalf of Mr. Pryseski\u2019s employer and the release executed also expressly released Mr. Pryseski. Mr. Pryseski in his own lawsuit was awarded monetary damages for having had to pay his own legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Relying on <em>Brohawn, </em>our intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court and held that \u201cwhile coverage cannot be established clearly from the facts alleged\u201d in the underlying tort suit, it was clear that St. Paul was obligated to defend Mr. Pryseski, because \u201cthe allegations were sufficient to indicate a possibility that the claim in question was covered by the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192-93, 438 A.2d at 285 (internal citations and quotations omitted). We agreed and stated that, \u201c[i]n light of the allegations of the tort suit concerning scope of employment and ratification, the Court of Special Appeals in this ease correctly held that the tort suit determined the scope of employment issue.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 196, 438 A.2d at 287. In so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>holding, we established a two-part inquiry to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">In determining whether a liability insurer has a duty to provide its insured with a defense in a tort suit, two types of questions ordinarily must be answered: (1) what is the coverage and what are the defenses under the terms and requirements of the insurance policy? (2) do the allegations in the tort action potentially bring the tort claim within the policy\u2019s coverage? The first question focuses upon the language and requirements of the policy, and the second question focuses upon the allegations of the tort suit. At times these two questions involve separate and distinct matters, and at other times they are intertwined, perhaps involving an identical issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 193, 438 A.2d at 285. We also have consistently held that the duty to defend should be construed liberally in favor of the policyholder. <em>Litz, </em>346 Md. at 231, 695 A.2d at 572; <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v.

Wentworth complaint were not sufficient to trigger the business pursuits exclusion and thereafter, to support the entry of summary and declaratory judgments on Erie\u2019s behalf. The complaint merely alleged that Mr. Springer was CEO of the Sovereign Funding Group and that Mr. Springer made statements about J.G. Wentworth in order to gain an unfair business advantage against them, although it also contained contradictory information possibly indicating that the Sovereign Funding Group was no longer a viable business entity according to the records of the State Department of Assessments and Taxation. There was no information at all regarding profit motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">As a result, Erie and the trial court subsequently could not rely on the face of the J.G. Wentworth complaint to establish Mr. Springer\u2019s alleged business interests and his profit motive. We vacate the declaratory and summary judgments entered and remand the case for further proceedings to explore the continuity of Mr. Springer\u2019s interests in the Sovereign Funding Group and any profit motive on his part at the time of the alleged defamatory statements against J.G.

When the Court of Appeals issues a writ of certiorari on its own initiative, and thereby \u201cbypasses\u201d the Court of Special Appeals, we generally rely on the questions presented in the Appellant\u2019s brief in the intermediate appellate court to frame the issues to be considered in this Court. <em>Dual Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>383 Md. 151, 161 n. 3, 857 A.2d 1095, 1100 n. 3 (2004). In the present case, those questions include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>1. Can the \"business pursuits\u201d exclusion in an insurance policy relieve an insurer of its duty to provide a defense to its insured, when the claims alleged were not connected to the insured\u2019s alleged business pursuits, and when the evidence about the insured\u2019s business activity demonstrated that the insured had not engaged in such activity for approximately two years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">2. Can the \"expected or intended\" exclusion in an insurance policy relieve an insurer of its duty to provide a defense to its insured, when the claims against the insured are based on reckless conduct and not solely intentional conduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">In its opinion and order, the Circuit Court did not extensively address the \"expected or intended\u201d exclusion referred to by the parties in the questions presented, but rather awarded summary judgment solely on the basis of the \"business pursuits\u201d exclusion. As such, our review focuses on the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion because, as stated on numerous occasions, we review \" \u2018only the grounds upon which the trial court relied in granting summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gourdine v.

The \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion also included a non-business exception which allowed coverage for injuries arising from a business pursuit if the insured's activity qualified as ordinarily incident to non-business.

Injurious falsehood, otherwise known as disparagement, is a \"false and injurious statement that discredits or detracts from the reputation of another's character, property, product, or business.\" Black's Law Dictionary 538 (9th ed. 2009). <em>See Rite Aid Corp. v.

The final outcome of the <em>Pryseski </em>case is particularly instructive. In that case; although the Court held that the underlying tort suit determined the scope of employment issue that was at the heart of the coverage dispute, we, nevertheless, remanded for further evidentiary hearings when we determined that a key definition in the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>policy had not been admitted into evidence at the earlier trial. We instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">Upon remand, St. Paul may offer the definition of \"occurrence\u201d said to have been found in the \"policy jacket.\u201d The authenticity of this document, whether it was actually part of the policy issued to Sun Life under which Pryseski was a named insured, and the probative value of the \"definition,\u201d are matters for the trial court in the first instance. Also upon remand both sides shall be entitled to introduce any additional admissible extrinsic evidence relevant to the meaning of \"occurrence\u201d in the policy. If the trial court is unable to resolve the ambiguity upon the evidence introduced, if any, then the ambiguity should be resolved against St. Paul as the party preparing the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\"><em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.
