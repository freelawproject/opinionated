In answering these questions we are treading new ground on some, but not all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Appellant Muriel Peters worked as a certified nursing assistant for Early Healthcare Giver, Inc. (\u201cEHCG\u201d) from April 2008 to April 2009. Peters provided in-home care for an elderly patient throughout her employment with EHCG. She consistently worked 119 hours in every two-week pay period. EHCG paid Peters $12 per hour for all of her work, including the hours she worked in excess of 40 hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Following her departure from EHCG, Peters sued EHCG in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, claiming that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>EHCG wrongfully withheld her overtime wages. At trial, EHCG\u2019s President, Esther Guy, conceded that she did not pay Peters overtime. Guy explained that she did not think that Peters was owed overtime because Peters exercised during work hours. Regarding the nature of Peters\u2019s employment, Guy explained that Peters was paid under a federal program under which Medicaid would pay EHCG $16 per hour under the contract \u2014 EHCG would pay Peters $12 per hour and EHCG kept $4. <em>See </em>Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395k(a)(2)(A) (2012). EHCG\u2019s counsel argued that because the company operated under a federal program, federal law governed EHCG\u2019s payment of home healthcare workers. Under that theory, Peters\u2019s work fell under the Fair Labor Standards Act\u2019s (the \u201cFLSA\u201d) \u201ccompanionship services\u201d exemption label,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thus, she was not entitled to overtime pay. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. 213(a)(15). The trial court denied Peters\u2019s claim for overtime wages. Though the court rejected Guy\u2019s claim that overtime was withheld because Peters exercised at work, the court explained that federal law preempted Maryland law, and exempted the employer from paying overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Peters appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court held that the trial court erred in concluding that federal law preempted state wage laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the Court of Special Appeals held that the FLSA exemption did not apply, the case was remanded \u201cfor the [trial] court to consider whether Peters is entitled to recover [overtime wages] under the Maryland Wage and Hour Law and the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law as well as other issues raised in her complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On remand to the Circuit Court, Peters filed an unopposed memorandum asserting a claim under the Wage and Hour Law (\u201cWHL\u201d) and the WPCL, requesting unpaid overtime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>and treble damages under LE \u00a7 3-507.2(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She did not offer any additional evidence. On March 28, 2013, the Circuit Court awarded Peters $6,201 in unpaid overtime wages, but denied her request for enhanced damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Peters appealed the order to the Court of Special Appeals and filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to this Court. Before the Court of Special Appeals could hear the case, we granted Peters\u2019s petition to consider the following questions, which we have rephrased for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">1. Are overtime wages recoverable under the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">2. Is it an abuse of discretion for a trier of fact to fail to award enhanced damages under \u00a7 3-507.2(b) of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law when there is no claim of a bona fide dispute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">3. Should any award of up to treble damages under the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law be made in addition to the award of unpaid wages?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">For the following reasons, we answer the first question in the affirmative and answer the second and third in the negative. Yet, because the trial court failed to make a required predicate finding, and there was no evidence to support a finding of a bona fide dispute, we remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">\n<em>Overtime Wages Under The Wage Payment And Collection Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Maryland has two wage enforcement laws relevant to this case: the WHL and the WPCL. The WHL aims to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>protect Maryland workers by providing a minimum wage standard. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 3-402. The WPCL requires an employer to pay its employees regularly while employed, and in full at the termination of employment. LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-502<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 3-505<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>. Read together, these statutes allow employees to recover unlawfully withheld wages from their employer, and provide an employee with two avenues to do so. <em>Battaglia v. Clinical Perfusionists, Inc., </em>338 Md. 352, 364, 658 A.2d 680, 686 (1995) (the WPCL\u2019s \u201cprincipal purpose was to provide a vehicle for employees to collect, and an incentive for employers to pay, back wages.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Both Peters and the Commissioner of Labor and Industry (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d), appearing as <em>amicus </em>curiae,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> argue that this Court has already resolved whether overtime pay is recoverable under the WPCL. Peters relies on our decision in <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354 (2003) <em>(\u201cFriolo I\u201d) </em>to support her argument that the WPCL not only concerns the timing of payments, but any dispute over entitlement of wages. In <em>Friolo I, </em>we explicitly held that an employee \u201cwas entitled to sue under [the WHL and the WPCL] to recover any overtime pay that remained due after termination of her employment.\u201d 373 Md. at 515, 819 A.2d at 362. Peters also claims that because this Court applies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>WPCL\u2019s \u201cbona fide dispute\u201d provision to all disputes generally regarding an employee\u2019s entitlement to wages, the statute cannot possibly be interpreted to affect violations of time only. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 3 \u2014 507.2(b); <em>see Ocean City, Md., Chamber of Commerce, Inc. v. Barufaldi, </em>434 Md. 381, 400, 75 A.3d 952, 963 (2013) (analyzing a bona fide dispute under the WPCL to mean \u201c[a dispute] as to the plaintiffs entitlement to the withheld wages[.]\u201d). We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">This Court recently addressed the WPCL\u2019s scope in <em>Marshall v. Safeway, Inc., </em>where we repeated our rejection of a narrow reading of the WPCL. 437 Md. 542, 560, 88 A.3d 735, 745 (2014). We were called upon to do so in the face of federal court decisions that continued to restrict its application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reaffirm today that both the WHL and the WPCL are vehicles for recovering overtime wages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Without a doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Peters has a right to bring a private cause of action under the WPCL to recover any unlawfully withheld overtime wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">\n<em>Challenges To The Trial Court\u2019s Refusal To Grant Enhanced Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Appellant argues that she was wrongfully denied treble damages under the WPCL. She presents three interrelated arguments that the court\u2019s order was erroneous. First, she claims that the court erred when it failed to make an explicit finding regarding whether EHCG withheld overtime wages as a result of a bona fide dispute. Second, Appellant urges that the court could not have reasonably concluded that EHCG withheld the wages as a result of a bona fide dispute. Finally, she avers that the court abused its discretion by declining to award her treble damages. Because of this error, Appellant requests that we remand this case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with instructions that she be awarded the full amount of treble damages under the WPCL. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">A brief review of the prior appeal in this case and the proceedings on remand is helpful to our discussion. In the prior appeal, the Court of Special Appeals held that EHCG\u2019s federal preemption defense was legally incorrect and remanded this case for the Circuit Court to determine whether Peters could recover under the WHL and WPCL. Back at the trial court, Appellant insisted that no trial or further evidentiary hearing was necessary and EHCG did not appear. The Circuit Court requested a memorandum of law from Peters regarding the propriety and the amount of damages under the WHL and WPCL, and scheduled oral argument. In her memorandum, Peters argued that EHCG did not withhold overtime as a result of a bona fide dispute, and that she was entitled to the full amount of enhanced damages pursuant to LE \u00a7 3-507.2(b). The court subsequently granted Peters the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>withheld overtime wages, but denied any enhanced damages, without explanation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">\n<em>No Finding Regarding Bona Fide Dispute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In granting the unpaid wages pursuant to the WHL and the WPCL, the trial court was required to make a predicate finding as to whether the wages were withheld pursuant to a bona fide dispute. <em>See Friolo I, </em>373 Md. at 530, 819 A.2d at 371 (remanded in part because \u201cthe jury made no predicate finding of a lack of a bona fide dispute.\u201d). In <em>Programmers\u2019 Consortium, Inc. v. Clark, </em>this Court recognized that a trier of fact \u201cmay not award enhanced damages unless it finds that the employee\u2019s wages were not withheld as a result of a bona fide dispute^]\u201d 409 Md. 548, 563, 976 A.2d 290, 299 (2009). For this reason, we approved the ruling of the Court of Special Appeals that the trier of fact \u201c \u2018will be required to make such an actual threshold determination\u2019 \u201d regarding a bona fide dispute before proceeding to the question of enhanced damages. <em>Programmers\u2019 Consortium, </em>409 Md. at 558, 976 A.2d at 296 (quoting <em>Programmers\u2019 Consortium, Inc. v. Clark, </em>180 Md.App. 506, 531, 951 A.2d 914, 928 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We will normally imply a finding of fact if the conclusion that the court reaches requires that finding, and there is evidence in the record to support it. <em>See, e.g., Edmonds v. State, </em>372 Md. 314, 337 n. 13, 812 A.2d 1034, 1047 n. 13 (2002) (\u201cSometimes the record is adequate for a reviewing court to find that the trial judge <em>implicitly </em>ruled on\u201d a predicate fact) (emphasis in original). Yet here, there is nothing to suggest that the court decided the question of bona fide dispute, one way or the other, and we will not imply a finding under these circumstances. Because the court did not make the required predicate finding regarding a bona fide dispute, it erred. This error, however, may be moot if Peters is successful in her next contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\n<em>Evidence Of A Bona Fide Dispute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Peters next argues that whatever the judge intended, the evidence simply did not support a finding that EHCG withheld her wages pursuant to a bona fide dispute. We have previously defined a \u201cbona fide dispute\u201d as \u201ca legitimate dispute over the validity of the claim or the amount that is owing[]\u201d where the employer has a good faith basis for refusing an employee\u2019s claim for unpaid wages. <em>Admiral Mart, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 543, 745 A.2d 1026, 1031 (2000). The inquiry into whether an employer\u2019s withholding of wages was the result of a bona fide dispute is one concerned with the employer\u2019s \u201c \u2018actual, subjective belief that the party\u2019s position is objectively and reasonably justified.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barufaldi v. Ocean City, Md. Chamber of Commerce, Inc., </em>206 Md.App. 282, 293, 47 A.3d 1097, 1103 (2012) (quoting <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>201 Md.App. 79, 130 n. 42, 28 A.3d 752, 783 n. 42 (2011), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>438 Md. 304, 91 A.3d 1156 (2014)); <em>see also Admiral Mortgage, </em>357 Md. at 541, 745 A.2d at 1030. It is well settled that a plaintiff carries the initial burden of proving that he or she in fact performed the work that was inadequately compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The WPCL is silent, though, on which party carries the burden of production with respect to showing a bona fide dispute. Because we have not considered this question directly, we look to other states for guidance. We have found only a few cases addressing the issue where the statute is silent. These cases have placed the burden of proof on the employer oftentimes because of the employer\u2019s knowledge of its own mental state. <em>See, e.g., Washington State Nurses Ass\u2019n v. Sacred Heart Med. Ctr., </em>175 Wash.2d 822, 834, 287 P.3d 516, 521-22 (Wash.2012) (\u201cThe burden falls on the employer to show the bona fide dispute exception applies.\u201d); <em>Amaral v. Cintas Corp. No. 2, </em>163 Cal.App.4th 1157, 78 Cal.Rptr.3d 572, 598 (2008) (\u201cWhere essential facts necessary to proof lie within the exclusive knowledge or control of one party, \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 is what justifies shifting the burden of proof to this party.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>In re Raymour and Flanigan Furniture, </em>405 N.J.Super. 367, 376-77, 964 A.2d 830, 836 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>(N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.2009) (establishing that the employer carries the burden, and that \u201c[g]iven the humanitarian purpose of the Wage and Hour Law, we construe the exemption narrowly, not broadly.\u201d); <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Wapner, </em>2006 Pa.Super. 156, 903 A.2d 565, 575 (Pa.Super.Ct.2006) (\u201cIt is both logical and appropriate to allocate to the employer the burden of proving good faith. Certainly, the information tending to establish good faith in a WPCL matter is in the possession of the employer.\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The rules of evidence also support this burden-shifting rule. In a civil trial, the burden of production (i.e., to produce evidence) can shift from one party to another concerning a particular issue, even though the ultimate burden of persuasion remains with the plaintiff. <em>See </em>Lynn McLain, 5 <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 300.6 at 375-76 (3d ed. 2013); Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 400-05 (4th ed. 2010). In this context, the employer is in the best position to bring forward evidence concerning its own subjective belief as part of establishing a bona fide dispute. <em>See Md. State Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Phoebus, </em>319 Md. 710, 718, 575 A.2d 335, 339 (1990) (shifting the burden of production to the party who would have particular knowledge of a key fact). Once the employer has done so, the burden of production shifts back to the employee to rebut the employer\u2019s reason. <em>See id. </em>at 717, 575 A.2d at 338. The burden of proof, i.e., the risk of non-persuasion, however, never shifts from the party on whom it is placed. <em>Id.; see also </em>McLain at 376-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>With the guidance of other jurisdictions, and based on settled evidentiary principles, it is not difficult to conclude that the employer, as the party withholding the wages, is uniquely qualified to offer evidence about its reason for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">\n<em>Evidence Of Reasons EHCG Withheld Overtime Wages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">EHCG concedes that Peters was its employee and that she worked more than 40 hours per week, thus supporting \u201covertime\u201d status. The only disputed issue is why EHCG withheld the overtime wages and whether its reason could be considered a bona fide dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The record reveals the answer to this question. When asked why Peters was not paid overtime wages, Ms. Guy repeatedly answered that she withheld overtime pay because Peters exercised around the neighborhood during work hours. The trial court rejected the claim that Guy withheld pay because Peters was exercising, reasoning that it was inconsistent with the company\u2019s payment to Peters for those same hours at regular rates.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Although Guy mentioned that the services provided by the company were paid for through the Medicaid program, she never testified that she believed that the federal law exempted the company from Maryland overtime requirements for that reason.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nor did EHCG present any other evidence to support the argument that the company withheld overtime pay pursuant to federal Medicaid law. Put shortly, EHCG pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>sented nothing that could sufficiently justify that its president, Ms. Guy, actually believed that federal law or any other law exempted EHCG from paying Peters overtime. Without this, there was no evidence of a bona fide dispute, and EHCG did not meet its burden of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Without evidence of any bona fide dispute, there is no reason for the trial court to make a factual determination on the issue of bona fide dispute. We have foreclosed any such finding as a matter of law. Yet, a remand is still necessary because the record does not reveal whether the trial court considered the absence of a good faith reason for withholding overtime pay, or gave appropriate consideration to the statutory availability of an enhanced award up to treble damages. We now review the guidelines for considering such awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\n<em>Enhanced Damages Awards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Appellant argues that it would be an abuse of discretion for the Circuit Court to deny her treble damages on remand from this Court. She urges that \u201cevery purpose of the WPCL\u2019s treble damages provision (punitive, deterrent, and compensatory) strongly favors awarding treble damages to Ms. Peters. And no factors weigh in favor of denying or diminishing those damages.\u201d Cautioning that without the threat of enhanced damages, employers will simply withhold wages, relying on the unlikelihood of employees bringing suit, Peters argues that \u201c[i]f multiple damages awards are few and far between, the provision\u2019s crucial deterrent purpose will be significantly impeded.\u201d In light of these reasons, Peters urges us to adopt a similar approach to enhanced damages as we do for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees under the same provision, and hold that such damages should be granted \u201cliberally.\u201d <em>See Barufaldi, </em>434 Md. at 393-94, 75 A.3d at 959 (\u201cIn light of the purposes of the fee-shifting provision of the [WPCL], this Court has stated that when the factfinder concludes that there was no \u2018bona fide dispute\u2019 as to the employer\u2019s liability, \u2018courts should exercise their discretion liberally in favor of awarding a reasonable fee, unless the circumstances of the particular case indicate some good reason why a fee award is inappropriate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>that case.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Friolo I, </em>373 Md. at 518, 819 A.2d at 364)). Appellant concludes that, because the facts are so one-sided in this case, it would be an abuse of discretion for the court to decline an award of enhanced damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Although we recognize that the WPCL is a remedial statute to be construed liberally in favor of the employee, we are not persuaded by Appellant\u2019s argument that there should be a presumption in favor of granting enhanced damages. To apply such a presumption would ignore the Legislature\u2019s use of \u201cmay\u201d in the clause granting the fact finder discretion to make such an award. In <em>Admiral Mortgage, </em>this Court interpreted the Legislature\u2019s rejection of \u201cshall\u201d in a proposed bill to mean an award was discretionary, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">In its initial version, the bill that enacted \u00a7 [3-507.2] provided for an automatic trebling. It was amended, however, apparently at the behest of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce and with the support of the Maryland State Bar Association, to make that penalty discretionary. That indicates to us, in line with the general discussion above, an intent by the Legislature to leave the determination in the hands of the trier of fact, which ordinarily determines both compensatory and punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">357 Md. at 551, 745 A.2d at 1035. This Court, in dictum, has indicated that the trier of fact has the discretion to decline any award of enhanced damages, notwithstanding a finding that there was no bona fide dispute. <em>Programmers\u2019 Consortium, </em>409 Md. at 563, 976 A.2d at 299 (\u201c[A] jury may decide not to award enhanced damages even though it is persuaded that the wages were not withheld as a result of a bona fide dispute[.]\u201d);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>see also Barufaldi v. Ocean City, Md. Chamber of Commerce, Inc., </em>196 Md.App. 1, 36 n. 17, 7 A.3d 643, 664 n. 17 (2010) (\u201c[T]he jury properly could find the absence of a bona fide dispute <em>and </em>decline to award additional statutory dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ages.\u201d) (italics in original) (citation omitted). Thus, an employee is not presumptively entitled to enhanced damages, even if the court finds that wages were withheld without a bona fide dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">We have not attempted in the past to set forth any guiding principles that trial courts should follow when they exercise their discretion whether and in what amount to award a plaintiff employee enhanced damages. Today, we shall be almost as circumspect. In <em>Barufaldi, </em>we considered the nature of the trial court\u2019s discretion whether to award <em>attorneys\u2019 fees </em>when there was no bona fide dispute, and decided that trial courts should exercise their discretion \u201cliberally.\u201d One of the chief purposes for liberally awarding attorneys\u2019 fees is \u201cgiven the relatively small amounts typically at issue[, attorneys\u2019 fees provide] a stronger incentive for private attorneys to undertake representation in wage cases.\u201d <em>Barufaldi, </em>434 Md. at 392, 75 A.3d at 958. That rationale is not truly applicable to consideration of a claim for treble damages. Although attorneys may be more likely to be paid higher amounts when there are enhanced damage awards, the need for legal representation is adequately addressed by the section allowing attorneys\u2019 fees awards. Thus, <em>Barufaldi </em>does not fully justify a rule that enhanced damages should be liberally awarded unless there exists a bona fide dispute as to the wages owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Yet the treble damages option was included in the statute for a remedial purpose \u2014 to cure what the Legislature saw as a problem with \u201cwage theft,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and practical difficulties that employees had in bringing lawsuits to recover wages owed. As we explained in <em>Battaglia, </em>the WPCL provides a greater incentive for employers to pay employees the amounts owed them, in full. 338 Md. at 364, 658 A.2d at 686. Thus, we feel confident that we are not departing from the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>language if we simply say that trial courts are encouraged to consider the remedial purpose of the WPCL when deciding whether to award enhanced damages to employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">\n<em>The Calculation Of Enhanced Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Peters presents arguments contending that enhanced damages must be given in addition to an award of the unpaid wage. Although, in the absence of any award, we need not reach this issue, we do so for the guidance of the trial court on remand. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a). Peters argues that the proper interpretation of \u201cadditional damages\u201d pursuant to LE \u00a7 3-507.2(b) is that such damages be given in addition to the recovery of unpaid wages (\u201cquadruple damages\u201d). She presents two main arguments in support of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">First, Peters avers that because the statute separates recovery of unpaid wages in \u00a7 3-507.2(a) from treble damages in \u00a7 3-507.2(b), the statute contemplates two separate awards. Peters explains that LE \u00a7 3-507.2 contains two damages provisions as opposed to the one found in \u00a7 3-507, which governs claims brought by the Commissioner. She contends that the private right of action is unlike \u00a7 3-507 because in LE \u00a7 3-507.2(b), the Legislature authorized<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> two separate awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Second, Peters claims we should reject the holding of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Stevenson v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Corp., </em>that \u201cthe employee\u2019s total compensatory plus punitive award may \u2018not exceed[ ] 3 times the wage[.]\u2019 \u201d 159 Md.App. 620, 659, 861 A.2d 735, 758 (2004) (quoting LE \u00a7 3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>507.2(b)). Peters relies on this Court\u2019s language in addressing other WPCL claims to support her view that <em>Stevenson </em>is wrong. <em>See Friolo I, </em>373 Md. at 508, 819 A.2d at 358 (\u201c[T]he jury could award her <em>extra compensation </em>up to three times the amount she was entitled to receive^]\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Baltimore Harbor Charters, Ltd. v. Ayd, </em>365 Md. 366, 396-97, 780 A.2d 303, 321 (2001) (\u201c[T]he employee would be entitled to receive <em>additional damages </em>according to the provisions of [\u00a7 3-507.2].\u201d) (emphasis added). According to Appellant, <em>Friolo I </em>and <em>Baltimore Harbor Charters </em>contemplate enhanced damages differently than <em>Stevenson, </em>and therefore we should reject the calculation espoused in <em>Stevenson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The Commissioner and Peters part ways on this issue. The Commissioner argues that the plain language of the statute dictates that, like the damages available in suits initiated by the Commissioner, the total damages for a private cause of action are limited to three times the unpaid wage. The Commissioner explains that the private cause of action was enacted in 1993 because severe budget cuts rendered the Commission unable to handle the high number of enforcement actions needed. <em>See Friolo I, </em>373 Md. at 516, 819 A.2d at 363; <em>see also </em>Testimony by Senator Paula C. Hollinger on Senate Bill 274 (Sen.Fin.Comm. Feb. 4, 1993). The Commissioner quotes Senator Hollinger, lead sponsor of the 1993 legislation, who stated the new private right of action \u201cwould enable employees to collect back pay and get the same results as if the matter had been handled by the Commissioner of Labor and Industry.\u201d Testimony by Senator Paula C. Hollinger on Senate Bill 274 (Sen.Fin.Comm. Feb. 4, 1993). Thus, the Commissioner urges us to follow the rule from <em>Stevenson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In determining whether the WPCL contemplates a maximum award of three times the unpaid wage, or three times the unpaid wage in addition to recovering unpaid wages, we first turn to the statute. LE \u00a7 3-507.2(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">If, in an action under subsection (a) of this section, a court finds that an employer withheld the wage of an employee in violation of this subtitle and not as a result of a bona fide dispute, the court may award the employee an amount not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>exceeding 3 times the wage, and reasonable counsel fees and other costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">This Court has consistently recognized these guiding principles of statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">\u201cWe begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions, and our analysis ends.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-6\"><em>Nichols v. Suiter, </em>435 Md. 324, 339, 78 A.3d 344, 353 (2013) (quoting <em>Friedman v. Hannan, </em>412 Md. 328, 337, 987 A.2d 60, 65-66 (2010)). Applying these principles, we first examine the plain meaning of \u00a7 3-507.2(b). Subsection (b) does not indicate anywhere that the award is in addition to the unpaid wage. Thus, it seems, Appellant asks us to force a reading of the statute that is not supported by the plain text.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">In <em>Stevenson, </em>the Court of Special Appeals, finding no case that directly addressed whether \u00a7 3-507.2(b) is capped at three times the unpaid damage \u201cexplicitly adopt[ed this] construction based on a plain language interpretation of the statute.\u201d 159 Md.App. at 659, 861 A.2d at 758. Reasoning that the damage provision addressed in <em>Stevenson </em>was contained in just one clause of the Real Property section interpreted there,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as compared to separate clauses in \u00a7 3-507.2, Appellant argues that the <em>Stevenson </em>court\u2019s analogy was mistaken. Yet the intermediate appellate court explained the link between the two statutes, reasoning that \u201c[b]oth statutes create a civil remedy by which wrongfully withheld money can be recovered, along with litigation expenses and a substantial penalty that serves as an incentive for the payor not to stonewall without legitimate reason.\u201d <em>Stevenson, </em>159 Md.App. at 661, 861 A.2d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The <em>Stevenson </em>court also distinguished a federal trademark infringement law that provided quadruple damages because the statute contained \u201cdifferent language authorizing a federal court to increase the compensatory damage award by also awarding, in addition to those damages, \u2018any sum above the amount found as actual damages, not exceeding three times such amount.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 861 A.2d at 758 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a) (emphasis in original)). We find persuasive the reasoning that because there is no such language under the WPCL like \u201calso\u201d or \u201cin addition to\u201d that would clearly indicate an award of quadruple damages, the Legislature did not intend to make it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Appellant also argues that this Court has impliedly approved of quadruple damages under \u00a7 3-507.2(b) by describing the award as \u201cadditional damages\u201d or \u201cextra compensation.\u201d <em>See Admiral Mortgage, </em>357 Md. at 541, 745 A.2d at 1030; <em>Friolo I, </em>373 Md. at 508, 819 A.2d at 358. The question presented for our review today was not at issue in those cases, and there is nothing in the context of those words suggesting that we intended to address this issue in dictum. For this reason, we again look to other states for guidance on how they calculate damages under similar damage provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Other states with analogous wage payment laws have reviewed similar language and held that a given multiple of unpaid wages is the maximum damage award when the legislature does not add conjunctive language between two damage provisions. The Supreme Court of Vermont observed a distinction in various state wage laws in holding that its wage payment law provides for a double damages award that includes unpaid wages. <em>Stowell v. Action Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., </em>182 Vt. 98, 110-11, 933 A.2d 1128, 1137-38 (Vt.2007). The <em>Stowell </em>court remarked: \u201cwhen a legislature intends to provide for wage-payment penalties in addition to actual damages, it does so explicitly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 933 A.2d at 1138; <em>see, e.g., </em>Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26 \u00a7 626-A (2007) (\u201c[I]n any action brought to recover unpaid wages ... such judgment includes, in addition to the unpaid wages ... an additional amount equal to twice the amount of unpaid wages as liquidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>damages.\u201d) (emphasis added). On the other hand, \u201cwhere a wage-payment statute does not specify whether a penalty is in addition to the amount of unpaid wages, courts typically interpret the penalty amount to include the unpaid wages.\u201d <em>Stowell, </em>182 Vt. at 111, 933 A.2d at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In passing the WPCL, the General Assembly did not expressly include any language to suggest the enhanced damage award was meant to be in addition to the unpaid wages. We are guided by our longstanding principle that \u201ca court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. ... Moreover, [c]ourts will not engage in \u2018a forced or subtle interpretation [in an attempt to] extend[ ] or limit[ ] a statute\u2019s meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stickley v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>431 Md. 347, 365, 65 A.3d 141, 152 (2013) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Hastings v. PNC Bank, NA, </em>429 Md. 5, 36, 54 A.3d 714, 732 (2012)). If the Legislature intended to impose a treble damage award on top of the compensatory damages, we think it would have said so explicitly. The plain language of the statute dictates that the total amount of damages an employee may recover under the WPCL is three times the unpaid wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we remand this case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to reconsider its decision whether to award any enhanced damages pursuant to LE \u00a7 3-507.2(b) in light of (i) our holding that there was no evidence of a bona fide dispute as a matter of law, and (ii) the remedial purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED.
