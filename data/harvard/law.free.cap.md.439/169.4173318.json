Chester Street, comprised of a building that had formerly housed a church and contained various offices. The Appellant, Edward Makowski, raises ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>issues for our review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> some of which are not properly before us, and the rest of which can be addressed as a single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Did the Circuit Court for Baltimore City err in granting the City\u2019s \u201cPetition for Immediate Possession and Title\u201d to 900-902 N. Chester Street?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">We shall answer no, affirm, and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We derive the following facts from the memorandum opinion issued by Judge Audrey J.S. Carrion of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City: beginning in the 1950s, Baltimore City, and particularly, the East Baltimore neighborhood, began losing manufacturing jobs. The City continued to hemorrhage jobs through the 1990s, causing significant urban decay marked by high crime, high unemployment, population loss, and a general deterioration in the Middle East neighborhood.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, property values were in steep decline and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>neighborhood became a proverbial ghost town. In an early attempt to combat these problems, the City attempted \u201cpiecemeal\u201d revitalization efforts, involving the rehabilitation of individual buildings one by one. The piecemeal efforts, however, had proven to be futile,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the continued struggle with urban decay was readily apparent; Judge Carrion described the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>neighborhood as depicted in various photographs that had been admitted into evidence as a \u201cscene more akin to the deserted, urban setting of a post-disaster film than a thriving, livable community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The City, then, turned to more comprehensive redevelopment and revitalization efforts, including a \u201cnon-profit partnership between government, philanthropists, institutions, and the community\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to undertake a massive revitalization of property in the East Baltimore community, called the Eastern Baltimore Development Initiative (\u201cEBDI\u201d). EBDI was intended to \u201caddress, for the first time, on a comprehensive basis the blight and disinvestment in the neighborhood\u201d through the redevelopment of an area encompassing 88 acres in proximity to the Johns Hopkins University Medical Campus<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; specifically, it would involve the construction of \u201cbiotechnology, research, and life sciences buildings, a new community school ... senior housing ..., mixed income residential homes and rental units, commercial and retail property, green/open spaces, a new park, and fresh food stores.\u201d To acquire the properties necessary for the EBDI project, the City was authorized, pursuant to the Baltimore City Ordinance No. 11-453 entitled the \u201cMiddle East Urban Renewal Plan\u201d, to acquire, via voluntary conveyance or condemnation, properties in the project area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Mr. Makowski\u2019s property, 900-902 N. Chester Street (\u201cthe Property\u201d), located on Block 1587<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at the intersection of Chester Street and Ashland Avenue, lies within the heart of EBDI\u2019s planned development.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Property is located within the footprint of a planned biotechnology and life sciences facility in the EBDI project, which will \u201c \u2018house laboratories and offices, ... employ hundreds of scientists and support personnel, and ... provide a range of public health services\u201d and will be developed by the Forest City Science and Technology Group.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Due east of the Property, or directly across the street, is a site where EBDI is currently constructing a new school.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The City attempted initially to acquire the Property in April of 2011, when it sent Mr. Makowski a \u201cNotice of Interest to Acquire.\u201d Approximately nine months later, the City provided Mr. Makowski with an \u201cOffer of Just Compensation.\u201d After receiving the City\u2019s offer, Mr. Makowski\u2019s then-tenant, The Answer Inc., moved out of the building; to compensate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Mr. Makowski for any loss he suffered as a result of the lost rent, EBDI and the City offered to give Mr. Makowski $2,000 monthly, in exchange for which Mr. Makowski would provide the City a \u201cRight-of-Entry\u201d, permitting the City\u2019s agents to enter the property for purposes of boarding up the building in preparation for demolition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mr. Makowski accepted the offer and executed a rental agreement and a Right-of-Entry agreement, both of which contemplated that the City would ultimately acquire the Property in terms such as that contained in the rental agreement that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">EBDI offers to fairly compensate you for the loss of rental income that you will experience for 900-902 N. Chester Street. This will be accomplished by paying The Answer Inc.\u2019s rent obligation of <em>$2,000.00 </em>per month to you beginning April 1, 2012 and continue until the City\u2019s Condemnation Action with you is resolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">(emphasis in original). The Right-of-Entry agreement, likewise, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">WHEREAS, It is the City\u2019s Intention to acquire title to the Property at the earliest possible time as part of the Urban Renewal Plan provided for under Ordinance No. 1202.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">At the time the Circuit Court issued its decision, Mr. Makowski continued to be compensated at a rate of $2,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">While the rental agreement was in force and after the City was \u201cunable to negotiate with and/or agree with\u201d Mr. Makowski \u201cupon a price to be paid for\u201d the Property, the City, in April of 2012, filed a Petition for Condemnation in the Circuit Court pursuant to Baltimore City Ordinance Nos. 1202 and 11-453, which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">2. It is necessary for the Petitioner to acquire the Fee Simple interest in and to the property known as 900-902 N. CHESTER STREET in Baltimore City, State of Maryland (hereinafter called the \u201cproperty\u201d), Ward 07, Section 03, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Block 1587, Lot 081, and more particularly described and attached hereto in Schedule A, together with improvements thereupon, and all the rights, ways, waters, easements, privileges, advantages and appurtenances thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining. The two properties 900 N. Chester Street and 902 N. Chester Street, having been consolidated on the tax sale records are now known on the City tax rolls as the single unit, 900-902 N. Chester Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">3. This property will be used for redevelopment purposes; namely it is one of the properties in the East Baltimore Development Initiative, Phase II.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Mr. Makowski challenged the City\u2019s authority to condemn the property, in his response to the Petition, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the City had failed to demonstrate why the acquisition of the Property was necessary, because, he asserted, the City failed to allege what it intended to do with the Property. Mr. Makowski also later filed a Motion to Dismiss Petition for Condemnation, stating in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">The Petition as filed by Mayor and City Council fails to allege facts sufficient to support the Petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">The Petition fails to state sufficient specific facts to support it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">That as filed the Petition does not satisfy the requirements of the U.S. Constitution and Amendments thereto, [sic] to justify the taking of private property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">After holding a hearing on the motion, the Circuit Court denied the Motion to Dismiss Petition for Condemnation; the condemnation case was then scheduled for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Prior to trial, Mr. Makowski became the sole owner on Block 1587 who had not yet conveyed or agreed to convey his property on Block 1587 to the City. The City filed a \u201cPetition for Immediate Possession and Title\u201d, pursuant to Section 21-16 of the Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City (2012)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>(\u201cthe quick-take action\u201d), which alleged that immediate possession of the subject property was necessary:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">1. That previously hereto your Petitioner filed a Petition for Condemnation as against the fee simple interests in that lot of ground and premises known as 900-902 N. Chester Street in Baltimore, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">2. That it is necessary for Petitioner to acquire immediate possession and title to the said property interest as appears from the affidavit of William N. Burgee, Director of the Office of Property Acquisition and Relocation, Department of Housing and Community Development, attached hereto and prayed to be taken as a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">3. That the necessity for the taking of such immediate possession of and title to said property is not due to any substantial fault or neglect on the part of the Petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Mr. William Burgee, Director of the Office of Property Acquisition and Relocation, did file an affidavit in which he asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>that immediate possession of the Property was necessary because the City had effectively acquired title to all other properties on Block 1587. He also stated that there was a school scheduled to open in August of 2013 to the east of the Property, prior to which all demolition on Block 1587, including that of the Property, needed to be completed to \u201csafeguard\u201d the health and safety of the children, guests, and staff of the school:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">4. There is an immediate necessity for the Mayor and City Council to acquire title to the subject property because it is the lone hold-out among nearly 150 individual properties in Block 1587, which is bounded on the north by Eager Street, on the east by Chester Street, on the south by Ashland Avenue and on the west by Washington Street. The City plans to close Castle Street in this block and all interior alleys in furtherance of the development plan. The City has effectively acquired title to all other properties in the block, and demolition must proceed as soon as possible. To the east of the subject property, on Block 1588, lies the footprint of a new school, currently under construction, and to be opened to students in August, 2013. All demolition in Block 1587 must be completed before the school opens, in order to safeguard the health and safety of the children, faculty and staff of the new school. All structures in Block 1587 are currently vacant. The vast majority of them are abandoned, dilapidated boarded structures. The existence of such structures opposite a new community school for children as young as five is untenable. These buildings, with their attendant risk of vagrancy, vermin, disease and criminal activity, cannot be allowed to menace the school children\u2019s health and well-being. Such buildings are also fire hazards and structural time-bombs, and as such represent a serious and growing menace to the public health, safety and welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">Likewise, the demolition cannot occur after the school has opened because of the noise, odor, rat displacement and toxic dust that such demolition will generate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Mr. Makowski filed a \u201cResponse to Petition for Immediate Possession and Title\u201d, contesting the City\u2019s right to obtain immediate possession of the Property, asserting, once again, that the City had failed to demonstrate why acquisition of the Property was necessary. Mr. Makowski also challenged the City\u2019s contention that there was an immediate need to condemn the property, attaching his own affidavit in which he asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Property was not the only property that the City had not acquired on Block 1587:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\">A check of the location on corner of Chester St and Ashland Ave. immediately across the street from 900-902 N. Chester St., revealed a massive incomplete construction site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">The internet information about the school states that the main entrance is on Chase St., and the school has a Wolfe St. address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">Paragraph 4 of William N. Burgee\u2019s Affidavit incorrectly states that 900-902 is the sole \u201chold out\u201d in block 1587 and that the City has \u201ceffectively\u201d acquired title to all other properties in the block. It further mistakenly states that all structures are currently vacant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">On Sunday, June 9, 2013, I went to the area check progress of the construction site and noted that 2030 Ash-land Ave., which is within block 1587 was occupied and still functioning as a church. Services were being held at the time I was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">I was informed by one of the Pastors of the Church that they had not yet found a new location and they seemed to be unaware of any pending demolition of the block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">The Burgee Affidavit also states that the existence of abandoned, dilapidated boarded structures cannot continue opposite a new community school. However properties on Ashland Ave. across the school and streets intersecting Ashland Ave across from school also fit that description and no efforts to demolish any of those [ ] buildings is apparent as of this time. Likewise the odd side of the 2000 blk of Ashland Ave., and the even side of the 800 Blk of N. Chester St which are all in view and close proximity to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>school [ ] do not appear to be in any stage of demolition or preparation for demolition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Mr. Makowski later filed a \u201cDefendant\u2019s Points and Authorities in Opposition to Plaintiffs Petition for Immediate Possession\u201d, in which he also asserted, because the City intended to convey title to his property to Forest City Enterprises, a private entity, as part of the EBDI development, that the City was taking private property \u201cto be transferred to another party\u201d, which, he alleged did not serve a public purpose, thereby violating the strictures of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He also argued, pursuant to our decision in <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City v. Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. 222, 916 A.2d 324 (2007), that the City had failed to meet its burden of proving an immediate need for the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Judge Carrion held a hearing on the City\u2019s right to take the Property. Mr. Burgee was the City\u2019s only witness, testifying, consistent with his affidavit, that the City had an immediate need for the Property, because the structures on Block 1587 had to be demolished prior to the opening of the school in August \u201cto mitigate the possible effects of dust and other elements that would result from having to do the demolition if the school were, in fact, in session.\u201d He also testified that there were only two properties that had not yet been acquired on Block 1587 within two weeks of the hearing \u2014 the Property and a church located at 2028-2030 Ashland Avenue, which the City had acquired in the intervening period of time between filing of the quick-take petition and the hearing date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>[MR. BURGEE]: Acquisition-wise specifically until two weeks ago there were two properties that are not owned, one of which is improved and is necessary to have been acquired and was, in fact, acquired two weeks ago.... That was the church. That\u2019s in addition, of course, to the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">[COUNSEL FOR THE CITY]: Okay, but in the City\u2019s, as it were, quiver of properties to be assembled for this project are there anymore, save the subject we\u2019re here for today, to be acquired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">[MR. BURGEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Mr. Burgee then explained on cross-examination that, at the time the City filed its quick-take petition, the owners of the church at 2028-2030 Ashland Avenue had agreed to convey their property to the City, but title insurance issues delayed its formal conveyance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">[MR. MAKOWSKI]: And at the time when you filed your affidavit saying you had acquired all the other parties in block 1587, that was not correct, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">[MR. BURGEE]: The affidavit was in support of the acquisition of this property in which we had under contract and established equitable interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">[MR. MAKOWSKI]: Within [Block 1587], is the property 2028-2030. Ashland Avenue located?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">[MR. BURGEE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">[MR. MAKOWSKI]: Is it still occupied to this date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">[MR. BURGEE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-13\">[MR. MAKOWSKI]: So when you say that you had acquired all \u2014 that I was the lone holdout; that was not correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-14\">[MR. BURGEE]: We had acquired it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>[MR. MAKOWSKI]: But you didn\u2019t have it at the time you filed the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">[MR. BURGEE]: We had an auction contract, which the title insurance company said was insufficient to go forward .... A defect in the title at the level of underwriting the title to go to settlement emerged and the title insurance company requested to have the vestry of the church or the appropriate body that governs the business decisions of the church to meet and to perform what they needed to do to satisfy a title insurance company. They did that and it went to settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">After Mr. Burgee concluded his testimony, Mr. Makowski testified on his own behalf and offered into evidence photographs of the school construction site, purporting to show that construction would not be completed by the August 2018 date. Mr. Makowski, additionally, sought to offer into evidence a map that he proffered would show that the Property was located within a historical district<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that the planned development plan would, therefore, be in contravention of the Urban Renewal Ordinance (\u201cOrdinance\u201d), which he testified, \u201cspeaks of the historic character of the properties and maintaining the historic character of the properties.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Counsel for the City objected, however, asserting that the map was not admissible because it had not been authenticated; Judge Carrion sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Judge Carrion, thereafter, issued a memorandum opinion and order, in which she ordered that the City \u201cbe vested with possession of and title in the fee simple interest in that property known as 900-902 N. Chester Street, Baltimore, Maryland ... together with the buildings thereupon, and the rights, alleys, ways, waters, privileges, appurtenances, and advantages thereupon.... \u201d She found, with respect to the City\u2019s authority to take the property, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">[A] long-standing Urban Renew Plan for the Middle East neighborhood expressly permits the acquisition of properties within the project area, \u201cby purchase or by condemnation either for clearance and redevelopment, for rehabilitation, or for public facilities.\u201d ... Appendix D of the Urban Renewal Plan for the Middle East neighborhood lists the subject property as one of the properties \u201cbeing acquired and disposed of for rehabilitation or redevelopment.\u201d ... The purpose of the massive EBDI project at issue is the redevelopment and renewal, through a master plan years in the making and a colossal influx of investment, of an East Baltimore neighborhood that has suffered from urban decay for decades. By endeavoring to improve Middle East and dramatically reduce blight through a massive redevelopment and revitalization project of an 88-acre sector, Baltimore City is condemning the subject property for a public purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">She opined, then, that, \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals has long held that municipalities possess power under the Maryland Constitution to condemn property for redevelopment purposes\u201d, and concluded, therefore, that \u201cthere is no question that Plaintiff has the lawful power to condemn the subject property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">With respect to the \u201cquick-take\u201d, Judge Carrion credited the City\u2019s evidence that Mr. Makowski was the lone \u201choldout\u201d, thereby inhibiting further development of the EBDI project:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">Currently, the subject property is the only hold-out \u2014 in other words, the only property out of nearly 150 individual properties found in Block 1587 to which Baltimore City had not acquired title.... Demolition and the corresponding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>redevelopment/renewal for the EBDI project\u2019s Phase II on Block 1587 and the surrounding area cannot proceed until the City consolidates title to all properties located there, including the subject property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Applying our decisions in <em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. 222, 916 A.2d 324 and <em>Sapero v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>398 Md. 317, 920 A.2d 1061 (2007), she concluded that the City had met the \u201chigh threshold for situations to qualify as \u2018necessary\u2019 for Baltimore City to have \u2018immediate\u2019 possession and/or title to real property\u201d, because Mr. Makowski was a \u201chold-out\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">A hold out occurs where, \u201c[djuring property assemblages, whether private or public, one or more property owners resist selling, wanting to be the last owner of a parcel or among the last, in order to be able to demand higher prices for their property because they are holding up a larger project.\u201d <em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. at 257 n. 18 [916 A.2d 324]. To counter such action, the Court of Appeals explained, \u201c[i]n public acquisitions, the condemnation process \u2014 even quick-take actions \u2014 are available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">In the case at bar, this Court is presented with facts identical to those in <em>Segall. </em>The hold-out occurring here, to be sure, is a perfect example of the circumstances <em>Valsamaki </em>and <em>Sapero </em>highlighted as potentially offering sufficient immediacy and necessity to validate the use of quick-take condemnation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Because Judge Carrion concluded that Mr. Makowski being a \u201chold-out\u201d was sufficient to justify a quick-take condemnation, she expressly declined to address the City\u2019s contention that \u201csafety concerns over the future demolition of Block 1587 occurring directly across from the new school provide[d] the necessity, immediacy, or exigency needed for a quick-take condemnation of the subject property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Mr. Makowski, thereafter, filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration Order Granting City\u2019s Petition for Immediate Possession and Title to Vacate, Alter or Amend Order Dated June 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>2013\u201d, in which he challenged the Circuit Court\u2019s finding that he was the \u201csole hold-out\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">The hold out assertion was simply not true at the time the City filed Petition for Quick Take. The property located at 2028-2030 Ashland Ave. did not belong to the City at the time it filed for Quick Take of Defendant\u2019s property. The City at that time had not reached any agreement with owners of 2028 Ashland Ave. and that property was still actively being used after City served Defendant with Quick Take Petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">He also asserted that the condemnation violated Constitutional principles, because the City failed to demonstrate why acquiring the Property was necessary for the development. His motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Mr. Makowski then noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from \u201cthe Circuit Court\u2019s determinations in a QUICK TAKE PROCEEDING\u201d; because quick-take proceedings proceed directly to this Court, his appeal was transferred to this Court. We confront, then, essentially the same issue faced by Judge Carrion \u2014 whether the facts as found justify a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\"> The State\u2019s power of eminent domain or \u201c[t]he inherent power of a governmental entity to take privately owned property, especially] land, and convert it to public use, subject to reasonable compensation\u201d, <em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. at 241, 916 A.2d at 335, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 562 (8th ed. 2004), is a power inherent in sovereign authority. <em>Riden v. Phila., Balt. &amp; Wash. R.R. Co., </em>182 Md. 336, 339, 35 A.2d 99, 100 (1943).

The City shall deposit into Court simultaneously with the filing of said Petition the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>said estimate of the fair value of the property to be acquired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In <em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. 222, 916 A.2d 324, we had occasion to interpret Section 21-16. The City had filed a \u201cquick-take\u201d petition, seeking to condemn Valsamaki\u2019s property, asserting, only, that immediate possession was necessary to \u201cassist in business expansion.\u201d The Circuit Court, after a hearing, denied the City\u2019s petition and we affirmed. In so doing, we reasoned that, in enacting Section 21-16, the City Council had required \u201cthe City to establish under oath the immediacy of the need for quick-take condemnation\u201d, and therefore, imposed a \u201cburden of proof on the City to establish that immediate need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 916 A.2d at 338. We concluded, then, that to prevail in a quick-take condemnation, the City must prove that the property is being condemned for a public use and that it has an immediate need to acquire the property, which it had not done.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Less than two months after issuing our decision in <em>Valsamaki, </em>we decided <em>Sapero, </em>398 Md. 317, 920 A.2d 1061, in which we reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to grant Baltimore City\u2019s quick-take petition after the City had, again, asserted only that acquisition of the subject property was necessary at \u201cthe earliest possible time in order to assist in business expansion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 920 A.2d at 1066-67 (quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>tions omitted). We concluded that the City had failed to meet its burden of proving an immediate need for the property, emphasizing that the City must provide specific evidence of an immediate need, not merely a bald assertion that one exists. We did acknowledge, however, in both <em>Valsamaki </em>and <em>Sapero, </em>that there were cases in which the immediacy requirement had been satisfied under Section 21-16 \u2014 when the subject property posed a health risk to the public, <em>Free State Realty Co., Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>279 Md. 550, 369 A.2d 1030 (1977), and in \u201chold out situations\u201d. <em>Segall v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>273 Md. 647, 331 A.2d 298 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">A \u201chold-out\u201d occurs in projects involving property assemblages, i.e., when multiple properties are assembled for a single project, where \u201cone or more property owners resist selling, wanting to be the last owner of a parcel or among the last, in order to be able to demand higher prices for their property because they are holding up a large project.\u201d <em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. at 257 n. 18, 916 A.2d at 344-45 n. 18. <em>Segall </em>was our seminal hold-out case, in which, in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, we concluded that an affidavit by the City alleging \u201c \u2018[t]hat all other property interests in the ten disposition lot areas aforesaid ha[d] been acquired, and demolition and sale of the entire site areas [could] not be completed until possession and title of the subject property interests [were] granted to the City\u2019 \u201d was adequate to justify a quick-take under Section 21-16. <em>Segall, </em>273 Md. at 648, 331 A.2d at 298-99 (alterations in original). In both <em>Valsamaki </em>and <em>Sapero </em>we iterated that the facts of <em>Segall </em>presented a \u201chold-out\u201d situation under which a \u201cquick-take\u201d is warranted. <em>See Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. at 256, 916 A.2d at 344 (noting that \u201c[t]he City needs a more concrete, immediate necessity for an exercise of such power\u201d and citing <em>Segall </em>as such an example); <em>Sapero, </em>398 Md. at 347, 920 A.2d at 1079 (\u201cThese quick-take condemnations deal with the fundamental right to property, and any resulting deprivation of process \u2014 that which is normally provided under regular condemnation proceedings \u2014 should not occur unless warranted by extreme circumstances. Such ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>treme circumstances can arise ... possibly in extreme cases of \u2018hold-outs,\u2019 <em>Segall, </em>273 Md. at 648, 331 A.2d at 298-99.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Hold-outs pose a significant problem in public projects; when the government seeks to address a problem such as community blight on a comprehensive basis, it, necessarily, needs to acquire multiple properties. Because of the democratic process and \u201cthe nature of public scrutiny\u201d, the need to acquire properties within a given area becomes public knowledge. Daniel B. Kelly, <em>The \u201cPublic Use\u201d Requirement in Eminent Domain Law: A Rationale Based on Secret Purchases and Private Influence, </em>92 Cornell L.Rev. 1, 5 (2006). Because the public, and particularly, the owners of the properties the government seeks to acquire, have knowledge of the government\u2019s plans, the sovereign is placed at a \u201csevere disadvantage\u201d when it attempts to negotiate for the property\u2019s acquisition. Steve P. Calandrillo, <em>Eminent Domain Economics: Should \u201cJust Compensation\u201d Be Abolished, and Would \u201cTakings Insurance\u201d Work Instead?, </em>64 Ohio St. L.J. 451, 468-69 (2003). The problem is exacerbated when the government acquires a significant portion of the needed properties and the remaining owners are unwilling to sell. These owners, or \u201chold-outs\u201d, become \u201cmonopoly suppliers of the assembled land\u201d, and thus, obtain a significant bargaining advantage, as they may seek to sell the property to the government for an inflated price, because they know about the government\u2019s need. Michael Heller &amp; Rick Hills, <em>Land Assembly Districts, </em>121 Harv. L.Rev. 1465, 1472-75 (2008). Accordingly, \u201cquick-take actions ... are available to address the situation.\u201d <em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. at 257 n. 18, 916 A.2d at 345 n. 18; <em>cf also Cottonwood Christian Ctr. v. Cypress Redevelopment Agency, </em>218 F.Supp.2d 1203, 1231 (C.D.Cal.2002) (\u201cEminent domain can even be an effective tool against free-riders who hold-out for exorbitant prices when private developers are attempting to assemble parcels for public places----\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>In <em>Segall, </em>Baltimore City had filed a Petition for Immediate Possession and Title, pursuant to Section 21-16, and sought to condemn Segall\u2019s property for \u201curban renewal purposes\u201d as part of an urban renewal plan entitled the \u201cUpton Project\u201d. In support of its Petition, the City had attached an affidavit of Mr. Jerome M. Katz, the City\u2019s Land Acquisition Officer of the Department of Housing and Community Development, alleging that it was necessary to acquire title and possession to ten separate lots as part of the urban renewal plan and that Segall\u2019s property was the only property to which it had not yet acquired, thereby preventing demolition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">1. That it is necessary for the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore to acquire title to and possession of the following listed property interests which form portions of ten separate disposition lots in accordance with the master plan for the Upton Redevelopment area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">2. That owner-occupants or tenants of the affected leasehold and fee simple areas will have the right to 90 days of continued occupancy under federal regulations dating from the time that possession of the subject property interests is granted to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">3. That all other property interests in the ten disposition lot areas aforesaid have been acquired, and demolition and sale of the entire site areas cannot be completed until possession and title of the subject property interests are granted to the City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>(emphasis added). Segall answered, alleging that the City did not have an immediate need to acquire the property. The Circuit Court granted the Petition for Immediate Possession and Segall moved to set aside the order, which was denied; we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">As in <em>Segall, </em>the City\u2019s inability in the present case to acquire the Property prevented it from engaging in demolition in furtherance of an urban renewal plan. Indeed, Mr. Makowski\u2019s property, one of almost 150 other properties in totality, inhibited further development to a greater degree than did any one of the <em>Segall </em>properties, because his was the only property on Block 1587 that was left. Mr. Makowksi, thus, retained leverage to hold a hammer over the City in order to gain financial advantage, and accordingly, was a \u201chold-out\u201d within the meaning of <em>Segall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Mr. Makowski\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Segall </em>is unavailing. He asserts that, unlike <em>Segall, </em>the City, in the present case, had not acquired all of the properties on Block 1587, based, primarily, on Mr. Burgee\u2019s testimony that, at the time of filing the Petition, the City had not acquired the church property.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Judge Carrion, however, concluded otherwise, finding that, \u201cthe subject property is the only hold-out \u2014 in other words, the only property out of nearly 150 individual properties found in Block 1587 to which Baltimore City has not acquired title\u201d and the evidence adduced at trial clearly supports Judge Carrion\u2019s finding. Mr. Burgee testified that, despite formal conveyance having not been completed due to title insurance issues, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>owners of the church were under contract to convey 2028-2030 Ashland Avenue to the City and had indeed done so two weeks prior to the hearing. He, likewise, testified that demolition of the Property and the \u201cwhole square block\u201d needed to occur, and that the City could not do so until acquiring the Property. Mr. Makowski relies solely on the fact that formal conveyance of the church had not been effectuated at the time the quick-take petition was filed. A \u201chold-out\u201d occurs, however, when the remaining property-owners are <em>unwilling </em>to sell; because the owners of the church were <em>willing </em>to sell, as indicated by the auction contract Mr. Burgee testified the church owners had executed, Judge Carrion correctly recognized that Mr. Makowski was the sole \u201chold-out\u201d on Block 1587.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the quick-take action was warranted.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>We address, now, a number of other issues raised by Mr. Makowski. The first issue is an alleged evidentiary error pertaining to Judge Carrion\u2019s decision to exclude evidence regarding whether the demolition of the Property was consistent with the Urban Renewal Ordinance\u2019s references to preserving the historic character of East Baltimore. Specifically, Mr. Makowski sought to question Mr. Burgee on the stand regarding a map that he proffered would have shown that the Property was in an area of Baltimore designated as \u201chistoric.\u201d The City objected on the grounds that Mr. Burgee testified that he did not recognize the map, and asserted, therefore, that Mr. Makowski had failed to properly authenticate it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGf\">[COUNSEL FOR THE CITY]: Well, Mr. Burgee first testified that he doesn\u2019t know, that he\u2019s not familiar with the document. He doesn\u2019t know what it is. Mr. Makowski has instructed him that there are certain nomenclature at the bottom of the document \u2014 document seeming to indicate what it is but there\u2019s nothing to verify what it is. It\u2019s a one-page printed document. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s pertinent or relevant or \u2014 and certainly not authenticated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Mr. Makowski responded that he had received the map from the City:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>[MR. MAKOWSKI]: Your Honor, I got that from the City of Baltimore in the same building that [the Assistant City Solicitor] works in on the eighth floor. I sent copies of it to [the Assistant City Solicitor]. I attached it to my response in a colored copy I attached to the response I filed to their motion for quick take.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">So it\u2019s not that it\u2019s coming here also for the first time. It\u2019s a document that has the City of Baltimore\u2019s logo at the bottom where it was issued from.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Judge Carrion sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Authentication of a document is governed by Rule 5-901, which states, \u201c[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d The Rule further elucidates a myriad of ways to authenticate evidence; the most pertinent to the instant matter is Rule 5 \u2014 901(b)(1), which provides that evidence may be authenticated through \u201c[testimony of a witness with knowledge that the offered evidence is what it is claimed to be.\u201d Mr. Burgee, however, testified that he had never seen the document before nor recognized it. Accordingly, Mr. Makowski failed to authenticate the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Mr. Makowski argues, next, that the Circuit Court erred in denying his \u201cMotion for Leave to Perpetuate Evidence and Motion for Order to Compel Plaintiff to Produce Documents that were Subpoenaed\u201d pursuant to Rule 2-404,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> as well as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>granting the City\u2019s \u201cMotion to Quash Subpoenas.\u201d These orders were issued after Mr. Makowski noted his appeal in this case and are not appropriate for our review. <em>See, e.g., Lazenby v. Asher, Jr. &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>266 Md. 679, 688, 296 A.2d 699, 704 (1972); <em>Silverberg v. Silverberg, </em>148 Md. 682, 687-89, 130 A. 325, 327 (1925), <em>disapproved of on other grounds by Lewis v. Lewis, </em>219 Md. 313, 149 A.2d 403 (1959); <em>Baltimore Skate Mfg. Co. v. Randall, </em>112 Md. 411, 414, 76 A. 491, 493 (1910).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Mr. Makowski, finally, argues that the City provided him with \u201celeventh hour cursory, superficial evasive and incomplete discovery responses\u201d, contending, generally, that \u201c[djocuments requested were not produced\u201d, the City did not \u201cprovide any specific response as to each of the document requests\u201d, and that \u201cthe [ijnterrogatory [a]nswers were deficient, evasive and non responsive\u201d. Mr. Makowski did not file a motion to compel discovery pursuant to Rule 2-432(b), which permits \u201c[a] discovering party, upon reasonable notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to other parties and all persons affected\u201d to \u201cmove for an order compelling discovery if\u2019, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 2-421\u201d or \u201ca party fails to comply with a request for production or inspection under Rule 2-422,\u201d Rule 2 \u2014 432(b),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> so that the trial court did not decide the discovery issue. The issue, therefore, is not properly before us, pursuant to Rule 8-131(a), providing that, \u201c[o]rdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court\u201d. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">We have explained that the purpose of Rule 8-131 is to allow \u201ctrial courts to explicate, to some degree, just what they are deciding or finding so that we may perform our tasks.\u201d <em>Wilkerson v. State, </em>420 Md. 573, 597, 24 A.3d 703, 717 (2011). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Rule 8-131, likewise, serves the \u201cinterests of fairness ... by \u2018requiring] counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 149, 729 A.2d 910, 918-19 (1999) (alterations in original). In this case, the trial court never had an opportunity to address the alleged omissions; we do not, therefore, address the adequacy of the City\u2019s discovery responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
