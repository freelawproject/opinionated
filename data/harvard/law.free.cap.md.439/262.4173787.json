For the forthcoming reasons, this Court must dismiss the present appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">The controversy giving rise to the present appeal began in the summer of 2007, when Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. (\u201cWKA\u201d) submitted to the Maryland Department of Agriculture (\u201cMDA\u201d) a pair of requests for certain public records. In those requests, WKA sought to obtain the specific nutrient management plans (\u201cNMPs\u201d) of various private farming operations on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, along with any supporting documentation related to the NMPs. WKA submitted the requests pursuant to the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cPIA\u201d), Maryland Code (1984, 2009 RepLVol.), State Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ment Article, \u00a7\u00a7 10-601 to 10-628,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which allows generally for the inspection and receipt of copies of public records. The MDA denied WKA\u2019s requests, on the basis that \u00a7 10-615(2)(i)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the PIA exempted disclosure of the NMP inspection records, citing Md.Code (1973, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Agriculture Art., \u00a7 8 \u2014 801.1(b)(2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as the operative excepting statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">On 4 February 2008, WKA and eight other environmental advocacy groups filed an action (\u2018WKA action\u201d) against the MDA and three of its executives in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (\u201cAnne Arundel Circuit Court\u201d) to obtain the records WKA sought.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> WKA\u2019s Complaint alleged four legal grounds, which it labeled \u201cCauses of Action,\u201d upon any of which the court should order the MDA to produce the records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>[1] On its Face, Md.Code Ann., Agrie. \u00a7 8-801(b)(2) [sic] Constitutes a Violation of the Rights Conferred on Citizens by Article 6 of Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">[2] Md.Code Ann., Agrie. \u00a7 8 \u2014 801(b)(2) [sic] is a \u201cSpecial Law\u201d That Violates Article III, \u00a7 33 of the Maryland Constitution ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">[3] Md.Code Ann., Agrie. \u00a7 8-801(b)(2) [sic] Constitutes a Violation of the Rights Conferred on Citizens by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">[4] The Denial of Access to Nutrient Management Plans Violates the Maryland Public Information Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">To remedy the alleged violations, the Complaint pressed six distinct, but at times overlapping, prayers for relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The Waterkeepers pray that this [c]ourt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">(1) deelare[] Md.Code Ann., Agrie. \u00a7 8 \u2014 801(b)(2) [sic] unconstitutional under the Maryland and United States Constitutions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">(2) enjoin[] the defendants from withholding the public records sought by Waterkeeper;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">(3) order[ ] the defendants to produce the public records improperly withheld;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-12\">(4) order[ the] defendants to pay actual and punitive damages for the failure to disclose public records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-13\">(5) order[ the] defendants to pay reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs, including attorney and expert fees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-14\">(6) grant[ ] other relief as the Court deems appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax\">Following WKA\u2019s filing of the Complaint, the parties engaged in discussions as to what specific information the MDA might be required to disclose. No apparent settlement was reached, and the case remained \u201clive.\u201d After the discussions concluded, WKA filed on 16 May 2008 a third request with the MDA for information, which the MDA approved tentatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">On 18 July 2008, before the MDA could fulfill WKA\u2019s third PIA request, the Maryland Farm Bureau, Inc. (\u201cMFB\u201d) and three anonymous farmers filed a related action (\u201cMFB action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>I\u201d) against the MDA in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County (\u201cDorchester Circuit Court\u201d). MFB alleged in its Complaint that the \u201c[MDA] received a request pursuant to the Maryland [PIA] for the disclosure of certain [NMP] information[,] ... [including] all [NMPs], plan summaries, and records of inspection or enforcement against poultry operations located in Dorchester, Queen Anne\u2019s Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico, and Worcester Counties.\u201d The Complaint asserted two counts-one alleging grounds for a declaratory judgment as to the scope and temporal limitations of Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1(b)(2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the other alleging grounds for preliminary and permanent injunctions to enjoin the MDA from disclosing confidential information. MFB identified four prayers for relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">[1] A declaration that Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1(b)(2) requires that: (a) the Department maintain nutrient management plan summaries for three years; and (b) the Department maintain all nutrient management plan information in a manner that protects the identity of the individual for whom the nutrient management plan was prepared, without any time limitation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">[2] Preliminary and permanent injunctive relief preventing the Department from disclosing confidential nutrient management information identifying the Farmers or other members of the Maryland Farm Bureau;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">[3] Award of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and costs in pursuing this litigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">[4] Such other and further relief as the Court deems appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">In response to the Scylla and Charybdis effect of the actions against it, the MDA filed a motion in the Dorchester Circuit Court requesting a transfer of MFB action I to the Anne Arundel Circuit Court. On 2 September 2008, the Dorchester Circuit Court granted the MDA\u2019s motion. After MFB action I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>was transferred to the Anne Arundel Circuit Court, the MDA filed in that court a Motion to Consolidate the WKA and MFB actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">While the Motion to Consolidate was pending, MFB filed a Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to MFB action I, Anne Arundel Circuit Court Case No. 02-C-08-134331, stating that MFB is \u201centitled to summary judgment declaring the proper interpretation of Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1(b)(2).\u201d The MDA filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment in MFB action I. On 17 October 2008, the Anne Arundel Circuit Court granted the MDA\u2019s Motion to Consolidate. The court consolidated the dockets of the WKA and MFB actions, and designated MFB action I, Case No. 02-C-08-134331, as the \u201clead case.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> WKA filed then a Motion in Opposition to MFB\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and in Support of the MDA\u2019s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The parties addressed the court on the summary judgment motions and oppositions during a hearing on 8 December 2008 (\u201cthe 2008 hearing\u201d). Two months later, the trial judge issued a Memorandum Opinion and, on 10 February 2009, issued an Order (\u201c2009 Order\u201d) in which it granted the MDA\u2019s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, denied MFB\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, including the following language in the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">DECLARED, that the Maryland Department of Agriculture must disclose Nutrient Management Plan Summaries that have been maintained by the Department of Agriculture for 3 years or less pursuant to the Public Information Act with the limitation that the Maryland Department of Agriculture must redact any and all information from the Nutrient Management Plan Summaries that may allow for the identification of the individual for whom the nutrient management plan was prepared; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>DECLARED, that the Maryland Department of Agriculture must disclose Nutrient Management Plan Summaries that have been maintained by the Department of Agriculture for more than three years without any redaction of identifying information unless failure to redact identifying information from Nutrient Management Plan Summaries that have been held for more than three years would allow for the identification of the individual for whom the Nutrient Management Plan was prepared with respect to those Nutrient Management Plan Summaries that have been maintained by the Maryland Department of Agriculture for three years or less; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A51\">DECLARED, that the Maryland Department of Agriculture must redact any information from any documents subject to disclosure under the Public Information Act that are related to Nutrient Management Plans if such information would allow for the identification of the individual for whom the Nutrient Management Plan was prepared with respect to those Nutrient Management Plan Summaries that have been maintained by the Maryland Department of Agriculture for three years or less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">No further litigation activity was reflected on the docket immediately following entry of the 2009 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Over a year later, however, on 2 April 2010, the MDA received another PIA request regarding specific NMP information, this time from Assateague Coastkeeper (\u201cCoastkeeper\u201d), a co-plaintiff in the WKA action. Coastkeeper requested essentially the same information that WKA sought in its PIA requests and the resulting litigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unbeknownst to Coast-keeper, the MDA and MFB engaged in communications to determine which information might be disclosed to Coastkeeper. The MDA told MFB that, among other things, it intended to provide Coastkeeper with an electronic spreadsheet con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>taining information regarding the MDA inspections and enforcement actions involving MFB members. MFB asked the MDA to delay releasing the spreadsheet so that it could \u201cdevelop a legal strategy\u201d to prevent disclosure of any confidential information within the spreadsheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">On 13 September 2010, after the MDA informed Coastkeeper of its plans to further delay the release of information, MFB filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Preliminary and Permanent Injunctive Relief (\u201cMFB action II\u201d), along with a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, against the MDA in the Circuit Court for Worcester County (\u201cWorcester Circuit Court\u201d) seeking to prevent the MDA from disclosing, without redactions, the spreadsheet. The following day, that court issued a Temporary Restraining Order preventing the MDA from \u201cdisclosing any information concerning nutrient management plans that identifies <em>the </em>person for whom <em>the </em>plan was prepared.... \u201d The MDA responded with a Motion for Transfer of Venue to send MFB action II to the Anne Arundel Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On 22 September 2010, Coastkeeper filed a \u201cPetition for Contempt\u201d in Anne Arundel Circuit Court Case No. 02-C-08-134331. Two weeks later, on 4 October 2010, MFB action II was transferred to the Anne Arundel Circuit Court, with MFB\u2019s consent, and assigned to the same trial judge who issued the 2009 Order in the consolidated Case No. 02-C-08-134331. On 2 May 2011, the Anne Arundel Circuit Court dismissed, with prejudice, MFB action II. On 9 May 2011, MFB filed in Anne Arundel Circuit Court Case No. 02-C-08-134331 a Motion for Clarification of Memorandum Opinion and Order Dated February 10, 2009, asking the judge to clarify the 2009 Order in light of the evolving developments in the parties\u2019 disputes arising after entry of the 2009 Order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>On 14 July 2011, the court issued an Order (\u201c2011 Order\u201d) granting MFB\u2019s Motion for Clarification and declaring how the 2010 PIA request was controlled by the 2009 decision. The 2011 Order read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">ORDERED and DECLARED that the Maryland Department of Agriculture must redact any information from any documents subject to disclosure under the Public Information Act that are related to Nutrient Management Plans if such information would allow for the identification of the individual for whom the Nutrient Management Plan was prepared with respect to those Nutrient Management Plan Summaries that have been maintained by the Maryland Department of Agriculture for three years or less. In applying this standard, the Maryland Department of Agriculture must redact only that information which would allow the reader to link a specific individual with a specific nutrient management plan; and it is further:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">ORDERED and DECLARED that, as applied to the spreadsheet of enforcement information that the Maryland Department of Agriculture will provide to the Assateague Coastkeeper, the Maryland Department of Agriculture must redact the following fields of information in their entirety, as reflected in Exhibit 2 to the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Response: [\u201cVisit Type,\u201d \u201cOperation Type,\u201d and \u201cTotal Farmed Acres\u201d fields.] In addition, the Maryland Department of Agriculture must review the following fields of information and redact any plan information that could be sued to create a linkage between a specific individual and a specific nutrient management plan: [\u201cCompliance Comments\u201d and \u201cComments\u201d fields;] and it is further:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">ORDERED and DECLARED that, in redacting identifying information from nutrient management plan summaries or annual implementation reports, the Maryland Department of Agriculture must redact the entries for name, address, signature, and unique identification number, as reflected in Exhibit 3 to the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>In addition, the court issued a second Order, on 5 August 2011, stating that no further proceedings were necessary in the consolidated case and that \u201cthis case was to be considered closed for statistical purposes and no future hearings are needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">WKA noted an appeal of the 14 July 2011 Order to the Court of Special Appeals. In a reported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the Anne Arundel Circuit Court. <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>211 Md.App. 417, 65 A.3d 708 (2013).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> WKA filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in this Court, which we granted on 20 September 2013. <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>434 Md. 311, 75 A.3d 317 (2013).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">During oral arguments, a member of the Court raised <em>sua sponte </em>the question of whether the 2009 Order was an enrolled final judgment, and, consequently, whether the Anne Arundel Circuit Court\u2019s act of issuing the 2011 Order to clarify and revise its 2009 Order was in contravention of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>revisory powers pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-535.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No party had briefed this issue prior to oral arguments. After oral argument, MFB submitted a supplemental letter-brief to the Court, arguing that the restrictions of Rule 2-535 did not apply because the 2009 Order did not qualify as a final judgment by reason of the fact that some of the issues from the WKA action remained pending.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Additionally, MFB suggested in a supplemental brief that the 2011 Order is a final and appealable judgment because, after issuing the 2011 Order, the Circuit Court ordered that the consolidated case be closed. Therefore, according to MFB, the merits of the 2011 Order are before this Court properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">To determine whether this appeal is before this Court properly, we must address first the finality of the 2009 Order in order to determine whether the Anne Arundel Circuit Court had jurisdiction to issue the 2011 Order. If the 2009 Order was a final judgment, then MFB\u2019s Motion for Clarification of that Order would have been subject to the temporal and other restrictions of postjudgment motions under Rule 2-535.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 2-535 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>(a) Generally. On motion of any party filed within 30 days after entry of judgment, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment and, if the action was tried before the court, may take any action that it could have taken under Rule 2-534 [Motion to Alter or Amend a Judgment].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">(b) Fraud, mistake, irregularity. On motion of any party filed at any time, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We note that Rule 2-535 is applicable only to final judgments. <em>See Quartertime Video &amp; Vending Corp. v. Hanna, </em>321 Md. 59, 65, 580 A.2d 1073, 1076 (1990) (per curiam). Thus, non-final orders are \u201csubject to revision ... without regard to Rule 2-535.\u201d <em>Albert W. Sisk &amp; Son, Inc. v. Friendship Packers, Inc., </em>326 Md. 152, 159, 604 A.2d 69, 73 (1992). In sum, if the 2009 Order was a final judgment, the Anne Arundel Circuit Court lacked the authority to revise that Order more than two years later in July 2011, absent proof of fraud, mistake, or irregularity \u2014 none of which grounds have been alleged here. Conversely, if the 2009 Order was not a final judgment, the Anne Arundel Circuit Court had the authority in 2011 to revise the 2009 Order without regard to the restrictions of Rule 2-535.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">For reasons stated <em>infra </em>in Part II.B., we agree with MFB that the 2009 Order was not a final judgment, and, thus, Rule 2-535 does not apply. We disagree, however, with MFB\u2019s follow-on suggestion that the 2011 Order was a final judgment. As we discuss in detail <em>infra </em>in Part II.C., the 2011 Order, like the 2009 Order, did not resolve all of the claims before the trial court. Because none of the immediate appealability exceptions to the requirement of a final judgment are applicable to the 2011 Order, it was not an appealable judgment. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>appeal (as did the Court of Special Appeals), and, therefore, the appeal must be dismissed, without reaching the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">A. Applicable Law Concerning Final Judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u201cThe appellate jurisdiction of the courts of this State is delimited by statute.\u201d <em>Harris v. David S. Harris, P.A., </em>310 Md. 310, 314, 529 A.2d 356, 358 (1987). Maryland law provides that a party has the right to seek appeal when there is entry of a final judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Md.Code (1973, 2013 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7 12-301; <em>Quillens v. Moore, </em>399 Md. 97, 116, 923 A.2d 15, 26 (2007). Conversely, a party cannot appeal ordinarily a judgment that is not final. <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, </em>389 Md. 315, 324, 884 A.2d 1215, 1220 (2005). Requiring cases to have reached final judgment before permitting appeal reflects Maryland\u2019s long-established policy against piecemeal appeals. <em>See, e.g., Medical Mut. Liability Ins. Soc. of Maryland v. B. Dixon Evander and </em>Assocs. (Evander), 331 Md. 301, 313, 628 A.2d 170, 176 (1993) (\u201c[Reviewing an order with unresolved claims] is clearly contrary to the policy against piecemeal appeals.\u201d); <em>Frey v. Frey, </em>298 Md. 552, 555-56, 471 A.2d 705, 707 (1984) (\u201cThe policy underlying this rule is that piecemeal appeals are disfavored.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">An order will constitute a final judgment if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) \u201cit must be intended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy;\u201d (2) \u201cit must adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties;\u201d and (3) \u201cthe clerk must make a proper record of it\u201d on the docket. <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767, 773 (1989); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-601;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Md. Rule 2-602(a)(l). In other words, for an order to qualify as a final judgment, it must adjudicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>each and every claim and be reflected in a docket entry. <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman &amp; Remodeling Servs., LLC, </em>412 Md. 555, 565, 989 A.2d 210, 216 (2010); <em>see also Estep v. Georgetown Leather Design, </em>320 Md. 277, 287, 577 A.2d 78, 82 (1990) (holding that the viability or mootness of a claim bears no relevance to whether a judgment is final); <em>Case v. Comptroller, </em>219 Md. 282, 288, 149 A.2d 6, 9 (1959) (requiring the court to release declarations, upon request of declaratory judgment, on each of the issues raised in the action before a final judgment could be entered). The language of Maryland Rule 2-602 emphasizes this requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">(a) Generally. Except as provided in section (b) of this Rule, an order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates <em>fewer than all </em>of the claims in an action ... or that adjudicates less than an entire claim, or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties to the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">(1) is <em>not a final judgment;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">(2) <em>does not terminate the action </em>as to any of the claims or any of the parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">(3) is subject to revision at any time before the entry of a judgment that adjudicates all of the claims by and against all of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Md. Rule 2-602(a) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u201cA \u2018claim\u2019 ... is defined as a \u2018substantive cause of action\u2019 that encompasses all rights arising from common operative facts.\u201d <em>Schuele, </em>412 Md. at 568, 989 A.2d at 218 (Citations omitted). Alternative legal theories and differing prayers for relief do not constitute separate \u201cclaims\u201d so long as they arise from a single asserted legal right. <em>See East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 459, 445 A.2d 343, 346 (1982); <em>see also Cnty. Comm\u2019rs for St. Mary\u2019s Cnty. v.

Thus, for a court to adjudicate completely a particular claim, each legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>theory and non-collateral prayer for relief within that claim must be resolved. <em>See Huber v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>347 Md. 415, 422, 701 A.2d 415, 418 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Assessing whether all claims have been adjudicated fully may be accomplished generally by comparing all of the claims raised in the complaint with all of the claims resolved in the court\u2019s order. <em>See Lacer, </em>393 Md. at 426-27, 903 A.2d at 385. In certain scenarios, however, where two or more actions are consolidated into a single case, introducing various claims in multiple complaints, this assessment may not be so straightforward or the result apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">When multiple actions are consolidated into a single case, the trial court has discretion in determining whether \u201cjoint or separate ... judgments be entered.\u201d Md. Rule 2-503(a). Where, as in the present case, the court does not make explicit whether it intended to resolve the consolidated case in joint or separate judgments, we must determine from the record and the applicable law whether the consolidated action should be treated as one case or multiple cases. In <em>Yarema v. Exxon Corp., </em>305 Md. 219, 236, 503 A.2d 239, 248 (1986), we stated: \u201c[UJnless the trial court <em>dearly intends that a joint judgment be entered </em>disposing of all cases simultaneously, consolidated cases are not to be treated as a single action for purposes of Rule 2-602; instead, each one of the cases is to be treated as a separate action.\u201d (Emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-503(a).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Yarema, </em>four separate tort actions were filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County by multiple plaintiffs against Exxon Corporation and various other defendants. <em>Yarema, </em>305 Md. at 221-22, 503 A.2d at 240. On a motion filed by one of the defendants, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>trial court consolidated the actions into a single case, for judicial efficiency, although maintaining separate dockets and entries for each action. <em>Yarema, </em>305 Md. at 222-23, 503 A.2d at 240-41. We held that, because the trial court intended to direct the entry of judgments for each action separately, an order as to one of the consolidated cases could be treated as a final judgment, despite unresolved issues in the other cases. <em>Yarema, </em>305 Md. at 240, 503 A.2d at 249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">B. The 2009 Order Was Not a Final Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Determining the finality of the 2009 Order rests in part on the effect of the consolidation of the WKA action and MFB action I into a single case. If the actions do not require a joint disposition, then the finality of the 2009 Order would be contingent on the whether the 2009 Order resolved completely the claim in the MFB Complaint.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See Yarema, </em>305 Md. at 236, 503 A.2d at 248. The circumstances of the consolidation in the present case differ significantly, however, from those in <em>Yarema. </em>For the purpose of analyzing the finality of the 2009 Order, we conclude not only that the trial judge intended to resolve both actions in a joint disposition, we are convinced that he was compelled to do so, given the interconnectedness of the actions, the nature of the claims, and Maryland\u2019s policy disfavoring piecemeal appeals.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">First, the trial judge recognized that the outcomes of the two actions were meaningfully interdependent. If WKA pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>vailed on its claim that Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1(b)(2) is unconstitutional, MFB\u2019s claim requesting a declaration interpreting that statute would be moot as the interpretation sought was not one amenable to a judicial gloss such as to save it from the unconstitutionality claim. The Anne Arundel Circuit Court judge appeared to recognize this during the 2008 hearing when he asked WKA about its constitutional claim<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and how that claim could affect his decision as to MFB\u2019s claim. Unfortunately, counsel for WKA was not prepared to address the constitutional claim at that time, and neither the judge nor the parties discussed that claim on the record again prior to the present appeal. The judge\u2019s inquiry demonstrates, however, some appreciation that a joint disposition resolving both of the claims would be necessary to put effectively the parties out-of-court. The practicality of deciding these particular actions together implores the judge to resolve both in a single disposition: it defies logic and offends greatly Maryland\u2019s policies favoring judicial efficiency to allow one claim to be appealed when later disposition of an unresolved claim in the same consolidated case could render the first adjudication moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Second, upon granting the motion to consolidate the actions, the judge was well aware that the respective plaintiffs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>two actions presented countervailing requests with interdependent claims that were part of the same action from the start. In <em>Yarema, </em>the Court consolidated multiple distinct cases for the purposes of efficiency in the discovery and trial phases of the cases. <em>Yarema, </em>305 Md. at 222-23, 503 A.2d at 240-41. Unlike <em>Yarema, </em>and the cases on which that opinion is founded, the present case does not involve the consolidation of \u201ctwo [or more] entirely separate and distinct cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 503 A.2d at 247 (quoting <em>Coppage v. Resolute Insur. Co., </em>264 Md. 261, 263-64, 285 A.2d 626 (1972)). Here, the consolidated cases are what the MDA describes aptly as \u201cflip-sides of the same coin\u201d \u2014 the outcome of one of the cases could affect directly the outcome of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Although, technically speaking, WKA and MFB are plaintiffs and the MDA is a common defendant, due to the process by which the cases were filed separately and consolidated eventually, the essence of this dispute is a disagreement between the WKA plaintiffs and MFB plaintiffs in which the MDA is an intermediary in control of the disputed property, i.e., the information regarding certain NMPs. The judge, therefore, must have understood that the adverse parties in this case were in fact the duelists WKA and MFB, and that their claims impacted directly the interests of the other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Lastly, the Anne Arundel Circuit Court maintained the WKA action and MFB action on the same docket, whereas the court in <em>Yarema </em>maintained separate dockets for each individual action. 305 Md. at 223, 503 A.2d at 241. Although this is only a formal distinction, the amalgamation of the two actions into one docket, in addition to the interdependence of the actions and the court\u2019s attempt to engage in consideration of the effect of WKA\u2019s pending constitutional claim in the same hearing in which it was addressing MFB\u2019s statutory non-constitutional claim, lends further weight to our conclusion that the trial court intended clearly to treat the actions as a singular case requiring a single disposition. One may argue that it is contradictory to conclude that the trial court intended to require a single disposition because it issued an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>declaring the case \u201cclosed,\u201d without resolving the constitutional claim. A countervailing supposition may be that the court simply forgot about the pendency of the constitutional claim, when it issued the 2009 Order, after the parties failed to follow up on the court\u2019s attempt in the 2008 hearing to address that claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Because the two actions required a joint disposition, the finality of that disposition would be conditioned upon a complete adjudication of all of the claims presented by both actions. Here, the MFB Complaint raised one claim, asserting two counts and four prayers for relief, concerning the degree of confidentiality to which the MDA must maintain its records in the face of a PIA request. The WKA Complaint raised an additional claim as to the constitutionality of \u00a7 8-801.1(b)(2), the statute upon which MFB based its assertions. The 2009 Order only resolved the claim from the MFB Complaint and did not address the constitutional claim from the WKA Complaint.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Consequently, the 2009 Order could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>not qualify as a final judgment because it did not adjudicate every claim. <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41, 566 A.2d at 773. MFB\u2019s Motion for Clarification of the 2009 Order was not subject to the thirty-day time-limit of Rule 2-535. The Anne Arundel Circuit Court retained the power to revise that Order in its 2011 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">C. The 2011 Order Was Not an Appealable Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Having concluded that the 2009 Order was not a final judgment, we turn our attention to whether the 2011 Order was final for purposes of appeal. When MFB submitted the Motion for Clarification of Memorandum Opinion and Order Dated February 10, 2009, the Anne Arundel Circuit Court responded by issuing the 2011 Order, which granted MFB\u2019s motion and restated, in a slightly different manner, the conclusions of the 2009 Order. The Circuit Court\u2019s language in the 2011 Order regarding the meaning of its prior Order was taken in large part word-for-word from the 2009 Order, with the addition of a sentence to emphasize further the court\u2019s conclusion (and an additional paragraph addressing specifically the electronic spreadsheet situation raised by Coastkeeper). The court made no comment about the constitutional claim raised in the WKA complaint, nor did any of the parties attempt to address that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">For the reasons discussed above in Part H.B., the 2011 Order cannot constitute a final judgment because the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Court did not resolve WKA\u2019s pending constitutional claim.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because the 2011 Order is not a final judgment, we must determine whether that Order was appealable pursuant to one of the exceptions to the final judgment rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">There are three categorical exceptions to the general rule limiting appeals only from a final judgment: (1) interlocutory orders that are appealable by statute; (2) orders that are appealable by the common-law collateral order doctrine; and (3) orders that adjudicate completely one of multiple claims in an action and are certified (and certifiable) under Rule 2-602(b), or, alternatively, Rule 8-602(e)(l)(C). <em>Salvagno v. Frew, </em>388 Md. 605, 615, 881 A.2d 660, 666 (2005). The first exception may be eliminated quickly in the present case because an interlocutory order resembling the 2011 Order (declaratory judgment on a statutory claim) does not fall within the types of appealable interlocutory orders enumerated in Md.Code (1973, 2013 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Aft. \u00a7 12-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Likewise, the 2011 Order is not appealable as a collateral order. Among other requirements, the collateral order doctrine applies only when the issues resolved in the appealed order do not relate to the merits of the case.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>See Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. 550, 563, 914 A.2d 783, 791 (2007) (quoting <em>Pittsburgh Corning Corp. v. James, </em>353 Md. 657, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>660-61, 728 A.2d 210, 211-12 (1999)). In the present case, the interpretation of Agrie. \u00a7 8-801.1(b)(2), resolved purportedly by the 2011 Order, was tied directly to the merits of the case. Thus, the 2011 Order does not fall within the subset of appealable cases permitted by the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The final exception is also of no aid to the parties here, although it appears to be the most pertinent to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Rule 2-602(b)(l) permits, in certain circumstances, the trial court to certify for appeal an interlocutory order if it resolves at least one of the claims in a multi-claim action, even when other claims remain unresolved. <em>See Shenasky v. Gunter, </em>339 Md. 636, 638, 664 A.2d 882, 883 (1995); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-602(b).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Similarly, Rule 8-602(e)(l)(C)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> allows an appellate court to certify an order before it that is otherwise not a final judgment, but only where the trial court could have exercised discretion under Rule 2 \u2014 602(b)(1), but did not do so. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Gress, </em>378 Md. 667, 670, 838 A.2d 362, 364 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The discretionary power to direct entry of final judgment under Rule 2 \u2014 602(b)(1) is to be used sparingly. <em>E.g., Smith v. Lead Industries Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>386 Md. 12, 24, 871 A.2d 545, 552 (2005) (quoting <em>Diener Enters. v. Miller, </em>266 Md. 551, 556, 295 A.2d 470, 473 (1972)). Circumstances where an appellate court may certify an order are even more limited because not only is the appellate court limited to scenarios <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>where the trial court could have certified the order, but the appellate court may not supersede the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion where the trial court denies certification expressly. <em>See Gress, </em>378 Md. at 682, 838 A.2d at 371 (holding that an appellate court may not exercise discretion under Rule 8-602(e)(1)(C) if the trial court declines expressly to certify an entry of final judgment under Rule 2 \u2014 602(b)). Courts that exercise discretion to certify a non-final judgment for appeal \u201cshould balance the exigencies of the case before them with the policy against piecemeal appeals and then only allow a separate appeal in the very infrequent harsh case.\u201d <em>Diener Enters., </em>266 Md. at 556, 295 A.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Certification under 2-602(b)(l) requires that: (1) the case must involve at least two distinct claims; (2) the order which is to be certified must dispose of at least one of the claims entirely; (3) there is no just reason to delay immediate appeal of the resolved claim; (4) the case must be of an extraordinary nature that would justify exercising discretion; and (5) the court must make express written notice of certification. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2 \u2014 602(b)(1); <em>Schuele, </em>412 Md. at 568, 989 A.2d at 218; <em>Smith, </em>386 Md. at 24, 871 A.2d at 552; <em>Huber, </em>347 Md. at 419-20, 701 A.2d at 417; <em>Diener Enterprises, </em>266 Md. at 556, 295 A.2d at 473. As we have stated, the conjunction of all these elements and its relationship to Rule 2-602(a) reinforce the theme of limiting interlocutory appeals and increasing judicial efficiency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">The purpose of Rule 2-602(a) is to prevent piecemeal appeals, which, beyond being inefficient and costly, can create significant delays, hardship, and procedural problems. The appellate court may be faced with having the same issues presented to it multiple times; the parties may be forced to assemble records, file briefs and record extracts, and prepare and appear for oral argument on multiple occasions; resolution of the claims remaining in the trial court may be delayed while the partial appeal proceeds, to the detriment of one or more parties and the orderly operation of the trial court; and partial rulings by the appellate court may do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>more to confuse than clarify the unresolved issues. That is precisely why Rule 2-602(b) is reserved for the \u2018infrequent harsh case,\u2019 and why the trial judge, who normally has a much better grasp of the situation than an appellate court, is viewed, at least in the first instance, as the \u201cdispatcher.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><em>Smith, </em>386 Md. at 25-26, 871 A.2d at 553 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Although the 2011 Order satisfies the first two elements listed above, this is certainly not a case where there is no just reason to delay appeal of the resolved claim. In fact, there is a very significant reason to defer its appeal \u2014 as discussed <em>supra, </em>the outcome of the adjudication of the constitutional claim may render moot the judgment on the statutory interpretation claim. Given that the underlying premise of any certified order is that certification would improve judicial efficiency, there exists no reason to consider directing entry of the 2011 Order as a final judgment while WKA\u2019s constitutional claim remains pending. Furthermore, choosing not to direct entry of the 2011 Order will not result in a \u201charsh\u201d outcome for the parties. <em>Diener Enterprises, </em>266 Md. at 556, 295 A.2d at 473. WKA has the opportunity to pursue its claim that Agrie. \u00a7 8 \u2014 801.1(b)(2) is unconstitutional, even as construed by the 2011 Order. After adjudication of the constitutional claim and entry of a final judgment, any party would have the right of appeal of either the 2011 Order or the order adjudicating the constitutional question. In any event, there is no hardship imposed on WKA, the petitioner here, to address first the merits of their outstanding claim in the Anne Arundel Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Because the 2011 Order is not a final judgment and does not fall within one of the three categorical exceptions permitting interlocutory appeals, both this Court and the Court of Special Appeals lack the jurisdiction to review the merits of this case at this time. Accordingly, we must dismiss this appeal and allow the judicial carousel ride to resume in the Anne Arundel Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED.

The judge asked specifically about WKA\u2019s assertion in its third \"Cause of Action\u201d that Agrie. \u00a7 8-801(b)(2) violates the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Pursuant to our discussion of what constitutes a \"claim,\u201d <em>see supra </em>Part II.A., we conclude that each of WKA's first three \"Causes of Action\u201d alleged an alternative legal theory for invalidating Agrie. \u00a7 8 \u2014 801(b)(2) on a constitutional ground, which embody collectively a single constitutional claim for final judgment analysis purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b316-5\">. We note that the principle of constitutional avoidance does not salvage the failure to dispose of WKA\u2019s constitutional claim. \"The canon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction; and the canon functions as <em>a means of choosing between them.\u201d Clark v. Martinez, </em>543 U.S. 371, 385, 125 S.Ct. 716, 726, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005). No evidence in this record demonstrates that the trial judge considered and avoided an interpretation of the pertinent statute that would raise a constitutional question in favor of a competing interpretation. To the contrary, the court attempted to engage in consideration of a constitutional question \u2014 i.e., whether the statute violated the First Amendment \u2014 but his attempt was thwarted by WKA's unpreparedness to address that issue when the judge raised it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\">. The 2009 Order does not indicate facially whether MFB\u2019s entire claim had been resolved completely. The ruling issued by the judge appears to have disposed only of the request for declaratory judgment, without expressing a decision on the request for injunctive relief. If it were clear that the judge felt that his ruling was sufficient to put the parties out-of-court as to that claim and that he disposed implicitly of the request for injunction, then the failure to express this in the 2009 Order was a procedural error that would leave discretion in the appellate court to treat it as a final judgment. <em>Cf. Bushey v. Northern Assur. Co. of Am., </em>362 Md. 626, 651, 766 A.2d 598, 611 (2001) (stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>that the trial judge's failure to issue certain declarations in the final order amounted to a procedural error, but did not deprive the Court of jurisdiction). If he did not intend to dispose of the request for injunctive relief, then the declarations made in the 2009 Order did not resolve automatically that issue, and would render therefore the 2009 Order, and consequently the 2011 Order, as non-final judgments. <em>See Falls Road Cmty. Ass'n, Inc. v. Baltimore Cnty., </em>437 Md. 115, 150, 85 A.3d 185, 206 (2014) (\u201cThe issuance of a declaratory judgment does not lead ineluctably to ancillary relief, such as an injunction.\u201d). Factors such as relative inconvenience and hardship to the parties should be considered prior to resolving a request for injunction, factors not necessary to be considered when deciding whether to enter a declaratory judgment. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Beane v. McMullen, </em>265 Md. 585, 615-17, 291 A.2d 37 (1972)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">. The notion that \"closing\u201d the case had any impact on the finality of the 2011 Order is unsupported and inconsistent with Maryland law. Although the court may have intended to close the proceedings with regard to MFB's claim on statutory interpretation, the court could not render a final judgment without disposing of the constitutional claim from WKA\u2019s Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">. A collateral order is one where \"the interlocutory order sought to be reviewed: (1) conclusively determines the disputed question; (2) resolves an important issue; (3) resolves an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action; and (4) would be effectively unreviewable if the appeal had to await the entry of a final judgment.\" <em>Pittsburgh Corning v. James, </em>353 Md. 657, 660-61, 728 A.2d 210, 211-12 (1999). It is necessary for each of those four elements to be satisfied conjunctively. <em>Cnty. Comm'rs for St. Mary\u2019s Cnty. v.
