Savage (\u201cSavage\u201d), another lawyer and partner at the Shapiro Firm. At the Shapiro Firm, paralegals (who were also notaries public) notarized the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits. Although McDowell had signed the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits outside the paralegals\u2019 presence, the notary jurats stated that the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits had been signed in the paralegals\u2019 presence. The robo-signing and notarizations at the Shapiro Firm came to the attention of the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>On October 17, 2012, on the Commission\u2019s behalf, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Burson and McDowell, charging Burson with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rule of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 5.1 (Responsibilities of Partners, Managers, and Supervisory Lawyers) and 5.3 (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants); charging McDowell with violating MLRPC 5.2(a) (Responsibilities of a Subordinate Lawyer);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and charging Burson and McDowell with violating MLRPC 1.1 (Competence) and 8.4 (Misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">On October 22, 2012, this Court designated the Honorable Marielsa A. Bernard (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to hear this attorney discipline proceeding. On July 9, 2013, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On September 27, 2013, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact and conclusions of law that McDowell had not violated any MLRPC and that Burson: had violated MLRPC 5.1(a) and 5.3(a); had not violated MLRPC 1.1, 5.3(b), or 8.4;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was not vicariously responsible for McDowell\u2019s conduct under MLRPC 5.1(c); and was not vicariously responsible for the paralegals\u2019 conduct under MLRPC 5.3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On April 29, 2014, we heard oral argument. For the below reasons, we reprimand Burson and McDowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">In her opinion, the hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In 1985, this Court admitted Burson to the Bar of Maryland. In June 1985, Burson helped form the Shapiro Firm, which represented mortgagees in foreclosure actions in Maryland and Virginia. Burson was the Shapiro Firm\u2019s managing partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">On December 12, 2001, this Court admitted McDowell to the Bar of Maryland. In 2009 (for present purposes), McDowell began working for the Shapiro Firm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Savage was McDowell\u2019s supervisor. At Savage\u2019s direction and over the relevant period of time, McDowell reviewed for accuracy trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits in approximately 900 foreclosure actions and signed the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf. The affidavits contained averments regarding facts that trial courts had already found <em>{e.g., </em>that the mortgagors were not serving in the military). McDowell had the legal knowledge that was reasonably necessary to review for accuracy the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits. McDowell was conscientious in reviewing for accuracy the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits; McDowell did not make any errors in doing so, and none of the trustee\u2019s deeds were defective or challenged in court. McDowell believed (albeit mistakenly) that it was not improper to sign trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf. Burson neither ordered nor ratified McDowell\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">At the Shapiro Firm, paralegals (who were also notaries public) notarized the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits that McDowell had signed on Savage\u2019s behalf. Although McDowell had signed the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits outside the paralegals\u2019 presence, the notary jurats stated that the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits had been signed in the paralegals\u2019 presence. Burson neither ordered nor ratified the paralegals\u2019 conduct; at the hearing, Burson testified that he believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the notarizations at the Shapiro Firm did not violate Virginia law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Sometime in or before 2010, two other lawyers at the Shapiro Firm signed each other\u2019s names on foreclosure-related documents. Various circuit courts issued show cause orders regarding the lawyers\u2019 signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In 2011, Burson learned that McDowell had signed trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf outside the paralegals\u2019 presence. Until then, Burson had made no efforts to ensure that the Shapiro Firm had in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that lawyers did not robo-sign documents and that paralegals did not falsely notarize documents. After learning that McDowell had signed trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf outside the paralegals\u2019 presence, Bur-son made timely good faith efforts to rectify the misconduct\u2019s consequences and to prevent future misconduct by ensuring that McDowell\u2019s past signing of the trustee\u2019s deeds on Savage\u2019s behalf neither created any problems as to title nor necessitated that the trustee\u2019s deeds be executed again, requiring all employees at the Shapiro Firm to promise in writing that they would neither sign others\u2019 names nor allow others to sign their names, and requiring all notaries public at the Shapiro Firm to promise in writing that they would not violate laws regarding notarizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Burson is respected for his integrity. As a result of the robo-signing at the Shapiro Firm, Burson was sued, received adverse media coverage, voluntarily stopped the active practice of law, and withdrew from the Shapiro Firm, which no longer bears his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Burson and McDowell have never before received attorney discipline. In the matter before us, they lacked dishonest or selfish motives, were cooperative with Bar Counsel, and showed remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference a hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Reno, </em>436 Md. 504, 508, 83 A.3d 781, 783 (2014) (\u201c[T]his Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact[.]\u201d (Citations omitted)); Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d). This Court determines whether clear and convincing evidence establishes that a lawyer violated the MLRPC. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-757(b) (\u201cThe [Commission] has the burden of proving the averments of the petition [for disciplinary or remedial action] by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"As\">(A) Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Burson and McDowell state that they do not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that, at the hearing, Burson testified that he believed that the notarizations at the Shapiro Firm did not violate Virginia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">We need not rule on the exception; as Burson\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument, the hearing judge\u2019s other findings of fact establish that the notarizations at the Shapiro Firm were false, regardless of whether Burson believed that the notarizations at the Shapiro Firm did not violate Virginia law. Specifically, the hearing judge found that, although McDowell had signed the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits outside the paralegals\u2019 presence, the notary jurats stated that the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits had been signed in the paralegals\u2019 presence. Although Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 55-118.3 permits a notary public to notarize a document that has been signed outside the notary public\u2019s presence, Virginia law does not permit a notary public to falsely represent that a document has been signed in the notary public\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">(B) Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Burson does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Originally, McDowell did not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, but the Commission excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that McDowell had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation). Later, however, McDowell and the Commission filed in this Court a \u201cJoint Petition for Reprimand by Consent\u201d in which McDowell and the Commission agree that McDowell violated MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">MLRPC 1.1 (Competence)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u201cA lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Here, the hearing judge was correct in concluding that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that Burson had violated MLRPC 1.1. Nothing in the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact indicates that Burson failed to provide competent representation to any client.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The hearing judge was correct in concluding that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that McDowell had violated MLRPC 1.1. McDowell had the legal knowledge that was reasonably necessary to review for accuracy trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits. McDowell was conscientious in reviewing for accuracy the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits, and McDowell did not make any errors in doing so. Although McDowell signed the trustee\u2019s deeds on Savage\u2019s behalf, none of the trustee\u2019s deeds were defective or challenged timely in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">It is a crime to \u201cwillfully make a false entry in a public record[J\u201d Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 RepLVol.) (\u201cCR\u201d) \u00a7 8-606(b)(l). Additionally, it is a crime to \u201cwillfully and falsely make an oath or affirmation as to a material fact ... in an affidavit required by any state, federal, or local law[.]\u201d CR \u00a7 9 \u2014 101(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Here, the hearing judge was correct in concluding that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that McDowell had violated MLRPC 8.4(b). Although McDowell signed trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf, none of the trustee\u2019s deeds were defective, and the affidavits contained averments regarding facts that trial courts had already found; thus, the signatures did not render the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits \u201cfalse entries]\u201d under CR \u00a7 8 \u2014 606(b)(1). Because the affidavits contained averments regarding facts that trial courts had already found, that McDowell signed the affidavits was obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ously not \u201cmaterial\u201d under CR \u00a7 9 \u2014 101(a)(2) for purposes of determinations by trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit[,] or misrepresentation[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Here, we refrain from reviewing the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that McDowell had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c). As noted above, originally, the Commission had excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that McDowell had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c); later, however, McDowell and the Commission filed in this Court the Joint Petition for Reprimand by Consent, which contains a stipulation that McDowell violated MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice), but does not contain a stipulation that McDowell violated MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation). At oral argument, Bar Counsel stated that the Commission had not officially withdrawn its exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that McDowell had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c). Nonetheless, Bar Counsel made it clear that the Commission recommends that we reprimand McDowell based on his violation of MLRPC 8.4(d), regardless of any conclusion as to whether McDowell also violated MLRPC 8.4(c). At oral argument, McDowell\u2019s counsel advised that he believed that the Commission had withdrawn its exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that McDowell had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Although we acknowledge the position that Bar Counsel took at oral argument, it is highly unlikely that McDowell would have conceded that he had violated MLRPC 8.4(d) (which the hearing judge concluded that McDowell had not violated) had McDowell not believed that the Commission had withdrawn its exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c). For purposes of our review, we are satisfied that \u2014 by filing the Joint Petition for Reprimand by Consent based only on a violation of MLRPC 8.4(d), regardless of the outcome of any exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that McDowell had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c) \u2014 the Commission has essentially engaged in a <em>de facto </em>withdrawal of its exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that McDowell had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c). Although this Court has the discretion to do so, \u201c[ojrdinarily, we will not look for additional violations where [the Commission] filed no exceptions.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Geesing, </em>436 Md. 56, 63 n. 6, 80 A.3d 718, 722 n. 6 (2013) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dore, </em>433 Md. 685, 707, 73 A.3d 161, 174 (2013)). For example, in <em>Geesing, </em>436 Md. at 63 n. 6, 80 A.3d at 722 n. 6, and <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. at 707, 73 A.3d at 174, attorney discipline proceedings that involved robo-signing, this Court refrained from reviewing hearing judges\u2019 conclusions that lawyers had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c) where the Commission did not except to the same. Consistent with <em>Geesing </em>and <em>Dore, </em>here, we refrain from reviewing the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that McDowell had not violated MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(d). Generally, a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) where the lawyer\u2019s conduct negatively \u201cimpacts ... the public\u2019s perception ... of the ... legal profession.\u201d <em>Geesing, </em>436 Md. at 65, 80 A.3d at 723 (quoting <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. at 696, 73 A.3d at 167) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">For example, in <em>Geesing, </em>436 Md. at 65, 58, 80 A.3d at 723, 719, this Court held that a lawyer had violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by \u201cnegative[ly] impacting] ... the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession\u201d where the lawyer had \u201cauthorized [staff members] ... to sign his name on documents \u2014 including affidavits \u2014 in foreclosure filings[, and had] instructed the staff members (who were also notaries public) to notarize the affidavits, even though he had not signed them.\u201d This Court noted that the robo-signing had, among other consequences, \u201ccaused significant media coverage\u201d and \u201cprompted certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>mortgagors to file several lawsuits arising out of the robosigning against\u201d the lawyer and the law firm. <em>Id. </em>at 65, 80 A.3d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Here, the hearing judge was correct in concluding that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that Burson had violated MLRPC 8.4(d). Burson did not participate in, or know of, the robo-signing at the Shapiro Firm. Thus, Burson\u2019s conduct is distinguishable from that of the lawyer who participated in robo-signing in <em>Geesing, id. </em>at 58, 80 A.3d at 719. The sole basis for concluding that Burson violated MLRPC 8.4(d) would be that he made no efforts to ensure that the Shapiro Firm had in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that lawyers did not robo-sign documents and that notaries public did not falsely notarize documents. Although, under some circumstances, a supervisor\u2019s failure to take reasonable preventative measures may constitute a violation of MLRPC 8.4(d), here, the existence of this circumstance alone, where Burson was unaware of McDowell\u2019s and the paralegals\u2019 conduct, is insufficient to establish a violation of MLRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Clear and convincing evidence persuades us to reverse the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that McDowell had not violated MLRPC 8.4(d). Paramount to this conclusion, as noted above, is the circumstance that McDowell concedes that he violated MLRPC 8.4(d). McDowell signed trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Once it became public knowledge, the robo-signing at the Shapiro Firm prompted adverse media coverage and a lawsuit against the Shapiro Firm. <em>Cf. Geesing, </em>436 Md. at 65, 80 A.3d at 723 (This Court held that a lawyer had violated MLRPC 8.4(d) where the lawyer had participated in robo-signing that had \u201ccaused significant media coverage\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>and \u201cprompted certain mortgagors to file several lawsuits arising out of the robo-signing against\u201d the lawyer and the law firm.).

Prior to Burson\u2019s discovery of McDowell\u2019s and Savage\u2019s conduct, two other lawyers at the Shapiro Firm signed each other\u2019s names on foreclosure-related documents and were the subjects of show cause orders in various circuit courts as a result of the practice. As the Shapiro Firm\u2019s managing partner, Burson was aware that circuit courts issued show cause orders regarding the two lawyers\u2019 signing of documents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The hearing judge found that, despite being aware of the \u201cprior incident,\u201d before learning that McDowell had signed trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf, Burson made no efforts to ensure that the Shapiro Firm had in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that lawyers did not robo-sign documents. McDowell signed Savage\u2019s name in approximately 900 cases. The existence of the show cause orders involving allegedly improper signing of documents, coupled with the number of cases in which McDowell signed Savage\u2019s name, leads to the conclusion that clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s determination that Burson made no efforts to ensure that the Shapiro Firm had in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that lawyers did not robo-sign documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The hearing judge was correct in concluding that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that Burson was vicariously responsible for McDowell\u2019s conduct under MLRPC 5.1(c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As discussed above, McDowell violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by signing trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf. However, Burson neither ordered nor ratified the signatures; and, after learning about the signatures, Burson took reasonable remedial action by ensuring that McDowell\u2019s signing of the trustee\u2019s deeds on Savage\u2019s behalf neither created any problems as to title nor necessitated that the trustee\u2019s deeds be executed again. Thus, it is readily apparent that Burson did not vicariously violate MLRPC 8.4(d) through McDowell\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">MLRPC 5.3 (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">MLRPC 5.3 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">With respect to a nonlawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>(a) a partner ... shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the [law] firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the [nonlawyer'J\u2019s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">(b) a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the [nonlawyer]\u2019s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">(c) a lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of [a nonlawyer] that would be a violation of the [MLRPC] if engaged in by a lawyer if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">(1) the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">(2) the lawyer is a partner ... and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Burson had violated MLRPC 5.3(a).

Had the paralegals been lawyers, they would have violated MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation) by falsely notarizing the trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits. Burson, however, neither ordered nor ratified the false notarizations; and, after learning about the false notarizations, Burson took reasonable remedial action by ensuring that the trustee\u2019s deeds did not need to be executed again.

Moreover, on this record, we do not conclude that Burson blinded himself willfully to what was occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Burson\u2019s neglect of his managerial duties did not cause any tangible injury; none of the trustee\u2019s deeds were defective or challenged timely in court. We note only one aggravating factor, namely, Burson\u2019s substantial experience in the practice of law; Burson has been a member of the Bar of Maryland for approximately twenty-nine years. We note seven mitigating factors: (1) the absence of prior attorney discipline; (2) the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (3) timely good faith efforts to rectify the misconduct\u2019s consequences and to prevent future misconduct by ensuring that McDowell\u2019s signing of the trustee\u2019s deeds on Savage\u2019s behalf neither created any problems as to title nor necessitated that the trustee\u2019s deeds be executed again, requiring all employees at the Shapiro Firm to promise in writing that they would neither sign others\u2019 names nor allow others to sign their names, and requiring all notaries public at the Shapiro Firm to promise in writing that they would not violate laws regarding notarizations; (4) a cooperative attitude toward this attorney discipline proceeding; (5) character, as Burson is respected for his integrity; (6) other penalties in the form of being sued, receiving adverse media coverage, voluntarily stopping the active practice of law, and withdrawing from the Shapiro Firm, which no longer bears Burson\u2019s name; and (7) remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We agree with Burson that a reprimand is the appropriate sanction for his misconduct. Although Burson made no ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>forts to ensure that the Shapiro Finn had in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that lawyers did not robo-sign documents and that notaries public did not falsely notarize documents, Burson did not participate in (or even know of) the robo-signing and false notarizations; thus, Burson\u2019s misconduct was negligent rather than knowing or intentional. Bur-son\u2019s misconduct is aggravated only by substantial experience in the practice of law, and is mitigated by a myriad of significant factors, such as his voluntary cessation of the active practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">We agree with Burson and the Commission that Burson\u2019s misconduct is distinguishable from that of the lawyer in <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. at 727, 689, 707, 708-09, 73 A.3d at 186, 163, 174, 175, in which this Court suspended from the practice of law in Maryland for ninety days a lawyer who had robo-signed documents, violated MLRPC 3.3(a)(1) (Making or Failing to Correct a False Statement to a Tribunal), and violated MLRPC 5.3(a) (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants) through intentional misconduct. By contrast, here, Burson did not robo-sign documents, did not violate MLRPC 3.3(a)(1), and violated MLRPC 5.3(a) through negligence rather than intentional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Similarly, we agree with Burson and the Commission that Burson\u2019s misconduct is distinguishable from that of the lawyers in <em>Kimmel, </em>405 Md. at 689, 672, 955 A.2d at 294, 284, in which this Court indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Maryland, with the right to apply for reinstatement no sooner than ninety days, lawyers who had violated MLRPC 5.1 (Responsibilities of Partners, Managers, and Supervisory Lawyers) and 1.4 (Communication). The lawyers, partners at a law firm, <em>see id. </em>at 651, 955 A.2d at 271, \u201cfailed to design and implement policies and procedures that reasonably would ensure [the lawyers\u2019 subordinate\u2019s] compliance with the Maryland Rules[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680, 955 A.2d at 289.

In contrast to <em>Goldberg, </em>here, McDowell\u2019s and the paralegals\u2019 actions <em>(i.e., </em>robo-signing and false notarizations) were not as glaring or as easily noticed as the employee\u2019s failure to prepare documents and deposit checks in <em>Goldberg; </em>in other words, Burson\u2019s failure to adequately supervise McDowell and the paralegals was less egregious than the lawyer\u2019s failure to adequately supervise the employee in <em>Goldberg. </em>Additionally, Burson\u2019s misconduct is mitigated by a number of significant factors, including his voluntary cessation of the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">To be clear, we caution partners \u2014 and lawyers who \u201cpossess[] comparable managerial authority[,]\u201d MLRPC 5.1(a); MLRPC 5.3(a) \u2014 that our decision to reprimand Burson is based on this attorney discipline proceeding\u2019s unique circumstances. Under other circumstances, this Court would sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>pend a lawyer who violates MLRPC 5.1(a), <em>see Kimmel, </em>405 Md. at 689, 680, 955 A.2d at 294, 289, or MLRPC 5.8(a). <em>See Dore, </em>483 Md. at 727, 708, 73 A.3d at 186, 175. We recommend that partners and lawyers who possess comparable managerial authority at law firms that represent mortgagees in foreclosure actions consider how to avoid Burson\u2019s situation and ensure that their firms have in effect measures that will assure that the conduct of their subordinates is consistent with the professional obligations of the supervising lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">For the above reasons, we reprimand Burson.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Appropriate Sanction for McDowell\u2019s Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

As to the lawyer\u2019s mental state, this Court noted that the lawyer \u201chonestly believed that he was legally authorized to\u201d cut-and-paste the other person\u2019s signature. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 31 A.3d at 527. This Court noted that the lawyer\u2019s misconduct \u201cwas not detrimental to his clients[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 31 A.3d at 527. This Court did not note any aggravating factors, and noted six mitigating factors: (1) the absence of prior attorney discipline; (2) the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (3) timely good faith efforts to prevent future misconduct; (4) character; (5) remorse; and (6) another penalty in the form of the lawyer\u2019s losing his job. <em>See id. </em>at 292-93, 31 A.3d at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Here, as to the duty violated, McDowell violated 8.4(d) (Conduct That is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice) by signing trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf. As to McDowell\u2019s mental state, McDowell signed trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Savage told McDowell to do so;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> McDowell believed (albeit mistakenly) that doing so was not improper. As to the potential or actual injury that McDowell\u2019s misconduct caused, McDowell\u2019s misconduct tarnished the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession, but did not cause any tangible injury; none of the trustee\u2019s deeds were defective or challenged in court. We note two aggravating factors: a pattern of misconduct and multiple violations of the MLRPC, as demonstrated by McDowell\u2019s signing trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf in approximately 900 foreclosure actions. We note four mitigating factors: (1) the absence of prior attorney discipline; (2) the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (3) a cooperative attitude toward this attorney discipline proceeding; and (4) remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">We agree with McDowell and the Commission that a reprimand is the appropriate sanction for McDowell\u2019s misconduct. Although McDowell signed trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf, McDowell had a relatively blameless mental state in doing so, as McDowell did so at Savage\u2019s direction and believed that doing so was not improper. Although McDowell\u2019s misconduct is aggravated by a pattern of misconduct and multiple violations of the MLRPC, McDowell\u2019s misconduct is mitigated by the absence of prior attorney discipline, the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, a cooperative attitude toward this attorney discipline proceeding, and sincere remorse. Under rare circumstances, a reprimand may be the appropriate sanction for a violation of MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>That is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice). <em>See Paul, </em>423 Md. at 293, 289, 31 A.3d at 527, 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">We agree with McDowell that his misconduct is distinguishable from that of the lawyer in <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. at 727, 717, 710, 73 A.3d at 186, 180, 176, in which this Court suspended from the practice of law in Maryland for ninety days a lawyer who had robo-signed documents on his own initiative, violated MLRPC 3.3(a)(1) (Making or Faffing to Correct a False Statement to a Tribunal), violated MLRPC 5.3(a) (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants), and negatively impacted the courts\u2019 operation. By contrast, here, McDowell signed trustee\u2019s deeds and affidavits on Savage\u2019s behalf at Savage\u2019s direction, did not violate MLRPC 3.3(a)(1), did not violate MLRPC 5.3(a), and did not negatively impact the courts\u2019 operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">For the above reasons, we reprimand McDowell and grant the Joint Petition for Reprimand by Consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENTS SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761(b), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY AGAINST MATTHEW JOHN MCDOWELL AND JOHN STEPHEN BURSON.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-5\">. \" \u2018Robo-signing\u2019 most often refers to the process of mass-producing affidavits for foreclosures without having knowledge of or verifying the facts. \u2018Robo-signing\u2019 may also refer to the mass-production of affidavits that the affiant did not sign.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Thus, a lawyer who engages in misconduct at another's direction might receive a lesser sanction than a lawyer who engages in misconduct on the lawyer's own initiative. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sudha Narasimhan, </em>438 Md. 638, 654 n. 9, 92 A.3d 512, 521 n. 9 (2014) (\u201c[T]o the extent that [another lawyer's conduct played a role in [a lawyer\u2019s] violation [of an MLRPC], such a fact could be considered in determining the appropriate sanction, but would not affect whether or not [the lawyer] violated a particular MLRPC.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
