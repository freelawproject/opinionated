This appeal involves a single issue: whether the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>engaged in impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d by adding a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(7)(C)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Phillips\u2019s base offense level.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the application of \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(7)(C) does not result in impermissible double counting and, thus, affirm Phillips\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">Before addressing the merits of Phillips\u2019s appeal, we first discuss \u00a7 2B1.1 and why Phillips was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1. As stated above, Phillips was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 228(a)(3). The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.1 states that \u201c[f]or offenses involving the willful failure to pay court-ordered child support (violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 228), the most analogous guideline is \u00a7 2B1.1.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.1, cmt. n.2. Therefore, Phillips was properly sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">Section 2B1.1, however, is not limited to those who willfully fail to pay court-ordered child support. Rather, \u00a7 2B1.1 addresses a wide variety of crimes, including, but not limited to, larceny, embezzlement, and other forms of theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">Although \u00a7 2B1.1(a) assigns a base offense level of six to a wide variety of crimes, \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(7)(C) provides for a two-level enhancement if the offense of conviction involves \u201ca violation of any pri- or, specific judicial or administrative order, injunction, decree, or process not addressed elsewhere in the guidelines.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B1.1(a) &amp; (b)(7)(C). The district court concluded that failure to pay court-ordered child support constituted a violation of a prior judicial order and increased Phillips\u2019s offense level by two. Phillips contends that this constitutes impermissible double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">\u201cImpermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.1999) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Double counting is permissible, however, when (1) the Sentencing Commission intended the result, and (2) each guideline section in question \u201cconcerns conceptually separate notions related to sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1310 (internal quotations and citation omitted). This Court presumes that, unless specifically directed otherwise, the Sentencing Commission intended that separate guidelines sections be applied cumulatively. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">As stated above, \u00a7 2B1.1 provides <em>for </em>a base offense level of six and applies to many types of criminal offenses. The Sentencing Commission added a two-level enhancement when the theft or other type of offense involved a violation of a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-13\">In <em>United States v. Naves, </em>252 F.3d 1166 (11th Cir.2001), this Court addressed a similar situation in which a defendant was convicted of carjacking. As noted in <em>Naves, </em>carjacking crimes are to be sentenced under \u00a7 2B3.1. <em>See Naves, </em>252 F.3d at 1168; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1, cmt. statutory provisions. However, \u00a7 2B3.1 applies to more than just carjacking. Rather, \u00a7 2B3.1 provides a base offense level of twenty that applies to robberies in general. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(a). It is a separate provision of \u00a7 2B3.1 that provides for a two-level enhancement if the offense in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>volved carjacking. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">In <em>Naves, </em>this Court concluded that the two-level enhancement for carjacking under the general robbery guideline did not constitute impermissible double counting. 252 F.3d at 1169. In so doing, the <em>Naves </em>Court stated that \u201c[w]e must assume that the Sentencing Commission knew that the two point enhancement at issue herein would be imposed in every case involving a conviction under \u00a7 2119 [carjacking], that it intended this result, and that in effect it was creating a base level of 22 for a conviction under \u00a7 2119.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1168-69. Likewise, we must assume in Phillips\u2019s case that the Sentencing Commission knew that a two-level enhancement would be applied in every conviction for willful failure to pay court-ordered child support and that the net effect was to create a base offense level of eight for convictions under \u00a7 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">\u201cThe Sentencing Commission is authorized to provide such an enhancement as long as there is a rational relationship between the enhancement and a legitimate governmental objective.\u201d <em>Naves, </em>252 F.3d at 1169 (citation omitted). The burden is on Phillips to establish that the guideline provision is irrational. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Phillips has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">Obviously, the Sentencing Commission could have created a separate guideline for willful failure to pay child support with a base offense of eight. The fact that the Sentencing Commission elected not to draft a separate guideline does not render the application of the two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(7)(C) irrational. Rather, it is rational for the Sentencing Commission to use \u00a7 2B1.1 to establish a base offense level of six for the culpability incident to offenses involving larceny, embezzlement, and other forms of theft. <em>See Naves, </em>252 F.3d at 1169. It is also rational for the Sentencing Commission to then provide a two-level increase \u201cto reflect the heightened seriousness\u201d of a violation of a court order. <em>See id. </em>The Sentencing Commission was within its statutory authority when drafting \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(7)(C) and Phillips\u2019s sentence is not the result of impermissible double counting. Therefore, we affirm Phillips\u2019s 21-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">.
