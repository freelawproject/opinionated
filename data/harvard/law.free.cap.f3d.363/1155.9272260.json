Crawford appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental social security income, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c). On appeal, Crawford argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by (1) discrediting the opinions of his treating physicians and chiropractor, and (2) failing to consider consultative psychologist Tracy Hartig\u2019s opinion that Crawford had \u201cmarked\u201d psychological limitations. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>Crawford, a 53-year-old male with a ministerial college education, applied for supplemental social security income and disability insurance benefits, alleging an onset date of March 1,1999, due to bilateral spondylolysis, a posterior midline annular tear, and degenerative disc disease. Crawford\u2019s applications were denied initially and on reconsideration. Crawford then requested and received a hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-3\">Subsequent to the hearing, the ALJ made findings in a decision that included the relevant medical evidence and witness testimony. The ALJ discredited the opinions of chiropractor Mabbett Reckord and treating physicians Drs. Stanley Zemank-iewiez, Pedro Ruiz, and Nicholas Blavatsky, all of whom had classified Crawford as \u201cdisabled\u201d or cited functional limitations that would preclude even sedentary work. The ALJ found that the restrictions cited by these physicians \u201cwavered constantly\u201d and were \u201ccontradictory to their other conclusions.\u201d The ALJ further found that these physicians\u2019 notes were inconsistent and detailed only \u201cshort-lived problems.\u201d Additionally, the ALJ discounted consultative psychologist Tracy Hartig\u2019s opinion that Crawford was markedly limited in certain areas, finding that (1) she was not a \u201ctreating source\u201d because she had examined Crawford only once, (2) she was not a medical doctor, (3) her findings were based on Crawford\u2019s self-interested assertions, and (4) her opinion was inconsistent with treating psychiatrist J.K. Mehta\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">The ALJ found that Crawford suffered from the severe impairments of spinal degenerative joint disease and reactive depression and that he consequently lacked the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform any of his past relevant work. The ALJ further found, however, that Crawford retained the RFC to perform \u201ca significant range of light work,\u201d including work that involved \u201csimple, repetitive, routine, low stress, safe, light work in clean surroundings, with a sit/stand option, and no overhead reaching.\u201d Relying on the medical evidence, and testimony from a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) and Crawford, the ALJ found that Crawford was not disabled as defined by the Act because he was able to perform other work that existed in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">The .Appeals Council denied review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. On judicial review, the magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying benefits be affirmed. Thereafter, the district court entered an- order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">On appeal, Crawford argues that the ALJ erred by discrediting the opinions of chiropractor Reckord and Drs. Ruiz, Blavatsky, and Zemankiewiez. Crawford maintains that the opinions of his treating physicians were based on a lengthy treatment history and supported by the medical evidence, whereas the opinion of consulting physician Dr. James Melton, upon which the ALJ placed great weight, was \u201cagainst the great weight of all the evidence.\u201d Additionally, Crawford argues that, although a chiropractor\u2019s opinion generally is not entitled to controlling weight, the ALJ should have afforded deference to Rec-kord\u2019s opinion because he had treated Crawford for several years and had referred him to specialists for consultations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">\u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cSubstantial <em>evidence </em>is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">It is well-established that \u201cthe testimony of a treating physician must be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. A treating physician\u2019s report \u201cmay be discounted when it is not accompanied by objective medical evidence or is wholly conclusory.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 583-84 (11th Cir.1991) (good cause existed where the opinion was contradicted by other notations in the physician\u2019s own record).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">Dr. Ruiz\u2019s opinion that Crawford is permanently and totally disabled is inconsistent with his own treatment notes, unsupported by the medical evidence, and appears to be based primarily on Crawford\u2019s subjective complaints of pain. Only three weeks after concluding that Crawford was unable to work due to lower back pain, Dr. Ruiz noted that Crawford was \u201cimproved\u201d and \u201cdoing well\u201d and that he had stated \u201cI\u2019m doing great.\u201d Moreover, subsequent to rendering his diagnosis of permanent and total disability, Dr. Ruiz examined Crawford and reported \u201cno acute distress.\u201d Further testing by Dr. Ruiz revealed no musculoskeletal abnormalities. Additionally, medical tests that were conducted by physicians to whom Dr. Ruiz had referred Crawford revealed \u201cno evidence of fracture, dislocation or bony destruction,\u201d normal soft tissues, and \u201c[n]o evidence of metastatic disease.\u201d Based on the foregoing, and the fact that Crawford repeatedly had declined medication that Dr. Ruiz had prescribed him, the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. Ruiz\u2019s opinion was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Dawkins v. Bowen, </em>848 F.2d 1211, 1213 (11th Cir.1988) (failure to follow prescribed medical treatment will preclude a finding of disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">Additionally, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Dr. Zemankiewicz\u2019s findings did not establish that Crawford was disabled within the meaning of the Act. The medical record indicates that Dr. Zemankiewicz found Crawford to be disabled for only a nine-day period. To the extent that Crawford asserts that Dr. Zemankiewicz\u2019s findings warrant a finding of total and permanent disability, he is not entitled to relief because such a finding is inconsistent with Dr. Zemankiewicz\u2019s treatment notes. During his first examination of Crawford, Dr. Zemankiewicz prescribed a \u201cback program for exercise\u201d and prohibited Crawford from lifting more than 25 pounds. A subsequent MRI revealed \u201c[v]ery minimal degenerative disc disease ... [n]o bulge or protrusion ... [n]o canal stenosis or nerve root impingement.\u201d Finally, Dr. Zemank-iewicz noted in an addendum that a repeat examination of the MRI revealed \u201cno associated spondylolisthesis, significant neural foramen narrowing, or spinal stenosis\u201d and \u201cno canal compromise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">Next, Dr. Blavatsky\u2019s conclusory finding that Crawford was disabled is unsupported by the medical evidence and contradicted by his own treatment notes, which state that (1) Crawford\u2019s MRI and bone scan were negative, (2) there was \u201cno evidence of fiscal incarceration, protrusion, bony destructive process, alignment, intrinsic or neural abnormality,\u201d (3) x-rays revealed \u201cno evidence of spondylolisthesis\u201d and \u201cgood preservation of lumbar lordo-sis,\u201d and (4) \u201c[fjlexion and extensive views done on this occasion demonstrate no evidence of spondylolisthesis or segmental instability.\u201d Additionally, less than two weeks after making a finding of disability, Dr. Blavatsky noted that Crawford\u2019s nerve conduction studies were negative. Based on the foregoing, the ALJ\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>discount Dr. Blavatsky\u2019s opinion was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">Next, the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount chiropractor 'Reckford\u2019s opinion was supported by substantial evidence for two reasons. First, Reckford is not considered an \u201cacceptable source\u201d and, thus, his opinion cannot establish the existence of an impairment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1513(a), 416.91.3(a) (excluding chiropractors from the list of \u201cacceptable medical sources\u201d whose opinions may be considered in determining the existence of an impairment). Second, Reckford\u2019s findings of disability are inconsistent with his own treatment notes and unsupported by the medical evidence. Reckford\u2019s finding that Crawford was unable to return to his past relevant work as a truck driver was based solely on Crawford\u2019s subjective complaints of pain. Additionally, approximately two weeks after making his finding, Reckford reported \u201can immediate 50% reduction in the amount of pain, spasm and limited motion\u201d and noted that Crawford \u201calways feels better with completion of chiropractic treatment.\u201d Finally, approximately five weeks after indicating that Crawford could perform no carrying, lifting, standing, sitting, climbing, balancing, stooping, crouching, kneeling, or crawling, Reckford reported that Crawford baby-sits his grandchildren and helps his wife \u25a0 and children around the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">Additionally, Crawford\u2019s contention that Dr. Melton\u2019s opinion was \u201cagainst the great weight of all the evidence\u201d lacks merit! Dr. Melton\u2019s opinion that Crawford should not return to work that involves lifting more than 20 to 25 pounds, or frequent lifting in excess of 15 pounds, is consistent with the above-mentioned medical evidence and comports with Dr. Zem-ankiewicz\u2019s finding that Crawford should be restricted from lifting more than 25 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">Finally, Crawford argues that the ALJ erred by failing to consider Hartig\u2019s opinion that he had \u201cmarked\u201d psychological limitations. Crawford maintains that the ALJ had no basis for rejecting Har-tig\u2019s opinion and, thus, erred by failing to include her findings in the hypothetical question to the VE. Crawford additionally contends -that the district court erred by \u201cfailing to justify the ALJ\u2019s implicit rejection of the \u2018marked\u2019 limitations noted [by Dr. Hartig].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\">Crawford\u2019s contention that the ALJ ignored Hartig\u2019s findings is belied by the record. The ALJ expressly considered Hartig\u2019s opinion that Crawford was markedly- limited in terms of his ability to cope with change or stress. However, the ALJ found that Hartig\u2019s opinion was not entitled to controlling weight and that, based on treating psychiatrist Dr. Mehta\u2019s reports, Crawford could perform \u201climited, simple, low-stress, routine work requiring moderate concentration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">The ALJ correctly found that, because Hartig examined Crawford on only one occasion, her opinion was not entitled to great weight. <em>See McSwain v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 617, 619 (11th Cir.1987) (stating that a doctor who. examines a claimant on only one occasion is not considered a \u201ctreating physician\u201d). Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Crawford\u2019s mental capacity were supported by the findings of Dr. Mehta, the psychiatrist who had examined Crawford on two occasions and reported that Crawford was \u201ccooperative ... clear, spontaneous, but without any evidence of loose associations, flights of ideas, or pressure of speech.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Mehta stated that Crawford had described his mood as \u201cfeeling better\u201d and that he should attend vocational rehabilitation to ascertain whether he can learn skills that will enable him to perform gainful employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>ment. Based on the foregoing, Crawford is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">Additionally, Crawford\u2019s contention that the district court failed to address the ALJ\u2019s implicit rejection of Hartig\u2019s opinion is belied by the record. The district court expressly found that the ALJ had properly considered Hartig and Dr. Mehta\u2019s reports and that the ALJ\u2019s decision on the issue of Crawford\u2019s mental limitations was supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, Crawford cannot show that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s alleged error because the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">Finally, we need not address Crawford\u2019s contention that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the VE was inadequate because Crawford failed to raise this issue in the district court. <em>See Stewart v. Dept. of Health and Human Services, </em>26 F.3d 115, 115-16 (11th Cir.1994) (stating that \u201c[a]s a general principle, this Court will not address an argument that has not been raised in the district court\u201d). In any event, the ALJ was not required to include findings in the hypothetical that the ALJ had properly rejected as unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit the opinions of Crawford\u2019s treating physicians and chiropractor. We further conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Crawford\u2019s mental RFC. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
