The employee, defendant in error, was found to be totally and permanently disabled as the result of a heart attack, and was awarded benefits accordingly. From the unfavorable holding of the trial judge in the court below, the employer, plaintiff in error has perfected his appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">Two assignments of error are made, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">(1) There is no material evidence to support the judgment of the court; and (2) The petitioner failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>prove the notice required by statute, sucli lack of notice conclusively prejudicing the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\">The facts are that the employee is a totally illiterate man who has worked as a laborer all of his life and has been in the employment of the defendant for approximately twelve years. He worked as a furniture assembler, particularly dressers and chests, and his work required him to lift a ten or twelve pound panel over his head, and to reach over his head with a two or three pound rubber hammer and \u201cknock it down in them holes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">On Monday, November 11, 1963, while at work, about 1:30 P.M., he suffered severe chest pains, but continued to work for the remainder of the day. The pains continued throughout the night, but he returned to work the following day. The pains continued and the employee, according to his testimony, kept getting weaker and weaker, whereupon at about 4:30 P.M. he sat down in the rest room. \u201cI was sick enough to die, it seemed like my breath was cutting off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">After work he went to his car and \u2018 \u2018 a bad spell hit me again,\u201d and he fell into the car where he lay for some time before he was able to drive home. The discomfort continued all night and on Wednesday morning he was taken to Dr. James W. Richardson, who placed him in the hospital and treated him for a heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s wife gave essentially the same testimony concerning the pains and illness of her husband. Additionally, she testified that about two and one-half weeks afterwards she contacted the plant nurse and told her that her husband had suffered a heart attack. She also related an incident wherein Jerry Allen, the foreman at Grluck Brothers, came to bring her husband\u2019s last pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>check, and she stated that she told him at that time that her husband had suffered a heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The deposition of Dr. James W. Bichardson the attending physician, was then introduced on behalf of the plaintiff. He testified that the plaintiff had suffered a myocardial infarction, and the onset of the attack was somewhere around the time the plaintiff first had the pains.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201cQ. Now, Doctor, you had ascertained the type of employment that Mr. Breeden did, would you tell us whether or not, in your opinion, if you can assume that the things that Mr. Breeden did involved lifting boards weighing approximately 10 pounds over' his head, and then taking a hammer and reaching over his head and hammering the boards, in your professional opinion, would or not that sort of activity aggravate, or initiate, or accelerate a heart attack such as Mr. Breeden had ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201cA. I would say it would probably accelerate it. I\u2019d say at the time the process was going, on in him any kind of physical activity at all would aggravate or accelerate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">\u201cUnder cross-examination by defense counsel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201cQ. Doctor, let\u2019s just get right down to it, from a medical standpoint, in your opinion is there any causal connection between this man\u2019s employment and his myocardial infarction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">\u201cA. Well, let\u2019s put it this way, I don\u2019t think that because he happened to be working for that company made him any more liable to have a heart attack than, say, if he had been working for the Southern Bailway. I just say that at the time he had his attack he was working when the thing started in progress as best as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>I can determine from the history he stated to me. As he stated, he started having these pains in his arms and chest 2 days prior to the time I saw him \u2014 that was on Monday, and they gradually worsened and he worsened, and even after they started on Monday he worked a fnll day, and then he worked another fnll day on Tuesday. It may he that if he had stopped work at dinner time on Monday, they may have gone away, and they might not have come back if he had stayed off for a week or so, I don\u2019t know. <em>All I\u2019m saying is that he was at work and the activity he was performing accelerated or aggravated the progress that began there.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The first question raised here is whether the evidence supports the holding that Mr. Breeden\u2019s heart attack arose out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In discussing the causal relationship between employment and heart attacks, this Court said in <em>Coleman v. </em>Coker, 204 Tenn. 310, 321 S.W.2d 540 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u201c [We are] committed to the proposition of law that an employee who dies in the course of his employment as a result of a heart attack, although suffering from a previous heart disease, is covered under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act even if the result was produced by <em>ordinary exertion and usual strain of the work. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\u201c* * * if the physical activity and exertion of an employee\u2019s work aggravates a pre-existing heart condition, precipitates the fatal heart attack, and thus hastens his death, such death is the result of accident arising out of and in the course of the employment within the meaning of our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. <em>Pat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>terson Transfer Co. v. Lewis, </em>195 Tenn. 474, 260 S.W. 2d 182; <em>Heron v. Girdley, </em>198 Tenn. 110, 277 S.W.2d 402; <em>Cambria Coal Co. v. Ault, </em>166 Tenn. 567, 64 S.W.2d 18; <em>Lucey Boiler </em>&amp; <em>Mfg. Corp. v. Hicks, </em>188 Tenn. 700, 222 S.W.2d 19.\u201d 204 Tenn. at 312-313, 321 S.W.2d at 541.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Mr. Justice Swepston, writing for the Court, in <em>Nashville Pure Milk Co. v. Rychen, </em>204 Tenn. 575, 322 S.W.2d 432 (1958), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201cCounsel for appellant seems to have pitched his case on the idea that there must have been some unusual occurrence or activity or exertion beyond the scope of the deceased\u2019s ordinary employment activities in order for the death to be compensable. We think this is a misapprehension of our cases. The question is succinctly stated in <em>Patterson Transfer Co. v. Lewis, </em>195 Tenn. 474, 478, 260 S.W.2d 182, 184, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\u201c \u2018If an ordinary exertion or usual strain produces an unusual result, is the resulting injury by accident?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">\u201cThe answer immediately follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">\u201c \u2018It is now well established that <em>ordinary and usual exertion at work resulting in injuries, is compensa-ble.\u2019 </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The recent case of <em>Ward v. Commercial Ins. Co., </em>213 Tenn. 100, 372 S.W.2d 292 (1963), approved the above language and stated that those cases resolve the question of law as to whether a death resulting from a heart attack in the course of employment <em>can be compensable\u25a0 </em>as arising out of the employment. The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">\u201cThese cases and many more also make it clear that in each case there is a question of fact which must he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>resolved by tbe trial court, to-wit: whether there \u2022actually was a causal connection between the heart attack and the employment.\u201d 213 Tenn. at 110, 372 S.W.2d at 297.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-3\">Thus, since the question is basically one of fact, it is necessary that we take note of the scope of review of this Court as concerns the facts found in the court below. It is settled law that we are to review the record only to determine if the trial judge\u2019s decision is supported by any material evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">In <em>White v. Whiteway Pharmacy, Inc., </em>210 Tenn. 449, 454, 360 S.W.2d 12, 15 (1962), this Court stated that in a workmen\u2019s compensation case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\u201c (F)indings of fact of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal if supported by any material evidence and this is true even though the preponderance of the evidence is against the finding of the trial court. <em>Vester Gas Range </em>&amp; <em>Mfg. Co. v. Leonard, </em>148 Tenn. 665, 257 S.W. 395; <em>Brady v. Reed, </em>186 Tenn. 556, 212 S.W.2d 378; <em>Graybeal v. Smith, </em>189 Tenn. 412, 225 S.W.2d 556.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Our review in the instant case is, therefore, limited to an examination of the record to see if there is any material evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s finding that there was a causal connection between Mr. Breeden\u2019s employment and his fatal heart attack. We think that the medical testimony in the record, without a doubt, is material evidence sufficient to uphold the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In discussing the value of medical testimony and medical opinion, 2 Larsen, Workmen\u2019s Compensation sec. 322 (1961), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">\u201cIt is a common experience of compensation and personal injury lawyers to find that the more distinguished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>a medical witness is, the more tentative and qualified are Ms statements on the witness stand. He will testify that a sledge hammer blow on claimant\u2019s head might well have caused claimant\u2019s headache, but hesitates to say positively that this was the only possible cause, and may concede on cross-examination that there could conceivably be other causes. The weight of such testimony, however, should not be too sharply discounted because of the disposition of the highly-trained scientific mind to refrain from unqualified statements of opinions on such matters as causation. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In <em>Lynch v. La Rue, </em>198 Tenn. 101, 278 S.W.2d 85 (1955), we discussed the value of medical testimony and concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201cIt is elementary that an award cannot be predicated solely upon the testimony of medical experts who are not willing to go any further than to say that it \u2018is possible\u2019 or \u2018could be\u2019 that there is a causal connection between the accident and the injury for which compensation is sought. However, such testimony is not entirely without value if there be other evidence from which the trial judge may reasonably infer that the injury did result from the accident that the experts say \u2018could be\u2019 the cause of the injury.\u201d 198 Tenn. at. 104, 278 S.W.2d at 86.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In re-examining the medical testimony in this case we are of the opinion that the doctor\u2019s statements indicate at least a degree of certainty that the heart attack, the aggravation or acceleration of it, was caused by the employment. Specifically, we point to the language such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">\u201cI\u2019d say * * * any kind of physical activity at all would aggravate or accelerate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>\u201c All I\u2019m saying is that he was at work and the activity he was performing accelerated or aggravated the process that began there.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">In addition to this medical testimony is the proof that the plaintiff\u2019s work required an appreciable amount of physical activity, i. e. lifting, hammering, etc., and, also, the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s condition worsened as he continued working clearly shows that the work accelerated or aggravated the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We think that the above facts constitute sufficient material evidence to make it mandatory that we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The case <em>sub judice </em>is easily distinguished from the recent case of <em>Cas Walker\u2019s Cash </em>Stores, <em>Inc. v. Livesay, </em>215 Tenn. 306, 385 S.W.2d 745 (opinion for publication released January 6, 1965; petition to rehear denied contemporaneously with the release of this opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In that case the evidence showed that the employee appeared normal when he went to work the morning of his attack; that when he left for home and lunch that day he appeared normal; that after eating his lunch and mowing a small part of his yard, he left to return to his work; that when he returned to the store where he worked he was pale and sweating; and, that he went back to lie down ten to fifteen minutes after returning to the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Medical testimony was only that the decedent\u2019s employment \u201ccould or might\u201d have contributed to the attack. At the same time, the other evidence, noted above, in no way supported an inference of a causal connection between the employment and the fatal heart attack. As a matter of fact, it showed the origin of the attack followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>exertion in mowing the lawn and the onset occurred as he returned to his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">As stated previously, in the instant case medical testimony positively links the heart attack with the stress and strain of the plaintiff\u2019s work. Secondly, the other evidence supports or gives rise to an inference that the employment precipitated the heart attack. Both of these elements are lacking in the Cas Walker\u2019s Cash Stores case. The first assignment is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The second assignment of error is that the petitioner failed to prove the notice required by Statute (T.C.A. sec. 50-1001), and such lack of notice conclusively prejudiced the defendant\u2019s rights. Plaintiff admits that he gave no written notice of his injury to the employer, however, he insists that the employer had actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">T.C.A. sec. 50-1001 requires an employee to give written notice of the accident and injury within thirty days on the penalty of having his petition dismissed. The courts have relieved an employee from the burden of written notice on two grounds, namely: (1) waiver, based upon the conduct of the employer, or his representatives in recognition of the liability; and (2) excuse, based upon various grounds of inability, or faultless omission of the employee. Knowledge of the accident and injury on the part of the employer and lack of prejudice are elements considered by the court as affecting the reasonableness of the excuse made, or the justness of the application of the doctrine of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Defendant cites the case of <em>Aluminum Co. of America v. </em>Rogers, 211 Tenn. 187, 364 S.W.2d 358 (1963), as authority for their position. That case held that a guard, who allegedly sustained an accidental injury (pain struck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>him while attempting to close a window), did no justify notice requirements when he merely told employer\u2019s desk sergeant that he was sick at his stomach and his arms and hips were hurting, nor did these statements give employer notice of injury which resulted in his death due to aggravation of a pre-existing diabetic condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">A second case relied upon by defendant is <em>York v. Federal Chemical Co., et al., </em>188 Tenn. 63, 216 S.W.2d 725 (1949). In that case the court dismissed a petition for lack of notice since employee, who died of an infected thumb, had failed to report the infected condition, although he had reported the initial injury. The rationale was that the employer was prejudiced, owing to the lack of notice, because he was deprived of the privilege of securing proper medical attention in time, to treat the infected thumb and thereby, in all probability, save the life of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">On the other hand, it is the established law of this State that while knowledge of a fellow workman of the injury cannot be imputed, to the employer, if an employee\u2019s superior is given notice of the accident and injury, this constitutes notice to the employer. <em>Hotel Claridge Co. v. Blank, </em>169 Tenn. 575, 89 S.W.2d 758 (1936); <em>Tennessee Products Corp. v. Gravitt, </em>182 Tenn. 54, 184 S.W.2d 164 (1945); <em>Patterson v. Bessemer Coal, Iron </em>&amp; <em>Land Co., </em>D.C., 192 F.Supp. 805 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In the case now before us, there is uncontradicted testimony that the plant foreman visited Breeden in the hospital and was informed at that time that Breeden had suffered a heart attack while at work. The foreman had brought Breeden\u2019s last pay cheek to him. Also, there is testimony that Mrs. Breeden reported that her husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>had suffered a heart attack to the plant nurse while plaintiff was still in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We think that these facts clearly demonstrate that the employer had notice through actual knowledge of the injury of Breeden. Notice to the foreman or the plant nurse of the accident and the injury is notice to the employer. Therefore, the second assignment is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The judgment is affirmed and the case is remanded to the trial court for the enforcement of this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b616-7\">Btjrnett, Cheep Justice, and Dyer, Holmes and Chattin, Justices, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
