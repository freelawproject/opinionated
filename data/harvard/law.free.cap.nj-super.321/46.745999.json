Defendant\u2019s motions relied upon a claim of change of circumstances arising from a hearing on April 17, 1997, by the Social Security Administration during which the Administrative Law Judge determined that defendant was disabled as of July 30, 1995, and continuing through December 31, 1997, thus entitling defendant to disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income under the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>claim of change of circumstances was the same in each of defendant\u2019s motions to modify the child support orders, Judge Edward Schwartz consolidated the two separate applications for disposition on the same date. One order bearing the consolidated caption was initially issued on December 24, 1997, and upon reconsideration ***<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was modified by a second order, again under the consolidated docket number, dated February 11,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Defendant, age thirty-two, is the father of four children: Anthony Capaccio IV, born December 1, 1985 and Michael Capaccio, bom September 9,1988, whose mother is Camille Capaccio; Tara Baldassarre, bom May 29, 1985, whose mother is Tina Baldassarre; and Nikki Ann Franciose, bom June 3,1993, whose mother was Gina Franciose, now deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Anthony and Michael reside with their mother, plaintiff Camille Capaccio (\u201cCamille\u201d). Pursuant to a judgment of divorce dated May 13,1991, Camille is the sole custodial parent of both children. The initial divorce judgment established defendant\u2019s child support responsibility at $135 per week for the two children, which was reduced in 1995 to $110 per week, and required defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>maintain a life insurance policy obtained during the marriage naming the two children as beneficiaries. Michael was diagnosed with Hodgkins\u2019 disease in July 1997. As of the date of defendant\u2019s initial modification motion, Michael\u2019s accrued medical bills were substantial. It was undisputed that Michael\u2019s future medical expenses will continue and it was anticipated that those expenses will also be substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Tara Baldassarre resides with her mother, plaintiff Tina Baldassarre (\u201cTina\u201d). Pursuant to an initial child support order dated September 2, 1992, defendant was ordered to pay $50 per week plus additional child care expenses for Tara. Defendant was originally ordered to pay fifty percent of Tara\u2019s unreimbursed medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Nikki Ann Franciose resides with her maternal grandmother, Rosemary Franciose. Subsequent to the death of Nikki\u2019s mother, Gina Franciose, on November 7, 1996, defendant surrendered custody to Rosemary Franciose. Defendant has never been ordered to pay child support for Nikki. Rosemary Franciose signed a certification verifying that she was not presently seeking child support from defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">On December 24, 1997, Judge Schwartz entered an order, in pertinent part: directing defendant to pay a reduced amount in child support to each plaintiff; garnishing defendant\u2019s social security disability payment to satisfy the child support obligations; requiring defendant to prove the continuing existence and parameters of his disability to the court; directing defendant to pay half of Camille\u2019s unreimbursed medical bills for their son; and directing defendant to hold in escrow any monies realized in a then-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>pending personal injury litigation and to notify the court in the event defendant abandons said litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">On January 9,1998, defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the December 24, 1997 order. Thereafter, Judge Schwartz heard oral argument and entered an order dated February 11, 1998, in pertinent part: directing defendant to pay a further reduced amount in child support; garnishing defendant\u2019s social security disability check; requiring defendant\u2019s doctor to submit a report to the court regarding the status and parameters of defendant\u2019s disability; directing defendant to pay for twenty-five percent of Tina\u2019s unreimbursed medical expenses for Tara; ordering defendant to name Anthony IV, Michael, and Tara as partial beneficiaries on one existing life insurance policy;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and continuing the terms of the December 24, 1997 order except where modified by the February 11,1998 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In defendant\u2019s brief on appeal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he raises five points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">THE APPELLATE COURT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DISTURB THE FINDINGS OF THE TRIAL COURT UPON THEIR REVIEW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">DEFENDANT\u2019S CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATION IMPOSED BY THE ORDER IS UNREASONABLE, INAPPROPRIATE AND BASED UPON AN ERRONEOUS APPLICATION OF EXISTING LEGAL PRINCIPLES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">A JUDGE SCHWARTZ FAILED TO APPLY THE CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES AS REQUIRED BY LAW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">B.

Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, R. </em>5:6A Appendix IX (1998) [hereinafter Appendix IX], The 1998 Guidelines \u201cprovide the court with economic information to assist in the establishment and modification of fair and adequate child support awards.\u201d A child support order following the Guidelines \u201cis assumed to be the correct amount of child support unless a party proves to the court that circumstances exist that make a guidelines-based award inappropriate in a specific case.\u201d Appendix IX-A(2). The court may disregard the Guidelines or adjust a Guidelines-based award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>if a party shows, and the court finds, that such action is appropriate due to conflict with one of the factors set forth in sections 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, or 20 of Appendix IX-A, or due to the fact that an injustice would result due to the application of the guidelines in a specific case. The determination of whether <em>good cause </em>exists to disregard or adjust a guidelines-based award in a particular case shall be decided by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\n<em>Ubid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The Guidelines require:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">If the support guidelines are not applied in a specific case or the guidelines-based award is adjusted, the reason for the deviation and the amount of the guidelines-based award (before any adjustment) must be specified in writing on the guidelines worksheet or in the support order. Such findings clarify the basis for the support order if appealed or modified in the future. If the guidelines are found to be inapplicable in a particular case, the court should consider the factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:17-53<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> when establishing the child support award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">[Appendix IX-A(3)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">In section twenty-one, the Guidelines state: \u201cIn all cases, the decision to deviate from the guidelines shall be based on the best interests of the child. All deviations from the guidelines-based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>award and the amount of the guidelines-based award must be stated <em>in uniting </em>in the support order or on the guidelines worksheet.\u201d Appendix IX-A(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The 1998 Guidelines must be construed with <em>Rule </em>5:6A which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">The guidelines set forth in Appendix EX of these Rules shall be applied when an application to establish or modify child support is considered by the court. The guidelines may be modified or disregarded by the court only where good cause is shown. Good cause shall consist of a) the considerations set forth in Appendix IXA, or the presence of other relevant factors which may make the guidelines inapplicable or subject to modification, and b) the fact that injustice would result from the application of the guidelines. In all cases, the determination of good cause shall be within the sound discretion of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">A completed child support guidelines worksheet in the form prescribed in Appendix IX of these Rules shall be filed with any order or judgment that includes child support that is submitted for the approval of the court. If a proposed child support award differs from the award calculated under the child support guidelines, the worksheet shall state the reason for the deviation and the amount of the award calculated under the child support guidelines.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">In reviewing the record on appeal, it is quite apparent that defendant\u2019s contentions in Points IIA and IIB that the judge failed to apply the Guidelines and failed to apply the government benefit deduction for social security disability paid directly to defendant\u2019s three children are clearly without merit. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">It is abundantly clear that the judge fully considered the gross and net income and assets of each party, the case information statement filed by each party, and the sole parenting worksheets which had been filed with the court. The judge was fully aware of each parent\u2019s standard of living and was particularly mindful that, despite the expenses listed in defendant\u2019s case information statement, defendant was living with his parents and was fully subsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>dized by them. The judge explained why it was appropriate to deviate from the Guidelines even though \u201cthis amount will place [defendant\u2019s] available income under the poverty guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We need not fully repeat all of the judge\u2019s calculations. It is clear that at the reconsideration hearing the judge utilized the sole parenting worksheets and determined that the appropriate child support obligation would be $37 per week for Camille\u2019s children and $17 per week for Tina\u2019s child. The judge then noted that if he applied the poverty guideline,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which at that time was $160 per week, \u201cthere would be no obligation on the part of [defendant] for the support of any of his children, and I think that would be contrary to the best interests of these children, and would have failed to take into account that [defendant] has no rental<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> expense at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>An obligor\u2019s living expenses are an appropriate consideration in fashioning a child support award. The Guidelines provide several examples of where the obligor parent\u2019s living expenses are considered: in Appendix IX-A(3), the Guidelines-based award may be adjusted \u201cto accommodate ... the parents\u2019 circumstances\u201d; in Appendix IX-A(20), in an extreme income situation, \u201cthe court shall carefully review the obligor\u2019s income and living expenses to determine the maximum amount of child support than can reasonably be ordered without denying the obligor the means of self-support at a minimum subsistence level\u201d; and in the instructions for the sole parenting worksheet in Appendix IX-B, the instructions for lines 24 to 26, \u201cMaintaining a Self-Support Reserve,\u201d the court can \u201cconsider a parent\u2019s actual living expenses\u201d in its determination of whether the application of the self-support reserve is appropriate. When the Guidelines are inapplicable and the court applies the statutory criteria listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23, the court may consider the \u201ceconomic circumstances of each parent.\u201d Lastly, the reasons for the deviation must be in writing pursuant to Appendix IX-A(2) and (21), as well as <em>R. </em>5:6A.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Based upon the totality of the evidence presented, the judge determined that he would disregard the poverty guideline and that he was prepared to follow the calculated Guideline figures of $37 per week payable to Camille for two children and $17 per week payable to Tina for one child. The judge then modified those figures so that each child would be treated equally, such that Camille would receive $36 per week for two children and Tara would receive $18 per week for one child. The court fully recognized that Camille\u2019s children received $128 per month<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Tara\u2019s child received $64 per month from the Social Security Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Here, the judge fully explained why he was deviating from the Guidelines and fully explained that his deviation also encompassed a deviation from strict adherence to the self-support reserve of $160 per week. The judge\u2019s explanation fulfills the judicial responsibility articulated in <em>Winterberg v. Lupo, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 132, 692 A.2d 92 (App.Div.1997). Further appellate intervention is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Defendant contends in Point IIC and IV that the judge erroneously determined defendant\u2019s obligations regarding his children\u2019s unreimbursed medical expenses. The 1998 Guidelines presume that the custodial parent will pay the first $250 of each child\u2019s medical expenses per year, but will share these ordinary health care expenses proportionally to the relative incomes of the parents. Thus, the medical expenses for the first $250 per child per year are included in the Appendix IX-F schedules. However, any amount of unreimbursed medical expenses above $250 that are predictable and recurring are included in the sole parenting worksheet in Line 10 and added to the basic support amount, as explained in Appendix IX-B in the instructions for the sole parenting worksheet. Unpredictable and non-recurring medical expenses in exeess of $250 per child per year are not included in the support award; thus, \u201cthe procedure for sharing such costs should be set forth in the general language of the order or judgment.\u201d Appendix IX-B.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The judge was fully aware that the medical expenses for Michael were substantial, exceeding $50,000, and would be ongoing. Although the judge recognized that defendant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>previously ordered to pay fifty percent of Michael\u2019s unreimbursed medical expenses, he was also aware of two additional facts: Camille\u2019s family had conducted a public fund raiser to obtain charitable contributions to assist her in defraying the expenses of Michael\u2019s medical treatment and that fund raiser had raised in excess of $50,000, albeit, as of the date of defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the exact extent of the fund raising effort was unknown. The judge determined that defendant\u2019s actual obligation would be affected by deducting those donated funds from the expenses owed. The judge temporarily suspended defendant\u2019s obligation to reimburse fifty percent of Michael\u2019s medical bills. However, to assure that funds would be available, the judge ordered that defendant\u2019s, then-pending personal injury litigation could not be dismissed by defendant without Family Part approval and additionally ordered that any settlement of that litigation would be deposited in escrow pending further review in the Family Part. The judge\u2019s decision was entirely equitable and clearly was neither arbitrary nor capricious. In fact, the judge\u2019s decision is consistent with <em>Cleveland v. Cleveland, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 592 A.2d 20 (App.Div.1991) (holding, in part, a personal injury award to a former spouse may be considered income in determining child support) and is consistent with the Guidelines, Appendix IX-B, which defines taxable and non-taxable income to be included on a sole parenting worksheet or on a .shared parenting worksheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Defendant contends in Point III the judge erred by requiring defendant to provide medical proof that his disability is continuing. We disagree. The judge\u2019s order is consistent with the Social Security Administration disability benefit award which also requires defendant to provide medical proof that his disability is continuous. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 421(i)(l) (requiring reevaluation \u201c[i]n any case where an individual is or has been determined to be under a disability, ... at least once every three years.\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In Point V defendant contends that the judge erred when he required plaintiff to name his children as beneficiaries on his life insurance and to pay insurance premiums. We disagree. Courts have statutory authority to require the maintenance of insurance coverage. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23d, effective January 19, 1998, provides that after filing a complaint for divorce, where the support of a child is at issue, the parent who maintained existing life insurance coverage must continue to maintain that same coverage. Additionally, the court may reallocate financial responsibilities by ordering a parent to obtain comparable insurance or may release a party from the obligation to maintain insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Here, the judge was advised that defendant had applied under the terms of the existing insurance policy for a waiver of premiums due to his disability. Ordering defendant to maintain the existing policy will not pose an economic detriment to defendant. Moreover, should defendant\u2019s application for a waiver of insurance premiums be denied, defendant is free to present that evidence to the Family Part for appropriate reconsideration of the life insurance provisions of the present order.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-16\"> Defendant's application for disability was considered pursuant to 20 <em>C.F.R. </em>404.1520(a)-(f) and 416.920(a)-(f) by Administrative Law Judge C'ALJ\") Robert Lazarus.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The AU determined that defendant had not been gainfully employed since the onset of his disability on July 30, 1995, and that defendant had been previously employed in sundry positions as a store clerk, automobile detailer, and as a laborer. The ALJ found that defendant\u2019s disability was attributable to \u201cpoly-substance abuse disorder, chronic renal failure, gout, clinical obesity, dilated cardiomyopathy, hyperparathyroidism, congestive heart failure, and back pain,\u201d and that defendant\u2019s substance abuse was not material to the conclusion that defendant was disabled within the parameters of the Social Security Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b77-12\"> Defendant was initially awarded $570 per month for social security benefits. That sum was reduced to $538 per month in January 1998. The reduction in defendant\u2019s monthly disability benefits was one basis for defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the order entered December 24, 1997. Additionally, as of the date of the initial modification motion Camille Capaccio was unemployed. In defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, he correctly asserted that Camille had obtained employment, providing another basis for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\"> Judge Schwartz premised each decision in these consolidated matters upon the understanding that defendant\u2019s child support obligation was for three children. Implicit in the judge's decisions is the fact that the last order dated February 11, 1998, would be subject to modification in the event Rosemary Franciose were to apply for child support for her granddaughter, Nikki.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> Allhough the record on appeal is not entirely clear, it appears that defendant was involved in two accidents. One personal injury claim had been settled shortly before the return date of the initial modification hearing. Defendant paid the net settlement he received to Camille in partial reduction of his accrued child support obligation. The second claim was pending pursuant to a prior complaint filed in the Law Division. The provision in the December 24, 1997 order references that pending litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\"> After Camille and defendant were divorced, defendant had been ordered to obtain an additional life insurance policy for $100,000 naming his two sons as beneficiaries conditioned upon defendant's insurability. Defendant did obtain one policy of insurance providing $50,000 of coverage. Defendant claimed that his uninsurability prevented him from obtaining the additional insurance to meet the obligation established by the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\"> Defendant\u2019s notice of appeal set forth three specific issues relating to the order of February 11, 1998. Defendant\u2019s brief on appeal raises issues not referenced in his notice of appeal. Since all issues raised by defendant\u2019s brief were presented to the motion judge and have been fully briefed on appeal, we have elected pursuant to <em>R </em>2:6-2 to address each of defendant's contentions, including certain aspects of the order which arguably are interlocutory in nature. <em>See </em>Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>2:6-2 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b81-11\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23(a), effective January 8, 1998, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">In determining the amount to be paid by a parent for support of the child and the period during which the duty of support is owed, the court in those cases not governed by court rule shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">(1) Needs of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">(2) Standard of living and economic circumstances of each parent;</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">(3) All sources of income and assets of each parent;</p>\n<p id=\"b81-16\">(4) Earning ability of each parent, including educational background, training, employment skills, work experience, custodial responsibility for children including the cost of providing child care and the length of time and cost of each parent to obtain training or experience for appropriate employment;</p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">(5) Need and capacity of the child for education, including higher education;</p>\n<p id=\"b81-18\">(6) Age and health of the child and each parent;</p>\n<p id=\"b81-19\">(7) Income, assets and earning ability of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b81-20\">(8) Responsibility of the parents for the court-ordered support of others;</p>\n<p id=\"b81-21\">(9) Reasonable debts and liabilities of each child and parent; and</p>\n<p id=\"b81-22\">(10) Any other factors the court may deem relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b81-23\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:17-53 contains a list of considerations for child support that is virtually identical to that found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b82-11\"> Although a Guidelines worksheet may not have been filed with the order dated February 11, 1998, and was not provided separately as an exhibit in defendant\u2019s appendices, we are nonetheless able to consider the issues raised by defendant.

The self-support reserve is weekly income an impoverished parent may maintain for liim/herself for basic sustenance. \u201cIt attempts to ensure that the obligor has sufficient income to maintain a basic subsistence level and the incentive to work so that child support can be paid.\u201d Appendix IX-A(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">A child support order may be adjusted to reflect the self-support reserve \"only if [the child support] payment would reduce the obligor\u2019s net income below the reserve <em>and </em>the custodial parent's ... net income is greater than 105% of the poverty guideline.\" Appendix IX A(7). As of March 10, 1997, the self-support reserve was $160 per week. Thus, the Guidelines assume that the obligor parent will be left with an income that provides for the parent\u2019s basis subsistence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">. Section twenty, \"Extreme Parental Income Situations,\u201d provides that extremely low or extremely high parental incomes makes the Appendix IX-F award (the chart on which the calculated child support is based) \"inappropriate due to the limitations of the economic data.\u201d This section provides that if the obligor\u2019s net income after deducting child support obligation, is less than $160 per week, \"the court shall carefully review the obligor\u2019s income and living expenses to determine the maximum amount of child support that can reasonably be ordered without denying the obligor the means of self-support at a minimum subsistence level.\" Appendix IX-A(20).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b83-10\"> In another section of the judge\u2019s findings, he concluded that defendant \u201chas few living expenses because he resides with his parents who provide his basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>needs. Therefore, an upward deviation from the Child Support Guidelines is warranted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\"> Although the judge's reasons for deviation are fully explained in his oral and written opinion, we construe Appendix IX-A(2) and (21) and <em>R. </em>5:6A to require that the judge\u2019s reasons for deviation be attached to the order upon filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b84-9\"> In his oral opinion, the judge stated Camille\u2019s two children received $128 per month for social security disability. The actual amount, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>records from the Social Security Administration included in defendant\u2019s appendix is $126 per month, $63 per month for each of Camille's two children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\"> The judge\u2019s order is also consistent with the evidence presented. Defendant admitted that he has supplemented his income by collecting and selling scrap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>metal. Defendant also sustained personal injuries in an accident while operating a taxi cab. Evidence was also presented which clearly demonstrated that although defendant is disabled within the purview of the Social Security Act, defendant is not sedentary nor is he confined to his home. Periodic review of defendant\u2019s medical status will permit the Family Part to reevaluate defendant's actual ability to return to the work force.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
