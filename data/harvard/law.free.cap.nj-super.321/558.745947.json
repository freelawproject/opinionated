Soon after plaintiff\u2019s admission to Newcomb Medical Center, an electronic fetal monitor belt was strapped around her abdomen. A fetal monitor produces a continuous paper strip. The baby\u2019s heartbeat is printed along the top of the strip and, simultaneously, the pattern of the mother\u2019s uterine contractions is printed along the bottom of the strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">At 1:30 p.m., Portadin ascertained that plaintiff\u2019s cervix was fully dilated. Dissatisfied with the frequency and intensity of her uterine contractions, Portadin directed the administration of Pitocin. This drug increases the frequency and intensity of uterine contractions and, as a result, increases the amount of uterine force exerted upon the baby, which in turn reduces the flow of oxygen to the baby during contractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Shortly after 1:30 p.m., defendant Cinotti, the nurse on duty in the hospital\u2019s labor room, began the intravenous infusion of Pitoein at the rate of two milliunits per minute. At about 1:45 p.m., Cinotti, at Portadin\u2019s direction, increased the Pitoein rate to four milliunits per minute. At about 2:24 p.m., Cinotti claimed she was relieved by defendant Spoltore as the nurse on duty in the labor room in order to prepare the adjacent delivery room for plaintiff. Spoltore disputed that contention, but in any event admitted that at about 2:24 p.m., the Pitoein rate was increased to six milliunits per minute. The note on the strip to that effect was in Spoltore\u2019s handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">At about 2:45 p.m., plaintiff was disconnected from the fetal monitoring belt and, at about 2:55 p.m., was transferred to the delivery room. At 3:02 p.m., plaintiff vaginally delivered Diana. At birth, Diana had virtually no heartbeat and, following resuscitation, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 medical malpractice theory was based on the fact that, after about 2:00 p.m., the fetal heartbeat portion of the paper monitoring strip developed intermittent gaps and became almost illegible. Apparently, the external fetal monitor lost contact with the fetal heartbeat as plaintiff thrashed around during her increased uterine contractions. Plaintiffs alleged that, under accepted medical standards, this loss of continuous fetal heartbeat information required the administration of Pitocin to be immediately discontinued, which would quickly return plaintiffs uterine contractions to their pre-Pitocin pattern. Thereafter, an internal fetal monitor should have been attached directly to the baby\u2019s scalp, after which administration of Pitocin could have been safely resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Plaintiffs asserted that Portadin, Cinotti, and Spoltore deviated from these accepted standards because, while administering the Pitocin, they either negligently failed to continuously monitor the fetal heartbeat, as required, or they observed the virtually illegible fetal heartbeat readings on the monitor strip and negligently failed to turn off the Pitocin. Plaintiffs\u2019 medical experts opined that Diana\u2019s cerebral palsy was proximately caused by oxygen deprivation commencing at about 2:30 p.m., and that Diana would have incurred no brain damage if the Pitocin had been discontinued before that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In answer to special interrogatories, the jury found that Portadin did not \u201cdeviate from accepted standards of medical practice,\u201d and that Cinotti and Spoltore did not \u201cdeviate from accepted standards of nursing practice.\u201d On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial judge committed various legal errors in the jury selection process, in several evidentiary rulings, and in the jury charge. We <em>find no error </em>warranting reversal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Plaintiffs contend that the judge \u201cerred by failing to perceive the pattern of systematic exclusion of prospective jurors on the basis of race and/or ethnicity, and in refusing to declare a mistri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>al.\u201d Specifically, plaintiffs complain about \u201cdefendants\u2019 use of peremptory challenges to eliminate minority members from the venire\u201d and assert that, as a result, plaintiffs\u2019 action was tried before a jury \u201cthat had been totally stripped of all Hispanics and partially stripped of other minorities by the improper use of peremptory challenges.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs specifically contend that , the trial judge erred by failing to follow the procedures established in <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 511 A.2d 1150 (1986), and <em>Russell v. Rutgers Comm. Health Plan, Inc., </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 655 A.2d 948 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>452, 663 A.2d 1359 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">During the fourth round of challenges, Cinotti\u2019s counsel, Kruttschnitt, used his second peremptory challenge to excuse Hilda Diaz, a Hispanic. During the fifth round of challenges, Kruttschnitt used his third peremptory challenge to excuse John Dukes, a black man. During the seventh round of peremptory challenges, Kruttschnitt used his fourth challenge to excuse Verna Douglas, a black woman. By this time defendants had exercised a total of fourteen out of eighteen permissible peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">After this challenge, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected and at side bar asked the judge to require Kruttschnitt to give a reason for the exclusion of juror Douglas, in light of the \u201cexclusion of other minorities ... particularly Ms. Diaz, who was the only Hispanic person that we\u2019ve seen all morning.\u201d During the colloquy that followed, it became clear that counsel for Spoltore and Portadin would have excused Diaz, even if Cinotti\u2019s counsel had not, because she and plaintiff worked for the same employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">During the eighth round of challenges, Spoltore\u2019s counsel, Crammer, used his sixth (and last) peremptory challenge to excuse Rosa Lopez. After this challenge, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected and at side bar requested a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>We now have a pattern of improper exeusal of minority jurors. My clients\u2019 last name is Velazquez, it\u2019s not hard to figure out what\u2019s going on here. Ms. Diaz and Ms. Lopez, the only two women, Hispanics, have now been excused. And I think this [e]ourt is bound to make a determination that we are under-represented by minorities. There is no Hispanic member in the jury panel right now, and I would ask for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Following this, the judge asked Crammer to state his reason for excusing Ms. Lopez. Crammer replied that he had excused Lopez because \u201cshe has specific medical training,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want people who have that kind of training to the extent of which I am unaware to then carry over notions [about what] the medical standard of care should be to a nurse.\u201d Lopez had stated that she had received training as \u201ca medical assistant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The judge accepted counsel\u2019s reason. In response to plaintiffs\u2019 request that he find a \u201cpattern\u201d of excusing minority jurors, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">Let me make clear what my position on it is. I don\u2019t think there needs to be a pattern established in the sense there needs to be a finding that there\u2019s a pattern that would ... lay a cloud over the whole proceeding. I just think that once there\u2019s been \u2014 and I think the <em>Russell </em>case stands for the proposition that once there\u2019s sufficient showing that appears as though someone has excused minority [jurors], whether it be Spanish or other, that perhaps counsel ought to be directed to place their positions on the record, which is what Mr. Crammer did. He would appear to have [ ] articulable reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">During the ninth round of challenges, Portadin\u2019s counsel, Leyhane, used his sixth (and last) peremptory challenge to excuse Ari Johnson, a black woman. When asked for his reason, Leyhane explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">[A]s to that particular juror, my concern was this is a long case, and I think my own idea is, frankly, that \u2014 in <em>any </em>event, this is a juror who obviously has a good deal of stuff on her mind, I come last in this ease. The anxieties that that kind of juror, whether white, black, Hispanic or otherwise, might feel as she goes into these, I guess it\u2019s [her union] negotiations, later in this case, not being able to participate fully here because of thinking about that, are of concern to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The judge accepted his explanation. The record reveals that on the first day of jury selection Ms. Johnson informed the court that she was going to be involved as a union representative in certain labor negotiations and was concerned about the possible conflict with her duties as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>At the end of jury selection plaintiffs concede that two black jurors sat on the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs again moved for a mistrial at that time. The judge rejected plaintiffs\u2019 request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">But the point of it is that I didn\u2019t discern there to be a pattern of either racial or ethnic exclusion. But when that issue was raised, I thought it incumbent upon the [c]ourt to ask counsel to articulate a reason. So, that anyone \u2014 [an][a]ppellate [cjourt reviewing this matter could hear what those reasons were and could make a judgment on it. I discerned no pattern in the sense of excusing minorities, including women.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In <em>Gilmore, </em>the Court held, on state constitutional grounds, that peremptory challenges on the ground of presumed group bias, as distinguished from situation-specific bias, unreasonably restrict the possibility that a petit jury will contain a representative cross-section of the community and, as such, impinges on a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury. 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 528-29, 511 A.2d 1150. <em>Gilmore, </em>a criminal case, held that there is a rebuttable presumption that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges on permissible grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 535, 511 A.2d 1150. A defendant has the burden of rebutting that presumption by making a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the potential jurors who were wholly or disproportionately excluded were members of a cognizable group, and that there is a substantial likelihood the peremptory challenges were based on assumptions of group bias rather than any indication of situation-specific bias. <em>Id. </em>at 535-36, 511 A.2d 1150. In deciding whether a party has met this <em>prima facie </em>showing, the trial judge should consider all relevant circumstances, including the number of members of the group that were excused, whether the opposing party used a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges against the minority group, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>whether the excused jurors were, except for their race, otherwise heterogeneous, and whether the excluded jurors were of the same race as the complaining party. <em>Id. </em>at 536, 511 A.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">When a defendant makes such a showing, the burden then shifts to the prosecutor to come forward with evidence that the action was justifiable on the basis of a situation-specific bias. <em>Id. </em>at 537, 511 A.2d 1150. The judge must then decide whether the explanations are genuine and reasonable or sham excuses and belatedly contrived. <em>Id. </em>at 537-38, 511 A.2d 1150. In making this decision, the judge must be mindful that the prosecutor\u2019s justifications need not rise to the level of a challenge for cause, nor is the prosecutor prohibited from making challenges based on hunches, so long as the exercise of those hunches does not demonstrate, on balance, action premised on group bias. Id. at 538-39, 511 A.2d 1150; <em>State v. Watkins, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>259, 267, 553 A.2d 1344 (1989). The \u201cultimate\u201d burden of proving that the prosecution has exercised challenges on constitutionally-impermissible grounds remains with the defendant and by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 539, 511 A.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In <em>Russell, </em>we applied the <em>Gilmme </em>principles to civil cases but added the caveat that plaintiff need not make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that counsel has exercised peremptory challenges on constitutionally-impermissible grounds in the <em>Gilmore </em>context where the minority juror who is challenged represents the only minority member of the venire. 280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 454, 655 A.2d 948. Further, we reiterated that a reviewing court must give deference to the trial judge\u2019s finding that the explanations for the challenges were not pretextual, rather than relying solely on the \u201ccold transcript,\u201d because the trial judge is \u201cin the best position to assess the subtle nuances not conveyed by the record, and to gauge the reactions of the attorneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 655 A.2d 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">When plaintiffs first objected to Kruttschnitt\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges, the <em>Russell </em>situation was not present. That is to say, there were other minority jurors in the venire. Accordingly, it was plaintiffs\u2019 obligation to establish a <em>prima facie </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>showing that Kruttschnitt had exercised his challenges on a disproportionate basis to exclude members of a cognizable group. Plaintiffs did establish that three out of the five challenges exercised by Kruttschnitt to that point were directed at minorities (two blacks and one Hispanic), arguably a disproportionate number. However, only one of the three was a member of the same minority group as the complaining party. Plaintiffs failed to show that the three excluded minorities were otherwise heterogeneous when compared to the remaining members of the panel. Indeed, the record indicates that they were not. Mr. Dukes\u2019 mother was mentally impaired and confined to an institution that specializes in the care of such persons, while Ms. Douglas was an employee of such an institution. Ms. Diaz, on the other hand, was employed by the same employer as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The trial judge\u2019s finding that plaintiffs had not established a \u201cpattern\u201d of impermissible challenges was essentially a determination that plaintiffs had not established the necessary <em>prima facie </em>showing under \u201call of the relevant circumstances\u201d as required by <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 536, 511 A.2d 1150. We find no abuse of discretion in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The next objection came when Crammer exercised his last peremptory challenge to excuse Ms. Lopez. At that point, there were apparently no other Hispanics remaining on the venire. The challenge to the only remaining Hispanic implicated the holding in <em>Russell, </em>thereby relieving plaintiffs of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case as to Crammer\u2019s challenge. Accordingly, the trial judge appropriately required Crammer to state his reason for excusing the juror. He did so, as noted earlier, articulating a trial-specific reason. Plaintiffs had the burden at that point to prove a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that Crammer exercised his peremptory challenge because of group bias rather than situation-specific bias. <em>Watkins, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 266, 553 A.2d 1344 <em>quoting Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 536, 511 A.2d 1150). The judge accepted Crammer\u2019s reason as non-pretextual, and plaintiffs have advanced no compelling basis to find an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Finally, Leyhane exercised his last challenge to excuse Ms. Johnson, a black woman. This was his first use of a peremptory challenge to excuse a minority. Apparently, two black jurors remained on the panel. There was certainly no showing that Leyhane\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges was disproportionate, nor was there a showing that Ms. Johnson was heterogeneous in comparison to the remaining jurors on the panel. Indeed, Leyhane\u2019s explanation, though perhaps not technically required, revealed a situation-specific reason for excusing the juror. Again, we find no basis for interfering with the judge\u2019s apparent conclusion that plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of proving that there was a substantial likelihood that the challenge was based on group bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We are not oblivious to the possibility that in a civil case involving multiple defense counsel a possibility of collusion among counsel exists, either tacitly or by agreement, to circumvent the principles of <em>Russell. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 argument suggests a tacit undertaking, although Leyhane and Crammer used only two out of their twelve challenges, to excuse minority jurors. All tolled, defense counsel used five out of a possible eighteen challenges to excuse minority jurors, and two minority jurors remained on the empaneled jury. (Kruttschnitt did not use his last challenge). Suffice it to say that whether the record is viewed singularly as to each defendant, or considered as a whole, we find no reversible error. Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, considering all the relevant circumstances, that there was a substantial likelihood that defense counsel exercised those five challenges for reasons related to group bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Noting that <em>R. </em>1:8 \u2014 3(c) provides that in civil actions each party is entitled to six peremptory challenges, plaintiffs contend that the judge abused his discretion \u201cin failing to increase the number of plaintiffs peremptory challenges, and in forcing plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>tiff to pick a jury with one-third the number of challenges the defense had among them.\u201d Specifically, plaintiffs assert that the judge erred in denying their request for more than six peremptory challenges because he \u201cconcluded that there was no identity of interest among the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><em>R. </em>l:8-3(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">In civil actions each party shall be entitled to 6 peremptory challenges. Parties represented by the same attorney shall be deemed 1 party for the purposes of this rule. Where, however, multiple parties having a substantial identity of interest in one or more issues are represented by different attorneys, the trial court in its discretion may, on application of counsel prior to the selection of the jury, accord the adverse party such additional number of peremptory challenges as it deems appropriate in order to avoid unfairness to the adverse party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The judge denied plaintiffs\u2019 application, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">The number of challenges are the number of challenges provided for in the Rule. And there\u2019s authority for altering the number of challenges when there would be a substantial identity of interest in one or more issues. Now, certainly the defense has an identity of issues in the sense that they hope that this case produces a no cause. But that\u2019s about as far as the identity of interest goes because they have individual clients with individual theories presented against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">And even their argument could go so far as to suggest that perhaps they would be pitted against one another as the trial unfolds. Whether that happens or not, but certainly the potential for it is there. And there is not a substantial identity of interest, at least I didn\u2019t think there was, or there is, that would cause the[ ] need to [have] challenges above six.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">We find no abuse of discretion in the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">In the context of plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability, a critical fact issue concerned which defendant, or defendants, was or were present when the fetal monitor strips became unreadable, and more specifically at 2:30 p.m. when plaintiffs\u2019 experts claimed intervention was critical to save the baby from oxygen deprivation. Nurse Cinotti testified at trial that she left the labor room at 2:20 p.m., leaving Nurse Spoltore in charge of the patient and, thus, theoretically responsible for the failure to either alert Dr. Portadin of the alleged problem or disconnect the Pitocin herself. Spoltore, on the other hand, maintained that she was the nurse for the baby, not the mother, and was present briefly to note that the Pitocin had been increased. She testified that had she increased the Pitocin, she would have noted it both on the strip and on the chart. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Thus, during the critical time period, Cinotti had an interest in having the jury believe that she was not responsible for the mother. Spoltore, on the other hand, disclaimed responsibility and by inference pointed blame at Cinotti or Dr. Portadin, if Dr. Portadin was in the room at the time the Pitocin was increased, as he believed he was. The defendant nurses were united only in that they attempted to show the jury that Dr. Portadin was present at the critical time period and had assumed the responsibility of monitoring the mother and baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">As for Dr. Portadin, the fact that he testified that he was more likely than not present at the time the Pitocin was increased and for some time thereafter, if not the entire time, does not reflect an identity of interest with the nurses. Plaintiffs\u2019 nursing expert testified that whatever nurse was responsible for the mother during the time period after 2:30 p.m., she was required to shut off the Pitocin, even if Dr. Portadin was present. Thus, whether Dr. Portadin was present or not during the critical time period, the nursing malpractice theory stood on its own. Likewise, the theory of liability against Dr. Portadin, testified to by another of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, was independent of that of the nurses. Accordingly, it simply did not matter to Dr. Portadin whether one, both, or none of the nurses were present during the critical time.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Further, we find no clear evidence in the record that the defense attorneys strategically used \u201cpasses\u201d in the course of jury selection in order to have plaintiffs consume all of their six challenges while hoarding theirs. Plaintiffs had two challenges remaining after Crammer exhausted all of his challenges and one challenge after Leyhane exhausted his challenges. Kruttschnitt, who had one remaining challenge after plaintiffs used all of their challenges, did not exercise his last challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">We cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Plaintiffs contend that the judge\u2019s \u201cvoir dire was inadequate and deprived counsel of meaningful information about any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the prospective jurors.\u201d Plaintiffs primarily complain because the judge refused to use their twenty-nine question juror questionnaire, either by having all potential jurors answer it in writing or by the judge using it to question the jurors aloud. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">In material part, <em>R. </em>l:8-3(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">For the purpose of determining whether a challenge should be interposed, the court shall interrogate the prospective jurors in the box after the required number are drawn without placing them under oath. The parties or their attorneys may supplement the court\u2019s interrogation in its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The appellate review standards on this issue are well established. Jury <em>voir dire </em>standards and procedures are traditionally within the broad discretionary powers vested in the trial judge, and the judge\u2019s exercise of that discretion will ordinarily not be disturbed on appeal. <em>State v. Williams, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>393, 410, 550 A.2d 1172 (1988). Because \u201cno <em>voir dire </em>is perfect,\u201d it need only be \u201csufficient to secure an impartial jury.\u201d <em>State v. Loftin, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>295,340, 680 A.2d 677 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">While a <em>\u201cvoir dire </em>designed to expose potential bias is essential to ensure an impartial jury,\u201d an appellate court \u201cshould defer to the trial court\u2019s decisions about the <em>voir dire.\u201d State v. Hunt, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>330, 348, 558 A.2d 1259 (1989). Because one of the primary purposes of <em>R. </em>1:8-3(a) \u201cis to avoid unnecessarily protracted jury examination[,]\u201d a <em>voir dire </em>need only be \u201csufficiently thorough to assure the selection of an impartial jury.\u201d <em>State v. Murray, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 392-93, 573 A.2d 488 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>334, 585 A.2d 350 (1990). Thus, even if the trial judge\u2019s <em>voir dir\u00e9 </em>interrogation is \u201cmore general and less searching than that requested by counsel,\u201d it will not be disturbed on appeal if the appellate court\u2019s \u201creview of the record reveals that the overall scope and quality of the <em>voir dire </em>was sufficiently thorough and probing to assure the selection of an impartial jury.\u201d <em>State v. Biegenwald, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>13,29,524 A.2d 130 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The judge here believed that his questioning of the potential jurors had been sufficiently thorough to \u201cend up with a jury that is free from at least any taint that\u2019s obvious.\u201d While the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>questions did not cover all questions in plaintiffs\u2019 questionnaire, they covered many of the most relevant ones. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the judge conducted a \u201cperfunctory <em>voir dire\u201d </em>and \u201cinadequate questioning\u201d of jurors is not factually supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Referring to Dr. Dollinger, Dr. Portadin\u2019s medical expert, plaintiffs contend that the trial judge erred in permitting Dr. Dollinger to testify beyond the contents of his report on issues never previously discussed by him. The issue is best understood in the context of plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability as to Dr. Portadin.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Dr. Edelberg, plaintiffs\u2019 obstetrical medical expert, testified that both the defendant nurses and Dr. Portadin failed to recognize the hyperstimulation of the uterus, an event caused by the administration of Pitocin, and failed to stop the administration of Pitocin to correct the condition. Because of the hyperstimulation, Dr. Edelberg was of the opinion that the fetus suffered from oxygen deprivation, resulting in brain damage to the infant plaintiff. Pitocin is a drug designed to augment uterine contractions. It is a \u201cvery, very potent drug, and a very useful drug ... it makes the contraction stronger, and ... it can make the contractions more frequent.\u201d The way to tell whether the Pitocin is overstimulating the uterus is to observe the fetal monitor strip and look for contractions that occur more frequently than every \u201ctwo to three\u201d minutes. And one way to determine whether there is fetal distress is to look for \u201clate decelerations\u201d in the fetal heart rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Plaintiffs complain in their brief that Dr. Dollinger, on direct examination, was allowed to give an opinion that plaintiffs uterus was not hyperstimulated by the Pitocin even though his report \u201cnever mentioned the issue of Pitocin, or hyperstimulation of the uterus.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that their attorney relied upon the absence of such a discussion in Dr. Dollinger\u2019s report \u201cin deciding how to present the plaintiffs case, and what issues to emphasize.\u201d Plaintiffs, however, never explain how the ease would have other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>wise been presented had they known that Dr. Dollinger would have been permitted to testify as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In any event, Dr. Dollinger\u2019s report reflects that he was aware that Pitocin was administered. It further reflects that he examined the fetal monitor strip and concluded that \u201c[m]uch of the late monitor strips are illegible.\u201d He also opined that \u201c[w]hile there were some decelerations, they were always followed by excellent accelerations and good beat to beat variability.\u201d In essence, he concluded that the inability to accurately trace the fetal heart rate near the end of delivery had no connection to the infant\u2019s condition at delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The decision whether to exclude expert testimony at trial on the ground that it goes beyond the perimeters of the expert\u2019s report is in the nature of a discovery sanction. As such, it is a discretionary decision and \u201cmust be just and reasonable.\u201d <em>Mauro v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 206, 542 A.2d 16 (App.Div.1988), <em>aff'd sub nom. Mauro v. Raymark Indus., Inc., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>126, 561 A.2d 257 (1989). Thus, we review the trial judge\u2019s d\u00e9termination of this issue in the context of whether there was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The hallmark for excluding expert testimony in this context is the presence of surprise and prejudice to the objecting party. <em>Westphal v. Guarino, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>139, 146, 394 A.2d 377 (App.Div), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>308, 394 A.2d 354 (1978). These concepts are somewhat elusive because they cannot always be objectively determined. A party cannot claim surprise, however, when the testimony of the expert contains \u201cthe logical predicates for and conclusions from statements made in the report[.]\u201d <em>McCalla v. Hamischfeger Corp., </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>160,171, 521 A.2d 851 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>219, 528 A.2d 36, 37 (1987). Limiting a defense expert to a statement of bare conclusion without giving the expert a chance to explain his or her reasons in detail is not fair or reasonable. In <em>McCalla, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s limitation on [the defense expert\u2019s] testimony to a mere rebuttal, without foundation, of plaintiffs expert\u2019s report was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>substantially worthless and lacked credibility and conviction; it required \u2018factual underpinning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 521 A.2d 851; <em>see also Congiusti v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126,131-32, 703 A.2d 340 (App.Div.1997); <em>Hall v. Zuckerman, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>455, 458-59, 495 A.2d 442 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">As in <em>McCalla, Congiusti, </em>and <em>Hall, </em>we believe Dr. Dollinger\u2019s report provided notice to the plaintiffs that he recognized Pitocin had been administered, and that he had reviewed the fetal monitoring strip to determine the signs of fetal distress, either related or unrelated to the use of Pitocin. If plaintiffs\u2019 attorney believed that Dr. Dollinger\u2019s report was a \u201cnet opinion\u201d without sufficient supporting reasons, his deposition should have been used to further explore the foundation for it. <em>McCalla, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 172, 521 A.2d 851. We have not been given Dr. Dollinger\u2019s deposition testimony for review, but we find nothing in plaintiffs\u2019 brief suggesting the reasons for Dr. Dollinger\u2019s finding of no deviation were explored in the context of plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability, or that the doctor either dodged questions or gave different answers dining his deposition from those he gave at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Although the outcome in <em>Mauro </em>was different from the outcome in all three of the foregoing cases, <em>Mauro </em>does not disagree with the principles of <em>McCalla. Mauro </em>simply comes to a different conclusion on the issue of surprise and prejudice to the objecting party and holds that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in barring the testimony. The factual distinction is that there was nothing in plaintiffs expert\u2019s report in that case that fairly alerted defendants to the fact that the expert would rely upon specific statistical and epidemiological studies at the time of trial to support his opinion that plaintiff had an enhanced risk of contracting cancer due to his asbestos exposure. In contrast, in this case Dr. Edelberg and Dr. Dollinger were essentially reviewing the same document, i.e., the fetal monitor strip, for the same clues of fetal distress, i.e., lack of variability and presence of late decelerations. The use of Pitocin as a possible contributing factor to siich signs of fetal distress was fairly implied. Thus, we cannot con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>elude that the trial judge abused his discretion in concluding that plaintiffs were neither surprised nor prejudiced by Dr. Dollinger\u2019s testimony on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the trial judge erred in allowing Dr. Portadin to testify concerning his general practice, \u201cas though his habit and routine were somehow applicable to the specifics of this labor and interpretation of this monitoring strip, and to explain his alleged thought processes and decision making process in this very case, despite his admitted complete lack of recollection concerning them.\u201d Indeed, on direct examination, Dr. Portadin stated that he had no independent recollection of the events of the day in question but could \u201creview the records\u201d and give his \u201cgeneral practice\u201d based upon what he read.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">There are two issues relevant to plaintiffs\u2019 contention. The first is whether a witness can testify as to habit or customary practice in response to certain facts in order to prove conformance with that habit or custom on a particular occasion. The other is whether a defendant doctor in a medical malpractice ease can offer opinion testimony in support of his defense that he did not breach a standard of care in the treatment of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">As to the first issue, the answer is provided by <em>N.J.R.E. </em>406(a) and cases interpreting the rule. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">Evidence, whether corroborated or not, of habit or routine practice is admissible to prove that on a specific occasion a person ... acted in conformity with the habit or routine practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">In <em>Reaves v. Mandell, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 507 A.2d 807 (Law Div.1986), the defendant doctor could not recall the specifics of any conversation with plaintiff concerning the issue of informed consent, which was the focal issue of the case. Nonetheless, the court held that the doctor could testify as to information he invariably gave to patients with medical problems similar to the plaintiffs as evidence that he gave the same information to plaintiff when he obtained her consent to the operation. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>472, 507 A.2d 807. Other jurisdictions have arrived at the same result in similar settings. <em>See Bloskas v. Murray, </em>646 P.2d 907 (Colo.1982); <em>Stephen W. Brown Radiology Assocs. v. Gowers, </em>157 <em>Ga.App. </em>770, 278 <em>S.E.</em>2d 653 (1981) (holding that doctor could testify as to his own habit or custom but others could not); <em>Palinkas v. Bennett, </em>416 <em>Mass. </em>273, 620 <em>N.E.2d </em>775 (1993); <em>McCormack v. Lindberg, </em>352 N.W.2d 30 (Minn.Ct.App.1984), <em>review granted, </em>363 N.W.2d 307 (Minn.), <em>order granting review vacated, </em>373 <em>N.W.2d </em>604 (Minn.1985); <em>Rigie v. Goldman, </em>148 <em>A.D.2d </em>23, 543 N.Y.S.2d 983 (N.Y.App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Secondly, to the extent that Dr. Portadin was permitted to interpret the \u201cfetal monitoring strips\u201d or state \u201creasons why he took certain actions,\u201d and to the extent that such testimony constitutes \u201copinion\u201d testimony, we also find no error. It is well established in this state that a defendant doctor in a medical malpractice case can give opinion evidence in describing his care and treatment of the plaintiff, including any opinion the doctor may have concerning his adherence to accepted standards of care. <em>Carey v. Lovett, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>44, 64-65, 622 A.2d 1279 (1993); <em>see also Stigliano v. Connaught Lab., Inc., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>305, 312-16, 658 A.2d 715 (1995); <em>Ginsberg v. St. Michael\u2019s Hosp., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 32-33, 678 A.2d 271 (App.Div.1996) (holding that a treating physician need not be listed as an expert witness). Dr. Portadin\u2019s testimony did not violate these basic principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit certain hospital protocols into evidence. The protocols in question contained various nursing policies relating to the use of Pitocin, internal fetal monitors, and electronic monitoring in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The trial judge ruled that plaintiffs could use the hospital protocols to \u201cbuttress ... the standard of care as testified to by the [plaintiffs\u2019] experts,\u201d if the standard of care was \u201cin conformance with the protocol or manual.\u201d The judge said, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>if the protocols set forth \u201ca higher standard\u201d than that testified to by plaintiffs\u2019 experts, the \u201cprotocols and manuals ... would not be admitted.\u201d This ruling is in complete accord with <em>Morlino v. Medical Ctr. of Ocean County, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>113, 684 A.2d 944 (App.Div.1996), <em>affd as modified, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>563, 706 A.2d 721 (1998), and <em>Johnson v. Mountainside Hosp., </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 571 A.2d 318 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>188, 584 A.2d 248 (1990). Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 experts did testify concerning applicable standards of care and related those standards to portions of each of the protocols previously identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">When it came time for plaintiffs to offer the protocols into evidence, the judge observed that each of the protocols contained statements of policy that had not been mentioned in the experts\u2019 testimony and, thus, should not be considered by the jury. He indicated that the protocols could be entered into evidence if appropriately redacted. After considering the judge\u2019s suggestion, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney announced that she did not \u201csee how that can be done with these policies.\u201d The judge declined to admit the protocols into evidence reasoning that to enter the unredacted protocols \u201cwould inject about 15 or 20 new standards in this case that have not been addressed in the testimony and would simply be unfair.\u201d The judge held, however, that \u201ccomment on them would be appropriate\u201d during summation. We agree with the trial judge that not all of the policy statements made in each of the protocols were accepted by plaintiffs\u2019 experts as relevant to the issues at hand or reflective of the standard of care applicable to plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Although the judge did not specifically reference the applicable evidence rule, he was essentially holding that the admission of the unredacted protocols would result in the \u201cconfusion of issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403. A trial judge\u2019s discretion under this rule is \u201ca broad one.\u201d <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127,144, 386 A.2d 378 (1978). The decision of the trial court must stand unless it can be shown that the court \u201cpalpably abused its discretion, that is, that its finding was so wide of the mark that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>manifest denial of justice resulted.\u201d <em>State v. Carter, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>86, 106, 449 A.2d 1280 (1982); <em>Thomas v. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 582-83, 660 A.2d 1236 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>574, 667 A.2d 191 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We find no abuse of discretion in this case. Clearly, only the policies in the protocols that plaintiffs\u2019 experts identified as being in accord with the applicable standard of care were admissible. The policies standing alone did not establish a standard of care. <em>See Morlino, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 581, 706 A.2d 721 (holding that \u201c[a]llowing the admission of PDR warnings without accompanying expert testimony could transform drug manufacturers into judges of acceptable medical care\u201d). Without redaction, the jury would have had difficulty remembering what policies had been established as being in conformance with accepted standards and possibly be mislead into thinking that all of the policies contained in the three protocols were relevant on that issue. Thus, both the \u201cconfusion\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d standards of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403(a) were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Plaintiffs also contend that the trial judge erred in his instruction to the jury concerning the hospital protocols. Specifically, plaintiffs state in their brief that \u201c[i]t was error for the [c]ourt here to have limited the jury\u2019s use of those policies to standard of care and to have told the jury to disregard them if there was contrary expert testimony.\u201d As we have said earlier in this opinion, the protocols were admissible under <em>Morlino </em>only to the extent that they corroborated an applicable standard of care. To the extent that plaintiffs\u2019 reading of <em>Morlino </em>expands that concept and suggests that the protocols were also relevant \u201cto show an awareness on the part of each defendant of what they were supposed to be doing\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> beyond the applicable standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>care, we disagree. First, none of the defendants claimed lack of knowledge of the protocols or their responsibility to follow them. Second, the protocols, like the PDR in <em>Morlino, </em>cannot be used to establish a duty in addition to that which is established by expert testimony. 152 <em>N.J. </em>at 582, 706 A.2d 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">So you, as jurors, are not to speculate or guess about the standards by which the defendants should have conducted themselves in the diagnosis and treatment of Diana, rather you must determine the applicable medical and nursing standards from the testimony of the expert witness you heard \u2014 witnesses you heard in this case. And I qualified all of those persons as witnesses \u2014 or as experts----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">In this regard, let me just digress a moment, there has been discussion in this case about manuals or protocols or other standards by which the hospital wishes its employees or doctors or nurses to act, and I\u2019m not suggesting to you that those manuals and protocols are unimportant. But this is not a case about those protocols or the manuals. This is a case about a deviation from standard medical or nursing practice. It\u2019s not a case about whether every hospital policy was in every instance met. So if you heard about a protocol or a manual which is different than the testimony concerning the standard medical or nursing practice, you should rely on what your memory was as to the standard not what the protocol or manual said, because it is a deviation from the standard which would, if proved by a preponderance or greater weight of the credible evidence, would produce liability. Thank you. When there\u2019s a conflict in the testimony of medical experts, and that happens frequently. It\u2019s not infrequent that experts will disagree and have an honest disagreement on what the standard is or whether that standard was met. It is for you, the jury, to resolve that conflict using the same guidelines in determining credibility that I mentioned earlier. You are not required to accept arbitrarily the opinions of an expert simply because he or she is an expert. You should consider the expert\u2019s qualification, training, experience, as well as her understanding or his understanding of the matters to which he or she testified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The instruction must be evaluated in the context of the testimony concerning the protocols. The manner in which the case was tried focused the debate concerning what standard of care applied on the expert witnesses\u2019 interpretation of the words of the various protocols in the context of the facts of the case. Accordingly, the jury\u2019s resolution of what standard of care applied to a given issue necessitated an evaluation of the relevant protocol as well. While the plaintiffs\u2019 experts testified that some of the policy statements contained in the protocols were coordinate with their understanding of the applicable standards of care, the defense experts pointed out that the policies identified by plaintiffs\u2019 experts were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>subject to interpretation and, thus, the exercise of judgment in the context of a given patient\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">By way of example, the protocol concerning the use of internal fetal monitoring stated in part that the procedure \u201cis performed by the physician/CNM [nurse] when the external fetal heart rate tracing is uninterpretable or when the external tracing exhibits a non-reassuring pattern.\u201d The dispute among the experts over this policy statement was whether the fetal monitor strip was \u201cuninterpretable,\u201d as opposed, for example, to \u201cdiscontinuous,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and whether the external tracing was \u201cnon-reassuring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Again by way of example, plaintiffs\u2019 experts disagreed among themselves as to whether the protocol concerning the use of Pitocin represented the standard of care. The protocol in part stated that Pitocin may be increased \u201cuntil coordinate contractions are occurring every 3-4 minutes with a duration of 60 seconds[.]\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 nursing expert opined that this represented the appropriate standard. Dr. Edelberg stated, however, that the applicable standard was every \u201ctwo to three minutes or thereabouts when you\u2019re driving the uterus.\u201d In contrast, Dr. Dollinger, a defense expert, was in agreement with the policy as to the frequency of contractions but pointed out that frequency is only one factor and must be considered in the context of the duration of contractions as well. He said that the ideal duration to look for was forty-five seconds, whereas the protocol called for a duration of sixty seconds. Thus, much of the discussion in the course of the trial concerning applicable standards of care was intertwined with interpretations of words and concepts used in the protocols.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">When the instruction is read as a whole and in the context of the evidence, the judge properly focused the jury\u2019s attention on the important, disputed issue \u2014 the applicable medical and nursing standards. Further, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the judge did not tell the jurors that the protocols were irrelevant. Rather, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>properly instructed the jury to disregard any protocol that was at odds with whatever standard of care the jury decided to apply after evaluating the experts\u2019 testimony. The instruction was consistent with the principles stated in <em>Morlino </em>concerning the utilization of documents to corroborate expert witness testimony on the standard of care. 152 <em>N.J. </em>at 578, 706 A.2d 721. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Without citing any case in support of the argument, plaintiffs claim that the trial judge erred when he permitted defense counsel for Dr. Portadin to use the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference (\u201cPDR\u201d) in the cross-examination of Dr. Edelberg. The pertinent testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">Q: Doctor, I asked you a question a moment ago, did you know what the PDR, the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference, lists as the <em>dosage </em>of Pitocin that is equal <em>to the force </em>of a natural, normal labor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">A; I do not know what they list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">Q: Would you be surprised, sir, if \u2014 I just put up a couple of things here, 6 mu [six milliunits], have I left something out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">A: That would be reasonable. It depends on the response of the uterus. We talked about [oxytocin] receptors before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">Q: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-11\">A: Some women will require four times that dose to keep them in labor. Some people will be hyperstimulated at a half a milliunit. So \u2014 but six is a reasonable\u2014 or I\u2019ll accept that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-12\">Q: Okay. And let\u2019s deal with Mrs. Velazquez. What\u2019s the highest <em>dose </em>of Pitocin that she ever got?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-13\">A: Six milliunits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">Plaintiffs claim that defense counsel misrepresented what the PDR actually said. The PDR excerpt for 1990 on that point actually stated: \u201cStudies of the <em>concentrations </em>of oxytocin in the maternal plasma during Pitocin infusion have shown that infusion rates up to 6 mu/min give the same oxytocin <em>levels </em>that are found in spontaneous labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">Plaintiffs contend that defense counsel misleadingly used the word \u201cforce\u201d rather than the concept of \u201cconcentrations\u201d or \u201clev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>els\u201d as used in the PDR. However, plaintiffs fail to explain in their brief how the interchange of those concepts resulted in prejudice. Dr. Edelberg expressed no confusion in understanding the thrust of counsel\u2019s question. Indeed, he agreed with the proposition advanced by defense counsel. The witness could have declined to admit, that the PDR was authoritative or asked to see the exact statement but chose not to do so, being satisfied that counsel was expressing a concept that the witness concluded was \u201creasonable.\u201d In any event, Dr. Edelberg hastened to point out that the amount of Pitocin to be administered depends on the response of the individual patient, some women being more sensitive to the medication than others. As we see it, the plaintiffs\u2019 point was forcefully made by Dr. Edelberg \u2014 proper dosage depends on sensitivity of the individual patient and averages are not important. We see no prejudice at all resulting from the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The judge offered to allow plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to read the sentence from the PDR that we have quoted above, but she declined. Instead, counsel asked for permission to read \u201ceverything that\u2019s relevant\u201d from the PDR. The judge denied the request. He was correct in doing so. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(18); <em>Jacober v. St. Peter\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>475, 608 A.2d 304 (1992). Because plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the cross-examination and because the PDR was not independently admissible, the judge did not err in failing to strike the testimony, refusing the introduction of a copy of the PDR into evidence, or requiring Dr. Portadin\u2019s defense counsel to bear the cost of recalling Dr. Edelberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Plaintiffs also claim that they were surprised by defense counsel\u2019s use of the PDR. They claim that had they known of counsel\u2019s intention they could have used other statements in the PDR to buttress their expert\u2019s testimony. Undoubtedly that is so. However, plaintiffs do not cite us to an interrogatory, discovery order, court rule, or evidence rule that required such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Lastly, plaintiffs contend that the judge erred in giving the standard Model Jury Charge because this case was one in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>which judgment was not an issue. The instructions given were those that were revised as a result of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Morlino. </em>The Supreme Court generally approved of those instructions with a recommendation that the Supreme Court Committee on Model Jury Charges, Civil, again review the charge to \u201cdetermine whether fewer than eleven references to judgment adequately will communicate to the jury that medicine is not an exact science and that physicians and surgeons must exercise judgment.\u201d 152 <em>N.J. </em>at 590, 706 A.2d 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We would have no hesitation in finding error in this case if we believed the jury had a clear-cut choice between applicable standards and once having decided the applicable standard there was no medical or nursing judgment allowed. <em>Patton v. Amblo, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 713 A.2d 1051 (App.Div.1998). We briefly recited some examples of the testimony concerning applicable standards and the judgments that had to be made by both the nurses and defendant doctor in complying with those standards in the discussion of the issue presented in part VII of this opinion. Those examples are, in our view, a fair representation of the nature of the expert testimony concerning other discreet issues on the subject of the defendants\u2019 liability. In our view, the exercise of judgment in this case was focal to the jury\u2019s determination of fault. Accordingly, we find no error in the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-16\">A11 subsequent references to \"plaintiff\" in the singular shall be to Barbara Velazquez, the mother of Diana Velazquez.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> Plaintiff is a Polish-American; her husband and Diana are Hispanic-Americans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\"> As to the two black jurors who were excused by defendant Cinotti, no explanation was required of counsel and none was offered at the time of trial.
