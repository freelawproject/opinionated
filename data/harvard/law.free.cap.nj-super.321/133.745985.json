The first count alleged that plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment and ultimately demoted because of his sensitivity to second-hand smoke, which plaintiff contends is a \u201chandicap\u201d within the intent of the LAD. The second count alleged that plaintiff was subjected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>a hostile work environment as a result of a series of anti-Semitic comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In March 1992, plaintiff began his employment with defendant Monmouth County at the County\u2019s reclamation center as a weigh-master. He alleges that before he began his employment, he told his supervisors that he was \u201cextremely sensitive\u201d to smoke. Plaintiff alleges that he satisfactorily completed a one month trial period, but shortly thereafter he began experiencing difficulty with the smoke he was forced to encounter on the job. He protested to his supervisor, defendant Kyle Dodig, who attempted to address the problem. Dodig and plaintiff\u2019s other supervisors posted \u201cno smoking\u201d signs and arranged a schedule under which two of the four booths where weighmasters worked were designated \u201cnon smoking.\u201d Although plaintiff was assigned to those booths on a regular basis, he claims there were frequent occasions when other employees scheduled to work with him did not appear and substitutes were provided, many of whom smoked in the designated non-smoking weighmaster booths. In addition, many employees ignored the \u201cno smoking\u201d signs, and plaintiff alleges his superiors made no sustained effort to enforce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Plaintiff also alleges that a series of anti-Semitic comments at the reclamation center created a hostile work environment. Plaintiff states that although he is \u201cnot a practicing Jew,\u201d his mother was born to \u201cparents who practice the Jewish religion\u201d and that, accordingly, under strict Judaic law he is Jewish. He also alleges that his last name and alleged \u201cSemitic physical appearance\u201d led other employees at the reclamation center to assume he was Jewish, and that he was \u201cthe subject of many anti-Semitic actions such as the use of anti-Semitic slurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">While plaintiff allegedly experienced difficulty with the effects of smoking by coworkers and anti-Semitic comments, his job performance produced a number of adverse reports and negative evaluations by his superiors. Between October 1992 and April 1993 he was disciplined four times: for closing his scale early, for arguing with another employee over smoking, and on two occasions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>making calculation errors. In May 1993, a number of coworkers complained about his failure to work hard enough and having offensive body odor. In August 1993, when plaintiff complained that he had been distracted by adverse actions of a coworker, he failed to collect a payment from a customer. As a result he was told the next day that he was terminated as a weighmaster and would be reassigned as a laborer. He said he accepted the transfer \u201cvoluntarily\u201d because he thought he had no alternative. He also says he was promised the transfer would not involve a salary reduction but in fact his salary was reduced. He grieved that issue through his union but was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The trial court concluded that sensitivity to second-hand cigarette smoke does not constitute a handicap under the LAD. In addition, the court concluded that plaintiff had not presented satisfactory evidence that he is hypersensitive to cigarette smoke. The court also rejected plaintiffs claim that he had been subject to a hostile work environment because of a pattern of anti-Semitic comments, concluding that plaintiff could not maintain this claim because he is not Jewish. Moreover, the court concluded that even if plaintiff had been Jewish, the comments were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to support a hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">We conclude that an alleged hypersensitivity to secondhand cigarette smoke, which is not related to any recognized medical condition, does not constitute a handicap within the intent of the LAD. We also conclude that the alleged anti-Semitic comments made to plaintiff or in plaintiffs presence were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a discriminatory hostile work environment. Accordingly, we affirm the summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The LAD defines \u201chandicapped\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">suffering from a physical disability, infirmity, malformation or disfigurement which is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness ... or from any mental, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>psychological or developmental disability resulting from anatomical, psychological, physiological or neurological conditions which prevents the normal exercise of any bodily or mental functions or is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>10:5 \u2014 5(q).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int'l Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 594, 538 A.2d 794 (1988), the Court concluded, on the basis of expert medical testimony, that \u201can alcoholic might suffer from either a \u2018physical disability [or] infirmity ... which is caused by illness,\u2019 or from a \u2018mental [or] psychological ... disability resulting from psychological, physiological or neurological conditions which ... is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by accepted clinical or, laboratory diagnostic techniques,\u2019 <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-5(q), or both,\u201d and thus \u201calcoholism is a handicap within the [LAD].\u201d However, the Court also concluded that Clowes had failed to present adequate medical proof that he was an alcoholic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">Conspicuously absent from the record is any testimony from a treating or examining physician that Clowes had been diagnosed as an alcoholic. Given the complexity of the many diagnostic procedures involved, expert medical testimony is required to establish the fact of the employee\u2019s alcoholism:...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">The only evidence in the record regarding Clowes\u2019s alleged alcoholism is his own assertion that he was an alcoholic, and a partial medical record from his hospitalization at Princeton House---- Clowes\u2019s admission that he was an alcoholic, along</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">with his. testimony regarding his drinking habits, is insufficient to prove that he suffered from this disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the hospital records tend to prove a diagnosis of alcoholism, there is no competent and legal evidence in the record to support such a diagnosis. Absent such evidence, the hearsay medical records alone are not sufficient to sustain a finding that Clowes was an alcoholic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 597-99, 538 A.2d 794.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-12\"><em>See also Gimello v. Agency Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc., </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>338, 361-62, 594 A.2d 264 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\"><em>Clowes </em>compels an affirmance of the dismissal of plaintiffs handicap discrimination claim. Plaintiff failed to present any medical evidence that hypersensitivity to second-hand smoke is a recognized medical condition or that he suffers from a such a condition. The only medical evidence plaintiff presented in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>from a Dr. Gary Gross, addressed \u201cTo whom it may concern,\u201d which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">Thirty-six year old Mr. Heitzman was seen for complaints of cigarette smoke related symptoms. He is quite sensitive to smoke exposure which causes difficulty breathing, coughing, sorethroat, nasal irritation and frequent ear infections. Unfortunately he has had to work closely with smokers at various positions at the Monmouth County Reclamation Center despite a no smoking policy. I would strongly recommend that Mr. Heitzman be allowed to work away from smokers even if it means he be transferred to another county agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">This letter does not constitute the kind of evidence which could support a handicap discrimination claim under the LAD. First, we note that the letter is dated November 18, 1996, which was more than three years after plaintiff was transferred out of his position at the reclamation center. Consequently, the letter has only limited probative value concerning any medical condition plaintiff may have suffered while he worked at that facility. Furthermore, the letter does not assert that plaintiffs sensitivity to second-hand smoke is \u201ccaused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness.\u201d It does not assert, for example, that plaintiff suffers from asthma, emphysema or any other pulmonary disease which could make a person especially sensitive to smoke. The letter only states that plaintiff is \u201cquite sensitive to smoke exposure\u201d which causes the described difficulties. Although plaintiff argues that an opinion that his problems are \u201ccaused by bodily injury\u201d or by \u201cillness\u201d is implicit in the letter, we see no reason why, if that were the doctor\u2019s opinion, he could not have simply said in unequivocal language that plaintiff suffers a \u201cphysical disability\u201d and that the disability is \u201ccaused by bodily injury ... or illness.\u201d In addition, the doctor\u2019s conclusions rest entirely on plaintiffs subjective \u201ccomplaints of cigarette smoke related symptoms.\u201d The letter does not refer to any tests or examinations which showed the existence of a pulmonary condition or allergy that would provide a medical explanation for plaintiffs complaints. Consequently, Dr. Gross\u2019 letter falls far short of the kind of expert medical opinion required to support a handicap discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Plaintiff also argues that even if he does not suffer from any actual \u201chandicap\u201d as defined under the LAD, the trial court should have denied summary judgment because he presented evidence that defendants perceived he suffers from a handicap. <em>See Rogers v. Campbell Foundry Co., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109,112, 447 A.2d 589 (App.Div.) (\u201c[TJhose perceived as suffering from a particular handicap are as much within the protected class as those who are actually handicapped.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>529, 453 A.2d 852 (1982). However, there is no evidence that defendants\u2019 efforts to respond to plaintiff\u2019s complaints about second-hand smoke reflected their perception that he is a handicapped person within the intent of the LAD. Rather, defendants\u2019 actions appear to have been simply a well-meaning effort to ameliorate a condition about which plaintiff had complained. If such efforts were found to constitute an admission that plaintiff was considered to be handicapped, it could have the unfortunate consequence of discouraging employers from making voluntary efforts to address employee complaints about working conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Therefore, we affirm the summary judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s handicap discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The second count of plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that he was subjected to a hostile work environment because of a series of anti-Semitic comments. Initially, we are satisfied that plaintiff falls within a protected class under the LAD even though he does not claim to be a practicing Jew. Because plaintiff\u2019s mother was Jewish, he may maintain a claim of discrimination on the basis of ancestry regardless of his religion. Moreover, even if plaintiff were not actually Jewish, he could pursue a claim under the LAD because there is evidence defendants perceived him to be Jewish. <em>See Rogers v. Campbell Foundry Co., supra, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 112, 447 A.2d 589; <em>Poff v. Caro, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 377-78, 549 A.2d 900 (Law Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Plaintiff asserts only a hostile work environment claim. He does not allege that he was demoted or that any other adverse employment action was taken against him because of his ancestry or defendants\u2019 perception of his ancestry and/or religion. Furthermore, plaintiff is no longer employed and has no interest in becoming reemployed by Monmouth County. Consequently, he does not seek any form of equitable relief. As his counsel confirmed at oral argument, plaintiff seeks solely compensatory damages for the pain, suffering and humiliation he claims to have suffered as a result of an alleged discriminatory hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">At his deposition, plaintiff identified eight comments he considered to be anti-Semitic upon which he grounds his hostile work environment claim. Plaintiff testified that when he told his supervisor, Dodig, and a coworker that he was going to the Catskills on his vacation, the coworker said, \u201cOh, the Jewish Alps.\u201d Plaintiff also alleged that when Dodig saw a load of yarmulkes spill out of a garbage truck, he laughingly referred to them as \u201call those skullcaps.\u201d On another occasion, a coworker who played golf complained that a particular country club \u201cwas barred to anyone but Jews.\u201d Plaintiff also testified that Dodig asked him whether he ate \u201cham, bacon or pork\u201d and inquired several times about what he was doing on Friday nights. In addition, plaintiff overheard Dodig tell a coworker about a Jewish real estate salesman who tried to sell him a condominium which Dodig thought was close to the reclamation center. When Dodig asked the salesman whether the housing complex was \u201cclose to the dump,\u201d the salesman said it was a mile away, which Dodig laughingly described as \u201ca Jewish mile.\u201d On another occasion, plaintiff overheard Dodig describe his own girlfriend as a \u201cJew bitch.\u201d Finally, a coworker named Kitzman once said to plaintiff: \u201c[I]f Hitler was alive, he would make a lamp shade out of [you].\u201d Plaintiff admitted that he never complained to anyone about any of these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The leading New Jersey cases dealing with hostile work environment discrimination claims are <em>Lehmann v. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 626 A.2d 445 (1993) and <em>Taylor v. Metzger, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>490, 706 A.2d 685 (1998). In <em>Lehmann, </em>the Court held that to prove a hostile work environment sexual harassment case under the LAD, a plaintiff must show \u201cconduct that occurred because of her sex and that a reasonable woman would consider sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.\u201d 132 <em>N.J. </em>at 603, 626 A.2d 445. In <em>Taylor, </em>the Court held that the same standard applies to other types of hostile work environment discrimination claims, such as those involving racial discrimination or, as in this case, ancestry. 152 <em>N.J. </em>at 498, 706 A.2d 685; <em>see also Leonard v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 343-44, 723 A.2d 1007 (App.Div.1999). This standard \u201cconforms to the standard for establishing workplace [discriminatory] harassment under federal Title VII law\u201d adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>57, 67, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2399, 2405, 91 L.Ed.2d 49, 60 (1986). <em>Taylor, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 498, 706 A.2d 685. Consequently, our courts have relied upon federal court decisions under Title VII in reviewing hostile work environment discrimination claims. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 499-507, 706 A.2d 685; <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 600-01, 607-08, 618-19, 622-23, 626 A.2d 445; <em>Muench v. Township of Haddon, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>288, 295-302, 605 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">In <em>Lehmann, </em>the Court held that an employer is strictly liable for equitable relief to remediate any discriminatory hostile environment found in the workplace. 132 <em>N.J. </em>at 616-17, 626 A.2d 445. However, a claim for compensatory damages is governed by \u201cagency principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 626 A.2d 445.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under these principles, \u201can employer whose supervisory employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment [is] liable for the supervisor\u2019s conduct in creating a hostile work environment,\u201d <em>ibid., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>and \u201ceven in the more common situation in which the supervisor is acting outside the scope of his or her employment, the employer will be liable in most cases for the supervisor\u2019s behavior under the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 219(2) [of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>].2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619-20, 626 A.2d 445. An employer is generally liable for a hostile work environment created by a supervisor because the power an employer delegates to a supervisor \u201cto control the day-to-day working environment\u201d facilitates the harassing conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 620, 626 <em>A.</em>2d 445; <em>see Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But under agency principles, an employer is not generally liable for harassing conduct by coworkers, \u201c[b]ecause employers do not entrust mere co-employees with any significant authority with which they might harass a victim.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1027,1032 (7th Cir.1998). Consequently, when a coworker engages in harassing conduct, the employer is liable only if \u201cmanagement-level employees knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, about the campaign of harassment.\u201d <em>Hunter v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., </em>797 <em>F.2d </em>1417, 1421 (7th Cir.1986); <em>see also </em>1 Barbara Lindenmann &amp; Paul Grossman, <em>Employment Discrimination Law </em>822 (3d ed. 1996) (An employer is liable for the harassing conduct of a coworker \u201conly if it had actual or constructive notice of the harassment and failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action.\u201d). Moreover, it has been recognized that an employer \u201cis unlikely to know or have reason to know of casual, isolated, and infrequent slurs.\u201d <em>Hunter, supra, </em>797 <em>F. </em>2d at 1422.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Applying these principles, we conclude that Monmouth County cannot be held liable for compensatory damages for the alleged statement to plaintiff that \u201cif Hitler were alive, he would make a lampshade out of [you].\u201d The person who allegedly made this comment, Joseph Kitzman, was not one of plaintiffs supervisors but rather a coworker. Moreover, plaintiff did not present evidence that anyone overheard Kitzman\u2019s comment, and plaintiff admittedly did not tell his supervisors about the comment. Therefore, unlike in <em>Lehmann </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>both of which involved alleged discriminatory harassing conduct by supervisory employees, we can perceive of no basis for concluding that Kitzman was acting within the scope of his employment when he allegedly uttered this anti-Semitic comment or that Monmouth County could be found vicariously liable for Kitzman\u2019s comment under any of the subsections of section 219(2) of the <em>Restatement (Second) of </em>Agency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>We turn to the question whether a reasonable person of plaintiffs ancestry would consider the alleged anti-Semitic comments made by or in the presence of plaintiffs supervisors to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. Under this standard, a hostile work environment discrimination claim cannot be established by epithets or comments which are \u201cmerely offensive.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>17, 21, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>367, 370, 126 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>295, 302 (1993). An employment discrimination law such as the LAD is not intended to be \u201ca \u2018general civility\u2019 code\u201d for conduct in the workplace. <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2283-84, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 677 (quoting <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </em>523 <em>U.S. </em>75,-, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>998, 1002, 140 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>201, 207 (1998)). \u201c[Discourtesy or rudeness should not be confused with racial [or ethnic] harassment,\u201d and \u201ca lack of racial [or ethnic] sensitivity does not, alone, amount to actionable harassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2283,141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 676 (quoting Lindemann &amp; Grossman, <em>supra, </em>at 349). Thus, \u201c \u2018simple teasing,\u2019 offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the \u2018terms and conditions of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2283, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 676 (citation omitted). \u201c[C]onduet must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2284, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 677. Ultimately, \u201cwhether an environment is \u2018hostile\u2019 or \u2018abusive\u2019 can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances,\u201d which \u201cmay include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a merely offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Harris, supra, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>at 23, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 371, 126 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 302-03; <em>see also Taylor, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 706 A.2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">We are convinced that no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the anti-Semitic comments which were allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>made to plaintiff by or in the presence of his supervisors were so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person of Jewish ancestry would believe that the .conditions of employment had been altered and that the working environment was hostile or abusive. Even viewing the evidence most favorably to plaintiff, as required on a motion for summary judgment, <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), most of the comments upon which plaintiff grounds his hostile work environment discrimination claim, such as the inquiries about what he was doing on Friday nights and his dietary habits, the reference to plaintiff\u2019s vacation destination as the \u201cJewish Alps,\u201d the comment about the country club which excluded non-Jews, and the characterization of Yarmulkes as \u201cskullcaps,\u201d were at worst \u201cteasing\u201d remarks which were not sufficiently extreme to create an abusive or hostile workplace. His supervisor Dodig\u2019s characterization of his own girlfriend as a \u201cJew bitch\u201d and his comment about a \u201cJewish mile\u201d were both directed at other persons. Although a reasonable person of Jewish ancestry undoubtedly would find these comments to be offensive, a derogatory comment about another person generally does not have the same sting as an ethnic slur directed at a minority group member. <em>Cf. Taylor, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 506, 706 A.2d 685 (noting that one of circumstances which supported the Court\u2019s conclusion that a racial slur was sufficiently severe to alter the conditions of employment was that it was \u201cdirected against\u201d plaintiff). Moreover, the comments were sporadic and casual, and did not involve any physical threat or humiliation or any direct interference with plaintiff\u2019s work performance. <em>See Harris, supra, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>at 23, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 371, 126 L.Ed.2d at 302-03. Consequently, these offensive comments did not rise to the level required to demonstrate a discriminatory hostile work environment. <em>See id. </em>at 21-23, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 370-71, 126 L.Ed.2d at 301-03; <em>Adusumilli v.

Instead, the first time this grievance surfaced was when plaintiff filed this lawsuit. Therefore, the absence of any contemporaneous evidence that plaintiff actually considered his working environment to be discriminatorily hostile or abusive reinforces our conclusion that, viewed objectively, the alleged anti-Semitic comments of plaintiffs supervisors were not sufficiently severe or pervasive for a trier of fact to find that plaintiffs working environment was hostile or abusive. <em>See Taylor, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 507, 706 A.2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\"> The Court in <em>Lehmann </em>also held that punitive damages may be recovered against an employer for a discriminatory hostile work environment \"only in the event of actual participation by upper management or wilful indifference.\u201d 132 <em>N.J. </em>at 625, 626 <em>A.2d </em>445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-6\"> This subsection of the <em>Restatement </em>states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">A master is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment, unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">(a) the master intended the conduct or the consequences, or</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">(b) the master was negligent or reckless, or</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">(c) the conduct violated a non-delegable duty of the master, or</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">(d) the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency r elation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b173-12\"> The Supreme Court of the United States has held that an employer\u2019s vicarious liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2000e to el7, for a discriminatory hostile work environment created by a supervisor is also governed by the principles set forth in \u00a7 219(2). <em>Burlington Indus., Inc. v.

However, I disagree with the conclusion that \u201cthe alleged anti-Semitic comments made to plaintiff or in plaintiffs presence were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a discriminatory hostile work environment.\u201d Accordingly, I dissent from the affirmance of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of that portion of plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">In <em>Lehmann v. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 606-07, 626 A.2d 445 (1993), a sexual harassment case, the Supreme Court specifically rejected a requirement that one claiming a hostile work environment must show a \u201cregular and pervasive\u201d pattern of misbehavior. Rather, the Court adopted a disjunctive test: the objectionable conduct must be <em>either </em>\u201csevere or pervasive\u201d and a showing of one or the other will suffice to demonstrate a hostile workplace. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 626 A.2d 445. Thus the Court noted that, while such a case would probably be \u201crare and extreme\u201d, it is possible that one single incident could be \u201cso severe that it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>... make the working environment hostile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606-07, 626 A.2d 445. However, the more frequent pattern, it said, would probably consist of \u201cnumerous incidents that, if considered individually, would be insufficiently severe to state a claim, but considered together are sufficiently pervasive to make the work environment intimidating or hostile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><em>Taylor v. Metzger, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>490, 706 A.2d 685 (1998), where the Court held that the <em>Lehmann </em>analysis applied to racial or ethnic discrimination as well as sexual harassment, is an example of the first, or \u201crare and extreme\u201d, kind of discrimination: a single comment which was so insulting and abusive that, by itself, it caused \u201cthe environment to become hostile and abusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502-03, 706 A.2d 685. This case is the converse of <em>Taylor v. Metzger. </em>It represents the more frequent pattern described by the Court, where no single incident would be sufficient to justify a finding of a hostile workplace, but the pervasive pattern of antiSemitic comments, taken together, is more than sufficient to justify such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The majority acknowledges that the comments aimed at plaintiff were anti-Semitic, and also seem to acknowledge that \u201ca reasonable person of Jewish ancestry undoubtedly would find [at least some of] these comments to be offensive.\u201d Nevertheless, it concludes that the remarks were \u201cat worst \u2018teasing1 remarks\u201d which were not sufficiently extreme to create an abusive or hostile workplace. I find that characterization unwarranted, since I believe a reasonable jury could well conclude that plaintiff had been subjected to a most unpleasant, most hostile, and grossly abusive workplace which he should not have been required to tolerate.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Obviously, questions about one\u2019s diet, or intended activities on Friday night, when made by friends in a friendly manner, could be harmless and even pleasant. Similarly, \u201cteasing,\u201d in a pleasant, non-malicious manner could also be pleasant or, at most, harmless. But that is not what is involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Throughout his deposition, plaintiff maintained that supervisor Dodig was anti-Semitic and Dodig\u2019s comments and attempts at humor were delivered in that context. For example, plaintiff maintained that Dodig\u2019s inquiries as to what plaintiff intended to do on a Friday night were regular and pervasive. As plaintiff described them,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">He would give me a hard time about different things, and a lot of times he would, you know be on my case, like on a Friday. And he would have me all worked up and everything, and Kyle [Dodig] knew exactly what he was doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">Q. And you regarded that inquiry, what are you doing tonight, to be antiSemitism?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">A. Yes, I did. Being that it came from the mouth of Kyle Dodig, and because of all the other anti-Semitic things that he said or engaged in prior to those different Fridays where I was questioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Most of the comments cited by plaintiff, and acknowledged by the majority, involved some attempt at humor or sarcasm premised on some alleged unattractive characteristic ascribed to Jews \u2014 and to plaintiff because he was (or was assumed to be) Jewish. And there were a considerable number of such comments. The Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthere is neither a threshold \u2018magic number\u2019 of harassing incidents that gives rise, without more, to liability as a matter of law nor a number of incidents below which a plaintiff fails as a matter of law to state a claim.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Metzger, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 706 A.2d 685. However, the number of offensive incidents is certainly relevant to the question of whether they are so pervasive as to create a hostile or abusive work environment. One or two such incidents should probably be overlooked as constituting nothing more than bad manners. Three would seem to be stretching things and four would seem to exceed reasonable tolerance \u2014 or, to repeat the critical point, at least a jury could so find. Here we had eight or nine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>I do not understand the reasoning which leads the majority to conclude that no reasonable trier of fact could find that such pervasive conduct created a \u201chostile or abusive\u201d working environment. In fact, I see every reason why one in plaintiff\u2019s position might well conclude, quite reasonably, that he was being required to work in a hostile and abusive environment. If Dodig was what plaintiff says he was; if Dodig said what plaintiff claims he said, as often as plaintiff says he did, and in the manner plaintiff describes, it seems to me that virtually anyone in plaintiff\u2019s position would regard that environment as \u201chostile and abusive\u201d. Or, to return again to the central point, at least a reasonable jury could so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">I see no reason why plaintiff should be required to tolerate what plaintiff says he was exposed to here. LAD may not have legislated against \u201cdiscourtesy or rudeness\u201d, or adopted a \u201cgeneral civility code\u201d but it did outlaw a workplace in which one is required to live with and endure ethnic slurs of the quality and frequency with which Dodig and his associates belabored plaintiff. Plaintiff should not be required to accept such conduct any more than an African-American should be required to tolerate anti-black jokes or a woman tolerate a pattern of sexist humor or snide sexual remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The majority purports to distinguish between hostile, antiSemitic and abusive comments on the one hand, and harmless teasing or a simple lack of civility on the other. There certainly is a difference between the two. However, whether comments constitute one or the other will frequently depend on subtle shadings and variances in the manner in which things are said, the relationship between the speaker and the target of the \u201chumor\u201d, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>entire panoply of facts \u2014 the surrounding circumstances \u2014 in which the comments are made.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Here, plaintiff and Dodig were not friends. Plaintiff described as best he could \u2014 and with considerable clarity \u2014 the anti-Semitism with which Dodig\u2019s comments (and those of the others) were laden. He explained why he found those comments objectionable, and why they did not constitute the harmless joshing which the majority hypothesizes. He submitted a reasonable, rational claim. Whether a reasonable Jewish person in his position would have considered the workplace hostile or abusive is a question that should be referred to, and decided by, a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Ethnic or sexist humor has little to commend it. The majority acknowledges that it is frequently offensive. While I certainly do not advocate outlawing it, I do not believe we need be overly solicitous in preserving and protecting it. The Supreme Court\u2019s comment on that point in <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 612, 626 A.2d 445 (although said there in relation to a sex harassment claim) is on point and profound:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">... LAD is <em>remedial </em>legislation. Its very purpose is to change existing standards of conduct. Thus, the reasonableness requirement must not be used to hold that the prevailing level of discrimination is <em>per se </em>reasonable, or that a reasonable <em>woman </em>would <em>expect </em>sexual harassment on <em>entering </em>a historically male-dominated workplace. The LAD is designed to remediate conditions of hostility and discrimination, not to preserve and immunize pre-existing hostile work environments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">I would reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs claim of a LAD violation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\"> The majority refers to eight incidents. My count is nine. While the ugly remark about Hitler and a lamp shade may not be actionable because it was not made by or in the presence of plaintiff\u2019s superior, I believe that comment should be considered in weighing the impact of the other statements which were made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>by or in the presence of a superior \u2014 particularly since plaintiff claimed that his superiors knew that Kitzman, who make the remark, was an anti-Semite.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">Further, the count of eight or nine incidents treats the comments about diet and Sabbath observances as constituting one incident each. In fact, plaintiff maintained that such comments were made a number of times, and thus, according to plaintiff, there were actually considerably more than eight or nine distinct incidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
