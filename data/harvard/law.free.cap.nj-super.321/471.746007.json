(temporarily assigned)</author>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">In this workers\u2019 compensation case, petitioner, Donna Zahner, appeals from entry of an order dismissing her claim petition on the basis the accident did not \u201carise out of and in the course of\u2019 her employment with respondent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">On December 11, 1996 petitioner was working a four-hour shift as a part-time cashier at the Pathmark food store on Route 35 in Hazlet, New Jersey. Petitioner \u201cpunched out\u201d and remained in the store to go food shopping for her mother. She proceeded to the back of the store where she saw her friends and fellow employees, T.J. and Dan, working in the Deli section. After briefly speaking with them, petitioner went to the fish department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>which was closed. After briefly speaking to the employee assigned to the fish department counter petitioner turned around, slipped and fell on the brown-tiled floor. Petitioner stated she slipped on a thin layer of water which came from the fish department. The water on the floor was caused by the cleaning done by the fish department employee, who used a hose to clean the area. After her fall, petitioner \u201cjust walked away\u201d and finished her shopping. Petitioner then went to the front of the store to \u201ccash out\u201d and left to go home but did not inform anyone at the store of her fall. From the time she punched out to the time she fell on the floor in the fish department, petitioner did not leave the Pathmark store.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">On December 23,1996 petitioner filed a Workers\u2019 Compensation claim petition seeking compensation for injuries which resulted from the slip-and-fall on December 11, 1996 at the store of respondent, Pathmark Inc. Petitioner\u2019s alleged injuries included headaches, pain in her neck, right arm, right leg, right shoulder, lower back, and right hand and fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">On February 4, 1997 Pathmark filed an answer to the claim petition contending the alleged incident did not arise out of or in the course of petitioner\u2019s employment. On March 18, 1997 Judge Boyle conducted a hearing where petitioner testified concerning the December 11,1996 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">On April 7, 1997 respondent filed a motion to dismiss the claim petition for failure to prove the accident arose out of or in the course of petitioner\u2019s employment. Petitioner filed opposition to respondent\u2019s motion, asserting her injuries did occur during the course of her employment with respondent. On April 21, 1998 Judge Boyle entered an order dismissing petitioner\u2019s claim petition with prejudice for failure to establish the accident arose out of and in the course of her employment with respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">On appeal, petitioner contends her injury occurred in the course of her employment and was improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Petitioner argues the judge mistakenly applied the law to the facts of the present case. When an error in fact-finding of a judge or administrative agency is alleged, the scope of appellate review is limited. The appellate court will decide whether the findings made could reasonably have been reached from the \u201csufficient\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d credible evidence present in the record, considering the proof as a whole, giving \u201cdue regard\u201d to the ability of the fact-finder to judge credibility. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965); <em>De Angelo v. Alsan Masons, Inc., </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 89-90, 299 A.2d 90 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>581, 303 A.2d 883 (1973). The appellate court has the power to review the factual determinations of a trial court for any cause, criminal or civil, involving issues of fact not determined by the verdict of a jury and to make new or amended findings, but deference must be given to the determinations of the trial judge. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 158-59, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). Appellate review does not consist of weighing evidence anew and making independent factual findings; rather, the function is to determine whether there is adequate evidence to support the judgment rendered below. <em>Id. </em>at 161, 199 A.2d 809. Deference is given to those findings of the trial judge which are substantially influenced by his or her opportunity to hear and see witnesses and to have the feel of the case. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cWhen the reviewing court is satisfied that the findings meet this criterion, its task is complete and it should not disturb the result, even though it has the feeling it might have reached a different conclusion were it the trial tribunal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162,199 A.2d 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">However, \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Tp. Committee, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). Here, the facts are not in dispute. Petitioner contends these facts support a finding an injury was caused to her \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d with respondent. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>34:15-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The language of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act must be liberally construed in favor of employees. <em>Cannuscio v.

Campus Chefs, Div. of CVI Service, Inc., </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 343, 498 A.2d 1274 (App.Div.1985). The Supreme Court has emphasized the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial social legislation that should be liberally construed in order that its beneficent purposes are accomplished. <em>Cannuscio, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 349, 725 A.2d 135 (citing <em>Shaudys v.

Worker\u2019s Compensation Act \u201cemployment is deemed to commence when an employee arrives at the employer\u2019s place of employment to report for work and terminates when the employee leaves the employer\u2019s place of employment, excluding areas not under the control of the employer.\u201d N.J.S.A 34:15-36. This definition describing when employment begins and ends is known as the \u201cpremises rule\u201d and it distinguishes between an accident that occurred on the employer\u2019s premises and one that did not. <em>Cannuscio, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 350, 725 A.2d 135; <em>Ramos v. M.F. Fashions, Inc., </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>583,591, 713 A.2d 486 (1998). The pivotal questions under the premises rule are (1) where was the situs of the accident, and (2) did the employer have control of the property on which the accident occurred? <em>Cannuscio, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 350, 725 A.2d 135; <em>Kristiansen v. Morgan, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>298, 317, 708 A.2d 1173 (1998). \u201cControl\u201d as it is defined in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act differs from control in the \u201cformal property law sense\u201d since it is more expansive. <em>Cannuscio, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 350, 725 A.2d 135; <em>Ramos v. M.F. Fashions, Inc., </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 592, 713 A.2d 486 (1998)(citing <em>Livingstone v. Abraham &amp; Straus, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>89, 105, 543 A.2d 45 (1988))(finding control under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act despite the absence of control according to property law).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-1, the petitioner\u2019s injury must also arise \u201cout of\u2019 the employment. For an accident to arise \u201cout of\u2019 the employment the risk of the accident \u201cmust be of such a nature\u201d that it \u201cmight have been contemplated by a reasonable person when entering the employment, as incidental to [that employment].\u201d <em>Sparrow v. La Cachet, Inc., </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 306, 702 A.2d 503 (App.Div.l997)(citing <em>Coleman, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>285, 289, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986))(quoting <em>Rafferty v. Dairymen\u2019s League Coop. Ass\u2019n, </em>16 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>363, 366, 200 A. 493 (Dep\u2019t of Labor, Workmen\u2019s Comp. Bureau 1938)). \u201cA risk is incidental to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>employment when it belongs to or is connected with what a workman has to do in fulfilling his contract of service.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Regarding the \u201cconnection\u201d between the injury and employment, New Jersey uses the \u201cbut for\u201d or positional-risk test. <em>Coleman, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 520 A./2d 1341 (1986). Under this test, the court must determine whether it is probably more true than not that the injury would have occurred during the time and place of employment rather than somewhere else. <em>Id. </em>at 290-91, 520 A.2d 1341. Unless it is more probable that the injury would not have occurred under the circumstances of everyday life outside the employment, the necessary causal connection does not exist. <em>Id. </em>at 291, 520 A.2d 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In applying the \u201cbut for\u201d test, the Supreme Court has identified three categories of risk which may result in an accident arising \u201cout of\u2019 employment: (1) risks \u201cdistinctly associated\u201d with the employment, such as an employee getting fingers caught in a machine; (2) \u201cneutral\u201d risks, such as an employee struck by lightning; and (3) risks that are \u201cpersonal\u201d to the employee, such as a non-work related heart attack. <em>Sparrow, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 306, 702 A.2d 503 (citing <em>Coleman, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 290-92, 520 A.2d 1341). Accidents which are a result of \u201cdistinctly associated\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d risks are compensable while accidents resulting from \u201cpersonal\u201d risks are non-compensable. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cPersonal\u201d risks include those risks which arise from the \u201cpersonal proclivities\u201d of the employee and have a \u201cminimal\u201d connection to the employment. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 702 A.2d 503 (citing <em>Coleman, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 292, 520 A.2d 1341)(quoting <em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Restaurant Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>72, 85,135 A.2d 161 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In <em>Chen v. Federated Dept. Stores Inc., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 337, 489 A.2d 719 (App.Div.1985), petitioner was employed as a salesperson at respondent\u2019s store, Abraham &amp; Straus. On petitioner\u2019s lunch break she was shopping in respondent\u2019s store, tripped on a clothes hanger and was injured. <em>Ibid. </em>We held injuries occurring on the employer\u2019s premises during a regular lunch hour arise \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 489 A.2d 719. We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>stated a different case is presented if a lunch-break injury occurs in an area of the employer\u2019s premises where the employee is not permitted. <em>Ibid. </em>We further noted the fact petitioner was shopping did not sever the relationship between employment and her injury because her shopping was both convenient and beneficial to her employer. <em>Ibid. </em>We ruled lunchtime shopping is \u201can on-premises activity that benefits the employer and should not militate against compensability.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In <em>Sparrow, 305 N.J.Super. </em>at 303, 702 A.2d 503, petitioner was a beautician employed by respondent, La Cachet, Inc. One morning she reported for work and was informed there were no customers to serve and she could go home. <em>Ibid. </em>Petitioner told the owner of La Cachet she was going on vacation and asked if she could get a facial. <em>Ibid. </em>During the facial, the machine operated by an employee of La Cachet emitted scalding water and steam injuring petitioner. <em>Ibid. </em>Regarding whether petitioner\u2019s injury occurred during the course of her employment, we noted prior decisions construed the test of compensability quite expansively and found petitioner\u2019s injuries occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 her employment. <em>Id. </em>at 305-06, 702 A.2d 503. However, we also held petitioner\u2019s injuries did not arise \u201cout of\u2019 her employment. <em>Id. </em>at 306-07, 702 A.2d 503. In reaching that decision we found the accident arose from a \u201cpersonal risk,\u201d because petitioner had a facial at her employer\u2019s beauty salon solely for her personal benefit. We also held petitioner\u2019s accident did not arise \u201cout of\u2019 a risk that was connected with her contract of service and it was the \u201cpersonal proclivities\u201d of the employee which gave rise to the harm. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 702 A.2d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Here, petitioner never left the Pathmark store from the time she \u201cpunched out\u201d to the time she fell on the floor in the fish department. Petitioner was on respondent\u2019s premises throughout the entire incident, respondent had control over the area where petitioner was injured, and she fell in an area where she, as well as any customer, was permitted. Further, similar to the situations in <em>Chen </em>and <em>Sparrow, </em>petitioner \u201cpunched out\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>remained in the store to go food shopping for her mother. We are satisfied petitioner\u2019s accident occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">However, petitioner\u2019s injury did not arise \u201cout of\u2019 her employment with respondent. Similar to the situation in <em>Sparrow, </em>petitioner decided to remain on her employer\u2019s premises to food shop for her mother. The slip-and-fall on the wet floor did not arise \u201cout of\u2019 a risk connected with her job as a cashier for Pathmark. The \u201cpersonal proclivities\u201d of petitioner gave rise to the harm she incurred as a result of the slip-and-fall on the wet floor in the fish department. This is a \u201cpersonal risk\u201d that did not \u201carise out of\u2019 her employment. Because petitioner did not establish her injuries were caused by an accident <em>both </em>\u201carising out of\u2019 <em>and </em>\u201cin the course of\u2019 her employment with respondent, Judge Boyle properly dismissed petitioner\u2019s claim petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We note petitioner instituted suit against Pathmark Stores, Inc. in the Law Division based on this accident to protect against the potential adverse consequence of the applicable statute of limitations. We view this as good practice as the issue of whether a transfer by us of the matter to the Law Division pursuant to <em>R. </em>1:13 \u2014 4(b), or other authority, would withstand a statute-of-limitations defense in the Law Division is as yet undecided.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
