TWC successfully challenged this determination in the Law Division, and the Board has appealed. Upon consideration of the arguments presented, we affirm the decision reversing the Board\u2019s jurisdictional determination, substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Wolfson in his opinion, reported as <em>TWC Realty v. Zoning Board of Adjustment of Township of Edison, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 717 A.2d 439 (Law Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The award of costs, also challenged on appeal, was consistent with <em>R. </em>4:42-8(a) which provides in pertinent part: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law, these rules or court order, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party\u201d. <em>See Gallo v. Salesian Soc\u2019y, Inc., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>616, 660, 676 A.2d 580 (App. Div.1996); <em>Regino v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>94, 100, 490 A.2d 362 (App.Div.1985)(rule generally requires that prevailing party receive costs.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\"> On its motion for reconsideration, the Board sought relaxation of the costs rule, citing its limited resources as a governmental entity and the novelty of the legal issues involved. Its request was denied. In light of the high threshold imposed for exercise <em>of the </em>court\u2019s limited discretion respecting costs <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>absent a specific statutory or Rule provision respecting local government entities, we cannot say that discretion was abused. <em>See Children\u2019s Inst. v. Verona Twp. Bd., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 358, 675 A.2d 1151 (App.Div.1996) (No abuse of discretion in awarding costs of transcript against Board of Adjustment); Cox, New <em>Jersey Zoning and Land Use Administration, </em>Sec. 22-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\"> \"[D]enial [of costs] requires special reasons beyond those justifying, for example, a denial of interest.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J.
