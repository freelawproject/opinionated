She sued and, pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21A-1, the matter was submitted to arbitration. An arbitrator determined that the parties were equally liable, setting damages at $60,000. The arbitrator\u2019s award issued on January 15, 1998. According to <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l), upon the filing of an arbitrator\u2019s award, an order shall be entered dismissing the action unless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF4\">(1) within 30 days after the filing of the arbitration award, a party thereto files with the civil division manager and serves on all other parties a notice of rejection of the award and demand for a trial de novo and pays a trial de novo fee as set forth in paragraph (c) of this rule____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In this case, February 16 was the last date to file a motion for a trial <em>de novo. </em>Defendant filed such a motion, however it was postmarked February 18,1998, and was rejected by the Clerk\u2019s Office with the notation that it was not received within 30 days of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">On February 18, 1998, plaintiff filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award. Defendant filed a cross-motion for a trial <em>de novo. </em>The trial judge denied defendant\u2019s motion and confirmed the arbitration award. Defendant appeals, contending that the trial judge erred in denying its cross-motion because it established \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify an enlargement of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The thirty-day rule is to be strictly enforced. Only \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warrant extension of this deadline. <em>Wallace v. JFK Hartwyck at Oak Tree, Inc., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>605, 609, 695 A.2d 257 (1997). Such a determination is fact sensitive and should be made on a case-by-ease basis. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, for example, the conduct of the errant attorney in <em>Wallace </em>in writing the wrong date on his calendar and missing the deadline, was deemed to be \u201cmere carelessness,\u201d not the \u201cextraordinary circumstances capable of relaxing the 30-day rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610, 695 A.2d 257. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>in <em>Hartsfield v. Fantini, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>611, 695 A.2d 259 (1997), the Supreme Court specifically noted that an attorney\u2019s heavy workload and/or a failure to supervise his or her staff does not satisfy the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 618-19, 695 A.2d 259. In emphasizing the need for a strict interpretation of the thirty-day rule, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">This case involves the integrity of the arbitration process and enforceability of arbitration awards. If a party could set aside an arbitration award and obtain a trial <em>de novo </em>whenever his or her attorney neglected to file for a trial <em>de rumo </em>within time solely because of a clerical error or failure to note or advise the client of the thirty-day requirement to file for a trial <em>de novo, </em>there would be an open door which would render the thirty-day time limit of <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(l) meaningless. Such a relaxation of the rule \u201cthwarts the effectiveness of a valid arbitration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2O\"><em>[Hartsfield, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 617, 695 A.2d 259 (quoting <em>Behm v. Ferreira, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566,574, 670 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1996))].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The court concluded, citing <em>Mazakas v. Wray, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>367, 372, 500 A.2d 1085 (App.Div.1985), that a trial judge\u2019s power to relax the court rules should be used sparingly in this context. <em>Hartsfield, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 617,695 A.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Defendant argues that the following facts are \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d sufficient to relax the rule: After the decision of the arbitrator, the defendant\u2019s attorney prepared and executed a notice demanding a trial <em>de novo. </em>The notice was dated February 12, 1998. A check dated February 11, 1998, in the amount of $200, was also issued to cover the applicable fee. Finally, a letter dated February 12,1998, enclosing the notice and the check, was prepared. The date of mailing is uncertain. However, it is agreed that the postmark on the copy of the motion addressed to plaintiff was February 18 and that the motion was received by the clerk after the thirty days expired. Defendant argues that because its lawyer prepared and executed the documents in a timely fashion, the delay in mailing is sufficient to meet the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">According to defendant, its lawyer had no reason to anticipate the mailing error (the documents apparently sat around in his office for nearly a week) and fully expected that the mailing would occur within a short time of his preparation of the documents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Thus, defendant argues that the untimely mailing was an \u201cextraordinary\u201d event. Moreover, defendant claims that the brevity of the delay assures that no prejudice could have occurred from the late filing and constitutes substantial compliance with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Defendant\u2019s arguments belie a fundamental misunderstanding of the meaning of the term \u201cextraordinary.\u201d This word, in common parlance, denotes something unusual or remarkable. The dictionary includes among its definitions of the word:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">exceptional to a very marked extent: most unusual: far from common ... rarely equaled: singular, phenomenal: strikingly impressive ... having little or no precedent and usually totally unexpected____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\"><em>[Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged </em>807 (1971).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Defendant\u2019s claim here is nothing more than a claim of human error or carelessness which is part of the fabric of every day existence and which <em>Wallace </em>specifically rejected as \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Even if the case is characterized as one involving lax attorney supervision of staff, <em>Hartsfield </em>has already declared that such circumstances are not \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Further, defendant\u2019s theory that the brevity of the delay equates with substantial compliance was laid to rest in <em>Hartsfield, </em>which held that generally \u201csubstantial compliance with the filing limitation ... will not constitute \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019 sufficient to relax the thirty-day rule.\u201d <em>Hartsfield, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at <em>618, </em>695 A.2d 259. In short, we are satisfied that the trial judge properly assessed defendant\u2019s contentions as inadequate to meet the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard and that he correctly refused to extend the time within which to file for a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">We add only this. The clerk exceeded her authority in refusing to file defendant\u2019s motions for a trial <em>de novo. </em>Filing is a \u201cministerial\u201d function. <em>White v. Katz, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>672, 619 A.2d 683 (App.Div.1993) (quoting Pressler, <em>N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 3 on <em>R. </em>1:5-6 (1993)). The clerk has no role in determining the timeliness of a party\u2019s pleadings. The clerk should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>filed defendant\u2019s motion for a trial de novo and left it to plaintiff to challenge the propriety of the filing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The order under review is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-16\"> It appears that the actual practice of the Civil Division Managers under <em>R. </em>4:21A, including the programming of the Civil Automated Case Management System (ACMS), has been formulated based upon the belief the <em>R. </em>1:5-6(c) does not apply to arbitration filings. In order to give the Court an opportunity to resolve the tension between these rules and to determine whether an amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>would be appropriate, this aspect of the opinion is prospective and will become effective on October 15, 1999. We suggest that the Civil Practice Committee consider this issue forthwith.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
