The trial judge erred in denying his motion for post-conviction relief as there was excusable neglect for the failure to abide by the five year time limit of <em>R. </em>3:22-12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">II. Post-Conviction relief should have been granted and defendant should have been permitted to withdraw his prior guilty pleas because his attorneys did not inform him of the fact that his guilty pleas could later be used as a sentencing enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Wilkerson never appealed any of the four underlying convictions, all of which were based on plea agreements, which were the subject of his PCR application. The convictions were as follows. On September 6, 1990, Wilkerson pled guilty to a count in a 1989 state grand jury indictment which charged him with third degree distribution of a controlled dangerous substance (CDS) (cocaine) <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-5b(3)), and shortly thereafter he was sentenced to three years of probation for that offense. On October 5, 1990, Wilkerson pled guilty to one count in a 1990 Mercer County indictment which charged him with first degree possession of CDS (PCP) with intent to distribute, and on January 25, 1991, he was sentenced as a second degree offender to eight years in prison. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>All remaining charges in that indictment were dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">On October 21,1991, Wilkerson pled guilty to third degree theft by unlawful taking <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3a and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6) in another unrelated 1990 Mercer County indictment, and on November 8,1990, he was sentenced to four years in prison to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on the conviction for first degree possession with intent to distribute CDS on the earlier Mercer county indictment. Again, all remaining charges were dismissed in accordance with a plea agreement. On October 21, 1991, Wilkerson also pled guilty to third degree terroristic threats <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3b) in a Mercer County criminal accusation, and was sentenced to four years in prison on November 8, 1990, concurrent with the earlier sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In 1995, Wilkerson (then out of prison) was arrested on federal charges of distributing cocaine in a quantity exceeding ten grams. Wilkerson pled guilty to that charge and was sentenced in federal court on May 12,1995 to a term of 188 months under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines by virtue of his having obtained \u201ccareer offender\u201d status. This was an increase from the seventy months sentence he would have received, but for his prior state record.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Although Wilkerson never sought direct appeal from any of his state convictions, he filed PCR petitions between February 4 and March 12, 1997, directed to the various state convictions based on the plea agreements. In arguing the PCR petitions, Wilkerson asserted the common claim that all of his prior attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel because they failed to advise him of the possibility that the crimes to which he pled guilty might someday provide the basis for an extended sentence if he were to commit future crimes and face prosecution and conviction for them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His attorney at the PCR hearing remarked that it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>surprising that Wilkerson was not so advised because most defense attorneys, to his understanding, did not give that kind of advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The trial judge in a well-written letter opinion concluded that all of Wilkerson\u2019s petitions were filed at least six years and nine months after sentencing, and, thus, were barred as beyond the five year limitation period for PCR applications in <em>R. </em>3:22-12. The judge also concluded that there was no showing of excusable neglect. Moreover, on the merits, the judge rejected Wilkerson\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We agree with Judge Smithson\u2019s findings and conclusions. Clearly, Wilkerson\u2019s petitions were all filed beyond the time period allowed by <em>R. </em>3:22-12 and are barred. <em>See State v. Mitchell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>565, 576-577, 601 A.2d 198 (1992); <em>State v. Dugan, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 19, 672 A.2d 1240 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>373, 678 A.2d 714 (1996). Moreover, all of Wilkerson\u2019s claims are essentially without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). Hence, we need not further address those issues, except for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Wilkerson\u2019s brief informs us that the Public Defender\u2019s office has at least fifteen appeals and PCR applications pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>involving the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for a defense attorney\u2019s failure to advise a defendant in connection with a plea agreement of the consequences of a conviction in the event that a defendant commits a future crime, particularly one which will subject a defendant to federal court jurisdiction and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. We are also aware from our own calendar that the issue is currently being raised with some repetitiveness. Because the issue has not been definitively decided in this State we address the issue at some length, recognizing that the great weight of authority in other jurisdictions has rejected such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Aside from the fact that generally individuals should be aware as a matter of common sense that a continuing course of antisocial or criminal conduct may lead to increased penalties, we find no constitutional requirement that a defense attorney must advise a client or defendant that if he or she commits future criminal offenses that there may be adverse consequences by way of enhancement of the penalty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Judge Smithson stated in his December 15, 1997 letter opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">This court declines to adopt Petitioner\u2019s proposed new rule of law. There is not, nor should there be, any constitutional requirement that defense counsel be omniscient. With hindsight, it is not difficult to suggest different strategies that an attorney might have pursued, but the law is settled that \u201c[i]n assessing the adequacy of counsel\u2019s performance, strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Burger v. Kemp, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>776, 819, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>3114, 3139, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>638 (1987) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(Powell, J., dissenting) <em>(quoting [Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 690, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2063-2064, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674, 693 (1984)]). Nor can the quality of counsel\u2019s representation fairly be assessed by focusing solely on events that exist in an unknown future, while ignoring the totality of counsel\u2019s performance in the context of the State\u2019s compelling evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">Thus, the contention that Petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel is utterly without merit. Petitioner does not demonstrate that had he gone to trial, he would have been acquitted of the state charges or sentenced differently. Indeed, all evidence suggests that defense counsel did the right thing by advocating guilty pleas to the state-level charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">The Motion to Dismiss the Petition for Post-Conviction relief is granted based upon the aforementioned procedural bars. The Petition for Post-Conviction is denied based upon the aforementioned procedural bars and the lack of merit to Petitioner\u2019s substantive claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">A distinction is often drawn between the penal consequences of a plea and potential or actual \u201ccollateral consequences.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This distinction may have relevance when the court is considering an application to withdraw a plea. <em>State v. Heitzman, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>617, 622, 508 A.2d 1161 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>603, 527 A.2d 439 (1987). <em>See also State v. Chung, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>427,436, 510 A.2d 72 (App.Div.1986) (deportation consequences of guilty plea a collateral rather than penal consequence and need not be disclosed by trial judge); <em>State v. Riggins, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 357, 466 A.2d 981 (Law Div.1983) (loss of employment a collateral consequence of plea and did not justify withdrawing plea even though defendant was misled by his attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Federal courts have consistently rejected the contention that a defendant who pleads guilty must first be advised that the resulting conviction could someday provide the basis for an enhanced sentence after conviction of a future crime, describing that potentiality as merely a \u201ccollateral consequence\u201d of the plea. <em>See, e.g., Heath v.

There is no constitutional requirement for such advice. It involves only a collateral issue. A rule requiring such advice would implicate speculation. Nor is the judge required to independently give such information to a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>dant. Aside from the fact that Wilkerson has not established either prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 687,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2063-2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693 (1984), or in <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 58, 519 A.2d 336 (1987), his argument runs counter to the philosophy of <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>that \u201cno particular set of detailed rules\u201d should govern counsel\u2019s conduct. 466 <em>U.S. </em>at 668-669, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064-2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>See also State v. Savage, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>594, 619, 577 A.2d 455 (1990). There is also no showing that even if Wilkerson had been advised by his attorney in the manner he suggests that he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>See State v. DiFrisco, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>434, 457, 645 A.2d 734 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>1129,116 <em>S.Ct. </em>949,133 L.Ed.2d 873 (1996). By his pleas Wilkerson disposed of three separate indictments and one criminal accusation against him, containing an aggregate of fifteen separate charges, including a first degree drug distribution charge, robbery and weapons charges, terroristic threats, resisting arrest, and other drug charges. Wilkerson received an aggregate sentence of eight years in prison with no parole eligibility. The likelihood that he could have received a more favorable result is indeed remote. Rather, Wilkerson faced the prospect of further convictions and lengthier sentences, as well as a potential consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\"> Wilkerson's PCR petitions also raised various other claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. He asserted that his attorney's failure to file a motion to suppress evidence in connection with his 1989 indictment was ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tance of counsel. In connection with his 1990 indictment he again argued ineffectiveness of counsel for failure to move to suppress evidence and also alleged prosecutorial misconduct stemming from the prosecutor's failure to investigate whether the evidence against him was admissible. On his second 1991 indictment and plea he claimed that his attorney should have negotiated a guilty plea to disorderly persons theft rather than third degree theft as the latter ultimately contributed to his career offender status in federal proceedings. Finally, with respect to the remaining convictions, he argued that the court and the prosecutor erred in including the charge of terroristic threats in his plea agreement without reviewing with him the consequences of that plea, which also later resulted in a substantial sentence enhancement in federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> On a quasi-criminal level it is safe to assume, as an example, that licensed motor vehicle drivers are acutely aware that if they commit repetitive offenses there may be serious adverse effects both in penalties involved and potential loss of driver's license, not to mention insurance consequences. Indeed, many motor vehicle offenses expressly carry increased penalties for repeat offenders. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lucci, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 60-61, 707 A.2d 1370 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>386, 718 A.2d 1215 (1998). In other cases, a judge has discretion to impose a fine or penalty up to and including a specified amount or sanctions. An individual's driving record may bear on the severity of the fine or penalty. As for criminal offenses, defendants are presumed to know that prior convictions of crimes may subject them to extended term sentences. <em>See, e.g., NJ.S.A. </em>2C:44-3(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> See <em>City of Ottawa v.

State, </em>the Texas Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Appellant's assertion that counsel should have informed him that the convictions stemming from the guilty pleas could potentially be used later to enhance the charges the next time he was caught violating the law, implies that counsel should automatically anticipate Appellant would continue to act as a one-man crime wave. Inferentially, such an argument requires the conclusion [that] Appellant's 20-day sentence was insufficient to deter further criminal activity. Furthermore, adherence to the view expressed in the contention would also necessarily abrogate the need for Appellant to accept any personal responsibility regarding the enhancement of any future criminal conduct he might commit. Thus, we conclude the lack of such a warning by counsel is not sufficient to establish that Appellant was afforded only nominal representation. Nor does the absence of such a warning affirmatively illustrate that Appellant lacked sufficient knowledge of the direct consequences of the pleas to the extent the pleas were constitutionally invalid.
