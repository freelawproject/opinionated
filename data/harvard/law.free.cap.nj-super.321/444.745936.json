The school district referred those charges to the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), which conducted investigations through its Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit. Although DYFS concluded that the abuse allegations had not been substantiated, it also concluded that the teachers\u2019 conduct had placed their students at \u201cundue risk of .harm.\u201d Consequently, DYFS made findings in each case that the abuse allegations were \u201cnot substantiated\u201d but also expressed \u201cconcerns\u201d regarding the teachers\u2019 conduct. DYFS sent letters reporting these findings to the teachers, the school district and the alleged abused students\u2019 parents and guardians. DYFS\u2019 letters to the school district also set forth remedial action the district should take to address DYFS\u2019 concerns, such as administrative counseling, monitoring and retraining of the teachers. The nature of DYFS\u2019 reports to the district are discussed in greater detail later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Several appellants requested an administrative hearing or \u201cdis-positional conference\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to contest these findings. However, DYFS denied these requests, stating that an opportunity for a hearing is afforded only when DYFS finds that a charge of abuse has been substantiated, thus resulting in an entry in the \u201cCentral Registry.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants then filed these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Appellants argue that DYFS does not have the statutory authority to transmit to a school district \u201cfindings\u201d that even though child abuse charges against a teacher were \u201cnot substantiated,\u201d DYFS nevertheless has \u201cconcerns\u201d about the teacher\u2019s conduct. Appellants also argue that even if DYFS has the statutory authority to notify a school district that charges of child abuse are \u201cnot substantiated with concerns,\u201d it has no authority to order a district to take specific corrective action or submit a remedial plan which addresses those concerns. In addition, appellants argue that DYFS denied their due process rights by refusing to afford them a hearing to contest its findings, because DYFS\u2019 transmittal of those findings to the Newark school district adversely affected their employment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We conclude that DYFS has statutory authority to complete an investigation of alleged child abuse by a teacher with a finding that the charges are \u201cnot substantiated with concerns,\u201d but it has no authority to order a school district to take specific corrective action or submit a remedial plan. We also conclude that when DYFS submits a report to a school district that it has found a charge of child abuse against a teacher to be \u201cnot substantiated with concerns,\u201d the teacher has no right to a hearing to contest DYFS\u2019 investigatory findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">DYFS has broad authority to investigate allegations of child abuse. Any person with \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that a child has been abused must immediately report this information to DYFS. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10. Upon receipt of such a report, DYFS is required to \u201cimmediately take such action as shall be necessary to insure the safety of the child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.11. Under these statutory provisions, DYFS has authority and responsibility to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>investigate allegations that a school teacher has abused a student. <em>See East Park High Sch., supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 154, 714 A.2d 339; <em>Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 177-78, 698 A.2d 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:6-7a provides that when DYFS completes an investigation of a child abuse complaint against a public school employee, it \u201cshall notify the school district and the employee of its findings.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:6-7a further provides that \u201c[u]pon receipt of a finding by [DYFS] that such a complaint is unfounded, the school district shall remove any references to the complaint and investigation by [DYFS] from the employee\u2019s personnel records.\u201d Thus, <em>N.J.SA </em>18:6-7a clearly requires DYFS to report the results of its investigation of a child abuse complaint against a teacher to the teacher\u2019s employer, regardless of whether the results are favorable or unfavorable. <em>See also N.J.AC. </em>6:29-9.1 to -9.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">DYFS has adopted administrative regulations which establish three categories of findings that may be made as a result of a child abuse investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">1. \u201cSubstantiated\u201d when the available information, as evaluated by the Division representative, indicates that a child is an abused or neglected child as defined in <em>N.JA.C. </em>10:133-1.3 because the child has been harmed or placed at risk of harm by a parent caretaker, temporary caretaker or institutional caretaker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">2. \u201cNot substantiated\u201d when the available information, as evaluated by the Division representative, provides some indication that a child was harmed or placed at risk of harm, but does not indicate that the child is an abused or neglected child as defined in <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:133-1.3; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">3. \u201cUnfounded\u201d when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">i. There is no evidence of conduct that would pose risk to the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">ii. There is no evidence that a parent, caretaker, temporary caretaker, institutional caretaker or child was involved; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">iii. The available information indicates that the actions of the parent, caretaker, temporary caretaker, or institutional caretaker were necessary and reasonable and the incident was an accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-13\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:129A-3.3(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">The regulations also require DYFS to notify the alleged perpetrator, alleged victim and his or her parents or caretaker of the results of the investigation. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:129A-3.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>In each of the cases involved in these consolidated appeals, DYFS found that the child abuse allegations against the appellant teachers were \u201cnot substantiated;\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that is, that the \u201cavailable information ... [did] not indicate that the child is an abused or neglected child as defined in <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:133-1.3,\u201d but that the investigation \u201cprovided] some indication that a child was harmed or placed at risk of harm.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:129A-3.3(a)(2). For example, in the case of appellant C.M., DYFS found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">Mr. [MJ\u2019s method of intervention was inappropriate. The credible evidence indicates that Mr. [MJ grabs the students by their chins and cheeks. Additionally, Mr. [MJ pushes the chairs of the students into their desks as a means to gain their attention or to make them sit in their chairs in a straight position. Although no excessive force was used, Mr. [MJ\u2019s actions are a violation of the school\u2019s policy/procedure. The face is a dangerous contact area and pushing the chairs is a potentially dangerous technique.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">DYFS\u2019 report to the school district noted that DYFS had previously requested the Acting Principal of C.M.\u2019s school to closely monitor his classes and recommended that the district take additional corrective action \u201cto include but not be limited to an administrative counseling [of C.M.] regarding effective interaction with students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Appellants argue that DYFS lacks the statutory authority to find that a child abuse charge against a teacher is \u201cnot substantiated.\u201d Appellants contend that upon the conclusion of an investigation, DYFS must find either that the charges have been \u201csubstantiated,\u201d in which event it may invoke the full panoply of its remedial powers, or that the charges are \u201cunfounded,\u201d in which event neither DYFS nor the teacher\u2019s employer may take any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">We reject this restrictive view of DYFS\u2019 investigatory and regulatory powers. \u201c[T]he grant of authority to an adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>trative agency is to be liberally construed in order to enable the agency to accomplish its statutory responsibilities and ... the courts should readily imply such incidental powers as are necessary to effectuate fully the legislative intent.\u201d <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 562, 384 A.2d 795 (1978). DYFS has been granted broad authority to investigate child abuse allegations, including specific authority to investigate any child abuse allegation against a public school teacher and to report its findings to the teacher\u2019s employer. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:6-7a. An investigation of an abuse complaint against a teacher may disclose conduct which poses a threat to the physical or emotional well-being of the teacher\u2019s students even though it does not rise to the level of \u201cchild abuse\u201d within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.21. Therefore, we are satisfied that DYFS has not only the authority but the responsibility to take reasonable measures to protect students from any threat to their well-being. The most obvious available measure to protect students from a teacher who poses a danger to their safety or welfare is for DYFS to communicate its concerns and recommendations to the school district which employs the teacher. The district can then take whatever action it deems appropriate to address DYFS\u2019 concerns, including counseling, transfer of the teacher to another assignment or, in an extreme case, termination of employment. Accordingly, we are satisfied that DYFS has the statutory authority to find that child abuse allegations against a teacher are \u201cnot substantiated\u201d but that the teacher\u2019s conduct poses a risk of harm to his or her students, and to report those concerns to the school district which employs the teacher. <em>See Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 180, 698 A.2d 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">We next consider whether DYFS has statutory authority to order a school district to take specific corrective action or submit a remedial plan based on a finding that a child abuse complaint is \u201cnot substantiated\u201d but that DYFS has \u201cconcerns.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The Legislature has conferred expansive authority upon local boards of education to manage and operate the public schools. These powers include the power to hire, assign, evaluate, transfer, promote, suspend and terminate teachers. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:25-1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:25-6; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:27-1 to -12; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:29-14. The Legislature has also conferred comprehensive authority upon the Commissioner and State Board of Education to monitor, evaluate and supervise a local school district\u2019s management of its public schools. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:4-10; <em>N.J.SA </em>18A:4-23; <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:7A-10 to -16; <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:7F-4; <em>see Robinson v. Cahill, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>449, 458-61, 355 A.2d 129 (1976),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Within this statutory plan for the management and operation of the public schools, DYFS\u2019 authority is limited to the investigation of any allegation of child abuse or neglect against a school employee and notification to \u201cthe school district and the employee of its findings.\u201d <em>N.J.SA. </em>18A:6-7a. Therefore, the school laws do not confer authority upon DYFS to order a school district to take corrective action or submit a plan for remedial action in response to DYFS\u2019 investigatory findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In its appellate brief, DYFS acknowledges that once it completes an investigation of a child abuse complaint against a teacher, \u201c[DYFS] has no statutory role to play aside from recommending remedial action to be taken by the facility.\u201d DYFS also acknowledges that \u201cappellants\u2019 employer, the Newark School District, has the responsibility for evaluating the results of the Division\u2019s investigations and determining whether to accept the Division\u2019s recommendation, if any, as to possible remedial action to ensure that further harm to the children under the teachers\u2019 care would not result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Although DYFS\u2019s brief accurately describes its statutory role with respect to a child abuse allegation against a teacher, DYFS\u2019 transmittals of its investigatory findings to the Newark school district at least implied that the district was required to take remedial action in accordance with DYFS\u2019 findings and recommendations. In each case DYFS made investigatory findings concerning the teacher\u2019s conduct which, although not rising to the level of child abuse within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21, reflected adversely upon the teacher\u2019s qualifications and in several instances clearly indicated the appropriateness of disciplinary action. In most of the letters reporting its findings and recommendations, DYFS concluded by stating: \u201cIt is recommended that the Newark Public School district take and document appropriate corrective action.\u201d The letters also stated: \u201cPlease respond in writing within 30 days to confirm action taken.\u201d Consequently, even though DYFS\u2019 conclusions concerning \u201cappropriate corrective action\u201d were described as recommendations, DYFS\u2019 directive to the school district to \u201cconfirm\u201d its corrective action \u201cin writing\u201d at least implied that the district was required to act in accordance with DYFS\u2019 recommendations, rather than, to exercise its own independent judgment in deciding what action, if any, to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Moreover, this implication was made explicit when the school district failed to submit a remedial plan within 30 days. A DYFS employee with the title \u201cCorrective Action Coordinator\u201d sent a letter to the principal of the school where appellant Z.M. taught, entitled \u201cOverdue Corrective Action Response,\u201d which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">This is your <em>last reminder to send documentation </em>on the above incident so that it may be closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">I informed you recently that if it was not received within two weeks, we may have to initiate an investigation or advise the licensing and/or regulatory agency of your lack of cooperation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3.1(d) mandates that if an institution does not formulate or implement a remedial plan or make changes requested by the division, the division may recommend to the authority which licenses, oversees, approves or authorizes the operation of the institution that appropriate sanctions or actions be enforced or taken against the institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">/ <em>must notify your licensing and/or regulatory agency if I do not receive your documentation with the next 5 days.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\"><em>Please send it immediately </em>to the above address, identified with the IAIU number.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>In this letter and several other letters DYFS sent to the Newark school district, it cited <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3.1 as authority for ordering a school to \u201cformulate or implement a remedial plan or make changes requested by [DYFS].\u201d However, <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-3.1 is clearly inapplicable to the investigatory reports involved in these appeals. This statute authorizes DYFS to request the chief administrator of an institution \u201c[to] formulate a plan of remedial action\u201d or \u201c[to] make administrative, personnel or structural changes\u201d under the circumstances set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3.1(b) and (c). In addition, <em>N.J.SA </em>9:6-3.1(d) provides that \u201c[i]f a chief administrator of an institution does not formulate or implement a remedial plan or make any changes requested by the division, the division may recommend to the authority which licenses, oversees, approves or authorizes the operation of the institution that appropriate sanctions or actions be enforced or taken against the institution.\u201d However, these provisions only apply if an act of child abuse or neglect is committed by a teacher or other staff person at \u201can institution,\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>9:6 \u2014 3.1(a); and <em>N.J.SA </em>9:6-8.21(g) defines \u201cinstitution\u201d to mean \u201ca public or private facility in the State which provides children with out of home care, supervision or maintenance,\u201d which \u201cincludes, but is not limited to, correctional facility, detention facility, treatment facility, day care center, residential school, shelter and hospital.\u201d This definition of \u201cinstitution\u201d does not include a \u201cday school,\u201d which <em>N.J.SA </em>9:6-8.21(h) defines as \u201ca public or private school which provides general or special educational services to day students in grades kindergarten through 12.\u201d <em>See N.J.SA. </em>9:6~8.21(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because a public school is a \u201cday school\u201d rather than an \u201cinstitution,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6 \u2014 3.1 does not confer authority upon DYFS to order a public school district to take specific corrective action or submit a remedial plan.* **<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Since the investigatory findings involved in these appeals were all transmitted to the Newark school district at least a year and a half ago, and the district has already taken disciplinary or other personnel actions against appellants based on DYFS\u2019s findings and recommendations, it is unclear whether appellants can be granted any effective relief at this time. However, we conclude that DYFS should be required to notify the Newark school district that DYFS\u2019 reports concerning the child abuse allegations against appellants did not require the district to take any disciplinary or other personnel actions but were investigatory findings and recommendations only, and that the district has the responsibility to make an independent judgment as to whether to accept DYFS\u2019 findings and recommendations. The district can then decide whether it would be appropriate to reconsider any of the disciplinary or other personnel actions which it has taken on the basis of DYFS\u2019 reports.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Appellants argue that under the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>New Jersey Constitution, <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, f 1, DYFS was required to afford them an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing before transmitting its findings and recommendations to the school district. Appellants characterize DYFS\u2019 findings as \u201cadjudicatory\u201d because they directly resulted in the Newark school district initiating disciplinary and other personnel actions which adversely affected their employment rights. These personnel actions included transfers to other schools, withholding of salary increments and terminations of employment. In the remaining cases, the district directed the teachers to attend training courses and/or undergo counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Initially, we note that insofar as appellants\u2019 arguments rest on the premise that DYFS required the Newark school district to take disciplinary or other personnel actions against them, we have held in section II of this opinion that DYFS does not have the statutory authority to order a school district to take any specific corrective action. The district has the sole authority to determine whether to initiate disciplinary proceedings or take other personnel action which may affect a teacher\u2019s employment rights. Any recommendations DYFS may make to the district are advisory only.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In <em>Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>we held that DYFS, through the Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU), may investigate child abuse allegations and transmit investigatory findings and recommendations to another government agency without conducting an evidentiary hearing. 304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 181-88, 698 A.2d 1275. In that case, DYFS sent a report to the Department of Education which found that child abuse allegations against a private day school and its primary owner and principal had been \u201csubstantiated\u201d and recommended that the Department \u201cthoroughly evaluate\u201d those findings and \u201ctake such actions as necessary to address [DYFS\u2019] concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 698 A.2d 1275. In concluding that DYFS was not required to conduct a hearing before transmitting the results of its investigation to the Department, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>[T]he \u201cdue process\u201d requirements which govern the proceedings of an agency that makes binding legal determinations directly affecting legal rights do not apply to agency proceedings which are purely investigatory in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">The IAIU\u2019s transmittal to the Department of Education of a report describing the results of its investigation of allegations of child abuse at Blackacre Academy did not implicate any liberty or property interest which would entitle appellants to the due process protections required in adjudicatory proceedings. The IAIU\u2019s report does not purport to be an adjudication which would be binding upon the Department of Education; the purely investigatory nature of the IAIU\u2019s findings is clearly indicated by the report\u2019s final sentence which \u201crecommend[s]\u201d that the \u201cDepartment of Education thoroughly evaluate the Blackacre Academy with regard to the various findings of this investigation and take such actions as necessary to address the concerns raised regarding Dr. Doe\u2019s actions, staff\u2019s actions, training, and suspensions.\u201d Moreover, before the Department could suspend or revoke appellants\u2019 licenses or order them to take remedial action, it would be required to conduct an evidentiary hearing in conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 to -15. Thus, the IAIU\u2019s transmittal of its investigatory report to the Department of Education is analogous to a local police department forwarding an incident report to the county prosecutor. A target of an investigation by a local police department cannot directly challenge the adequacy or fairness of the investigation or the police department\u2019s decision to forward the matter to the county prosecutor. Instead, his rights are fully protected by the opportunity to move for an order quashing any indictment that may be returned and to defend against the charges before a jury. Similarly, appellants\u2019 due process rights would be fully protected by the opportunity for an evidentiary hearing before the Department before their licenses could be revoked or they could be ordered to take remedial action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 182-84, 698 A.2d 1275 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We reach the same conclusion in this case. If the Newark school district initiated action which adversely affected a teacher\u2019s statutorily protected employment rights, such as the withholding of a salary increment, <em>N.J.SA </em>18A:29-14, or the termination of a tenured teacher\u2019s employment, <em>N.J.SA </em>18A:28-5, the teacher would be entitled to an evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the district could not simply rely upon DYFS\u2019 findings as the basis for such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>personnel action; if the district wanted to present the evidence upon which DYFS\u2019 investigatory findings were based, such as interviews of alleged victims or other witnesses, it would have to call any persons DYFS had interviewed as witnesses at the hearing. <em>See State v. Lungsford, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 306-10, 400 A.2d 843 (App.Div.1979); <em>see also Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 183-84, 698 A.2d 1275; <em>New Jersey Div. Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. E.D., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401, 412-14, 558 A.2d 1377 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>118 <em>N.J. 232, </em>570 A.2d 983 (1989). We are satisfied, as we were in <em>Blackacre Academy, </em>that the opportunity for such a hearing satisfies due process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Appellants point out that some of them were not afforded an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing to contest adverse employment actions taken by the Newark school district on the basis of DYFS\u2019 findings. For example, one appellant, a substitute teacher, was summarily terminated after the district received DYFS\u2019 findings and recommendations. However, a substitute or other untenured teacher has no statutory right to continued employment and thus no right to a hearing to contest a decision to terminate his or her employment. <em>Battaglia v. Union Comity Welfare Bd., </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>48, 56-58, 438 A.2d 530 (1981), cert. <em>denied, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>965,102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2045, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>490 (1982). The fact that a school district may make such a personnel decision based partly or wholly on DYFS\u2019 report of the results of a child abuse investigation, rather than solely on the basis of a school administrator\u2019s evaluation of the teacher\u2019s performance, does not create a right to a hearing. Indeed, appellants appear to concede that if the Newark school district itself conducted an internal investigation of child abuse allegations against a teacher who had no statutory right to continued employment, and its investigator submitted a report which the school administrators considered in deciding whether to recommend renewal of the teacher\u2019s employment contract, the teacher would have no right to a hearing to contest the report\u2019s findings and recommendations. We cannot perceive any good reason why a hearing should be required simply because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>another governmental agency \u2014 here DYFS \u2014 has submitted an investigatory report to the district rather than the district itself conducting the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Appellants also argue that they are entitled to an evidentiary hearing because DYFS damaged their professional reputations by notifying parents and guardians of the alleged abused students and the Newark school district of its investigatory findings. However, we rejected substantially the same argument in <em>Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 184-85, 698 A.2d 1275. Although the New Jersey Constitution extends due process protection to personal reputation, \u201cwithout requiring any other tangible loss,\u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1,104, 662 A.2d 367 (1995), this does not mean that a liberty interest is implicated anytime a governmental agency transmits information that may impugn a person\u2019s reputation. DYFS\u2019 transmittals of investigatory findings to the parents and guardians of alleged abused students and the school district constituted a significantly more limited dissemination of adverse information than the notifications concerning the presence of Tier II and III sex offenders in a community which the Court in <em>Doe </em>found to require due process protections. 142 <em>N.J. </em>at 103-07, 662 A.2d 367. Moreover, a finding that child abuse allegations have not been substantiated but that DYFS has nevertheless expressed \u201cconcerns\u201d about a person\u2019s conduct is intrinsically less damaging to reputation than a finding that child abuse charges have been \u201csubstantiated\u201d or that a person is a convicted sex offender. Therefore, DYFS\u2019 limited dissemination of the results of its investigations did not cause the kind of damage to reputation which would entitle appellants to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Finally, we note that a finding that child abuse allegations are \u201cnot substantiated\u201d is not included in the \u201cCentral Registry.\u201d <em>Compare N.J.AC. </em>10:129A-3.4(e)(2) <em>with N.J.AC. </em>10:129A-3.4(d). Consequently, such a finding is not made available to the various categories of parties listed in N.J.S.A 9:6-8.10a(b). For this reason, the present case is distinguishable from <em>M.R., supra, </em>314 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>at 409-13, 420-26, 715 A.2d 308 and <em>East Park High Sch., supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 159-66, 714 A.2d 339, which held that inclusion of a finding of substantiated child abuse in the Central Registry has such serious adverse effects upon a person\u2019s employment opportunities in the child care field and the right to become a foster or adoptive parent that an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing must be afforded to challenge such a finding. Therefore, we conclude that an investigative finding that child abuse allegations were \u201cnot substantiated\u201d does not have a sufficiently direct and substantial impact upon employment or familial relationships to \u201centitle appellants to the due process protections required in adjudicatory proceedings.\u201d <em>Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 183, 698 A.2d 1275; <em>see Hodge v. Jones, </em>31 F.3d 157, 165-67 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>1018, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>581, 130 L.Ed.2d 496 (1994) (confidential \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and \u201cruled out\u201d findings in Maryland\u2019s confidential child abuse registry do not impinge on protectable privacy or property interests).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Accordingly, we direct DYFS to notify the Newark school district that DYFS\u2019 reports concerning the results of its investigations of the child abuse allegations against appellants do not require the district to take any specific disciplinary or other personnel actions.
