Scott, held two jobs and, as a result of an injury \u201carising out of and in the course of\u2019 <em>(N.J.S.A </em>34:15-7) his part-time employment, seeks both workers\u2019 compensation from that employer and temporary disability benefits under the full-time employer\u2019s private disability plan. Recently, a divided Supreme Court, adopting the majority opinion of a panel of this court, held that an individual who obtains workers\u2019 compensation benefits by settlement \u201cmay not obtain temporary disability benefits for the same injury.\u201d <em>Sperling v. Board of Review, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1,5, 693 A.2d 901 (App.Div.1997), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>466, 720 A.2d 607 (1998). It was explained that, by virtue of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-20, even a settlement \u201cconstitutes an implied acknowledgment that the claimant\u2019s disability was work-related and compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,\u201d <em>Sperling, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 5, 693 A.2d 901; and <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21-29 and -30 prohibit the receipt of both temporary disability and workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the same accident. We must now decide if Scott\u2019s entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for part-time work precludes his recovery of temporary disability benefits for his full-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Scott appeals from an order of a private plan hearing officer of the Board of Review determining that he is \u201cineligible for disability benefits under the Employer\u2019s (employer <em># </em>1) [Konica Business Machines\u2019] approved Private Plan from April 8,1997 through July 15, 1997 as payment would be a duplication of benefits under <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21-30.\u201d Scott, who was injured during work for a part-time employer, Holiday Bowl, Inc. (\u201cemployer # 2\u201d), on October 28, 1995, claimed that he \u201cshould be entitled to private plan disability benefits from his full-time job [as] he is unable to work at that job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The facts are not in dispute. Accordingly, we adopt them as embodied in the decision of the private plan hearing officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqV\">The claimant was last employed as a copier technician on a full-time basis for employer # 1 from April 2, 1988 through April 7, 1997 at a final weekly salary of $523.50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The claimant was also employed on a part-time basis for employer # 2 from March 1994 though April 6, 1997 as a desk attendant. He had an average weekly wage of $208.25. He was injured on the job on October 28, 1995 at which time he crushed his hand while working with employer # 2. The claimant had reconstructive surgery in the form of a tendon transplant performed on April 8,1997 and was unable to work at either job through July 15,1997. He has been released to work by Dr. Wayne Altman on July 16, 1997. The claimant has received $145.77 per week as a temporary settlement from employer # 2\u2019s insurance carrier and will receive 66.15 weeks at $125 per week as he had permanent residuals as a result of his injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">The Worker\u2019s Compensation claim was not contested and the certification for contested Worker\u2019s Compensation form was not submitted by the claimant\u2019s attomey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The private plan hearing officer concluded that because \u201cclaimant suffered from a disabling injury in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with employer # 2 [Holiday Bowl] which resulted in his total inability to perform the duties of his employment,\u201d the claimant was \u201cineligible for disability benefits\u201d in light of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-30. That statute, entitled \u201cnonduplication of benefits,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">No benefits shall be required or paid under this act for any period with respect to which benefits are paid or payable under any unemployment compensation or similar law, or under any disability or cash sickness benefit or similar law, of this State or of any other State or of the Federal Government. Nor shall any benefits be required or paid under this act for any period with respect to which benefits, other than benefits for permanent partial or permanent total disability previously incurred, are paid or payable on account of the disability of the covered individual under any workmen\u2019s compensation law, occupational disease law, or similar legislation, of this State or of any other State or the Federal Government____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Konica\u2019s disability carrier opposes the payment of any temporary disability benefits from its private plan because such benefits are payable only for injuries \u201cnot compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation law,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-29. As Scott obtained workers\u2019 compensation (including \u201cmedical benefits and temporary disability benefits\u201d) from Holiday Bowl, Konica argues that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-29 and -30 prohibit the payment of any temporary disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>benefits to Scott because he received benefits \u201cunder the workers\u2019 compensation law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">While the argument has some literal appeal, we do not interpret those provisions to reflect a legislative intention to deny all temporary disability benefits to a disabled full-time worker, merely because he receives a workers\u2019 compensation award as a result of an accident \u201carising out and in the <em>course </em>of\u2019 unrelated part-time employment, when the workers\u2019 compensation benefits he receives are calculated solely on the basis of his earnings with that employer and are far less than would have been payable had the accident occurred on the full-time job. The effect of the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation is to give Scott, who was diligently working two jobs, less benefits than he would have received had he worked only at Konica and incurred the same injuries in a non-work related event. In this case there is no dispute that even if Scott received temporary disability benefits under Konica\u2019s plan, as well as the workers\u2019 compensation from Holiday Bowl, the aggregate would still be less than his full-time salary, which is the maximum amount payable under <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21-39(h).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Justice Jacobs reviewed the purpose of temporary disability benefits in <em>Janovsky v. American Motorists Ins. Co., </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4-5, 93 A.2d 1 (1952). As he explained, temporary disability benefits compensate a worker whose income is lost because his accident is not covered by workers\u2019 compensation or while that issue is being litigated. Therefore, as there can be no duplication of benefits, any temporary disability benefits received must be reimbursed by any workers\u2019 compensation recovery for same:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">Where an employee is disabled by accident or illness he will generally be entitled to benefits under either the compensation law or the benefits law, but not under both. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>If liability under the compensation law is clear, payment will be made thereunder, and if absence of liability under that statute is clear, payment will be made under the benefits law. If, however, as in the instant matter, the occurrence is in a twilight zone, with liability under the compensation law doubtful and dependent on the outcome of contested proceedings <em>(Cf. Neylon v. Ford Motor Co., </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>325, 91 A.2d 569 (1952)), immediate payment to help tide the worker over dining his inability to work should be permissible and, indeed, readily available, under the benefits law, with full reimbursement from any award subsequently rendered in the compensation proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\"><em>[Janovsky v. American Motorists Ins. Co., supra, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>at 5,93 A.2d 1.] <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\n<em>See also Sperling v. Board of Review, supra.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">It is undisputed before us that deductions to cover benefits under Konica\u2019s plan are taken from Scott\u2019s salary, and the amount of benefits are based on the salary paid (and income lost).3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this setting, we are not dealing, as in <em>Janovsky </em>and <em>Sperling, </em>with the traditional situation of a worker who has one job and is injured in circumstances not covered, or clearly covered, by workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">We can find neither logical support nor empirical evidence that the Legislature intended to deprive a worker who pays deductions for temporary disability benefits from obtaining those benefits to compensate him for the loss of income at his full-time employment merely because his injury occurred at a second or part-time job taken to supplement that income. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>43:21-26 (requiring liberal construction of the Temporary Disability Benefits Law \u201cas remedial legislation\u201d); <em>In re Paterson, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 339, 689 A.2d 772 (App.Div.1997) (\u201c[t]he purpose of the Temporary Disability Benefits Law is to protect workers against loss of income caused by non-employment-related accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>or sickness\u201d). The employee should not be worse off because the accident, not related to his full-time or prime employment and therefore otherwise entitling him to temporary disability benefits through that employer, happened to occur at an unrelated part-time work site.''</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The statutory interplay which divided the Supreme Court and our colleagues in <em>Sperling </em>takes on a different significance when multiple employment is involved. We must, therefore, reverse the denial of temporary disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">A question arises, however, as to whether the disability carrier should be entitled to a set-off \u201cto the extent of the\u201d temporary workers\u2019 benefits obtained through workers\u2019 compensation, <em>Sperling v. Board of Review, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 468, 720 A.2d 607 (Stein, J. concurring), or in some other amount. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>34:15-57; <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21-30; <em>see also Sperling v. Board of Review, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 5, 693 A.2d 901. Scott argues that, absent any workers\u2019 compensation benefits received from Konica, there can be no offset<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and suggests, in effect, that Konica should not benefit from his inability to work at either employment, particularly at his expense given the deduction from his pay for temporary disability benefits. We agree that the argument must be examined in light of our conclusion that the statutory interplay itself must be examined separately with respect to each job. Moreover, as Justice O\u2019Hem emphasized in his separate opinion in <em>Sperling, N.J.S.A </em>43:21-30 (entitled \u201cnon-duplication of benefits,\u201d not \u201celection of benefits\u201d) \u201cintends to avoid double recovery, not full recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 720 A.2d 607 (O\u2019Hern, J. concurring and dissenting). However, the record does not permit us to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Given his conclusion that the receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Holiday Bowl precluded the award of any temporary disability benefits under Koniea\u2019s plan, the hearing officer did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>consider the issue of \u201coffset\u201d or credits. In the absence of a record addressed to the question and a decision by the agency with expertise in administering the Temporary Disability Law (including the State plan to which <em>N.J.S.A. </em>41:21-29 and -30 apply), we decline to pass upon the issue before it is decided by the agency below. Accordingly, the final administrative determination under review is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Board of Review for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-10\"> Scott\u2019s brief says \"[h]is case for permanent partial disability benefits remains pending\u201d in the Division of Workers' Compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-39(h), relating to State plan benefits, is applicable to private plan benefits by virtue of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-32(c).
