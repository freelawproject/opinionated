Poller, appeals from an order of the Law Division vacating an award by a PIP arbitrator as to one patient, Juana Ledesma, and confirming the denial of an award as to another patient, Yolanda Genao. Dr. Poller proceeded as assignee for both patients who were allegedly injured in the same accident on January 26,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The arbitrator found \u201cthe form of assignment to be acceptable\u201d with respect to Ledesma and that the statute of limitations with respect to the Ledesma claim \u201cwas tolled by evidence of [plaintiff carrier\u2019s] continuing investigation and failure to specifically deny the claims.\u201d The arbitrator, however, concluded that Dr. Poller had \u201cfailed to provide a valid assignment\u201d from Genao and that the doctor was \u201cnot an intended beneficiary of the policy\u201d under which \u201can executed assignment [was] a prerequisite to [the] action.\u201d As a result the Genao claim was \u201cdenied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The Law Division judge adopted \u201cthe standard of review espoused by [an unpublished] Appellate Division [opinion]\u201d which he said \u201crequired a determination of whether or not the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial credible evidence in the record and whether the legal conclusions were consistent with the law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The Law Division judge held that the arbitrator erred in finding for Dr. Poller on the Ledesma claim on the basis that the two year statute of limitations was tolled by virtue of the communications from plaintiff carrier. However, the judge upheld the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>decision regarding patient Genao from whom Dr. Poller had not obtained an assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Plaintiff contends that the Law Division \u201capplied the appropriate scope of review\u201d and correctly found that the Ledesma \u201carbitration award was not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record and its legal conclusions were inconsistent with the law.\u201d It further argues that neither patient \u201cprovided a valid assignment\u201d and that the Law Division properly ruled for the carrier in the Genao arbitration on this ground. In essence, plaintiff contends that because an insured has the \u201coption\u201d to submit a PIP dispute to \u201cbinding arbitration\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5(b), review of a carrier\u2019s challenge to an award to the claimant \u201cshould be more extensive than the limited judicial review had under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:24r-8 to parties who voluntarily agree to submit their dispute to binding arbitration.\u201d <em>Div. 540 v. Mercer County Improvement Authority, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>245, 253, 386 A.2d 1290 (1978). Plaintiff argues that a carrier should be entitled to review of a PIP arbitrator\u2019s award as if the matter involved a public interest or public sector arbitration because its participation is involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In <em>Habick v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 727 A.2d 51 (App.Div.1999), we recently rejected a similar argument. Although addressing an insured\u2019s challenge to the determination of a PIP arbitrator, we there addressed the proper scope of review when either the carrier or the insured challenges the arbitrator\u2019s award. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">The standard of review of the public sector arbitrator\u2019s decision in either interest or grievance arbitration is broader than it would be for private, voluntary arbitration under <em>Tretina [Printing v. Fitzpatrick &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>349, 640 A.2d 788 (1994)]____ Only in interest arbitration must the award also be supported by substantial credible evidence. [Citation oihitted.] Plaintiff fails to note the distinction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">The rationale for the broader public sector standards of review is essentially bottomed on fairness to the parties, for whom arbitration of collective bargaining agreements is compulsory, [citations omitted]; the public\u2019s interest in avoiding violations of law or public policy; and protection of the public welfare. [Citations omitted.] Plaintiff would have us conclude that the same rationale requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>broader standard of review when an insuror seeks to vacate or modify a PIP arbitration award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">Plaintiff reasons that because only the insured, and not the insuror, can choose to arbitrate a PIP claim the insuror should not be limited by the <em>Tretina </em>standard. From that proposition, plaintiff argues that it would be unfair and contrary to the policy of encouraging PIP arbitration to apply a stricter standard of review to the insured than to the insuror; therefore a broader standard of review should apply to all PIP arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">We assume that the same standard of review should apply irrespective of which party is dissatisfied with a PIP arbitration\u2019s outcome, <em>cf. Division 510, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, n. 4, 386 A.2d 1290. Because PIP arbitration elected by the insured becomes mandatory for the carrier, plaintiff would have us view the carrier\u2019s challenge to an arbitration award as if it were the result of mandatory public sector arbitration. While that contention may have some facial validity, closer examination leads us to a different view. We reject plaintiffs premise that it would be unfair to subject the insuror to the limited <em>Tretina </em>standard of review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">Although the terms of PIP coverage, including the insured\u2019s right to elect arbitration, are mandated by statute, the carrier\u2019s participation in this market, circumscribed as it is by state law, is nevertheless voluntary. The PIP carrier has entered into a contract with its insured. Moreover, unlike the insured, whose interest lies in the outcome of a single PIP arbitration, the carrier\u2019s interest lies more in a predictable, consistent procedure and scope of review applicable across the board to all of the PIP arbitrations it faces. While a broader standard might allow the carrier to prevail in vacating certain arbitration awards it deems erroneous, such a standard would also jeopardize the finality of those awards the carrier deems favorable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">Additionally, to allow a substantial-eredible-evidenee test of a PIP award would require a verbatim record, with the attendant expense and delay that PIP arbitration is intended to avoid. The net result would be to defeat the overall purpose of, and public policy behind, PIP arbitration: to provide a prompt, efficient, and inexpensive means of dispute resolution that will minimize and not maximize resort to the courts. We therefore see no fundamental unfairness in holding both sides to the limited scope of review mandated by <em>Tretina. </em>We are satisfied that PIP arbitration warrants no different standard. Thus to the extent that plaintiffs contention is that the arbitrator was wrong because he believed the wrong expert, her appeal from the confirmed award is without merit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\"><em>[Habick v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 252, 727 A.2d 51.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">We adhere to <em>Habiek </em>and apply it to the review of a PIP arbitration award challenged by the carrier. As a result, the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test does not apply. Moreover, as the carrier does not challenge the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority or assert a basis for relief for \u201cfraud, corruption, or similar wrongdoing\u201d as provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-8 and -9, <em>see Tretina Printing, Inc. v. Fitzpatrick &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>349, 358, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>640 A.2d 788 (1994), there was no basis on which to disturb the arbitrator\u2019s award regarding Ledesma. Similarly, the arbitrator\u2019s denial of an award for the services relating to Genao cannot be disturbed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Law Division is affirmed on the Genao claim and reversed as to the Ledesma claim. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of an amended judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> R. 1:36-3 provides that \"[n]o unpublished opinion shall constitute precedent or be binding upon any court,\" and with certain exceptions not here applicable, \"no unpublished opinion shall be cited by any court.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-11\"> We have this date filed our opinion in <em>Clarendon National Insurance v.
