Defendant perceived Krell to have been unremorseful about his role in the tragedy and antagonistic towards defendant\u2019s family during subsequent legal proceedings in which Krell was convicted of only a misdemeanor for his involvement in Charlie\u2019s death. The only issue at defendant\u2019s trial was whether he was legally insane at the time of the incident. The prosecutor\u2019s expert witness opined that he was not, while defendant\u2019s expert opined that he was. Although these expert witnesses were the only doctors who testified at defendant\u2019s trial, their opinions regarding defendant\u2019s sanity were not the only expert opinions before the jury. Rather, defendant\u2019s jury was repeatedly told about the diagnosis of a third expert who was conspicuously absent from defendant\u2019s trial \u2014 a psychiatrist unaffiliated with either the prosecution or the defense, and the only doctor to have examined defendant within days of the incident, who, in a report that was reviewed by the other experts but never authenticated and offered into evidence, diagnosed defendant as suffering from \u201c[mjajor depression, single episode, severe without psychosis.\u201d We conclude that the use of this power<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ful, tiebreaking diagnosis as substantive evidence of defendant\u2019s sanity compromised his constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate defendant\u2019s convictions, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">On June 16, 2006, defendant\u2019s teenage son, Charlie, was killed in an automobile accident. Defendant describes the accident as a road rage incident, in which a car driven by Randy Krell allegedly engaged in a high-speed chase that resulted in the crash of another car in which Charlie was a passenger, killing Charlie and rendering another teenage passenger in the same car a paraplegic. The drivers of both vehicles were charged with vehicular manslaughter. The driver of the car in which Charlie was a passenger pleaded guilty to a lesser offense and apologized to defendant\u2019s family. Krell opted to go to trial, claiming his innocence. He was convicted of negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to six months in jail and probation. During the proceedings, defendant perceived Krell as insulting and antagonizing to his family. Krell never apologized.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">According to his relatives, friends, and colleagues, defendant experienced a significant change in his mood and behavior after Charlie was killed. Defendant saw a psychologist and was prescribed an antidepressant (Prozac) and an antianxiety medication (Xanax). On March 27, 2007, defendant watched his son\u2019s school baseball team play what would have been the first game of Charlie\u2019s varsity season. Witnesses described defendant as depressed and uncommunicative at the time. There were several indications that he was thinking of suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The next day, defendant drove to Krell\u2019s house with a gun. Krell testified that he saw defendant get out of his car with a gun in his hand and that defendant pointed the gun at his chest and said that the two men had to talk. Krell ran across the street to the home of a neighbor, Thomas Williams, who let Krell in. Defendant kicked in the door and told Williams, \u201cI\u2019m not here for you\u201d but for \u201chim.\u201d Krell ran out the back of the house. Someone else called 911. Defendant left in his car and drove to his mother\u2019s home in Toledo, Ohio, where he hid the gun in a register and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The police and defendant\u2019s family and friends looked for defendant after he left Williams\u2019s house. Attorneys who had represented defendant\u2019s family were also involved in the search and were in frequent contact with the Monroe County Prosecutor and the police. Eventually, a family friend found defendant at a gas station, approximately 20 miles away near Toledo, Ohio, and drove him to Flower Hospital in Toledo. Defendant was arrested en route to the hospital. One of the lawyers arranged for defendant\u2019s admission to the hospital and declined to allow the police to interview him because of his condition. Defendant was taken to a crisis center, where he spent the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The next day, defendant was admitted to the psychiatric intensive care unit at Flower Hospital. There, he was examined by Dr. Agha Shahid, who prepared a three-page report on defendant\u2019s psychiatric condition on March 30, 2007, two days after the incident. Defendant was prescribed Seroquel, an antipsychotic medication, and remained at Flower Hospital for approximately two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Defendant claimed to have little recollection of what he did on the day of the incident. He remembered sitting in his car at work in the morning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>crying. Witnesses saw defendant curled up in a fetal position in his car, rocking back and forth. The next thing he remembered was a red plastic couch at the crisis center in Toledo. He did not remember going to his mother\u2019s home, he did not remember the first couple days of his hospitalization, and he did not remember being interviewed by Dr. Shahid.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Defendant was charged with first-degree home invasion, MCL 750.110a(2), two counts of felonious assault with a dangerous weapon, MCL 750.82, and felony-firearm, MCL 750.227b. He claimed that he was legally insane at the time of the incident on March 28, 2007. The prosecutor presented the expert testimony of Dr. Jennifer Balay, a psychologist who examined defendant at the Michigan Center for Forensic Psychiatry in May 2007. Dr. Balay said that defendant was mentally ill, but she did not think that he was legally insane at the time of the offense. Specifically, she concluded that defendant \u201cwas not psychotic at anytime during this depression.\u201d Defendant presented the expert testimony of Dr. Zubin Mistry, a clinical psychologist who interviewed defendant on September 4, 2007. Dr. Mistry disagreed with Dr. Balay\u2019s assessment. He testified that defendant was legally insane at the time of the offense, concluding that defendant had experienced a \u201cmajor depressive episode with psychotic features\u201d or a \u201cbrief reactive psychosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Both Dr. Mistry and Dr. Balay reviewed Dr. Shahid\u2019s report in making their determinations regarding defendant\u2019s mental state. As the first witness presented by defendant, Dr. Mistry provided the requisite testimony needed for defendant to raise his insanity defense. Dr. Mistry testified that Dr. Shahid\u2019s report was one of many sources he had reviewed in reaching his opinion that defendant was legally insane at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>incident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his direct testimony, he never referenced Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis, never discussed any other doctor\u2019s diagnosis, and testified only as to his own diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Dr. Mistry was largely focused on Dr. Shahid, bringing out details about Dr. Shahid\u2019s professional credentials (\u201cHe\u2019s an M.D., psychiatrist, correct?\u201d) and Dr. Shahid\u2019s prior relationship to Dr. Mistry (\u201cDo you know Dr. Shahid?\u201d \u201cYou respect his opinion, correct?\u201d). At the end of this cross-examination, the prosecutor squarely placed Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis before the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\"><em>Q. </em>At the end of that report did you read Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\"><em>A. </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\"><em>Q. </em>You read where it says major depression, single episode,-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-11\"><em>Q. </em>-severe, without psychosis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\"><em>Q. </em>But you don\u2019t agree that the Defendant did not have a psychosis, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\"><em>A. </em>No. My opinion is different as to the diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The prosecutor later referred to Dr. Shahid\u2019s report in his examination of his own expert, Dr. Balay, again referring to Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis, and asking if Balay agreed with Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis. She answered yes. He also repeatedly mentioned Dr. Shahid and his diagnosis in closing arguments, telling the jury that \u201cit\u2019s real important to look at what Dr. Shahid had to say, even though he did not testify here before you.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel did not object to the questioning of the witnesses on the basis of Dr. Shahid\u2019s report and diagnosis or to the prosecutor\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The jury found defendant guilty but mentally ill of the charged offenses. He was sentenced to 45 months to 20 years in prison for the home invasion conviction, 1 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>4 years for each of the felonious-assault convictions, and 2 years for the felony-firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Defendant appealed in the Court of Appeals and moved for an evidentiary hearing regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals granted defendant\u2019s motion. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>People v Fackelman, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued August 27, 2009 (Docket No. 284512). The court rejected defendant\u2019s challenges to the use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s report at his trial, concluding that the prosecutor had proceeded properly in his use of the report in all instances except in his direct examination of Dr. Balay and that defendant could not show outcome-determinative prejudice with respect to that error. We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. <em>People v Fackelman, </em>486 Mich 907 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Whether the admission of Dr. Shahid\u2019s opinion regarding defendant\u2019s mental state violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation is a question of constitutional law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>People v Jackson, </em>483 Mich 271, 277; 769 NW2d 630 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">A. RIGHT OF CONFRONTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>with the witnesses against him . . . US Const, Am VI. Since its birth as a state, Michigan has also afforded a criminal defendant the right to \u201cbe confronted with the witnesses against him,\u201d adopting this language of the federal Confrontation Clause verbatim in every one of our state constitutions. Const 1839, art 1, \u00a7 10; Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 28; Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 19; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20. These constitutional provisions are underscored by MCL 763.1, which provides a criminal defendant the express right to \u201cmeet the witnesses who are produced against him face to face.\u201d These exact words have been codified in Michigan law since 1846. 1846 RS, ch 151, \u00a7 1; 1857 CL 5704; 1871 CL 7503; How Stat 9068; 1897 CL 11796; 1915 CL 15623; 1929 CL 17129.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">\u201cThese constitutional and statutory provisions are not accidental. They were incorporated in the jurisprudence of this country by reason of the universal condemnation of the inquisitorial methods of the star chamber which had been in force in England.\u201d <em>People v Saccoia, </em>268 Mich 132, 135; 255 NW 738 (1934). Specifically, the right to a face-to-face meeting with one\u2019s accusers described in MCL 763.1 is deeply rooted in the common-law right of confrontation. It can be directly traced back to the paradigmatic violation of this right, <em>The Trial of Sir Walter Raleigh for High Treason, 1603, </em>2 Cobbett\u2019s Complete Collection of State Trials 1 (T. B. Howell, ed, 1809), in which Sir Walter Raleigh was convicted of treason after being denied the opportunity to confront his alleged accomplice and accuser, Lord Cobham, who had implicated him in a letter that was read to the jury. On trial for his life, Raleigh urged, \u201cIf there be but a trial of five marks at Common Law, a witness must be deposed. Good my lords, let my Accuser come face to face, and be deposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>This was the notorious example of unfairness that the Framers had in mind and wished to avoid when they guaranteed every criminal defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. To John Adams, who later drafted the Massachusetts Confrontation Clause, the contours of this right were quite clear: \u201cEvery Examination of Witnesses ought to be in open Court, in Presence of the Parties, Face to Face.\u201d 30 Wright &amp; Graham, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, Evidence, \u00a7 6345, pp 521-522 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The great virtue of confrontation and cross-examination, repeatedly emphasized in founding-era documents, is that these mechanisms advance the pursuit of truth in criminal trials better than any others. See 3 Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (Jones, ed, 1976), p 373:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">This open examination of witnesses <em>viva voce, </em>in the presence of all mankind, is much more conducive to the clearing up of truth, than [a] private and secret examination ... [given that] a witness may frequently depose that in private which he will be ashamed to testify in a public and solemn tribunal.... Besides, the occasional questions of the judge, the jury, and the counsel, propounded to the witnesses on a sudden, will sift out the truth much better than a formal set of interrogatories previously penned and settled; and the confronting of adverse witnesses is also another opportunity of obtaining a clear discovery, which can never be had upon any other method of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">See also Hale, The History of the Common Law of England (6th ed, 1820), p 345:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">[OJftentimes witnesses will deliver [in private] that, which they will be shamed to testify publicly. ... [M]any times the very MANNER of delivering testimony, will give a probable indication, whether the witness speaks truly or falsely.... [Cross-examination] beats and boults out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>truth much better.... [A]nd [is] the best method of searching and sifting out the truth ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Our country\u2019s Sixth Amendment jurisprudence has never lost sight of the truth-seeking function of the right of confrontation. See, e.g. <em>Mattox v United States, </em>156 US 237, 242-243; 15 S Ct 337; 39 L Ed 409 (1895);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>California v Green, </em>399 US 149, 158; 90 S Ct 1930; 26 L Ed 2d 489 (1970) ;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Crawford v Washington, </em>541 US 36, 61; 124 S Ct 1354; 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This historical understanding underscores that \u201cthe con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>frontation guarantee serves not only symbolic goals. The right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses is primarily a functional right that promotes reliability in criminal trials.\u201d <em>Lee v Illinois, </em>476 US 530, 540; 106 S Ct 2056; 90 L Ed 2d 514 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In pursuit of the Clause\u2019s truth-seeking purpose, our criminal jurisprudence is clear, then, that \u201c[a] person accused of a crime has a right, at his trial, to be confronted, face to face, with the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>People v Nutter, </em>255 Mich 207, 215; 237 NW 384 (1931). We also know that the Confrontation Clause applies only to statements used as substantive evidence. Cf. <em>Tennessee v Street, </em>471 US 409, 413-414; 105 S Ct 2078; 85 L Ed 2d 425 (1985) (holding that evidence admitted solely for impeachment purposes did not violate the Confrontation Clause); see also <em>People v McPherson, </em>263 Mich App 124, 133; 687 NW2d 370 (2004). And we understand from the constitution that the right of confrontation is concerned with a specific type of out-of-court statement, i.e., the statements of \u201cwitnesses,\u201d those people who bear testimony against a defendant. <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In light of these venerable legal principles, it is clear that defendant was denied his constitutional right of confrontation. Dr. Shahid did not appear at defendant\u2019s trial, and defendant was not afforded \u201cthe privilege to confront [him] and cross-examine [him] face to face . . . .\u201d <em>Snyder v Massachusetts, </em>291 US 97, 106; 54 S Ct 330; 78 L Ed 674 (1934), overruled on other grounds by <em>Malloy v Hogan, 378 </em>US 1; 84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964). Defendant was not given a prior opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Shahid, nor was it shown that the doctor was unavailable to testify at trial so that his absence could be excused for purposes of the right of confrontation. See 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>(8th ed), p 664, articulating one of the few exceptions to the confrontation rule: \u201cIf the witness was sworn . .., and the accused had an opportunity then to cross-examine him, ... it seems allowable to make use of his [testimony] ... if the witness has since deceased, or has left the State, or is insane, or sick and unable to testify . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Moreover, our review of the record leads inescapably to the conclusion that Dr. Shahid was a true \u201cwitness against\u201d defendant. The ultimate issue at trial was not whether defendant had actually engaged in the conduct that led to the criminal charges; instead, it was whether he was legally insane at the time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At trial, the medical term that both testifying experts used as shorthand for describing legal insanity was \u201cpsychosis,\u201d which, as the prosecutor\u2019s expert explained to the jury, is \u201cwhen a person loses touch with reality.\u201d Repeatedly, the jury\u2019s attention was focused on this particular mental state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The experts defined \u201cpsychosis,\u201d described the symptoms of a person in a \u201cpsychotic state,\u201d debated whether a person \u201ccould slip in and out of [psychosis] at various time frames,\u201d offered their opinions regarding the effect of psychosis on memory, and rendered their own diagnoses in terms of whether defendant was experiencing psychosis, with the defense expert, Dr. Mistry, concluding that he was and the prosecution\u2019s expert, Dr. Balay, concluding that he was not. In this context, the prosecutor\u2019s improper introduction and repeated use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis that defendant was not, in fact, experiencing psychosis fully rendered the doctor a witness against defendant. \u201cIn short, when the State elected to introduce [the statement of a nontestifying scientific expert], [that expert] became a witness [the defendant] had the right to confront.\u201d <em>Bullcoming v New Mexico, </em>564 US_,_; 131 S Ct 2705, 2716; 180 L Ed 2d 610 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Our review of the record also makes clear that Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis of \u201c[m]ajor depression, single episode, severe without psychosis\u201d was used as substantive evidence for \u201cthe truth of the matter asserted.\u201d MRE 801(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Its admission for this purpose was barred by the Confrontation Clause. Cf. <em>Street, </em>471 US at 413-414. The prosecutor went well beyond the scope of the direct examination and placed Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis before the jury in his cross-examination of Dr. Mistry, who, very significantly, had not referred to Shahid\u2019s critical diagnosis in his direct testimony. Then, the prosecutor explicitly used Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis in his examination of both experts and in closing arguments. On each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>occasion, the obvious use of the diagnosis was as substantive evidence for its truth \u2014 that defendant was not experiencing psychosis as a result of the circumstances of his son\u2019s death and his perception of Krell\u2019s conduct. The prosecutor did not use Dr. Shahid\u2019s opinion to impeach his own witness, Dr. Balay, who agreed with Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis. Nor does it make sense to suggest that Dr. Shahid\u2019s opinion impeached Dr. Mistry\u2019s credibility, except insofar as it provided an independent piece of substantive evidence weighing in favor of the competing view of Dr. Balay.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis of no psychosis could only impeach or support the other experts\u2019 opinions if it was taken as true, something the prosecutor made clear in his closing arguments when he told the jury that \u201cit\u2019s real important to look at what Dr. Shahid had to say, even though he did not testify here before you\u201d and then proceeded to rely on Dr. Shahid\u2019s opinion as a third expert\u2019s vote on defendant\u2019s sanity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">And then I went to the conclusion part and said: Well, Dr. Mistry, why.is it then that Dr. Shahid says here that there\u2019s no psychosis and you say there was a psychosis. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the most he could say was: Well, different people have different opinions. Well, that\u2019s true, different people can have different opinions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">. .. And I submit to you from what you\u2019ve heard from Dr. Mistry, from what you\u2019ve heard from Dr. Balay, and the references you\u2019ve heard to Dr. Shahid\u2019s report, there aren\u2019t any real reasons behind Dr. Mistry\u2019s conclusion that the Defendant was suffering from a psychosis, not any real reason at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Finally, we conclude that Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis unquestionably falls within the \u201ccore class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements\u201d that are subject to the Confrontation Clause. <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 51. The report memorialized defendant\u2019s medical history and the events that led to his admittance to the hospital, provided the all-important diagnosis, and outlined a plan for treatment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It was Dr. Shahid\u2019s \u201ctestimony\u201d regarding defendant\u2019s mental illness, his \u201c \u2018solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting 2 Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">And Dr. Shahid\u2019s report was \u201c \u2018made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52 (citation omitted); see also <em>Melendez-Diaz v Massachusetts, </em>557 US 305, 310; 129 S Ct 2527; 174 L Ed 2d 314 (2009) (quoting <em>Crawford </em>and employing this test to ascertain that the statement at issue was testimonial). Specifically, the following indications, taken together, are highly probative in this respect: (1) defendant\u2019s admittance to the hospital was arranged by lawyers, (2) defendant was arrested en route to the hospital, (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>report noted that the Monroe County Sheriff requested notification before defendant\u2019s discharge, (4) defendant referred to a trial and to a gun in his responses related in the report, and, perhaps most significantly, (5) at its very beginning and ending, in which its overall context is most clearly identified, the report expressly focused on defendant\u2019s alleged crime and the charges pending against him. In the introductory paragraph, Dr. Shahid stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">47-year-old Caucasian married male was referred by Rescue Crisis Mental Health Services with an emergency application indicating that the patient\u2019s son was killed eight months ago in a traffic accident, and the patient drove to the man\u2019s home with a gun who patient felt was responsible for the death of his son. Patient has severe depression and had suicidal thoughts to overdose. The emergency application also indicated that the Monroe County sheriff wants to be called when the patient is discharged to home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Then in the very last paragraph, Dr. Shahid again referred to the criminal charges pending against defendant, listing these charges in precise legal language: \u201cPatient also has legal charges against him through the State of Michigan 38th Judicial Circuit, and count one is home invasion, first degree, and count two is assault with a dangerous weapon (felonious assault).\u201d Under these circumstances, an \u201c \u2018objective [psychiatrist would] reasonably [be led] to believe that [his statements] would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 52 (citation omitted); <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 US at 310.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>our judgment, the admission in evidence of Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis, an out-of-court, testimonial statement offered for its truth, violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">B. EVIDENTIARY ERRORS</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">There are other reasons why the use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s report at defendant\u2019s trial was improper. First, MRE 703 provides that \u201c[t]he facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference <em>shall be in evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This rule permits \u201can expert\u2019s opinion only if that opinion is based exclusively on evidence that has been introduced into evidence in some way other than through the expert\u2019s hearsay testimony.\u201d 468 Mich xcv, xcvi (staff comment to the 2003 amendment of MRE 703).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">It is undisputed that both Dr. Mistry and Dr. Balay reviewed Dr. Shahid\u2019s report in making their determinations regarding defendant\u2019s mental state. Indeed, Dr. Balay specifically testified that Dr. Shahid\u2019s report constituted a \u201cbig part\u201d of her opinion. It is understandable why the testifying doctors would rely heavily on Dr. Shahid\u2019s report, given that he was the only doctor to evaluate defendant shortly after the offense. Thus, the facts and data documented in his report provided distinctive insight into defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the offense. Because the facts and data in Dr. Shahid\u2019s report were essential to the testifying experts\u2019 opinions, they were required to have been admitted into evidence under MRE 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">However, Dr. Shahid\u2019s report contained more than just \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cdata\u201d; it also contained the doctor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>all-important diagnosis. Under MRE 703, only the facts and data contained in the report were admissible. As previously discussed, Dr. Shahid\u2019s actual <em>diagnosis, </em>a testimonial statement offered for its truth, was barred by the Confrontation Clause. In addition to this constitutional barrier, the diagnosis itself was inadmissible under MRE 703 because it constituted an \u201copinion,\u201d and thus did not fall within the ambit of MRE 703, which renders admissible only the <em>\u201cfacts </em>or <em>data </em>. . . upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, because the diagnosis was inadmissible, under the United States Constitution, the Michigan Constitution, and MRE 703, the report should have been redacted before it was admitted into evidence, and the jury should have been instructed that the proper and limited purpose of the report was to allow them to consider the facts and data on which the testifying experts based their opinions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Second, contrary to the prosecutor\u2019s contention, Dr. Shahid\u2019s report, including his diagnosis, was not admissible at defendant\u2019s trial under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, MRE 803(6). As a \u201creport . . . [of] opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge,\u201d Dr. Shahid\u2019s report may well have fallen within the scope of the business records exception, but the rule requires that its elements \u201call [be] shown by the testimony of the <em>custodian or other qualified witness </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, a recordkeeper or other qualified witness from Flower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Hospital would have had to testify for the report to have been properly admitted. This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Finally, we note that even if the prosecutor had sought to admit the entire report pursuant to the procedures required by MRE 803(6), any testimonial statements contained in the report offered for their truth would have been inadmissible under the business records exception. See <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 61 (\u201cWhere testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence . . . .\u201d). Because, as we have already determined, Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis constituted a testimonial statement offered for its truth, it could not have been admitted under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">C. PLAIN ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Because defense counsel did not object to the use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s report, we review these constitutional and evidentiary errors for plain error affecting defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 763-764; 597 NW2d 130 (1999).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We conclude that defendant is entitled to relief under this standard. The violations of defendant\u2019s right of confrontation and the evidentiary errors were clear and obvious. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>defendant can show that the errors resulted in outcome-determinative prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 763. As discussed previously, the ultimate issue at trial was whether defendant was legally insane at the time of the incident, or, in the parlance used at trial, whether he was experiencing psychosis. In assessing the effect of Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis on the jury\u2019s determination regarding this issue, three facts strike us as significant. First, Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis of no psychosis provided a tiebreaking expert opinion in a trial that is fairly characterized as a battle of two experts. Second, Dr. Shahid was the only expert unaffiliated with either party. Third and most importantly, he was the only doctor to have examined defendant within days of the incident, at a time when defendant may still have been experiencing a psychotic episode. The other experts did not interview defendant until months later, when defendant had been on antipsychotic medication for some time. Thus, both the defense and prosecutor\u2019s experts were necessarily trying to re-create defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime. Dr. Shahid was the only doctor who had personal knowledge concerning this dispositive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In sum, a reasonable juror evaluating the difficult issue of defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense could not have overlooked the significance of Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis, which constituted the tiebreaking, neutral expert opinion of the only doctor who had personal knowledge regarding whether defendant was experiencing symptoms of psychosis near the time of the offense. That defendant was not accorded the opportunity to meet this all-important witness \u201cface to face\u201d and to subject him to cross-examination clearly resulted in prejudice. Even a surface review of this record leaves one with many questions for Dr. Shahid\u2019s empty witness chair. For instance, what precisely were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the reasons for his diagnosis? How did he reconcile his diagnosis with certain objective indicators of the severity of defendant\u2019s mental illness documented in the report, such as the fact that Dr. Shahid assigned defendant a Global Assessment of Functioning score of 20 out of 100, which Dr. Mistry opined indicated a \u201csignificant level of impairment or likelihood to harm oneself or . .. others\u201d; that defendant was prescribed an antipsychotic medication; that defendant had attempted suicide; that defendant had been admitted to the psychiatric intensive care unit for his safety; and that, although defendant was \u201cdenying auditory or visual hallucinations\u201d at the time of the examination, defendant stated that, after his son\u2019s death, \u201c T was smelling things and I felt things crawling under my skin\u2019 \u201d? Moreover, did defendant actually make the statements attributable to him in Dr. Shahid\u2019s report, or did Dr. Shahid obtain the statements from another source, such as a police report?<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As Dr. Mistry stated when the prosecutor asked him this exact question, \u201cThat would be a question for Dr. Shahid.\u201d Indeed, <em>all </em>these questions are questions for Dr. Shahid, and they went unanswered because he did not testify at defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The evidentiary errors that occurred at defendant\u2019s trial compounded the prejudice caused by the violation of his right of confrontation. In contravention of the mandate in MRE 703 that the report be \u201cin evidence,\u201d and in spite of the fact that a juror, whose curiosity was understandably piqued by the frequent references to Dr. Shahid\u2019s report, expressly requested to see the \u201creports that the attorneys were speaking of and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>doctors were speaking [of] too,\u201d the jury was never allowed to examine the report for itself. This error was especially prejudicial to defendant because the prosecutor had imprecisely characterized the contents of Dr. Shahid\u2019s report. Specifically, in closing, the prosecutor discussed the statements attributable to defendant in the report and told the jury that defendant \u201cseemed to remember a lot of things\u201d about his altercation with Krell.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In actuality, however, the report consistently documented defendant\u2019s inability to remember all but a few details of the incident.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because the report was not \u201cin evidence\u201d as required by MRE 703, the jury was unable to assess the accuracy of the prosecutor\u2019s statements against the facts and data contained in the report and was more likely to have accepted the prosecutor\u2019s characterizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Moreover, because the prosecutor never attempted to satisfy the foundational requirements of the business records exception and to authenticate the report, the jury was not given the most basic information it needed to properly consider this document. That is, it was never established that the report was what the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>tor asserted it to be \u2014 a report (1) that contained \u201cinformation transmitted by. . . a person with knowledge [Dr. Shahid],\u201d (2) that was \u201ckept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity,\u201d and (3) that it was \u201cthe regular practice of [Flower Hospital] to make . . ..\u201d MRE 803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In summary, Dr. Shahid did not appear at trial, he was not subject to cross-examination, and his report was neither in evidence nor authenticated. We have little difficulty concluding that the principal error here \u2014 the violation of defendant\u2019s right of confrontation \u2014 was outcome-determinative. <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 763. As discussed, Dr. Shahid was the only doctor to examine defendant within days of the incident and, thus, the only expert with personal knowledge of defendant\u2019s mental state immediately after the offense. In this way, the trials of defendant and Sir Walter Raleigh, though separated by centuries and factually unrecognizable, were fundamentally deficient in the same way: at the public trial at which their guilt or innocence was determined, neither man was confronted \u201cface to face\u201d with the most important witness against him. This constitutional error was compounded by the multiple evidentiary errors that resulted from the haphazard manner in which Dr. Shahid\u2019s report was handled at trial. The effect of these errors gave the prosecutor the best of all possible worlds and defendant the worst of these. The prosecutor was able to employ Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis as substantive evidence that defendant was not experiencing psychosis at the time of the incident, without Dr. Shahid having to explain his diagnosis on cross-examination; able to err in his description of the contents of Dr. Shahid\u2019s report without the report being in evidence; and able to rely on a hearsay report without having to prove its authenticity and accuracy in the manner prescribed by MRE 803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Once a defendant demonstrates outcome-determinative plain error, an appellate court must exercise its discretion in deciding whether to reverse. <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 763. \u201cReversal is warranted only when the plain, forfeited error resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or when an error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings independent of the defendant\u2019s innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted). Both of these considerations move us in our discretion to vacate defendant\u2019s convictions. Defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence under the law depends on whether he was legally sane at the time of the offense and thus may be held criminally responsible. It was not only the understandable grief caused by the loss of a child that defined defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense, but also his feelings of being abused both by the man he believed was responsible for his son\u2019s death and by the legal system that treated this man\u2019s actions as a mere misdemeanor. Considering this background, it is imperative that defendant have the opportunity to be confronted with the most powerful witness against him before his guilt or innocence is decided. In this process, defendant was denied an ancient right in our criminal system, one on which our adversarial system is premised. If not redressed, this error would, in our judgment, seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">IV RESPONSE TO DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">It is necessary to respond more fully to the disagreements between this opinion and the dissent, specifically with regard to the dissent\u2019s sua sponte argument that defendant somehow waived his right to confront Dr. Shahid, and with respect to our differing perspectives on the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>A. WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The dissent would hold that \u201cdefendant affirmatively waived his right to confront Dr. Shahid because he chose, as a matter of trial strategy, not to call him as a witness.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 574. As the prosecutor understood, but the dissent does not, this argument is indefensible.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Waiver has been defined as \u201cthe \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 762 n 7, quoting <em>United States v Olano, </em>507 US 725, 733; 113 S Ct 1770; 123 L Ed 2d 508 (1993). The dissent does not claim that defendant affirmatively waived his constitutional right when his counsel expressed satisfaction with a court ruling allowing the prosecutor\u2019s use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis, because no such ruling was made. Cf. <em>People v Carter, </em>462 Mich 206, 215; 612 NW2d 144 (2000). Nor does the dissent claim that defendant affirmatively waived his constitutional right because his counsel was aware of the confrontation violation at trial but knowingly stood silent, because it is clear this is not what occurred. Specifically, at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing, counsel expressly testified that he did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s report only because he did not recognize it as a confrontation violation; thus, he could not, and did not, <em>intentionally </em>relinquish a <em>known </em>right. Nor does the dissent claim that defendant affirmatively waived his constitutional right by himself placing Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis in evidence because this also did not take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Instead, as noted earlier, the dissent claims that defendant waived his constitutional right to confronta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tion because \u201che chose, as a matter of trial strategy, not to call him as a witness.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 574. Not only is the dissent\u2019s waiver argument incompatible with the traditional understanding of waiver, but it also violates several first-principles of criminal law: (1) insanity is an affirmative defense with respect to which a defendant carries the burden of proof, (2) rules of evidence cannot trump the constitution, and (3) the prosecutor bears the ultimate burden of proof in criminal cases. The dissent misapprehends and misapplies each of these first-principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">First, \u201cit is an affirmative defense to a prosecution for a criminal offense that the defendant was legally insane when he or she committed the acts constituting the offense,\u201d MCL 768.21a(l), and the defendant \u201chas the burden of proving the defense of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d MCL 768.21a(3). In accord with this framework, defendant\u2019s expert, Dr. Mistry, testified first on the issue of defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense. In his testimony, Dr. Mistry referenced Dr. Shahid\u2019s report, as well as other reports, but he never mentioned Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis. Thus, the dissent\u2019s insight, on which it bases its waiver argument \u2014 that \u201cit was <em>defendant </em>who first raised the issue of his insanity and who first opened the door to questioning about Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation\u201d \u2014 is considerably less remarkable than the dissent believes it to be, because there is simply no other way in which a defendant in these circumstances could conceivably have raised an insanity defense other than through the testimony of a credible expert witness. <em>Post </em>at 573. No such witness could have neglected altogether to mention the existence of the report of the only person who actually interviewed defendant in the immediate wake of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Second, the rules of evidence do not trump the Confrontation Clause. See <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 61 (\u201cWhere testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence ....\u201d). Thus, although parts of Dr. Shahid\u2019s report should have been in evidence under MRE 703 because they constituted \u201cthe facts or data... upon which an expert bases an opinion,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and although under MRE 106\u2019s \u2018rule of completeness\u2019 the whole document may sometimes be admitted,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> these rules necessarily give way to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause. Though parts of the report may have been admissible under the rules of evidence, the rules of evidence cannot override the Sixth Amendment and cannot be used to admit evidence that would otherwise implicate the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>The dissent\u2019s indignation over Dr. Mistry\u2019s \u201cselective\u201d use of the report illustrates its confusion on this point. <em>Post </em>at 573. Without a doubt, Dr. Mistry used the report \u201cselectively.\u201d That is precisely our point. On direct, he testified that he relied on the report, which contained facts and data that formed the basis of his opinion, but he never mentioned Dr. Shahid\u2019s actual diagnosis, an <em>opinion </em>that is neither a \u201cfact\u201d nor \u201cdata,\u201d and which did not form the basis of Dr. Mistry\u2019s contrary opinion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Such direct testimony regarding the report was entirely proper. Because this testimony defined the permissible scope of cross-examination and, more fundamentally, because the report contained the testimonial statement of a witness defendant had the right to confront, the prosecutor had to either: (1) proceed narrowly, employing the facts and data in the report on which the experts relied in forming their own opinions, but <em>not </em>Dr. Shahid\u2019s opinion; or (2) call Dr. Shahid to testify as to his opinions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Yet, the prosecutor did neither and instead placed Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Shahid\u2019s diagnosis before the jury during his cross-examination of Dr. Mistry; employed this same diagnosis in the examination of his own expert; and repeatedly referred to this same diagnosis in closing arguments, all without calling Dr. Shahid as a witness.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Third, the ultimate burden of proof rests with the prosecutor, and thus the obligation to bring to trial \u201cwitnesses against\u201d the accused is the state\u2019s, not the defendant\u2019s.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The dissent would turn on its head this principle by holding that \u201cdefendant affirmatively waived his right to confront Dr. Shahid because <em>he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>chose, as a matter of trial strategy, not to call him as a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Post </em>at 574 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The dissent can only arrive at its conclusion that defendant waived his right to confront Dr. Shahid by transforming first-principles of criminal law and creating a constitutional environment in which: (1) a criminal defendant must choose between raising an affirmative defense and his right of confrontation, (2) the rule of completeness is on par with the Sixth Amendment, and (3) the burden of proof may sometimes shift from the state to the accused to call witnesses against himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">B. <em>MELENDEZ-DIAZ</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Next, we must address the differing perspectives on the Confrontation Clause that exist between this opinion and that of the dissent. These differences are perhaps best understood by comparing the quotation that the dissent appears to believe lends the most support for its analysis \u2014 footnote 2 of Melendez-Diaz\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>with the quotation that we believe lends the most support for ours \u2014 the Confrontation Clause itself, which states: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d We respectfully believe that our analysis is on far surer constitutional footing than that of the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">First, it is necessary to provide some context to the quotation highlighted by the dissent \u2014 \u201c[M]edical reports created for treatment purposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision today\u201d \u2014 which is the dissent\u2019s summarization of footnote 2 of <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>The question presented in that case was whether affidavits reporting the results of laboratory analyses, admitted at trial to show that a substance seized by police was cocaine, violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. Justice Kennedy in dissent responded that the \u201cCourt [was] sweeping] away an accepted rule governing the admission of scientific evidence,\u201d and offered cases in support of this claim in two appendices. <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 US at 330, 357-363. Footnote 2 of the majority opinion sought to distinguish the cases cited by Justice Kennedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">Other[] [cases] are simply irrelevant, since they involved- medical reports created for treatment purposes, which would not be testimonial under our decision today. See, <em>e.g., Baber </em>v. <em>State, </em>775 So. 2d 258, 258-259 (Fla. 2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Garlick, </em>313 Md. 209, 223-225, 545 A. 2d 27, 34-35 (1988). <em>[Id. </em>at 312 n 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In comparing the actual footnote with the dissent\u2019s quotation, one discovers two highly relevant omissions. When these omissions are considered, and when this quotation is placed in context, it hardly serves as authority to sustain the dissent\u2019s sweeping proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>First, the dissent fails to account for the final phrase of the sentence it finds so all-important \u2014 \u201cunder our decision today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, the Supreme Court did not expressly state that a medical report created for treatment purposes is not a testimonial statement within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. What <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>actually stated was far narrower and more limited \u2014 that the cases collected by Justice Kennedy were \u201cirrelevant\u201d because they involved \u201cmedical reports created for treatment purposes,\u201d whereas <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>involved an affidavit made for the purpose of providing testimony at trial. <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>accurately stated that the medical reports cited by the dissent \u201cwould not be testimonial under our decision today\u201d because <em>that </em>decision did not involve a medical report created for treatment purposes. <em>Id. </em>Determining the circumstances under which a medical report created for treatment purposes could be considered testimonial was simply left for another day.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> That <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>did not hold what the dissent contends it held is supported by the fact that <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>did not in any way involve a medical report created for treatment purposes. Accordingly, the footnote is not only dictum, but it is dictum that in no way supports the dissent\u2019s assertion that <em>\u201cnone </em>of the nine justices who served on the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>Court would have included medical reports created for treatment purposes in the definition of testimonial statements.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 566. This assertion has no basis because the Supreme Court was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>presented with this question in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>and it has not been presented with this question in any subsequent case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Second, the dissent omits any reference to the two citations that directly follow its quotation, <em>Baber v State </em>and <em>State v Garlick. </em>Read in the context of these two cases, the footnote communicates a critical distinction that courts have made concerning medical records. This distinction is evidenced by even a cursory review of these two cases. Both <em>Baber </em>and <em>Garlick </em>involved hospital records of results of laboratory tests administered for medical treatment purposes, a blood alcohol test and a drug test, respectively. In each case, although the laboratory technicians did not testify at trial, other witnesses from the hospital did. In <em>Baber, </em>the hospital\u2019s medical records custodian laid a foundation under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, and the head of the hospital\u2019s chemistry department testified. <em>Baber, </em>775 So 2d at 259. In <em>Garlick, </em>the emergency room physician who treated the defendant and ordered the drug screening testified. <em>Garlick, </em>313 Md at 212.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In these circumstances, <em>Baber </em>and <em>Garlick </em>determined that the defendants\u2019 right of confrontation had not been violated, and by their citations of these cases, both opinions in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>suggested their agreement with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">However, neither <em>Baber </em>nor <em>Garlick </em>applied the \u201ctwo-part test,\u201d see part IV(C) of this opinion, that the dissent believes <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>adopted to arrive at a per se rule that the admission of a medical report created for treatment purposes can never violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Confrontation Clause. Indeed, after recognizing the traditional understanding of \u201cthe concept of confrontation as a device to advance the search for truth,\u201d <em>Garlick </em>expressly qualified its holding in a passage that is particularly relevant to the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">This is not to say, however, that there have not been some hospital records (or more precisely some entries within those records) that have been objectionable or found to have been inadmissible. For example, in <em>Gregory </em>v. State, 40 Md. App. 297, 325, 391 A.2d 437, 454 (1978), the medical staff conference summary containing the opinions of several psychiatrists was not admissible without their testimony. The court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">\u201cThe mere fact that a document is part of a hospital record made in the ordinary course of the hospital\u2019s business, and may therefore be admissible under the hearsay rule, does not <em>ipso facto </em>make its admission comply with the confrontation requirement... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">\u201cWe have here not the routine record of a person\u2019s birth, or death, or body temperature, not any other similar statement of fact or condition objectively ascertained, generally reliable and normally undisputed, and free from any motive to record falsely. We are dealing with the opinions of supposed expert witnesses, who, in this document, are giving testimony not only as to appellant\u2019s mental condition, but, more importantly, as to whether or not he is criminally responsible.\u201d [Garlick, 313 Md at 214, 220-221 (quotation marks and citation omitted).][<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">It is sufficient to observe that we too \u201care dealing with the opinions of a supposed expert witness [], who, in this document, [was] giving testimony not only as to appellant\u2019s mental condition, but, more importantly, as to whether or not he [was] criminally responsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Other courts have also recognized that not all hospital records can be treated in the same manner for purposes of the confrontation requirement and that psychiatric opinions, in particular, deserve special consideration. See, e.g., <em>Phillips v </em>Neil, 452 F2d 337, 347 (CA 6, 1971) (holding that admission of psychiatric hospital records opining on the sanity of the defendant violated the Confrontation Clause and noting the \u201cdanger which inheres in the introduction of records containing psychiatric diagnoses\u201d).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Having never addressed this issue, the Supreme Court has never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>expressly adopted this approach to the admission of medical records for purposes of confrontation, but it certainly has never rejected it, and, as observed, several cases cited approvingly in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>recognize this distinction.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to the dissent, footnote 2 does not set forth a per se rule regarding the admissibility of medical records under the Confrontation Clause. If anything, such footnote suggests an altogether different legal standard when it is viewed in context and, in particular, when it is understood in light of the two cases which the Court in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>selected from among the some 80 cases in Justice Kennedy\u2019s appendixes as the prime examples of medical reports that would not be testimonial within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment under its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">C. DISSENT\u2019S TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">It is also important to comment on the dissent\u2019s test for determining whether an extrajudicial statement is testimonial. The dissent recognizes that the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford </em>\u201cdid not delineate the scope of testimonial statements\u201d and that <em>Crawford </em>articulated several formulations of this concept. <em>Post </em>at 577. Nonetheless, the dissent proceeds to articulate its own test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">In reviewing <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny, it becomes clear that the Court considers two related factors above all others when deciding whether an extrajudicial statement is testimonial, and therefore within the parameters of the Confrontation Clause: the <em>formality </em>of the statement within a criminal investigation or prosecution and the <em>purpose </em>of the statement. <em>[Post </em>at 577-578.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>While the dissent\u2019s test, in our judgment, constitutes a not-unreasonable attempt to synthesize several very-difficult-to-synthesize Confrontation Clause decisions of the Supreme Court, the test must be recognized for what it is \u2014 an attempt to accord meaning to some very tortuous jurisprudence. The absence of any citation for the dissent\u2019s test underscores this reality. The dissent does not cite any Supreme Court decision in support of its \u201ctwo-part test,\u201d because no such decision exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bullcoming </em>does not alter this fact. In <em>Bullcoming, </em>564 US at_; 131 S Ct at 2710, 2713, the Court affirmed the central holding of <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>\u2014 that the right to confrontation applies to analysts who claim to have certified evidence from a machine or other objective scientific test- \u2014 and rejected the argument that the testimony of a \u201csurrogate\u201d expert was a constitutionally permissible substitute for the testimony of the individual who had actually conducted the test. Questions regarding the Court\u2019s confrontation clause jurisprudence persist after <em>Bullcoming. </em>See <em>id. </em>at _; 131 S Ct at 2725 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cToday\u2019s majority is not committed in equal shares to a common set of principles in applying the holding of <em>Crawford\u201d). </em>However, at the very least, <em>Bullcoming </em>clearly reconfirmed that the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of a scientific report, prepared in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution absent the testimony of the expert himself, regardless of the report\u2019s facial reliability and \u201ceven if [the scientists] possess the scientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of Mother Teresa.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at ; 131 S Ct at 2715 (majority opinion) (quotation marks and citation omitted.) In our judgment, Dr. Shahid\u2019s psychiatric opinions, which are necessarily grounded in subjective interpretations of the vagaries of the human mind, are at least as deserving of the constitution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>guaranteed protections of confrontation and cross-examination as the analyst\u2019s certification of a blood alcohol analysis in <em>Bullcoming. </em>See <em>supra </em>at 552-554.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">To be clear, we agree with the dissent that \u201csome meaning can \u2014 and must \u2014 be given to [the Supreme Court\u2019s confrontation] decisions.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 578 n 40. We too have parsed these cases to discern principles, and have come to what is, in our judgment, a reading that more accurately synthesizes the various holdings and that also adheres more closely to the actual language of the Confrontation Clause. The dissent disagrees. Specifically, it faults this opinion for \u201csubstitut[ing] an inquiry into the mere <em>foreseeability </em>of a statement\u2019s use at trial for an inquiry into the primary purpose for which the statement was created[, which] is simply contrary to the mandates of <em>Davis, Melendez-Diaz, </em>and most recently <em>Michigan v Bryant.\" Post </em>at 582. However, what the dissent disparages as \u201can inquiry into the mere <em>foreseeability </em>of a statement\u2019s use at trial,\u201d <em>post </em>at 582 is what <em>Crawford </em>expressly offered as one of three \u201cformulations of [the] core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements\u201d \u2014 statements that were made \u201cunder circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial[.]\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 51-52. <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 US at 310, reiterated and applied this exact language to determine that the statement at issue in that case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>testimonial. And no subsequent case has renounced this definition of a core testimonial statement.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In place of such explicit direction, the dissent contends that it has been able to divine from Supreme Court decisions an alternative, exclusive test to determine whether a statement is testimonial \u2014 \u201can inquiry into the primary purpose for which the statement was created.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 582. According to the dissent, this test is mandated by a proper application of <em>Davis, Melendez-Diaz, </em>and <em>Bryant. </em>See <em>post </em>at 582. Our reading of these cases is very different. As explained earlier, <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>definitely mandated no such thing. The words \u201cprimary purpose\u201d are found nowhere in the opinion, and that opinion expressly reiterated and relied on <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>formulation of \u201ctestimonial.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> And while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>Davis </em>and <em>Bryant </em>both employed a primary purpose inquiry to determine whether statements made to the police in the very specific context of an <em>ongoing emergency </em>were testimonial, those cases did not mandate that this was the exclusive test to be applied generally in Confrontation Clause cases. In fact, for the following reasons, we read <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bryant </em>as endorsing a quite different approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The primary purpose test was specifically crafted in <em>Davis </em>for the purpose of determining whether statements made in an ongoing-emergency context violated a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. <em>Davis, </em>547 US at 822. The test is relevant in that context, because generally the declarant is speaking to authorities <em>either </em>to obtain assistance in what is an ongoing emergency <em>or </em>\u201cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the test is critical in the ongoing-emergency context because proper characterization of such statements will <em>always </em>prove decisive as to whether these statements are testimonial or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Apart from the fact that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test has never been applied beyond the ongoing-emergency context, the specific \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test articulated by the dissent is considerably different from the actual \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test applied in <em>Davis, </em>547 US at 822, which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">This test obviously makes sense in the context for which it was specifically designed, emergency circumstances in which there is often ambiguity concerning the objectives or purposes of the declarant\u2019s utterances. However, outside that context, in more ordinary circumstances, the questions posed by the test are largely irrelevant, and the either/or characterization inherent in the limited context of the test is absent.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It is utterly unclear how a court would apply the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test outside the <em>Davis </em>context to a case in which no emergency is alleged \u2014 what alternative \u201cpurposes\u201d would be considered, and how would the resolution of which of these is \u201cprimary\u201d bear in any meaningful way on the principles inherent in the Confrontation Clause?<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> A \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test removed from its moorings would have little in common with the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test of <em>Davis </em>except for its nomenclature.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">We find support for our decision not to extend the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test beyond the ongoing-emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>context for which it was created and apply it as the exclusive, controlling test in this new context in the very Supreme Court caselaw that the dissent claims \u201cmandates\u201d that we apply its test. In fact, one principle clearly emerging from <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bryant </em>is that the circumstances and context in which the statement was made are highly relevant, if not determinative, in deciding whether its admission offends the Confrontation Clause. See <em>Davis, </em>547 US at 822, 827-830 (repeatedly emphasizing that statements are \u201ctestimonial when <em>the circumstances </em>objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Bryant, </em>562 US at_; 131 S Ct at 1156 (explaining how a \u201cnew context\u201d and circumstances \u201cconfront[ed] for the first time\u201d affected its ruling). Indeed, the one thing that does seem clear from recent Confrontation Clause decisions is that the Supreme Court has very explicitly not adopted a bright-line test for determining whether a statement is testimonial, and instead has developed its jurisprudence on a case-by-case basis. See, e.g., <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 68 (\u201cWe leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Davis, </em>547 US at 823 n 2 (\u201c[O]ur holding today makes it unnecessary to consider whether and when statements made to someone other than law enforcement personnel are \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d); <em>id. </em>at 830 n 5 (\u201cWe have acknowledged that our holding is not an \u2018exhaustive classification of all conceivable statements \u2014 or even all conceivable statements in response to police interrogation,\u2019 but rather a resolution of the cases before us ....\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Bryant, </em>562 US at_; 131 S Ct at 1158 (stating that whether a statement is testimonial requires a \u201chighly context-dependent inquiry\u201d).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>For these reasons, we find little merit in the dissent\u2019s contention that <em>Davis, Melendez-Diaz, </em>and <em>Bryant </em>mandate that we exclusively rely on a primary purpose inquiry to determine whether use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis, absent his testimony, implicated defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In examining recent Supreme Court cases on which the dissent rests its decision, it is apparent that the dissent\u2019s reading of these cases is hardly mandated. No Supreme Court decision has articulated the dissent\u2019s allegedly controlling \u201ctwo-part test,\u201d and there is much language in each of the decisions relied on by the dissent to suggest that it is a test made out of whole cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">D. CONFRONTATION CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">We are not unsympathetic to the dissent\u2019s inability to fashion a single all-purpose Confrontation Clause test from recent Supreme Court decisions. These decisions seem not entirely consistent, they employ varying constitutional tests and formulations for discerning Confrontation Clause violations, they are lengthy and susceptible to having their language taken out of context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>and the justices are sharply divided in these decisions, making it sometimes difficult to know which propositions of constitutional law have garnered the support of a majority of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Nonetheless, we believe that the dissent has erred in its deconstruction of a clause taken from a footnote in a sharply divided opinion of the Supreme Court and that, as a result, it has also erred in fashioning its own \u201cexclusive\u201d test synthesized from Supreme Court decisions, none of which has actually articulated that test and each of which has articulated language incompatible with that test. However difficult an exercise, this majority has also sought to abide by the direction of the Supreme Court and reached a very different result than the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">We believe, though, that our analysis would be incomplete if we did not respond to the dissent\u2019s \u201ctwo-part test\u201d with an alternative analysis of our own. This analysis is drawn from the actual language of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. As the \u201csupreme Law of the Land,\u201d US Const, art VI, cl 2, it seems appropriate to consult the actual language of the Constitution when Supreme Court caselaw is not altogether clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution reads, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him . ...\u201d By its straightforward terms, the Confrontation Clause directs inquiry into two questions: (1) Does the person in controversy comprise a \u201cwitness against\u201d the accused under the Confrontation Clause; and (2) if so, has the accused been afforded an opportunity to \u201cconfront\u201d that witness under the Confrontation Clause?</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>First, for the reasons set forth in part 111(A) of this opinion, we believe the accused here has satisfied the first inquiry by demonstrating that Dr. Shahid constituted a \u201cwitness against\u201d him. Indeed, we believe that Dr. Shahid was, by far, the most important \u201cwitness against\u201d him. Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis that defendant was not experiencing psychosis was employed by the prosecutor as substantive evidence that defendant was not, in fact, experiencing psychosis \u2014 a psychosis, incidentally, that any member of the jury could probably have easily understood as having arisen as a function of a parent perceiving that a criminal perpetrator who had caused the needless death of his teenage child was unremorseful and unrepentant about the occurrence and that the legal system was satisfied to punish this perpetrator with a six-month misdemeanor. Dr. Shahid\u2019s report went to the heart of the ultimate issue at trial, upon which defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence under the law entirely turned, and it was relied on by every other significant expert witness testifying on behalf of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Second, for the reasons set forth in part 111(A) of this opinion, we believe the accused here has satisfied the second inquiry by demonstrating that he had no opportunity to confront Dr. Shahid. The accused was never afforded the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Shahid, therefore ensuring that the accused would be unable to question Dr. Shahid; that the accused would be unable to require that Dr. Shahid look him in the eye in open court, face-to-face, in the presence of the judge and jury and respond to questions; and that the judge and jury would never be required to assess the demeanor, the assuredness, the expertise, and the credibility of Dr. Shahid.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s report against defendant absent any opportunity for cross-examination is exactly what the words of the Confrontation Clause prohibit \u2014 however finely the dissent chooses to parse footnote 2 of <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>By guaranteeing that \u201cthe accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him,\u201d the Framers of the Confrontation Clause sought to guarantee that what happened at defendant\u2019s trial would not happen within our criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Because we believe that defendant has been deprived of his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment, and because we believe he has suffered considerable prejudice as a result, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate defendant\u2019s convictions, and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b780-8\">Cavanagh, Marilyn Kelly, Hathaway (except for footnote 15 and part IV), and Mary Beth Kelly, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\"> Dr. Mistry explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-13\">You\u2019ll typically interview the individual, extensively observing their behaviors, their mannerisms, their patterns of behavior.

There can be no doubt that had the prosecutor moved to admit Dr. Shahid\u2019s report under the business records exception, and had defendant objected because no \u201ccustodian or other qualified witness\u201d was present to testify to the elements of MRE 803(6), the report could not have been admitted.

Had the prosecutor sought to admit the report as a business record (which he did not), and had the court required the prosecutor to comply with MRE 803(6) (which under the rule, it must), then a \u201ccustodian or <em>other qualified </em>witness\u201d from Flower Hospital would have been present at defendant\u2019s trial. Far and away, the witness from Flower Hospital <em>most </em>qualified to authenticate the report would have been Dr. Shahid himself, and, at least in our judgment, defendant suffered serious prejudice because of his absence at trial. See part III(C) of this opinion. However, even if the authenticating witness was merely a hospital recordkeeper, the dissent fails to appreciate that this witness still might well have provided meaningful information to the jury. For instance, this witness could have answered some basic questions that were never properly answered at defendant\u2019s trial, such as: Who is Dr. Shahid? Is his report the kind of record that is kept in the regular course of business at Flower Hospital? Do doctors in making such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>reports often refer to a patient\u2019s pending criminal charges?

The dissent\u2019s determination not to differentiate among statements within the report and consider each on its own merits strains its analysis from the start.

To the contrary, what this opinion concludes is that the statement at issue \u2014 Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis \u2014 was clearly <em>not </em>being used for impeachment. We also note that the prosecutor had many avenues of proper impeachment, including the utilization of the facts and data contained in Dr. Shahid\u2019s report relied on by the defense expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> We reiterate our view that the prosecutor\u2019s use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis on each of these occasions was clearly for the truth of the matter asserted. See <em>supra </em>at 530-532. The dissent disagrees, and goes to lengths to explain how the report was used for impeachment purposes. See <em>post </em>at 589-594. The problems with the dissent\u2019s analysis are threefold. First, it is not focused on the <em>diagnosis </em>as implicating the Confrontation Clause, hut rather lumps together the entirety of the report. Second, the dissent never even attempts to explain how a diagnosis such as Dr. Shahid\u2019s could impeach another expert\u2019s opinion if it is not taken as true. Finally, the dissent again never even attempts to explain how the prosecutor could have used this diagnosis to impeach his own expert, who <em>agreed </em>with it. Like the Court of Appeals, we think it is evident that during the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Dr. Balay, he used the remarks from Dr. Shahid\u2019s report as substantive evidence \u201cto prove the truth of the matter asserted .. . .\u201d <em>Fackelman, </em>unpub op at 6. We do, however, agree with the dissent\u2019s impeachment discussion in one respect: we too conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated reference to Dr. Shahid\u2019s report and diagnosis during his closing argument, including his statement urging that \u201cit\u2019s real important to look at what Dr. Shahid had to say, even though he didn\u2019t testify here before you,\u201d was for the truth of the matter asserted. Unlike the dissent, though, we find these arguments prejudicial and entirely indicative of how the prosecutor employed the report and diagnosis throughout trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\"> Because defendant bore the burden on the affirmative defense of insanity, he had to initiate the presentation of evidence that he was legally insane at the time of the offense.

In this discussion, the dissent explores the reasons why <em>defense counsel </em>may have chosen not to call Dr. Shahid, and contends that this decision is entitled to deference under <em>Strickland. </em>We do not disagree with this; we just believe that the reasons for counsel\u2019s decision are irrelevant because defendant can be under no obligation to call \u201cwitnesses against\u201d himself. The question\u2014 \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call Dr. Shahid as a witness?\u201d \u2014 would be better directed toward the prosecutor, who <em>is </em>under such obligation. But even though one may be curious about the prosecutor\u2019s answer to this question\u2014 especially because Dr. Shahid worked at a hospital only 30 minutes away \u2014 his answer is also irrelevant. The only thing relevant is that the prosecutor <em>did not </em>call Dr. Shahid to testify at trial and made no showing regarding his unavailability, as he was required to do under the Confrontation Clause. In sum, counsel\u2019s strategic decision concerning which witnesses to call had no bearing on the clause.

The question posed by this case is: Can an out-of-court statement selectively used by a defendant in support of his principal defense serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>as a predicate for a Confrontation Clause claim after the prosecutor has used the statement to impeach the defendant\u2019s expert? Defendant and the majority answer this question in the affirmative. I believe that the answer is unquestionably no and therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">In this case, defendant\u2019s trial counsel declined to call as a witness the author of the out-of-court statement \u2014 a psychiatric evaluation \u2014 because he believed that the author would be a bad witness for the defense and would undermine the proffered insanity defense. This defense trial strategy proved partially successful; the jury found defendant guilty but mentally ill. On appeal, defendant now attempts to transform this conscious trial strategy into an \u201cappellate parachute\u201d by raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim premised on an alleged Confrontation Clause violation because the author of the out-of-court statement, which defendant\u2019s own expert relied on and referred to, did not testify at defendant\u2019s trial. Although our jurisprudence abhors sanctioning such appellate parachutes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the majority here blesses this artful appellate strategy. I cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">These uncontested facts notwithstanding, United States Supreme Court caselaw is equally inconvenient to the majority\u2019s conclusion. Apart from the appellate parachute problem, the psychiatric evaluation that defendant claims violated his Confrontation Clause rights was not a testimonial out-of-court statement and therefore <em>did not even implicate the rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause. </em>The United States Supreme Court has made this perfectly clear: in <em>Melendez-Diaz v Massachusetts, </em>the Court expressly stated that \u201cmedical reports created for treatment purposes . . . would not be testimonial\u201d statements within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Missed by the majority in this case is the fact that <em>none </em>of the nine justices who served on the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>Court would have included medical reports created for treatment purposes in the definition of testimonial statements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The psychiatric evaluation at issue in this case falls within that category of evidence considered to be nontestimonial because it was created to evaluate and treat defendant during his two-week hospitalization in a psychiatric intensive care unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Moreover, even if the psychiatric evaluation at issue were to be considered testimonial within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, the prosecutor\u2019s purpose in referring to Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation was to impeach defendant\u2019s expert, a purpose that falls outside the purview of the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because neither the facts nor the law supports the majority\u2019s decision in this case, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, albeit for different reasons than the Court of Appeals articulated, and affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">I.

Specifically, we are concerned with a psychiatric evaluation prepared by defendant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Agha Shahid, during his hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Defendant suffered from severe depression, including a suicide attempt, following the death of his teenage son in June 2006. Defendant\u2019s depression became particularly acute in the days leading up to his March 2007 hospitalization because it was the beginning of the baseball season for his son\u2019s high school team. While watching the team\u2019s game on March 27, 2007, defendant \u201cbegan to cry\u201d and \u201cwave[d] . . . off\u201d parents of his son\u2019s teammates from talking to him. Instead, he jogged to his car, drove home, and locked himself in his room, which was something he did \u201coccasionally when [he] didn\u2019t want to be seen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The next day, defendant drove from his home in northern Ohio to confront the Monroe County man he believed responsible for his son\u2019s death, Randy Krell.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant testified that he did not remember the incident. According to Krell, defendant arrived at Krell\u2019s home wielding a pistol.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He pointed the gun at Krell\u2019s chest and told Krell, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna talk.\u201d Defendant then directed Krell toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Krell\u2019s garage, all the while continuing to tell Krell that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna talk and end this all in about a minute.\u201d When defendant loaded the chamber of his pistol for firing, Krell ran across the street into his neighbor\u2019s house and asked his neighbor to call 911, which the neighbor did. Before the neighbor completed his 911 call, the neighbor heard \u201ca loud crash\u201d and his \u201centire doorframe came flying in and landed in ... the entranceway....\u201d Still brandishing the weapon, defendant knocked the telephone out of the neighbor\u2019s hand and looked through the house for Krell, spending about 3V2 or 4 minutes inside the house before leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Defendant returned to his car without again confronting Krell.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Later that evening, defendant arrived at his mother\u2019s house in Toledo, walked over to a heat register, and placed the gun in the air duct. He also called his brother and asked him to \u201ccome and get it and get rid of it.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After he left his mother\u2019s house, defendant\u2019s family and friends became worried for his safety, and they began searching for him. Eventually, a family friend found defendant at a gas station in Bowling Green, Ohio. At the request of the family\u2019s attorney, the friend drove defendant to Flower Hospital in Toledo. Just outside the hospital, and apparently while the family attorney was finalizing defendant\u2019s admission into the hospital, police arrested defendant. Defendant was searched but then released from police custody for his hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">After spending the night of March 28-29, 2007, at Rescue Crisis Mental Health Services in Toledo, defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>dant was transferred back to Flower Hospital to be admitted into the psychiatric intensive care unit. Defendant was placed under the care and supervision of Dr. Shahid.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">After interviewing and observing defendant, Dr. Shahid prepared a three-page \u201cPsychiatric Evaluation\u201d on Flower Hospital letterhead, which Dr. Shahid signed and dated March 31, 2007. The evaluation described defendant\u2019s history of present illness, past psychiatric history, medical history, family history, social history, mental status examination, strengths and limitations, estimated length of hospitalization, diagnosis, and plan of treatment. Dr. Shahid concluded in this evaluation that defendant suffered from \u201c[m]ajor depression,\u201d that it was a \u201csingle episode,\u201d and that it was \u201csevere without psychosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Defendant was charged with first-degree home invasion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> two counts of felonious assault with a dangerous weapon,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and felony-firearm.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defendant raised an insanity defense at his three-day jury trial. Defendant testified that he did not know how he ended up at Krell\u2019s house, that he did not remember chasing Krell, and that he did not remember knocking down the door of the neighbor\u2019s house. Furthermore, he testified that he did not remember going to his mother\u2019s house, hiding his gun, or talking to Dr. Shahid at Flower Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">While presenting his case-in-chief, defendant called an expert witness, Dr. Zubin Mistry, who testified that defendant was legally insane at the time of the crime.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The prosecutor called a rebuttal expert witness, Dr. Jennifer Balay, who testified that defendant was legally sane. Both experts testified that they relied in part on Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation in forming their opinions about defendant\u2019s mental state. However, neither party called Dr. Shahid as a witness, nor did either party formally introduce his evaluation into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The jury found defendant guilty but mentally ill of all the charged offenses. On appeal, the Court of Appeals remanded this case to the trial court for a <em>Ginther </em>hearing on defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At the hearing, defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified that he did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation because he thought the prosecutor was using the evaluation solely to impeach defendant\u2019s expert. Moreover, he explained, it did not occur to him that the use of the evaluation could violate the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> More important, he also testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to call attention to\u201d the evaluation and that he feared Dr. Shahid \u201cwould have been a bad witness if everything in that report would have come out. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>defendant did not receive constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel and affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the grounds that, although counsel had erred by allowing the prosecutor to use extrajudicial testimonial statements for the truth of the matter asserted, the error did not prejudice defendant. We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Defendant claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel after counsel failed to object to the use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s psychiatric evaluation. \u201cWhether a person has been denied effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and constitutional law. A judge first must find the facts, and then must decide whether those facts constitute a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We review a trial court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, while we review any underlying questions of constitutional law de novo.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">A. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">This appeal is presented to us as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant claims that his trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>counsel was constitutionally deficient for failing to object when the prosecutor questioned two expert witnesses about Dr. Shahid\u2019s psychiatric evaluation and referred to the evaluation in his closing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees a criminal defendant the right \u201cto have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he [United States Supreme] Court has recognized that \u2018the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">The United States Supreme Court has articulated two requirements for a defendant to establish that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Defendant now claims that his trial counsel erred by allowing the prosecutor to question his expert and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal expert about Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation and to refer to Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation in his closing argument. This is an absurd proposition because it was <em>defendant </em>who first raised the issue of his insanity and who first opened the door to questioning about Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation because his defense expert selectively relied on the evaluation during the defense\u2019s case-in-chief and because <em>defendant considered, but decided against, calling Dr. Shahid to the witness stand. </em>The majority does not explain why it would allow the defendant to rely on Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation without his being called as a witness, but preclude the prosecutor from using that same evaluation for impeachment and in rebuttal without calling Dr. Shahid as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Today\u2019s majority decision, thus, says in effect that a prosecutor is constitutionally required to call a particular witness \u2014 the author of an out-of-court statement \u2014 on the basis of the defense\u2019s selective use of that statement and conscious strategic decision <em>not </em>to call the author as a witness. The result of the majority\u2019s decision will be to promote trial and appellate gamesmanship.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The majority\u2019s decision flies in the face of the fact that a criminal defendant can waive his confrontation rights<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and \u201c[cjounsel may waive an accused\u2019s constitutional rights for tactical reasons when the circumstances are not exceptional.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Counsel can also waive confrontation rights when he \u201cpurposefully and explic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>itly opens the door on a particular (and otherwise inadmissible) line of questioning\u201d because \u201csuch conduct operates as a limited waiver allowing the government to introduce further evidence on that same topic.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, it is no surprise that defendant\u2019s trial counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation to rebut defendant\u2019s insanity defense. I would hold that defendant affirmatively waived his right to confront Dr. Shahid because he chose, as a matter of trial strategy, not to call him as a witness.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Therefore, he cannot now claim that the <em>prosecutor\u2019s </em>failure to call Dr. Shahid as a witness on an issue for which the prosecutor bore no burden of proof violated his confrontation rights.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Notwithstanding the issue of waiver, defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him and the evidentiary rules regarding the introduction of hearsay. I will discuss defendant\u2019s legal claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">B. CONFRONTATION CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in relevant part, \u201cIn all criminal pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him. . ..\u201d This right has been incorporated to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">The Confrontation Clause seeks to prevent \u201cthe civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In its seminal Confrontation Clause decision, <em>Crawford v Washington, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe Framers would not have allowed admission of <em>testimonial </em>statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> While previous cases interpreting the Confrontation Clause emphasized the truth-seeking function of the right of confrontation,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the <em>Crawford </em>Court reoriented Confrontation Clause jurisprudence toward confrontation\u2019s procedural safeguards to ensure that \u201creliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The majority helpfully summarizes this conclusion in articulating what it styles an \u201calternative analysis\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> for determining whether a Confrontation Clause violation has occurred: \u201c(1) Does the person in controversy comprise a \u2018witness against\u2019 the accused under the Confrontation Clause; and (2) if so, has the accused been afforded an opportunity to \u2018confront\u2019 that witness under the Confrontation Clause?\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Far from being an alternative analysis, these two questions simply assert uncontested constitutional first principles. Thus, the majority\u2019s alternative analysis does not answer the difficult and fact-intensive inquiry required to review this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">As the majority\u2019s test illustrates, and as the <em>Crawford </em>Court held, the Confrontation Clause \u201capplies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 against the accused \u2014 in other words, those who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Crawford </em>emphasized the qualitative distinction between testimonial statements and nontestimonial statements for purposes of applying the Confrontation Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law .... Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for <em>cross-examination.[</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Therefore, any case that applies the Confrontation Clause must determine, as a threshold matter, whether the statement at issue is testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>1. WHAT CONSTITUTES \u201cTESTIMONY\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">\n<em>\u201c[Miedical reports created for treatment purposes ... would not be testimonial under our decision today.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\"><em>\u2014Melendez-Diaz v Massachusetts </em>(2009)<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">\u201cTestimony\u201d is \u201c \u2018[a] <em>solemn </em>declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Court explained that \u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]he constitutional text, like the history underlying the common-law right of confrontation, thus reflects an especially acute concern with a specific type of out-of-court statement.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Although it did not delineate the scope of testimonial statements, the <em>Crawford </em>Court acknowledged that \u201c[v]arious formulations of this core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements exist,\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and instead of choosing one, it \u201c[left] for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In reviewing <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny, it becomes clear that the Court considers two related factors above all others when deciding whether an extrajudicial statement is testimonial, and therefore within the parameters of the Confrontation Clause: the <em>formality </em>of the statement within a criminal investigation or prosecution and the <em>purpose </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>statement.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Formal statements created as part of the investigative or judicial process \u2014 such as statements that are \u201cquite plainly affidavits\u201d \u2014 are testimonial.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Similarly, statements that are made for the express purpose of investigating and prosecuting crimes \u2014 such as a statement \u201cthe <em>sole purpose </em>of [which] was to provide \u2018prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight\u2019 of the analyzed substance\u201d \u2014 are likewise testimonial.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Contrarily, statements made for some other primary purpose \u2014 such as responses to interrogations in order \u201cto enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> or \u201cmedical reports created for treatment purposes\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> \u2014 are not testimonial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>This last example, specifically referenced in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>is particularly relevant to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">In deconstructing this reference in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the majority claims that this dissent fails to account for the final phrase of footnote 2 \u2014 \u201c \u2018under our decision today\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> \u2014 and it argues that, instead, \u201cthe circumstances under which a medical report created for treatment purposes could be considered testimonial was simply left for another day.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In fact, the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>majority was responding to Justice Kennedy\u2019s concern that the core holding of <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>would create unintended consequences.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Moreover, while the context of the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>majority\u2019s decision supports the interpretation that this opinion attaches to footnote 2, <em>all </em>the caselaw applying <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny attaches great significance to the broader proposition that the footnote applies: a statement\u2019s <em>primary purpose </em>is accorded great weight in the determination whether the statement is testimonial in nature.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In the end, while the facts of this case were not squarely before the Court in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>majority\u2019s statement that \u201cmedical reports created for treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ment purposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision today\u201d is highly instructive regarding how to apply Confrontation Clause principles to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">There are also a number of instructive state supreme court cases that illustrate the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>Court\u2019s recognition that \u201cmedical reports created for treatment purposes\u201d are not testimonial.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> For instance, in <em>People v Cage, </em>the California Supreme Court held that a victim\u2019s statement to his doctor at a hospital was not testimonial because it was made for the purpose of \u201cimmediate acute treatment\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and not to bear,, testimony against the defendant. Alternatively, in <em>Hartsfield v Commonwealth, </em>the Kentucky Supreme Court held that a statement made to a sexual assault nurse examiner was testimonial because the purpose of the questioning was to \u201celicitO evidence of past offenses with an eye toward future criminal prosecution,\u201d making the nurse \u201can active participant in the formal criminal investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v Stahl </em>perhaps most fully explained a court\u2019s inquiry into the purpose of a statement.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> It held that, although a forensic nurse working in an emergency room \u201cserves a prosecutorial function by collecting evidence,\u201d that function is \u201cat best secondary to the . . . primary motivation, the care of [the unit\u2019s] patients.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The court went on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>[The defendant] asserts that [the nurse\u2019s] taking of evidence, which included swabbing for DNA with the help of ultraviolet light, taking pictures of [the victim\u2019s] mouth, and taking a napkin that [the victim] used after the incident, demonstrates the ... unit\u2019s prosecutorial purpose and renders [the victim\u2019s] statements testimonial. Emergency rooms routinely perform these procedures, and a witness in this situation could reasonably believe that the ... unit\u2019s medical examination, including the incident history statement, serves primarily a medical function.[<footnotemark>54</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">In distinguishing an emergency room nurse\u2019s \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d functions, the <em>Stahl </em>court answered the majority\u2019s concern that \u201c[i]t is utterly unclear how a court would apply the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 test outside the <em>Davis </em>context to a case in which no emergency [requiring immediate police assistance] is alleged\u201d and its questions regarding \u201cwhat alternative \u2018purposes\u2019 would be considered, and how would the resolution of which of these is \u2018primary\u2019 bear in any meaningful way on the principles inherent in the Confrontation Clause[.]\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">These cases and others reiterate the United States Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgment in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>that statements made for the purposes of diagnosing and treating medical emergencies are not testimonial, while recognizing statements that carry an investigative purpose and that turn medical professionals into \u201cactive participant[s] in the formal criminal investigation\u201d can create testimonial statements, even if they are created by medical professionals.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The majority has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>followed this line of analysis. Instead, it substitutes an inquiry into the mere <em>foreseeability </em>of a statement\u2019s use at trial for an inquiry into the primary purpose for which the statement was created. The majority\u2019s analysis is simply contrary to the mandates of <em>Davis, Melendez-Diaz, </em>and most recently <em>Michigan v </em>Bryant.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Thus, the majority of this Court continues to misapply the Confrontation Clause caselaw of the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">2. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In light of the foregoing analysis of Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, the statement at issue in this case was not testimonial because it was neither formal nor created for the primary purpose of investigating or prosecuting crimes.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> As stated, the declarant, Dr. Sha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>hid, treated defendant during his hospitalization in Flower Hospital\u2019s psychiatric intensive care unit for an acute psychiatric episode.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In rendering emergency psychiatric treatment to a patient who had already attempted suicide once before and who continued to exhibit severe depression, Dr. Shahid created a detailed evaluation that outlined defendant\u2019s medical condition and determined the most appropriate course of emergency treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Because the context and contents of the entire evaluation are essential to determining whether it is testimonial, the Appendix to this opinion contains the evaluation with minor redactions.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In order to treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>defendant, Dr. Shahid had to understand his patient\u2019s medical and psychiatric history, particularly in a situation in which his patient had previously attempted to commit suicide, had been admitted on an emergency basis in a severely depressed state, and continued to express suicidal ideation.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Thus, Dr. Shahid interviewed defendant regarding every aspect of his illness, in particular, its origin in the death of defendant\u2019s son and the continuing effect of that death on defendant\u2019s mental state. This required Dr. Shahid to ask defendant, not only about his son\u2019s death generally, but also, more specifically, what he remembered about the incident with Krell. Dr. Shahid determined that defendant \u201cfeels helpless, hopeless and worthless\u201d but is \u201c[o]riented to time, place and person.\u201d In short, the evaluation documented defendant\u2019s mental and physical state at the time of the evaluation \u2014 his mood, affect, temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure \u2014 and provided a diagnosis and plan of treatment for the periods during and after defendant\u2019s hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Important for our analysis is the fact that Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation did not end with his diagnosis of defendant; rather, it followed that diagnosis with a <em>plan of treatment. </em>After diagnosing defendant\u2019s depression as \u201csevere without psychosis,\u201d Dr. Shahid concluded that defendant should \u201c[c]ontinue Prozac\u201d and \u201cadd Seroquel,\u201d a drug used to \u201chelp patient with sleep, agitation and his complaint that he cannot shut his mind.\u201d Dr. Shahid also determined that defendant should continue with psychotherapy after his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">All these facts lead inexorably to the conclusion that Dr. Shahid\u2019s primary purpose in undertaking and documenting defendant\u2019s psychiatric evaluation was to provide medical care and treatment, not to serve as \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>active participant in the formal criminal investigation\u201d or prosecution.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The evaluation was, therefore, created not in anticipation of litigation, but in anticipation of continued treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">The majority emphasizes that Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation noted that \u201cthe Monroe County sheriff want[ed] to be called when [defendant] is discharged to home\u201d and that defendant \u201cha[d] legal charges against him through the State of Michigan 38th Judicial Circuit . . . .\u201d The fact that Dr. Shahid was aware of the pending criminal charges against defendant does not alter Dr. Shahid\u2019s primary purpose in preparing his evaluation: to render emergency psychiatric treatment to defendant. Moreover, there was no indication that his treatment was handled any differently because of the pending charges, and the acknowledgment of the charges constitutes a legitimate part of the patient\u2019s history that is a customary part of psychiatric evaluations. Indeed, it would be passing strange for the evaluating psychiatrist to fail to note the conditions under which the patient was referred to the psychiatric emergency room in the first instance. This is essentially a passing reference in an evaluation that is otherwise entirely devoted to recording and treating defendant\u2019s psychiatric emergency, including an emphasis on defendant\u2019s suicidal ideation. Significantly, and undercutting the majority\u2019s foreseeability analysis, there is no evidence, other than being aware that defendant had been arrested for assaulting Krell, that Dr. Shahid had any other contact with the police or the prosecutor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The majority itself quotes the evaluation\u2019s introductory statement that defendant \u201c \u2018had suicidal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>thoughts.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Dr. Shahid emphasized the suicidal ideation later in his evaluation, repeating that defendant had attempted suicide by drug overdose and stating that defendant continued to exhibit suicidal ideation\u2014 defendant \u201cstated that he thinks about suicide \u2018all the time.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, Dr. Shahid explained that defendant \u201cwas transferred to the psychiatric intensive care unit for his safety since the patient was thinking intensely about suicide, and he just does not want to live anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Also, the majority distinguishes the psychiatric treatment that defendant received from other medical treatment and suggests that this distinction is determinative in confrontation cases.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This distinction confuses the <em>purpose </em>of documenting a psychiatric evaluation with its potential <em>effect </em>on future proceedings. Not only has the United States Supreme Court \u201cnever addressed\u201d this issue,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> at least one state court that considered it after <em>Crawford </em>(albeit in dicta) made no distinction between psychiatric treatment and other medical treatment.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> There is simply no principled distinction for applying the Confrontation Clause differently when analyzing psychiatric medical treatment than when analyzing medical treatment for \u201cphysical\u201d illnesses\u2014 particularly because courts must examine the <em>purpose </em>for which an out-of-court medical statement was created. As stated, Dr. Shahid explained in his evaluation that defendant was admitted to the psychiatric intensive care unit \u201cfor his safety\u201d because he \u201cwas thinking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>intensely about suicide . . . Thus, the purpose of Dr. Shahid\u2019s emergency care and treatment of defendant was no different than an emergency room physician\u2019s treatment of a person with life-threatening physical injuries: the immediate stabilization of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">The majority\u2019s determination that Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation was testimonial runs contrary to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s Confrontation Clause caselaw on the matter. The Court stated in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>that \u201cmedical reports created for treatment purposes\u201d are not testimonial, a position to which the <em>entire </em>Court subscribed.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In holding to the contrary, the majority places great weight on the fact that, because Dr. Shahid was aware of and acknowledged the pendency of charges against defendant, an \u201c \u2018 \u201cobjective [psychiatrist] would reasonably [be led] to believe that [his statements] would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the fact that the standard that the majority quotes is not the standard of law that is binding on our decision today,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>fails to give appropriate credence to Dr. Shahid\u2019s efforts to diagnose defendant\u2019s medical problem and to create a treatment plan, efforts that were clearly articulated in the evaluation. The evaluation itself acknowledged that defendant would be hospitalized for \u201c10-14 days\u201d and would be receiving both prescription medications and psychotherapy during and after his hospitalization. In reading Dr. Shahid\u2019s entire evaluation, it is hard to conclude, as the majority does, that Dr. Shahid was <em>primarily </em>concerned with anything other than defendant\u2019s mental health.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">As stated, the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>Court affirmed the non-testimonial nature of medical reports created for treatment purposes. <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>emphasized that reviewing courts must examine the <em>primary purpose </em>of the statement\u2019s creation when determining whether it runs afoul of the Confrontation Clause. The majority has not provided any indication that Dr. Shahid did anything other than treat defendant for his severe depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">3. IMPEACHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Even if, contrary to my conclusion above, Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation was testimonial in nature, the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>frontation Clause \u201cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Accordingly, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s suggestion that we should not engage in what it terms \u201cmental gymnastics\u201d in determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation was to prove the truth of the matter asserted,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> that is just the type of analysis that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s Confrontation Clause jurisprudence requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">In order to meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was legally insane at the time of the crimes,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> defendant presented the testimony of Dr. Mistry. On direct examination, Dr. Mistry admitted that he reviewed \u201crecords from Flower Hospital, Dr. Shahid\u2019s records . . . .\u201d Dr. Mistry\u2019s admission that he reviewed Dr. Shahid\u2019s records opened the door to inquiry about how Dr. Shahid\u2019s records influenced Dr. Mistry\u2019s expert opinion, including any points of disagreement between his opinion and the information contained in Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Far from \u201c[going] well beyond the scope of the direct examination,\u201d the prosecutor appropriately sought to undermine the opinion proffered by defendant\u2019s expert, that the defendant was legally insane, by using Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation to impeach that opinion.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> And Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation was a powerful tool for impeachment because Dr. Shahid concluded that defendant did not suffer from psychosis when he evaluated him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>shortly after the crimes were committed.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Having read Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation and records in reaching his own opinion, Dr. Mistry was properly compelled by the prosecutor\u2019s impeachment to explain how he came to an entirely different conclusion than the treating physician concerning the defendant\u2019s mental status at the time of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The majority\u2019s extensive quotations from the trial transcripts indicate nothing to the contrary: Dr. Mistry confirmed that he reviewed Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation, including Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis of defendant, and indicated that he disagreed with that diagnosis because of his review of the entire record, including information that Dr. Shahid did not have at his disposal. And yet, notwithstanding these extensive quotations, the majority does not provide sufficient context to understand the nature of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>context shows that the prosecutor initially sought to use factual information contained in Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation that conflicted with Dr. Mistry\u2019s own observations and proves the impeachment purpose of questioning Dr. Mistry about the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">One of the points of conflict between Dr. Mistry\u2019s testimony and Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation was the extent to which defendant remembered what occurred on the afternoon of March 28, 2007. As part of his inquiry into defendant\u2019s mental state, Dr. Mistry interviewed defendant, who explained that \u201c[h]e had no recollection of the events of that time[,] only what he heard from other people.\u201d It was in challenging this point that the prosecutor first discussed the substance of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation. After confirming that Dr. Mistry had read Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation, the prosecutor asked Dr. Mistry whether he was aware that defendant had explained to Dr. Shahid \u201cthat on the day that this happened he wanted [Krell] to feel my pain\u201d and that defendant stated \u201cthat he remembers stopping his car and seeing that person who [defendant] believes was responsible for his son\u2019s death, and stated that that person took off in the street and, quote: I followed him across the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The prosecutor sought to impeach Dr. Mistry\u2019s credibility as an expert on the basis of these conflicting statements by defendant. This is evident from the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that defendant had \u201ca motivation not to tell the full truth [to Dr. Mistry] about his memory\u201d because Dr. Mistry could help defendant\u2019s case \u201cif he reaches a certain conclusion . . . .\u201d While Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Mistry denied that defendant had lied to him regarding his lack of memory, he admitted that part of his diagnosis required him \u201cto develop an opinion as to whether [defendant] is being sincere or whether [he\u2019s] misconstruing things or lying in order to paint a picture to you of [himself] in a certain way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">It was only after this point that the prosecutor cross-examined Dr. Mistry regarding Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis. Thus, after raising the <em>factual </em>differences between Dr. Shahid\u2019s psychiatric evaluation session with defendant at the hospital and Dr. Mistry\u2019s later pretrial interview with defendant, the prosecutor sought to link those factual differences to the different diagnoses themselves. Indeed, the prosecutor asked Dr. Mistry whether he could \u201cpoint to anything specific in [Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation] where you . . . can say he made a mistake,\u201d and Dr. Mistry could not. Rather, Dr. Mistry \u201c[didn\u2019t] disagree with Dr. Shahid on his observations,\u201d only \u201cas to the diagnosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In short, the prosecutor\u2019s use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation during his cross-examination of Dr. Mistry was for the purpose of impeaching Dr. Mistry\u2019s expert opinion, not to prove the truth of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">However, the prosecutor did not just refer to Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation during his cross-examination of Dr. Mistry. The prosecutor also referred to the evaluation during his direct examination of his rebuttal expert witness, Dr. Balay. As with his cross-examination of Dr. Mistry, the prosecutor highlighted the differences between Dr. Shahid\u2019s psychiatric session with defendant and Dr. Balay\u2019s psychiatric interview of defendant. Dr. Balay explained that defendant \u201cclaimed to basically have no memory of any of the events\u201d that occurred on the afternoon of March 28, 2007, even though she acknowledged that defendant had described to Dr. Sha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>hid some memories from that afternoon. Dr. Balay then explained to the prosecutor that defendant could either be suppressing the memories or \u201cjust be lying,\u201d but that she \u201c[had] no way of knowing one way or the other.\u201d In the end, Dr. Balay indicated that she agreed with Dr. Shahid\u2019s conclusion that defendant was not psychotic. She also stated that she disagreed with Dr. Mistry\u2019s conclusion and explained her reasons for doing so. In particular, she determined that defendant had acted methodically in pursuit of his stated motive \u2014 that he \u201cwas furious at this man who he believed had caused the death of his son\u201d \u2014 and that such methodical behavior is \u201cthe most relevant\u201d factor in determining whether a person is able to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. As with the cross-examination of Dr. Mistry, the purpose of the direct examination of Dr. Balay was to impeach Dr. Mistry\u2019s credibility and not necessarily to assert that Dr. Shahid\u2019s diagnosis was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Finally, the prosecutor referred to Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation during his closing argument, explaining that \u201cit\u2019s real important to look at what Dr. Shahid had to say, even though he didn\u2019t testify here before you\u201d and emphasizing that Dr. Shahid \u201creached the conclusion at the end [of] his examination that Mr. Fackelman was depressed, he had severe depression, but that there was no psychosis involved.\u201d However, this does not change the fact that during defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecutor used Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation for a proper impeachment purpose rather than to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Moreover, the trial court explained that \u201clawyers\u2019 statements and arguments are not evidence\u201d and that \u201c[e]vidence includes only the sworn testimony of witnesses, the exhibits which were admitted into evidence, and anything else I told you to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>consider as evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Because Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation meets none of these criteria, and because \u201cjurors are presumed to follow their instructions,\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> I cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument prejudiced defendant. The trial court\u2019s cautionary instruction properly insulated the jury from any inappropriate use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Because the majority seriously errs in applying United States Supreme Court Confrontation Clause precedent to the instant case, I respectfully dissent and would hold that Dr. Shahid\u2019s medical evaluation was not testimonial and, therefore, not subject to the Confrontation Clause. Moreover, even if Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation were testimonial, it was primarily used not to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but to impeach defendant\u2019s expert witness. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not err by failing to raise a Confrontation Clause objection to Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">C. HEARSAY</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Even if Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation is not subject to the Confrontation Clause, it is still subject to the Michigan Rules of Evidence, including our evidentiary rules regarding hearsay. However, because counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise futile objections,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> we must determine whether any objection to Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation on evidentiary grounds would have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">As a prehminary matter, it is undisputed that Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation, among other facts and data, provided a basis for the testimony of the two expert witnesses in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>this case.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Furthermore, MRE 703 provides, \u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference shall be in evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> However, even though such facts and data \u201cshall be in evidence,\u201d they might be subject to our evidentiary rules regarding hearsay.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">\u201cHearsay is not admissible except as provided by\u201d our evidentiary rules,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> which define \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>statement, other than the one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> It is uncontested that Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation is \u201ca statement, other than the one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Assuming for the sake of argument that the prosecutor\u2019s purpose for referring to Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation in closing was, in substantial part, to use it to prove the truth of the matter asserted,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> MRE 803(6), the business records exception, nevertheless, allows introduction of \u201c[a] memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, transactions, occurrences, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge . ...\u201d As a diagnosis of defendant\u2019s psychiatric condition, Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation falls squarely within this exception and therefore was admissible into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The majority correctly observes that MRE 803(6) also requires authentication by \u201cthe testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> However, the majority entirely overlooks the fact that <em>defendant </em>was required to admit Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation into evidence in the first instance, since defendant\u2019s expert admitted that Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation comprised, in significant part, the \u201cfacts and data\u201d on which he based his opinion.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Moreover, defendant does not dispute the authenticity of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation, even on appeal. Since his own expert first relied on the evaluation, defendant can hardly (certainly not legitimately) claim that when it was used in rebuttal, the evaluation became inauthentic. Thus, this case does not even present a situation in which defendant simply failed to object to the authenticity of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation; rather, defendant <em>affirmatively endorsed </em>its authenticity because his own expert relied on it in forming his opinion, which was the foundation of the insanity defense. Under such circumstances, defendant cannot receive relief on the basis of authentication error.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>D. TRIAL STRATEGY</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Even if I were to conclude that trial counsel erred by failing to raise a Confrontation Clause or hearsay objection to Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation (which I do not), before granting defendant relief, the Court must also determine whether that failure constituted an error \u201cso serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> In undertaking this inquiry, <em>Strickland </em>made clear that a defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy must be given deference because \u201c[e]ven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.[<footnotemark>91</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Instead, reviewing courts must \u201cevaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time,\u201d and defendants must \u201covercome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>To begin with, defendant\u2019s trial strategy was to raise the defense of insanity rather than contest the factual elements of the charged crimes. Although the prosecutor must prove the factual elements of the charged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt, the <em>defendant </em>bears the burden of proving insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> In this case, defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing that he did not object when the prosecutor first cross-examined defendant\u2019s expert witness about Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to call attention to\u201d it, which would have undermined the insanity defense. Moreover, counsel also stated that he \u201chad a discussion as to whether or not to even present Dr. Shahid\u201d but explained that \u201cthe concern was that he would have been a bad witness if everything in that [evaluation] would have come out, and it would have hurt rather than helped\u201d defendant\u2019s insanity defense.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Defense counsel thus had a dilemma: his own expert had relied on portions of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation to establish his own opinion that defendant was legally insane, but the <em>entire </em>evaluation was harmful to the insanity defense. According to the defense expert, he agreed with all of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation <em>except </em>his conclusion that the defendant had not suffered a break with reality when he committed the crimes. Accordingly, counsel, after apparent consultation with defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>dant, made a <em>conscious decision to downplay Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation. </em>Given that the evaluation contained information detrimental to his client\u2019s defense\u2014 particularly the conclusion that defendant was not suffering from psychosis and was thus legally sane \u2014 I cannot conclude that this trial strategy was objectively unreasonable. To the contrary, defendant\u2019s strategy may have represented the best strategy possible: defendant was allowed to rely on favorable portions of Dr. Shahid\u2019s statement as the basis for his insanity defense while avoiding having Dr. Shahid take the stand to explain his finding of \u201cno psychosis,\u201d which could have completely undercut defendant\u2019s proffered defense. Indeed, this defense trial strategy proved partially successful; the jury found defendant guilty but mentally ill. The majority ought to explain why this strategy should not be given the deference <em>Strickland </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Defendant now claims that the failure to call Dr. Shahid to the witness stand violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause, and the majority treats this failure as if it were an omission. It has been made clear that this was not an omission, but a conscious strategy that defendant\u2019s trial counsel employed.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> When properly considered as a conscious decision to avoid calling as a witness an expert that counsel reasonably thought would have been \u201ca bad witness,\u201d defendant\u2019s claim of error seems to be the very danger that the <em>Strickland </em>Court warned against: allowing defendant to \u201csecond-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> The majority compounds this problem by \u201cexamining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, [and] concluding] that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Because I do not believe that this Court should reward defendants for pursuing a reasonable trial strategy then using it as an appellate parachute, I also dissent on this alternative basis from the majority\u2019s conclusion that defense counsel rendered objectively unreasonable assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The majority explains that, because \u201cinsanity is an affirmative defense with respect to which a defendant carries the burden of proof,\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> defendant had no choice but to open the door to questioning about his mental state through expert testimony. Moreover, the majority explains that \u201c[n]o such [expert] witness could have neglected altogether to mention the existence of the report of the only person who actually interviewed defendant in the immediate wake of his conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Precisely! These observations prove just how completely the majority fails to understand basic impeachment, and reinforce just how appropriately strategic was defense counsel\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to call Dr. Shahid as a witness. It would appear that the majority believes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>no impeachment of the defense expert could have occurred under these circumstances unless the prosecutor called Dr. Shahid as his own witness. If the Confrontation Clause can properly be read to require this result, then <em>Crawford </em>will seem a tiny shift compared to the seismic destruction that this new majority rule will require.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">There is no question that Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation contained statements that any expert would have had to take into account when forming an opinion regarding defendant\u2019s mental state. As explained previously, the evaluation also revealed inconsistencies concerning what defendant remembered about the afternoon in question, inconsistencies that <em>any </em>expert witness would have had to resolve. Yet precisely because the defense expert was silent about these inconsistencies, the prosecutor cross-examined him regarding his selective use of the evaluation. The majority would raise this strategic silence to a constitutional level and insulate the expert from such cross-examination. I would not hamstring the impeachment of an expert witness in such a way.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Because Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation was initially used by the defense as a part of its legitimate trial strategy to establish its insanity defense, the prosecutor\u2019s use of that same evaluation in rebuttal cannot constitute a Confrontation Clause violation. The majority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary rewards a clever appellate parachute strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">Secondarily, Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation was a \u201cmedical report[] created for treatment purposes .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>States Supreme Court precedent could not be clearer that the Confrontation Clause did not prohibit introduction of the evaluation into evidence. The majority\u2019s failure to apply the Supreme Court\u2019s Confrontation Clause doctrine can only cause further confusion in an already confusing area of law. Accordingly, I would hold that the prosecutor\u2019s use of Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. Furthermore, the evaluation was admissible under the business records hearsay exception, and defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s use of the evaluation did not render his assistance constitutionally ineffective, nor was his trial strategy to downplay Dr. Shahid\u2019s evaluation objectively unreasonable. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b819-4\">Zahra, J., concurred with Young, C.J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">47-year-old Caucasian married male was referred by Rescue Crisis Mental Health Services with an emergency application indicating that the patient\u2019s son was killed eight months ago in a traffic accident, and the patient drove to the man\u2019s home with a gun who patient felt was responsible for the death of his son.

The patient stated that he remembers stopping his car and seeing that person who the patient believes was responsible for his son\u2019s death and stated that that person took off in the street and, \u201cI followed him across the street.\u201d Patient states, \u201cI do not remember driving to Michigan and driving to his house. I do not remember what happened, and the only thing I remember is that I saw a terrified look on that man\u2019s face, and at that time I felt I just woke up and started apologizing to that man.\u201d The patient stated that he went back to his car and drove away and stated that he stopped at his mother\u2019s house, and he believes that he left the gun that he had with him at his mother\u2019s house. Patient stated that he had a handgun for years and years that he kept in a dressing drawer in his bedroom. The patient states he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>does not remember taking the gun out of the drawer when he went to that person\u2019s house in Michigan. When I asked him about if there were bullets in the gun, patient states he does not remember, but he thought that he had bullets in his pocket and stated that he believes that he flushed the bullets down the toilet or he believes that he threw his bullets away.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Patient stated that since the death of his son on June 5, 2006, \u201cMy whole life has been torn apart,\u201d then patient went on to say that on Tuesday he went to his son\u2019s school, Whitmer High School, where his friends were playing baseball and states that he watched the baseball game, but all the time when he was watching the baseball he missed his son and stated the school team won, and when he left the playground he was just in tears and he was feeling sad, and then he believes that while going to the game, brought a lot of memories back to him and his feeling of loss got more intensified.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: Denies previous psychiatric treatment.

If there is a God, why did he give me my son and then took it away. I used to pray but not anymore.\u201d Patient stated that he goes to church to support his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION: Patient looks of his stated age, not in any acute physical distress. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Mood is dysphoric, and affect is depressed. Temperature 97.7. Pulse 85. Respirations 16. Blood pressure 126/79 on admission. Today, patient\u2019s temperature is 97.2. Pulse 81. Respirations 18. Blood pressure 141/95. Patient feels helpless, hopeless and worthless. The patient has suicidal thoughts but denies any active plans of hurting himself. Initially, patient was admitted to the adult closed unit but was transferred to the psychiatric intensive care unit for his safety since the patient was thinking intensely about suicide, and he just does not want to live anymore. Patient feels hopeless, helpless and worthless. Has marked feelings of anger and guilt. Oriented to time, place and person. Recent and remote memory is intact, and intelligence is normal. Speech is relevant and goal-oriented. During most part of this interview, patient was crying and sobbing. He is denying auditory or visual hallucinations but states that after the death of his son, \u201cI was smelling things and I felt things crawling under my skin, but not anymore.\u201d Attention and concentration are extremely poor. Patient states, \u201cMy mind is going all the time. I cannot shut up my mind. I am thinking about my son all the time.\u201d At the present time, patient is denying any homicidal thoughts or plans. I specifically asked the patient if he wants to kill the person that he feels is responsible for the death of his son, and patient stated, \u201cI just feel sorry for him. I am not thinking of killing him.\u201d Patient has suicidal thoughts but does not have any active plan of hurting himself. Patient has been admitted to the psychiatric intensive care unit for his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Patient has supportive family and is employed, which is a strength.
