The instructions given at trial did not properly apprise the jury of the <em>actus reus </em>of the accosting a minor statute and were therefore plainly erroneous. However, we conclude that, regardless of whether defendant waived review of the jury instructions, the instructions did not result in outcome-determinative error, defendant was not denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>effective assistance of counsel, and sufficient evidence was produced at trial to support the jury\u2019s verdict. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the jury convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Defendant, then aged 51, logged into a Yahoo! chat room under the screen name \u201cmr_ltr_nmidmi_007\u201d and engaged in a conversation with a person he believed to be a 15-year-old girl indentifying herself as \u201ckeyanagurl.\u201d Before he asked keyanagurl her age, defendant stated that he was \u201cvery horny\u201d and asked keyanagurl if she wanted to role-play. Defendant went on to say that he enjoyed different types of sexual activities, including \u201crole, phone, cyber\u201d and \u201creal!\u201d In fact, keyanagurl was Vincent Emrick, an undercover police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Upon learning that keyanagurl was supposedly a 15-year-old girl, defendant continued the chat. Defendant informed keyanagurl that he had a \u201cgreat pool in the woods\u201d with \u201cno neighbors in sight,\u201d and asked if she had a boyfriend. Defendant told keyanagurl he was divorced, but explained that he would rather \u201cbe with someone, enjoy sharing and cuddling[.]\u201d Defendant requested that keyanagurl send him photographs of herself, and keyanagurl agreed and sent a photograph of a 15-year-old girl. The conversation continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\"><em>Defendant: </em>I might hav too take cold shower \u2014 lol</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB-Y\"><em>keyanagurl: </em>ya me2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\"><em>Defendant: </em>you horny too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmG\"><em>keyanagurl: </em>ya</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Defendant: </em>mmm \u2014 nice</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\"><em>Defendant: </em>what size chest do you hav looks awesome</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\"><em>keyanagurl: </em>its 36b</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai77\"><em>Defendant: </em>yummy</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Defendant asked keyanagurl what she was wearing, and when she responded \u201cnuthin hot,\u201d defendant exclaimed, \u201coh baby sweet.\u201d Defendant indicated that he was only wearing boxer shorts and repeatedly asked if the two could speak on the telephone or Internet voice chat. First, defendant asked keyanagurl, \u201cyou hav mic?\u201d When keyanagurl responded that her microphone was broken, he asked if she had a cellular phone or whether she could enable his microphone on her computer. When that did not work, defendant asked to call her home phone. During these repeated attempts to speak with her, defendant also engaged in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\"><em>Defendant: </em>i lov to fantasize about young women gets me rock hard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\"><em>keyanagurl: </em>good</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\"><em>Defendant: </em>i lov oral</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqDr\"><em>keyanagurl: </em>its ok</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG1n\"><em>Defendant: </em>esp [giving]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">After keyanagurl refused his last attempt to speak with her on the phone, defendant conceded that he was \u201cthinkin with wrong brain[.]\u201d When keyanagurl asked defendant how many \u201cbrains\u201d he had, defendant replied that he had two and that one was in his boxers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>was \u201cgettin bigger\u201d and \u201cfeels great[.]\u201d He stated that when he was in school he was \u201calways horny[.]\u201d The chat concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\"><em>Defendant: </em>jus need to cyber</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2M\"><em>Keyanagurl-. </em>cyber wat</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afg\"><em>Defendant: </em>sx</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATV\"><em>keyanagurl: </em>ya wit who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\"><em>Defendant: </em>someone</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\"><em>keyanagurl: </em>u cyberin now</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azs\"><em>Defendant: </em>nope ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\"><em>Defendant: </em>gonna stroke it soon</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Over the following six days, keyanagurl chatted two more times with defendant. During the second chat, defendant stated that he was about to vacuum his pool to prepare for a party later that evening. He stated that there would be friends and alcohol at the party and exclaimed, \u201ccant wait for hot weather for skinny dip-p[ing].\u201d Defendant also mentioned that he had a hot tub. During the third chat, keyanagurl asked defendant about his pool party. Defendant responded that \u201cit was a blast\u201d with \u201clots of partying\u201d and explained that he was back at work. He stated, \u201ccant wait to get home and skinny dip\u201d and \u201ci love being naked.\u201d Defendant explained that, during the party, \u201cthere was lots of naked bodies in my pool, big orgy[.]\u201d He stated that he was \u201ca touchy feely type guy[.]\u201d When keyanagurl asked defendant if the partygoers were all drunk, defendant stated \u201cyup\u201d and remarked, \u201cwe needed a sexy waitress like you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Shortly thereafter, Emrick appeared at defendant\u2019s home to execute a search warrant. Defendant denied that he owned a computer, denied that he had home Internet access, and denied that he had a Yahoo! account. However, Emrick observed a computer monitor in the home and confronted defendant with a local newspaper article that featured a story about how defendant used the Internet to collect Frisbees. Several hours after Emrick left the residence, a homeowner in the area saw defendant dump \u201cthin strips of beige plastic\u201d near a dirt road in a rural location. Police officers responded to the call and collected the parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">At trial, prosecution witness Jasmine DeWeese testified that when she was 22 years old, she began an online relationship with defendant that included consensual cybersex and eventually led to physical sex.' After two or three chats, defendant invited DeWeese to his home, and he offered to pay her to clean his house. DeWeese agreed and went to defendant\u2019s home on several occasions. She testified that defendant asked her to wear clothing that made her look \u201ccute\u201d and \u201cyoung\u201d and specifically requested that she wear a \u201cschoolgirl\u201d outfit. DeWeese testified that defendant suggested that she bring her underage sister along to help clean and swim in his pool, where \u201c[s]uits were optional.\u201d DeWeese testified that defendant showed her his favorite pornographic websites and other pornography stored on his computer\u2019s hard drive. DeWeese testified that the photographs on the hard drive depicted girls that looked \u201cextremely young\u201d and sexually undeveloped. The trial court admitted DeWeese\u2019s testimony pursuant to MRE 404(b) to show defendant\u2019s intent and to show that defendant acted according to a common plan, scheme, or system.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Defendant did not present any evidence and instead moved for a directed verdict, which the trial court denied. During closing argument, the prosecutor stated that the accosting a minor statute, MCL 750.145a, required a finding that defendant \u201cdid accost, solicit, or entice.\u201d The prosecutor proceeded to define each of those terms and explained, \u201cSo those are the three ways you can do this. You accost, entice or solicit. . . [and] the prosecution has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements. That\u2019s one of the elements I have to prove.\u201d In her rebuttal, the prosecutor stated that \u201c[a]ccosting a minor on the internet for the purposes I\u2019ve described in the statute, that\u2019s illegal.\u201d The prosecutor noted that \u201c[t]he law says accost, entice or solicit with a certain intent. ... It says you accosted, enticed or solicited with the intent to result in an act.\u201d She argued that defendant had tried to entice and induce keyanagurl.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Defense counsel responded in closing argument that defendant had not accosted, enticed, solicited, or encouraged keyanagurl to commit any proscribed act, despite participating in the chats. Defense counsel argued that because defendant did not invite keyanagurl to meet him, did not ask her to have sex with him, and did not exchange obscene photographs with her, defendant could not be guilty of accosting a minor under MCL 750.145a. Rather, defense counsel asserted that a conviction under MCL 750.145a must be supported by \u201csome kind of an action, . . . some kind of an act in furtherance \u2014 not just words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Following closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of accosting a minor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">The Defendant is charged with accosting a child for immoral purposes. To prove this charge, the Prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt. First, that the Defendant believed he was engaging with a child under the age of 16 years. Second, that the Defendant has then the intent to induce that person who he believed to be under 16 years to commit an immoral act or an act of sexual intercourse or an act of gross indecency or other acts of depravity or delinquency or <em>did encourage said person to engage in one of those acts. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Defense counsel stated that he did not have any objection to the instructions. While deliberating, the jury asked the court for the definition of \u201caccost,\u201d and the court provided the following dictionary definition: \u201cto approach and speak to, greet first before being greeted, especially in an intrusive way.\u201d Defense counsel likewise did not object to that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Thereafter, the jury convicted defendant of accosting a minor, MCL 750.145a, and of using a computer or the Internet to do the same, MCL 750.145d(1)(a). Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal or for a new trial, arguing that insufficient evidence supported a finding of the <em>actus reus </em>element of MCL 750.145a. Defendant also moved for a Ginther<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> hearing and argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions. The trial court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Defendant appealed as of right, and the Court of Appeals reversed his convictions and remanded the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on MCL 750.145a because the instruction entirely omitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>actus reus </em>of the offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it was impossible to tell whether the jury would have reached the same result had it been properly instructed. However, the Court of Appeals rejected defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. The prosecution applied for leave to appeal, and defendant applied for leave to cross-appeal. We granted both applications.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">A. ELEMENTS OP MCL 750.145a</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The prosecution argues that the Court of Appeals erred by concluding that the trial court committed instructional error warranting reversal. Before determining whether the jury instructions were erroneous, we must first construe the meaning and elements of accosting a minor, MCL 750.145a. We review de novo questions of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The primary goal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>in interpreting the meaning of a statute is to \u201cascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature ... .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first step in determining legislative intent is consideration of the statutory language itself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Statutory language must be read in the context of the act as a whole, giving every word its plain and ordinary meaning.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the language is clear and unambiguous, we enforce the statute as written.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">MCL 750.145a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">A person who <em>accosts, entices, or solicits a child </em>less than 16 years of age, regardless of whether the person knows the individual is a child or knows the actual age of the child, or an individual whom he or she believes is a child less than 16 years of age with the intent to induce or force that child or individual to commit an immoral act, to submit to an act of sexual intercourse or an act of gross indecency, or to any other act of depravity or delinquency, <em>or who encourages a child </em>less than 16 years of age, regardless of whether the person knows the individual is a child or knows the actual age of the child, or an individual whom he or she believes is a child less than 16 years of age <em>to engage in any of those acts </em>is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years or a fine of not more than $4,000.00, or both. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Reduced to its essential language, this provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">A person who accosts, entices, or solicits a child ... with the intent to induce or force that child... to commit an immoral act, to submit to an act of sexual intercourse or an act of gross indecency, or to any other act of depravity or delinquency, <em>or </em>who encourages a child ... to engage in any of those acts is guilty of a felony .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Because the Legislature used the disjunctive term \u201cor,\u201d it is clear that there are two ways to commit the crime of accosting a minor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A defendant is guilty of accosting a minor if the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1) accosted, enticed, or solicited (2) a child (or an individual whom the defendant believed to be a child) (3) with the intent to induce or force that child to commit (4) a proscribed act. Alternatively, a defendant is guilty of accosting a minor if the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1) encouraged (2) a child (or an individual whom the defendant believed to be a child) (3) to commit (4) a proscribed act. Taken as a whole, the statute permits conviction under two alternative theories, one that pertains to certain acts and requires a specific intent and another that pertains to encouragement only and is silent with respect to <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Although the latter, \u201cencourages\u201d prong lacks an explicit element of intent, there is no clear indication that the Legislature meant to dispense with the <em>mens rea </em>requirement. When interpreting a criminal statute that does not have an explicit <em>mens rea </em>element, we do not construe the Legislature\u2019s silence as an intention to eliminate the <em>mens rea </em>requirement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Significantly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cencourages\u201d indicated its intention that the <em>mens rea </em>element of the encourages prong be the intent to do the physical act of encouraging. The verb \u201cencourages\u201d contemplates intentional conduct by a defendant. To \u201cencourage\u201d means \u201cto inspire with courage, spirit, or confidence^]... to stimulate by guidance, approval,... to promote; foster.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the act of encouragement is the evil in itself, and an accused, by completing the act, is \u201cpresumed to intend the natural consequences of his [actions] . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In essence, the encourages prong envisions a <em>mens rea </em>consistent with a general criminal intent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In comparison, if a defendant has committed acts of accosting, enticing, or soliciting, the statute requires the prosecution to demonstrate a specific intent to induce or force the child to commit proscribed acts; it is not enough for the prosecution to merely establish that the defendant committed acts of accosting, enticing, or soliciting. The Legislature\u2019s inclusion of alternative bases for conviction, one that requires proof of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>criminal intent and another that requires proof of a general criminal intent, demonstrated an intention to criminalize a wide range of sexually predatory actions aimed at children.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">B. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Having construed the elements of MCL 750.145a, we now consider whether the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding the crime of accosting a minor were erroneous. We review de novo claims of instructional error.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We must consider the instructions as a whole, rather than piecemeal, to determine whether any error occurred.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to have a jury determine his or her guilt from its consideration of every essential element of the charged offense.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A defendant is thus \u201c \u2018entitled to have all the elements of the crime submitted to the jury in a charge which [is] neither erroneous nor misleading. . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Instructional errors that omit an element of an offense, or otherwise misinform the jury of an offense\u2019s elements, do \u201cnot <em>necessarily </em>render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, an imperfect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>instruction is not grounds for setting aside a conviction if the instruction fairly presented the issues to be tried and adequately protected the defendant\u2019s rights.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">As noted, the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of accosting a minor as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">The Defendant is charged with accosting a child for immoral purposes. To prove this charge, the Prosecutor must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt. First, that the Defendant believed he was engaging with a child under the age of 16 years. Second, that the Defendant has then the intent to induce that person who he believed to be under 16 years to commit an immoral act or an act of sexual intercourse or an act of gross indecency or other acts of depravity or delinquency <em>or did encourage said person to engage in one of those acts. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Considering this instruction as a whole, we conclude that it misinformed the jury of the elements of the offense. Although the instruction was correct with respect to the encourages prong of the offense, it erroneously omitted the <em>actus reus </em>element of the \u201caccosts, entices, or solicits\u201d prong of the offense. The fact that the trial court properly instructed on the encourages prong of the offense did not negate this instructional error. This is because we do not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 know whether the jury convicted defendant on the basis of the accosts, entices, or solicits prong of the offense or the encourages prong of the offense. Because the trial court omitted the <em>actus reus </em>portion of the accosts, entices, or solicits prong, the instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>erroneous and the jury was precluded from making a finding on this element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Again, a jury instruction that improperly omits an element of a crime amounts to a constitutional error.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, because defense counsel here explicitly and repeatedly approved the instruction, defendant has waived the error. This Court has defined \u201cwaiver\u201d as \u201cthe intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cOne who waives his rights under a rule may not then seek appellate review of a claimed deprivation of those rights, for his waiver has extinguished any error.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> When defense counsel clearly expresses satisfaction with a trial court\u2019s decision, counsel\u2019s action will be deemed to constitute a waiver.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In this case, before jury selection, the trial court proposed to the prosecutor and defense counsel the jury instructions for accosting a minor ultimately given. After the court read the instructions, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\"><em>The Court: </em>Is there any objection to that as a preliminary instruction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\"><em>Defense Counsel: </em>Is that, is that taken from the statute\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\"><em>Defense Counsel: </em>[T]hat\u2019s where I took mine from as well so I, <em>I don\u2019t have an objection to that. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>After the close of proofs, the trial court dismissed the jury, and defense counsel expressed his approval of the jury instructions generally. The trial court again read the proposed instruction for accosting a minor, along with several other model jury instructions. The trial court then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\"><em>The Court: </em>Any objection to those instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\"><em>Prosecutor: </em>No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\"><em>Defense Counsel: </em>No, your Honor, not, not at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">After providing the instructions to the jury, the trial court once again asked counsel if there were any objections. Defense counsel for the fourth time stated, \u201cNone by the defense, your Honor.\u201d Thus, by expressly and repeatedly approving the jury instructions on the record, defendant waived any objection to the erroneous instructions, and there is no error to review.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Defendant, however, argues that defense counsel merely forfeited the error because counsel did not state that he \u201capproved\u201d of the instructions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The distinction defendant attempts to make between counsel stating, \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>approve of the instructions,\u201d and counsel stating, \u201cI have no objections,\u201d is unavailing. Counsel\u2019s statements were express and unequivocal indications that he approved of the instructions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would allow counsel to \u201charbor error at trial and then use that error as an appellate parachute. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Nevertheless, even if we were to accept defendant\u2019s argument that defense counsel did not waive the issue and, instead, merely forfeited it, defendant would not be entitled to reversal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">We review unpreserved constitutional error for plain error affecting a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In order to avoid forfeiture under a plain-error analysis, defendant must establish (1) that an error occurred, (2) that the error was plain, and (3) that the plain error affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Even if defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>dant could satisfy these requirements, \u201c[r] ever sal is warranted only when the plain, forfeited error resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or when an error \u2018 \u201cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d independent of the defendant\u2019s innocence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Defendant has established that an instructional error occurred and that the error is plain and obvious on the record. However, defendant cannot establish that this error affected his substantial rights. We have previously held that jury instructions that were somewhat deficient may nonetheless, when viewed as a whole, have sufficed to protect a defendant\u2019s rights when the jury would have convicted the defendant on the basis of the evidence regardless of the instructional error.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If the evidence related to the missing element was overwhelming and uncontested, it cannot be said that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights or otherwise undermined the outcome of the proceedings.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Here, even if the trial court had properly instructed on the accosts, entices, and solicits prong of the offense, the jury would still have convicted defendant because the Internet chats, in and of themselves, were immoral, grossly indecent, delinquent, and depraved acts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>constituted the <em>actus reus </em>under either prong of the offense.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The only acts on which the prosecution based the charge were defendant\u2019s online exchanges with keyanagurl. These chats were admitted into evidence, without any objection, and defendant, during opening and closing argument, conceded that these conversations occurred. The content of the exchanges established beyond any reasonable doubt that the chats constituted immoral, grossly indecent, depraved, or delinquent acts.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">At the outset, defendant invited keyanagurl to engage in role-playing or cybersex. After learning keyanagurl\u2019s age, defendant continued to guide the course of the conversation in a manner intended to heighten the sexualized nature of the chats. Defendant asked keyanagurl if she was \u201chorny\u201d and indicated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>was; defendant asked keyanagurl for her photograph and upon receiving it, indicated that he was sexually aroused and referred to physical attributes of his genitalia; and defendant told keyanagurl that he enjoyed fantasizing about young women and performing oral sex. Defendant also told keyanagurl that she was \u201ccute\u201d and had a \u201cyummy\u201d chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Moreover, defendant sought to escalate the instant messaging conversation by repeatedly requesting or soliciting keyanagurl to talk over the telephone or using their computers\u2019 microphones, interspersing those solicitations with highly sexualized comments, including comments about how horny he was. After keyanagurl rebuffed defendant\u2019s attempts to speak with her, this first chat between defendant and keyanagurl concluded with defendant stating that he needed to have cybersex with someone and that he would soon masturbate. In subsequent chats, defendant spoke of a \u201cbig orgy,\u201d skinny-dipping, his hot tub, and how he loved to be naked; he also told keyanagurl that he needed her to be his \u201csexy waitress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Additionally, DeWeese\u2019s testimony would have allowed a rational juror to conclude that defendant\u2019s acts were intended to engage keyanagurl in sexually delinquent behavior through a common plan or scheme that he had used on DeWeese. DeWeese testified that her online chats with defendant eventually led to cybersex at defendant\u2019s direction. She testified that defendant told her to dress so that she looked \u201cyoung\u201d and explained that defendant had a collection of pornographic photographs of sexually undeveloped girls. Further, a jury could have inferred from the testimony of the homeowner who lived in the area that, after Emrick questioned defendant, defendant destroyed his computer and discarded it in a secluded, rural location. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>This, coupled with defendant\u2019s dishonesty about having home Internet access, would have allowed a jury to infer that defendant evinced a consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Taking all this evidence together, it is clear that the evidence of the <em>actus reus </em>under either prong of the offense was overwhelming and uncontroverted. The chats constituted highly sexualized conversations, which were by themselves immoral, grossly indecent, delinquent, or depraved acts. These highly sexualized conversations between defendant (an adult stranger) and a person whom he presumed to be a child, in which the child sent the stranger her photograph, was asked for her phone number, and was continuously objectified in a sexual manner, would have given an actual child a distorted and unhealthy view of human relationships and would have involved her in a distinctly antisocial set of behaviors. As the prosecutor explained at trial, \u201csex talk over the internet,\u201d such as the highly sexualized conversations that undisputedly occurred between defendant and someone whom he believed to be a 15-year-old girl, \u201cin and of itself is a delinquent act for a minor to be engaging in. . . .\u201d We agree with the prosecutor that, according to \u201ccommon everyday understanding . . . this [kind of sex talk over the Internet] is delinquent behavior. . . .\u201d By engaging in the chats, defendant committed the <em>actus reus </em>of accosting a minor under either prong of the offense. Therefore, by admitting that he participated in the chats with a person he presumed was a 15-year-old girl, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>cannot establish that the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury affected the outcome of the lower court proceedings.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Defendant engaged in highly sexualized online chats with a person whom he believed to be a 15-year-old girl. In doing so, he accosted, enticed, solicited, or encouraged a child to commit an immoral, grossly indecent, delinquent, or depraved act within the meaning of those terms in MCL 750.145a. Although the trial court erred when it failed to instruct on the <em>actus reus </em>of the accosts prong of the offense, reversal is not warranted. Regardless of whether defendant waived review of the instructional error, the error did not affect his substantial rights, defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel, and there was sufficient evidence to support his convictions. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for reinstatement of the judgment of sentence pursuant to the jury convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Young, C.

The harmless-error test applies to <em>preserved </em>constitutional errors. See <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 774. In this case, defendant did not preserve his claim of constitutional error for review; rather, as we have concluded, he waived any error.

For the same reasons that we conclude that defendant failed to show outcome-determinative prejudice under the plain-error standard discussed earlier in this opinion, we also conclude that defendant failed to show that there was a \u201creasonable probability that hut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>From the same evidence, we likewise conclude that sufficient evidence supported defendant\u2019s convictions under MCL 750.145a and MCL 750.145d(1)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b727-4\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3B\"><em>(concurring in the result). </em>I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the charged offense, MCL 750.145a. Although I do not believe that the evidence against defendant was \u201coverwhelming,\u201d I concede that, under the facts of this case, defendant cannot establish that he is entitled to relief under plain-error review. Accordingly, I concur only with the result reached by the majority opinion. I write separately, however, because I question the majority\u2019s waiver analysis. I also write to reiterate my belief that this Court should not have extended the plain-error review doctrine to the type of arguably unpreserved constitutional error present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Federal caselaw suggests that the majority\u2019s waiver analysis is overly simplistic. As the majority correctly explains, the canonical definition of \u201cwaiver\u201d is the \u201c <em>\u2018intentional </em>relinquishment of a <em>known </em>right.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Shahideh, </em>482 Mich 1156, 1180 (2008) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Bailey v Jones, </em>243 Mich 159, 162; 219 NW 629 (1928) (emphasis added). Applying this definition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has concluded that the threshold question in determining whether an issue capable of being waived has indeed been waived is \u201cwhether the appellant who failed to object in the trial court to an error that violated his rights was <em>aware </em>of the relinquished or abandoned right.\u201d <em>Virgin Islands v Rosa, </em>399 F3d 283, 291 (CA 3, 2005) (emphasis added). In other words, while \u201cwaiver is accomplished by intent,\u201d unpreserved, or what has been dubbed \u201cforfeited,\u201d error \u201ccomes about through neglect.\u201d <em>United States v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Cruz-Rodriguez, 570 F3d 1179, 1183 (CA 10, 2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted); see, also, <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535, 554; 520 NW2d 123 (1994) (Levin, J., concurring). Accordingly, a rote statement by trial counsel that he has \u201cno objection\u201d to the instructions, or his expression of satisfaction with the instructions as given, may not necessarily be determinative of whether the right was in fact waived. <em>Rosa, </em>399 F3d at 287-289, 291, 293. Instead, whether a failure to object will be deemed a waiver depends on whether the defendant had knowledge of the right, yet intentionally chose to abandon it or \u201cconsciously refrain[ed] from objecting as a tactical matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291 (quotation marks and citations omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Although some federal courts have concluded otherwise, see, e.g., <em>United States v Gonzalez, </em>319 F3d 291, 298 (CA 7, 2003), in my view, the aforementioned analysis is persuasive and consistent with the generally recognized notion that waiver of a constitutional right should not be lightly presumed, see <em>Brookhart v Janis, </em>384 US 1, 4; 86 S Ct 1245; 16 L Ed 2d 314 (1966) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>(explaining that \u201c[t]here is a presumption against the waiver of constitutional rights\u201d); <em>Rosa, </em>399 F3d at 294 n 12 (explaining that a defendant\u2019s federal due process rights are violated if a jury instruction omits or materially misdescribes an essential element of an offense). By focusing on the definition of waiver \u2014 i.e., the <em>intentional </em>relinquishment of a <em>known </em>right \u2014 the federal caselaw discussed ensures that a defendant\u2019s right to appellate review of an instructional error is not summarily foreclosed simply because trial counsel mechanically agreed with an erroneous jury instruction when counsel was unaware of the correct rule of law or, if aware of it, did not realize that the instruction misstated the law. <em>Rosa, </em>399 F3d at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In light of this caselaw, I would not hastily presume that a waiver occurred in this case simply because defense counsel stated on more than one occasion that he had no objection to the instruction. Indeed, the facts of <em>Rosa </em>counsel against such an analysis. See <em>id. </em>at 287-289, 291, 293.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Nevertheless, I concur with the majority\u2019s result because I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that defendant cannot establish that he is entitled to relief under the plain-error standard of review. As I have noted in the past, however, I continue to disagree with this Court\u2019s decision to extend plain-error review to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>unpreserved constitutional errors and instead would subject such errors to harmless-error analysis. See <em>Grant, </em>445 Mich at 554-557 (Levin, J., concurring); <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 775-783; 597 NW2d 130 (1999) (MARILYN Kelly, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>People v Borgne, </em>483 Mich 178, 196 n 8, 202 n 17; 768 NW2d 290 (2009). Indeed, as I have previously stated, the notion that a defendant would not be entitled to relief if, despite the error seriously affecting the fairness and integrity of the trial, he could not prove prejudice \u201cseems to be an anomaly that should not stand\u201d and is yet another reason that I continue to disagree with the <em>Carines </em>and <em>Grant </em>framework. <em>Borgne, </em>483 Mich at 202 n 17.1 acknowledge that my position regarding unpreserved constitutional errors has yet to win the favor of this Court. Thus, as I have done in other cases, I recognize that <em>Carines </em>is the law in Michigan. For this reason, I concur only in the result reached by the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b730-5\">Marilyn Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\"> See, also, <em>Cruz-Rodriguez, </em>570 F3d at 1183, 1185 (stating that \u201c[w]aiver occurs when a party <em>deliberately considers </em>an issue and malees an <em>intentional decision </em>to forgo it\u201d and identifying the \u201cclassic waiver\u201d situation as occurring when \u201ca party \u2018actually identified the issue,\u2019 \u2018deliberately considered\u2019 it, and then affirmatively acted in a manner that \u2018abandoned any claim\u2019 on the issue\u201d) (emphasis added) (citation omitted); <em>United States v Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F3d 382, 384 (CA 5, 2006) (concluding that a scoring error was not waived when there was no evidence that counsel \u201cknew of the sentencing guidelines issue,\u201d yet \u201cconsciously chose\u201d to forgo it given defense counsel\u2019s mere statement that he had \u201cno problem\u201d with the presentence report); accord <em>People v Grimmett, </em>388 Mich 590, 598, 601; 202 NW2d 278 (1972) (explaining that waiver requires both \u201cspecific knowledge of the constitutional right\u201d and an \u201cintentional decision to abandon the ... right\u201d and concluding that no waiver occurred when defense counsel was mistaken in his view of the law), overruled on other ground by <em>People v White, </em>390 Mich 245; 212 NW2d 222 (1973), overruled on other grounds by <em>People v Nutt, </em>469 Mich 565; 677 NW2d 1 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\"> In <em>Rosa, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit did not find a \u201cknowing waiver situation\u201d despite discussions regarding the jury instructions and despite defense counsel\u2019s (1) statement that he had \u201clooked at\u201d the proposed instructions, that they could apply to his client, and that he had no additions to or modifications or corrections of the proposed instructions and (2) statements on at least three occasions that he was satisfied with the proposed jury instructions, including at least one acquiescence that occurred after a delay that provided the attorneys additional time to review and raise objections to the proposed instructions. <em>Rosa, </em>399 F3d at 287-289, 291, 293.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
