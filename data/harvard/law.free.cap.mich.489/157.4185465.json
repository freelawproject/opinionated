The boards had been leaned against a wall by employees of defendant, a carpentry and drywall subcontractor, which, like plaintiff\u2019s employer, had been hired by a general contractor to work on the construction project. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence and defendant moved for summary disposition, asserting that, under <em>Fultz v Union-Commerce Assoc, </em>470 Mich 460, 469-470; 683 NW2d 587 (2004), and its progeny, it owed no duty to plaintiff that was \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from defendant\u2019s contractual duties to the general contractor. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal. <em>Loweke v Ann Arbor Ceiling &amp; Partition Co, Inc, </em>488 Mich 876 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We take this opportunity to clarify <em>Fultz\u2019s </em>\u201c \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 mode of analysis,\u201d 470 Mich at 467, and hold that a contracting party\u2019s assumption of contractual obligations does not extinguish or limit separately existing common-law or statutory tort duties owed to noncontracting third parties in the performance of the contract. <em>Davis v Venture One Constr, Inc, </em>568 F3d 570, 575, 577 (CA 6, 2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, plaintiff asserts that defendant had a common-law duty, separate and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>tinct from its contractual obligations to the general contractor, to use ordinary care in order to avoid physical harm to persons and property in the execution of its undertakings. See, e.g., <em>Clark v Dalman, </em>379 Mich 251, 261; 150 NW2d 755 (1967); <em>Rinaldo\u2019s Constr v Mich Bell Tel Co, </em>454 Mich 65, 84; 559 NW2d 647 (1997). Because defendant raised its motion for summary disposition on the basis of an improper understanding of <em>Fultz, </em>and the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary disposition on that basis, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Plaintiff, Richard Loweke,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was an electrician employed by Shaw Electric, a subcontractor on a construction project at Detroit Metro Airport. Walbridge Aldinger Company, the general contractor for the project, also subcontracted with defendant to provide carpentry and drywall services. Defendant\u2019s employees leaned numerous 4- by 8-foot sheets of cement board against a wall in a hallway where plaintiff was working. Plaintiff claimed that at the time of the accident, he was standing midway in front of the cement boards when, for unknown reasons, sheets of the cement board began to fall. Plaintiff attempted to stop the boards from falling on him, but to no avail: several sheets of cement board fell onto plaintiff\u2019s right leg, injuring him.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Plaintiff sued defendant, alleging that defendant was negligent in stacking the cement boards in an unstable position, creating a new hazard that previously did not exist. Relying primarily on <em>Fultz, </em>defendant moved for summary disposition, asserting that it was not liable to plaintiff in tort because plaintiffs allegations were based on an assertion that defendant negligently performed its contractual obligations to the general contractor and, thus, were not based on any separate and distinct duty that defendant owed to plaintiff. To support its argument, defendant cited its contract with Walbridge, which held defendant responsible for \u201cunloading, moving, lifting, protection, securing and dispensing of its materials and equipment at the Project Site.\u201d Defendant asserted that it had not violated any duty that was independent of the contract because, in its view, the management and storage of its materials was a subject of its contract with Walbridge. The trial court agreed with defendant and granted its motion for summary disposition, reasoning that what had happened was within defendant\u2019s obligations under the contract. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The Court of Appeals affirmed. The Court explained that, under <em>Fultz, </em>a \u201ccourt must look at the terms of the contract and determine whether the defendant\u2019s action was required under the contract.\u201d <em>Loweke v Ann Arbor Ceiling &amp; Partition Co, Inc, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued April 22, 2010 (Docket No. 289451), p 3. Because defendant was required under its contract with Walbridge to secure the cement board at the project site, the Court reasoned that plaintiffs claim was based on defendant\u2019s negligence in performing its obligations under the contract and that the alleged hazard had not presented any unique risk that was not contemplated by the contract. Finally, the Court claimed that its holding was sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ported by two peremptory orders of this Court: <em>Mierzejewski v Torre &amp; Bruglio, Inc, 477 </em>Mich 1087 (2007), and <em>Banaszak v Northwest Airlines, Inc, 477 </em>Mich 895 (2006). We granted plaintiffs application for leave to appeal. <em>Loweke, </em>488 Mich 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">This Court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary disposition. <em>In re Egbert R Smith Trust, </em>480 Mich 19, 23; 745 NW2d 754 (2008). This Court also reviews de novo questions of law. <em>Byker v Mannes, </em>465 Mich 637, 643; 641 NW2d 210 (2002). Whether a defendant is under a legal obligation to act for a plaintiffs benefit \u2014 i.e., whether a defendant owes a particular plaintiff a duty \u2014 is a question of law. <em>Dyer v Trachtman, </em>470 Mich 45, 49; 679 NW2d 311 (2004); <em>Valcaniant v Detroit Edison Co, </em>470 Mich 82, 86; 679 NW2d 689 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">To establish a prima facie case of negligence, a plaintiff must prove the following elements: (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty, (2) the defendant breached the legal duty, (3) the plaintiff suffered damages, and (4) the defendant\u2019s breach was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs damages. <em>Roulo v Auto Club of Mich, </em>386 Mich 324, 328; 192 NW2d 237 (1971). Accordingly, a defendant is not liable to a plaintiff unless the defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff. <em>Beaty v Hertzberg &amp; Golden, PC, </em>456 Mich 247, 262; 571 NW2d 716 (1997). In this case, the issue is when a duty of care arises between a party to a contract and a noncontracting third party. In other words, when two parties enter into a contract and a noncontracting third party, i.e., one who is a stranger to the contract, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>injured, under what circumstances does a duty of care arise between the contracting party and the third party?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In Fultz,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this Court attempted to clarify the standards for determining when a negligence action based on a defendant\u2019s contractual obligations with another and brought by a third party to that contract may lie. Since <em>Fultz </em>and its progeny were issued, however, courts have erroneously interpreted this Court\u2019s decisions as rejecting accepted tort-law principles and creating a legal rule \u201cunique to Michigan tort law,\u201d which bars negligence causes of action on the basis of a lack of duty if a third-party plaintiff alleges a hazard that was the subject of the defendant\u2019s contractual obligations with another. <em>Bennett v MIS Corp, </em>607 F3d 1076, 1091-1092,1094-1095 (CA 6, 2010); see, also, <em>Hatcher v Senior Home Health Care Inc, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued August 19, 2010 (Docket No. 289208), p 5 (stating that a claim is barred if an injury is \u201ccaused by a hazard that is even remotely connected to a contractual relationship\u201d). Because this broad interpretation is misguided, we write to clarify <em>Fultz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">A. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Before <em>Fultz, </em>when a plaintiff pleaded a tort arising out of a defendant\u2019s breach of contractual obligations, Michigan courts historically drew a distinction between \u201cmisfeasance\u201d of a contractual obligation \u2014 i.e., \u201cactive misconduct\u201d \u2014 and \u201cnonfeasance\u201d of a contractual obligation \u2014 i.e., \u201cpassive inaction,\u201d <em>Williams v Cun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>ningham Drug Stores, </em>Inc, 429 Mich 495, 498; 418 NW2d 381 (1988), or \u201cfailing to do what one has promised to do in the absence of a duty to act apart from the promise made,\u201d <em>Ferrett v Gen Motors Corp, </em>438 Mich 235, 245 n 11; 475 NW2d 243 (1991) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Under this dichotomy, a contracting party generally was not liable in tort for the complete nonperformance of a contractual obligation, or nonfeasance, whereas defective performance of a contractual obligation, or misfeasance, could support an action in tort or contract. <em>Rinaldo\u2019s Constr, </em>454 Mich at 83-84; <em>Ferrett, </em>438 Mich at 245 n 11; <em>Chase v Clinton Co, </em>241 Mich 478, 486; 217 NW 565 (1928). As this Court has stated, however, the fundamental principle distinguishing a cause of action in tort from one in contract is the concept of duty. <em>Rinaldo\u2019s Constr, </em>454 Mich at 83. Accordingly, in cases of nonfeasance, a defendant who fails to perform his contractual duties is ordinarily not liable in tort because, as a general tort rule, \u201cthere is no duty that obligates one person to aid or protect another.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>429 Mich at 498-499.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, when a defendant completely fails to perform his contractual obligations, \u201c[w]hat we are left with is defendant\u2019s failure to complete his contracted-for performance,\u201d which \u201cis not a duty imposed by the law upon all, the violation of which gives rise to a tort action\u201d but, instead, is \u201ca duty arising out of the intentions of the [contracting] parties themselves and owed only to those specific individuals to whom the promise runs.\u201d <em>Hart v Ludwig, </em>347 Mich 559, 565-566; 79 NW2d 895 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>In contrast, cases that recognized a cause of action in tort arising out of the negligent performance of a contract by a defendant \u201cgenerally involve [d] a separate and distinct duty imposed by law for the benefit of the plaintiff that provide[d] a right to maintain [the] action without regard to whether there was a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.\u201d Ferrett, 438 Mich at 245. This separate and distinct duty \u201cimposed by law\u201d could arise by operation of a statute or under the \u201cbasic rule of the common law, which imposes on every person engaged in the prosecution of any undertaking an obligation to use due care, or to so govern his actions as not to unreasonably endanger the person or property of others.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>379 Mich at 261; see, also, <em>Rinaldo\u2019s Constr, </em>454 Mich at 84; <em>Parker v Port Huron Hosp, </em>361 Mich 1, 11; 105 NW2d 1 (1960) (\u201cIt should be noted that... at the common law . .. the general rule has been that one is liable for his negligence or tortious acts.\u201d). Thus, in cases alleging misfeasance of contractual obligations, although there was a contract, it \u201cmerely create[d] the state of things which furnishe[d] the occasion of the tort.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>379 Mich at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">This Court, however, has recognized that determining whether an action in tort can arise out of a contractual promise is often largely semantic and difficult to discern. <em>Rinaldo\u2019s Constr, </em>454 Mich at 83; <em>Hart, </em>347 Mich at 564-565. In <em>Fultz, </em>a majority of this Court recognized the often \u201cslippery distinction\u201d between misfeasance and nonfeasance of contractual obligations and attempted to disentangle the misfeasance/nonfeasance dichotomy by shifting the focus to whether the particular defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff. <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 467 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Noting that this Court had described a tort action arising from the misfeasance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>contractual obligations as a \u201c \u2018violation of a legal duty separate and distinct from the contractual obligation,\u2019 \u201d the <em>Fultz </em>majority explained that this \u201c \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 definition of misfeasance\u201d offered better guidance in determining whether a negligence action based on a contract and brought by a third party could lie. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Rinaldo\u2019s Constr, </em>454 Mich at 84. Accordingly, after <em>Fultz, </em>courts were to forgo the misfeasance/nonfeasance distinction and, instead, employ a \u201c \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 mode of analysis\u201d to determine the threshold question: \u201cwhether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff that is separate and distinct from the defendant\u2019s contractual obligations.\u201d <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 467; see, also, 1 Torts: Michigan Law and Practice (2d ed), \u00a7 10.18, p 10-24. Under this analysis, an action would lie in contract if it was based solely on a defendant\u2019s failure or refusal to perform a contractual promise. In contrast, an action <em>could </em>lie in either contract or in tort if a \u201cdefendant negligently performs a contractual duty or breaches a duty arising by implication from the relation of the parties created by the contract . . . .\u201d <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 469. In the latter category of cases, however, no tort liability would arise \u201cfor failing to fulfill a promise in the absence of a duty to act that is separate and distinct from the promise made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Applying these principles, <em>Fultz </em>concluded that the plaintiff, who had slipped on a snow- and ice-covered parking lot, did not have a negligence cause of action against the contractor hired by the premises owner to plow and salt the lot because, in essence, the plaintiff merely claimed that the contractor had breached its contract by failing to perform its contractual duties. <em>Id. </em>at 468. Thus, because the plaintiff did not claim that she was a third-party beneficiary of the contract be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>tween the defendant and the premises owner or claim that the law otherwise imposed a duty on the defendant to complete the contracted-for performance, the plaintiff had failed to plead a duty owed to her that was independent, or \u201cseparate and distinct,\u201d from the defendant\u2019s contractual duty to the premises owner. <em>Id. </em>at 463, 468. After explaining that the <em>Fultz </em>plaintiff alleged no duty owed to her that was independent of the contract, this Court distinguished the facts of <em>Fultz </em>from <em>Osman v Summer Green Lawn Care, Inc, </em>209 Mich App 703; 532 NW2d 186 (1995), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Smith v Globe Life Ins Co, </em>460 Mich 446; 597 NW2d 28 (1999). The majority explained that <em>Osman </em>was factually similar, insofar as the <em>Osman </em>plaintiff was injured when she slipped on ice that the <em>Osman </em>defendant had contracted to remove from the premises owner\u2019s property. However, the facts of <em>Fultz </em>were distinguishable from the facts of <em>Osman </em>in a few significant respects: in <em>Osman, </em>the defendant <em>breached </em>a duty owed to the plaintiff that was separate and distinct from its contractual obligations when it created a \u201cnew hazard\u201d in carrying out its snow-removal duties. Specifically, in acting under the contract, the defendant moved snow to a portion of the premises that created a condition that it should have known would pose a danger to individuals traversing the area. <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 468-469. In contrast to the plaintiff in <em>Osman, </em>the <em>Fultz </em>plaintiff failed to establish <em>the existence of a duty </em>owed to her by the defendant and, thus, could not meet the threshold requirement for bringing a negligence action. The plaintiff simply asserted that the defendant had failed to perform its contractual obligations to the premises owner, which was insufficient to establish that the defendant owed her a duty in tort. <em>Id. </em>at 468-469. Accordingly, the plaintiffs remedy in <em>Fultz </em>rested solely against the premises owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>B. CLARIFICATION OF <em>FULTZ</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Although <em>Fultz </em>clearly stated that a defendant\u2019s legal duty to act must arise separately and distinctly from a defendant\u2019s contractual obligations, <em>Fultz\u2019s </em>\u201cseparate and distinct mode of analysis\u201d has been misconstrued to, in essence, establish a form of tort immunity that bars negligence claims raised by a noncontracting third party. This is due, in part, to two orders from this Court, <em>Mierzejewski, 477 </em>Mich 1087, and <em>Banaszak, 477 </em>Mich 895. Courts have misconstrued <em>Fultz\u2019s </em>test requiring a \u201cseparate and distinct duty\u201d by erroneously focusing on whether a defendant\u2019s conduct was separate and distinct from the obligations required by the contract or whether the hazard was a subject of or contemplated by the contract. See, e.g., <em>Carrington v Cadillac Asphalt, LLC, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 9, 2010 (Docket No 289075); <em>Hatcher, </em>unpub op at 5; see, also, 1 Torts: Michigan Law and Practice, \u00a7 10.18, p 10-25. This interpretation is incorrect because, in analyzing tort actions based on a contract and brought by a noncontracting third party, <em>Fultz </em>directed courts to focus on \u201c[w]hether a particular defendant owes <em>any duty at all </em>to a particular plaintiff,\u201d <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 467 (emphasis added), and, thus, generally required an inquiry into whether, aside from the contract, \u201ca defendant is under <em>any </em>legal obligation to act for the benefit of the plaintiff,\u201d <em>Valcaniant, </em>470 Mich at 86 n 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, also, <em>Davis, </em>568 F3d at 575-576.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Thus, in determining whether an action in tort will lie, <em>Fultz </em>recast the test to focus on whether any legal duty independent of the contract existed. <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 466. Notably, in requiring courts to focus on whether a defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff, <em>Fultz </em>directed courts to utilize the \u201c \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 definition of misfeasance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467. In shifting the focus to this Court\u2019s \u201cseparate and distinct definition of misfeasance,\u201d however, <em>Fultz </em>did not modify the aforementioned historical understandings of this Court\u2019s \u201cseparate and distinct mode of analysis.\u201d Instead, <em>Fultz </em>favorably cited <em>Rinaldo\u2019s Constr, </em>454 Mich at 84, and <em>Ferrett, </em>438 Mich at 245, which, like <em>Fultz, </em>focused on whether a <em>legal duty </em>independent of a contract existed, rather than whether defendant\u2019s conduct was separate and distinct from the tasks required by the contract or whether the hazard was contemplated by the contract. <em>Davis, </em>568 F3d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Determining whether a duty arises separately and distinctly from the contractual agreement, therefore, generally does not necessarily involve reading the contract, noting the obligations required by it, and determining whether the plaintiffs injury was contemplated by the contract. <em>Id. </em>Instead, <em>Fultz\u2019s </em>directive is to determine whether a defendant owes a noncontracting, third-party plaintiff a legal duty apart from the defendant\u2019s contractual obligations to another. <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 461-462. As this Court has historically recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>nized, a separate and distinct duty to support a cause of action in tort can arise by statute, <em>Clark, </em>379 Mich at 261, or by a number of preexisting tort principles, including duties imposed because of a special relationship between the parties, see, e.g., <em>Williams, </em>429 Mich at 499, and <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 468 n 4, and the generally recognized common-law duty to use due care in undertakings, see, e.g., <em>Clark, </em>379 Mich at 261; <em>Hart, </em>347 Mich at 564. As this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">Cases recognizing a right to maintain an action in tort arising out of a breach of contract by the defendant, generally involve a separate and distinct duty imposed by law for the benefit of the plaintiff that provides a right to maintain an action without regard to whether there was a contractual relationship .... In <em>Clark </em>[379 Mich at 261-262], the duty \u201cimposed by law\u201d was \u201c[t]he general duty of a contractor to act so as not to unreasonably endanger the well-being of employees of either subcontractors or inspectors, or anyone else lawfully on the site of the project....\u201d <em>[Ferrett, </em>438 Mich at 245-246 (second alteration in <em>Ferrett).]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Stated another way, under the \u201cseparate and distinct mode of analysis,\u201d \u201c \u2018[e]ntering into a contract with another pursuant to which one party promises to do something does not alter the fact that there [exists] a preexisting obligation or duty to avoid harm when one acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rinaldo\u2019s Constr, </em>454 Mich at 84, quoting Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 92, pp 656-657; see, also, <em>Davis, </em>568 F3d at 575, 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Thus, under <em>Fultz, </em>while the mere existence of a contractual promise does not ordinarily provide a basis for a duty of care to a third party in tort, \u201cthe existence of a contract [also] does not extinguish duties of care otherwise existing. . . .\u201d 1 Torts: Michigan Law and Practice, \u00a7 10.18, p 10-25; see, also, <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 468-469. <em>Fultz </em>did not extinguish the \u201csimple idea that is embedded deep within the American common law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>torts . . . : if one \u2018having assumed to act, does so negligently,\u2019 then liability exists as to a third party for \u2018failure of the defendant to exercise care and skill in the performance itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>568 F3d at 575, quoting <em>Hart, </em>347 Mich at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In summary, \u201c[w]hether a particular defendant owes <em>any duty at all </em>to a particular plaintiff [in tort],\u201d <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 467 (emphasis added), is generally determined without regard to the obligations contained within the contract, <em>Davis, </em>568 F3d at 577. See, also, <em>Churchill v Howe, </em>186 Mich 107, 114; 152 NW 989 (1915) (explaining that although a tort can grow out of a contract, in general, a tort is a \u201cwrong independent of a contract\u201d). Accordingly, with the aforementioned principles in mind, we clarify that when engaging in the \u201cseparate and distinct mode of analysis\u201d in <em>Fultz\u2019s </em>analytical framework, see 470 Mich at 469-470, courts should not permit the contents of the contract to obscure the threshold question of whether any independent legal duty to the noncontracting third party exists, the breach of which could result in tort liability. Instead, in determining whether the action arises in tort, and thus whether a separate and distinct duty independent of the contract exists, the operative question under <em>Fultz </em>is whether the defendant owed the plaintiff any legal duty that would support a cause of action in tort, including those duties that are imposed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">C. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Unlike the plaintiffs cause of action in <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 468-469, plaintiffs cause of action in this case was not brought solely on the basis of defendant\u2019s failure to perform its contractual obligations to the general contractor. Instead, plaintiff claims that defendant breached the common-law duty to exercise reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>able care and avoid harm when one acts. <em>Clark, </em>379 Mich at 261; <em>Rinaldo\u2019s Constr, </em>454 Mich at 84. Defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, however, was raised and decided on the basis of a misinterpretation of <em>Fultz. </em>Specifically, defendant\u2019s motion was brought exclusively under the erroneous belief that defendant owed no duty to plaintiff because defendant\u2019s performance and the hazards associated with that performance were the subject of defendant\u2019s contract with the general contractor. Because defendant\u2019s motion was brought solely under the mistaken belief that <em>Fultz </em>extinguished preexisting common-law duties, we need not and do not preemptively decide whether <em>this particular plaintiff </em>was owed a duty of care under the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Under <em>Fultz, </em>a contracting party\u2019s assumption of contractual obligations does not extinguish or limit separate, preexisting common-law or statutory tort duties owed to noncontracting third parties in the performance of a contract. Accordingly, we clarify that when engaging in Fultz\u2019s \u201cseparate and distinct mode of analysis,\u201d courts should not permit the contents of the contract to obscure the proper initial inquiry: whether, aside from the contract, the defendant owed any independent legal duty to the plaintiff. In this case, defendant \u2014 by performing an act under the contract\u2014 was not relieved of its preexisting common-law duty to use ordinary care in order to avoid physical harm to foreseeable persons and property in the execution of its undertakings. That duty, which is imposed by law, is separate and distinct from defendant\u2019s contractual obligations with the general contractor. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings that are consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-4\">Young, C.J., and Marilyn Kelly, Markman, and Mary Beth Kelly, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b389-5\">Hathaway, J. I concur in the result only.</judges>\n<author id=\"b389-6\">Zahra, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFYE\">did not participate because he was on the Court of Appeals panel in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-6\"> Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has subsequently opined that Michigan courts would have decided <em>Davis </em>differently, see <em>Bennett v MIS Corp, 607 </em>F3d 1076, 1096 (CA 6, 2010), the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Michigan law is not binding on this Court. <em>Rasheed v Chrysler </em>Corp, 445 Mich 109, 123 n 20; 517 NW2d 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>(1994). And, for the reasons stated later in this opinion, we reject Bennett\u2019s overly broad reading of <em>Fultz.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> Because plaintiff Sherri Loweke\u2019s claims are derivative of the injuries suffered by her husband Richard, we will refer to Richard Loweke as the singular \u201cplaintiff.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"> Although the two concurring justices in <em>Fultz </em>remain committed to their positions in that case, see 470 Mich at 470-476 (Marilyn Kelly, J., concurring), we recognize that the principles announced by the <em>Fultz </em>majority are the law in Michigan and will apply them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b380-5\"> See, also, 1 Torts: Michigan Law &amp; Practice (2d ed), \u00a7 10.18, p 10-23.

Instead, <em>Fultz </em>intended to provide a simplified test to disentangle the sometimes difficult distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance by directing courts to focus on the \u201c \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 definition of misfeasance,\u201d as previously recognized by this Court. <em>Fultz, </em>470 Mich at 467. Notably, the <em>Banaszak </em>and <em>Mierzejewski </em>orders only cited <em>Fultz </em>and did not claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>to extend it. Moreover, <em>Fultz </em>did not claim to overrule the common law, and, just as \u201clegislative amendment of the common law is not lightly presumed,\u201d <em>Dawe v Dr Reuven Bar-Levav &amp; Assoc, PC, </em>485 Mich 20, 28; 780 NW2d 272 (2010) (quotation marks and citation omitted), this Court does not heedlessly modify the common law. Accordingly, to the extent that <em>Banaszak </em>and <em>Mierzejewski </em>have been misconstrued to support an overly expansive reading of <em>Fultz, </em>we note that such an interpretation is incorrect and reject it as inconsistent with <em>Fultz.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
