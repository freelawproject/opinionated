First, whether a utility\u2019s right of first entitlement to provide electrical service to \u201cthe entire electric load on the premises\u201d of a \u201ccustomer\u201d ceases when the \u201ccustomer\u201d on the property changes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, whether the Public Service Commission (PSC) is required to impose interest on a refund it awards when it determines that a utility has overcharged a consumer. Third, whether the PSC is required to impose a fine whenever a utility \u201cneglects\u201d to comply with one of its orders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">We conclude that a utility\u2019s right of first entitlement set forth in Rule 460.3411 (Rule 411) of the Michigan Administrative Code extends to the entire premises initially served. And the right is not extinguished when a customer is no longer present on the premises. We also conclude that the PSC is not required to impose interest on a refund it awards to an overcharged utility consumer. Finally, we hold that the PSC is required to impose a fine pursuant to MCL 460.558 only when a utility \u201cwilfully or knowingly\u201d neglects to comply with a PSC order. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the PSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Plaintiff, Great Wolf Lodge of Traverse City, LLC, owns a water-park resort on 48 acres near Traverse City. The resort sits on part of a 120-acre parcel once farmed by the Oleson family. On July 14, 2000, plaintiff entered into an option agreement to buy a portion of the property from GDO Investments (GDO), which acquired it after Mr. Oleson\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Defendant Cherryland Electric Cooperative claims that it provided electricity to the Oleson property beginning in the 1940s. Cherryland ran an electric line, known as a \u201cservice drop,\u201d to the property. At one time or another over the years, Cherryland, Consumers Energy Company, and Traverse City Light &amp; Power (TCLP) serviced farm buildings on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">After the last farming tenant vacated the premises in September 2001, the electricity was turned off. However, according to a GDO employee, GDO continued to pay a minimum monthly bill from Cherryland so that it had the option to have the electricity turned back on.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Later, when plaintiff was planning new construction on the property, it solicited bids for electric service from Cherryland, Consumers Energy, and TCLP At that time, Cherryland did not claim that it had the sole right to provide electric service to the property. TCLP was the winning bidder, and in December 2001, plaintiff contracted with TCLP to provide electricity to its planned resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">By January 2002, the farm buildings were scheduled to be demolished. GDO asked Cherryland to remove its service line so that the building it was attached to could be taken down. But Cherryland made it a condition for removing the service drop that it would be the electricity provider. Plaintiff claims that it agreed in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>keep the project on schedule. Thus, plaintiff asserts, Cherryland coerced it to rescind its contract with TCLP and contract with Cherryland to avoid construction delays, loss of revenue, or litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In May 2002, plaintiff entered into a three-year contract for electrical service with Cherryland. Under the contract\u2019s terms, Cherryland charged plaintiff $0.0496 a kilowatt-hour. This was the large resort service (LRS) rate set by the PSC. In February 2003, Cherryland applied to the PSC for formal approval to charge plaintiff the LRS rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">This rate is available to consumers with a load factor greater than 50 percent and at least a 1500-kilowatt load. The application Cherryland signed recited these conditions. It also stated that, if plaintiff did not meet them, a different rate would apply. Shortly thereafter, in March 2003, plaintiff and Cherryland replaced their May 2002 contract with another that expressly provided for service at the LRS rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In July 2004, the PSC rejected Cherryland\u2019s application. It expressed concern that plaintiff was the only customer that Cherryland charged the LRS rate and questioned whether plaintiffs electrical needs were typical for a large resort. The PSC directed Cherryland to apply instead for a \u201cspecial contract\u201d to serve plaintiff. It also concluded that Cherryland had violated MCL 460.552 by implementing the LRS rate without PSC approval and fined Cherryland $10,000 pursuant to MCL 460.558. However, the PSC approved the LRS rate \u201cfor up to one year or until a special contract is approved.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Plaintiff and Cherryland attempted to negotiate a special contract but were unable to reach an agreement. In August 2004, Cherryland filed an application with the PSC for approval of a special contract with plaintiff. The contract had not yet been agreed to, but Cherry-land indicated that plaintiff was reviewing it. However, plaintiff intervened before the PSC and expressed concerns about the proposed special contract. According to plaintiff, it imposed unconscionable late charges and required plaintiff to forever bind itself to Cherryland. The PSC dismissed Cherryland\u2019s application in October 2004, indicating that it could be refiled once the parties reached an agreement. It also indicated that the parties could petition the PSC to resolve any disputes to the extent that the PSC had jurisdiction to hear those disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In November 2004, Cherryland began unilaterally charging plaintiff for electricity at the large commercial and industrial (LCI) rate. Cherryland claimed that it made the change because plaintiff almost never used enough electricity to satisfy the minimum requirements of the LRS rate. Therefore, Cherryland feared that the PSC would again fine it for charging an improper rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In July 2005, plaintiff filed a two-count complaint against Cherryland in the PSC. Count I alleged that Cherryland had violated MCL 460.552 and the PSC\u2019s 2004 order by charging plaintiff the LCI rate rather than the LRS rate. Plaintiff sought a refund of the amounts that it had paid in excess of the LRS rate. Finally, plaintiff asked that the PSC fine Cherryland for violating its order and require Cherryland to stop charging plaintiff the LCI rate and return to the LRS rate. In count II, plaintiff asked the PSC to declare that plaintiff could receive all components of its electrical service from any provider of its choosing. Plaintiff also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>asked the PSC to order Cherryland to transfer its distribution facilities to any new provider chosen by plaintiff and to remove any unnecessary facilities on its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Cherryland moved for summary disposition. A hearing referee ruled for plaintiff on count I and for Cherryland on count II. The referee concluded that Cherry-land\u2019s conduct was a \u201cpurposeful and flagrant violation\u201d of the PSC\u2019s 2004 order. He determined that plaintiff was entitled to a refund of $72,550.16 plus interest and recommended that Cherryland be fined $44,250. Regarding count II, he agreed that plaintiff could choose its electric supplier, but added that no authority permitted plaintiff a full choice of providers for all components of its electric service.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The PSC agreed that plaintiff was entitled to summary disposition on count I and with the amount of the refund to which it was entitled. However, the PSC declined to impose a fine or interest on Cherryland. Although the PSC concluded that Cherryland \u201cshould have sought clarification\u201d of its 2004 order, it stated that \u201cCherryland\u2019s interpretation of the July 22 order was not so clearly unreasonable as to justify the imposition of a fine or interest on the refund to [plaintiff].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the PSC agreed with the hearing referee that count II should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The circuit court affirmed the PSC\u2019s order in large part. It concluded that plaintiff was an existing customer of Cherryland under Rule 411 because the property (the Oleson farm) was the customer, not the entity that owned the property. Therefore, Cherryland had the right to continue providing electric service to the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>erty. However, the circuit court reversed the decision not to impose a fine and interest on Cherryland. It ruled that the language of the PSC\u2019s 2004 order was clear and unambiguous and concluded, contrary to the PSC, that Cherryland\u2019s misinterpretation of the order was clearly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Plaintiff and the PSC both appealed. The Court of Appeals consolidated the appeals and, in a published opinion, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the PSC for further proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the PSC was required to impose a fine and interest on Cherryland. However, the Court of Appeals concluded that plaintiff was free to choose its electric distributor if there was no customer governed by the restrictions of Rule 411. It held that the plain language of Rule 411(1)(a) defined \u201ccustomer\u201d as the \u201cbuildings and facilities served\u201d by an electricity provider. The panel reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">If the changes in buildings and facilities and interruption of service came about in reasonable proximity to and for the purpose of a change in ownership and plan for the site,... those changes and that interruption did not create a new customer. If, however, the previous owner held on to the site for a significant period after all land uses requiring electricity had been abandoned, requested that electric service be terminated, and demolished buildings or removed facilities, or at least allowed them to stand without electricity, for reasons other than anticipation of an immediate change of ownership or land use, then those actions should be deemed to have extinguished the previously existing customer or customers on the site, thus severing the utility-customer relationship.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The panel concluded that the record was insufficient to determine whether there was an existing customer and remanded the case to the PSC for further factual development, findings, and conclusions. It also directed the PSC to consider whether a \u201ccustomer!]\u201d was \u201calready receiving service\u201d pursuant to MCL 124.3 when plaintiff acquired the property. If so, MCL 124.3(2) would prohibit TCLR a municipal electricity provider not regulated by the PSC and not subject to Rule 411, from contracting with plaintiff to provide electric service.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Cherryland and the PSC appealed in this Court. We granted the parties\u2019 applications for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">A court reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute should give the agency\u2019s interpretation \u201crespectful consideration\u201d and, if it is persuasive, should not overrule it without \u201ccogent reasons.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have held that \u201c[i]n construing administrative rules, courts apply principles of statutory construction.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> All rates, fares, charges, classification and joint rates, regulations, practices, and services prescribed by the PSC are presumed, prima facie, to be lawful and reasona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ble.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A final order of the PSC must be authorized by law and, if a hearing is required, supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A party aggrieved by a PSC order must show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the PSC\u2019s order is unlawful or unreasonable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">CHERRYLAND\u2019S RIGHT OF FIRST ENTITLEMENT UNDER RULE 411(11)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The PSC adopted Rule 411 in 1982 as part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme for electric utilities. At that time, it stated that the purpose of Rule 411 was \u201cto avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of facilities and to provide objective standards for extension of electric service . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The PSC argues that its decisions interpreting Rule 411 clearly establish that \u201conce a first utility entitlement is established, a subsequent change in ownership does not create a new prospective customer on the old premises.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In effect, the PSC\u2019s interpretation of Rule 411(11) gives the first-serving utility a right in perpetuity to serve the property on which a customer is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Rule 411(11) provides that \u201c[t]he first utility serving a customer pursuant to these rules is entitled to serve the entire electric load on the premises of that customer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>even if another utility is closer to a portion of the customer\u2019s load.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rule 411(l)(a) defines \u201ccustomer\u201d as \u201cthe buildings and facilities served rather than the individual, association, partnership, or corporation served.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rule 102(f) defines \u201cpremises\u201d as \u201can undivided piece of land which is not separated by public roads, streets, or alleys.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">When those definitions are incorporated into Rule 411(11), it reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">The first utility serving [buildings and facilities] pursuant to these rules is entitled to serve the entire electric load on the [undivided piece of land which is not separated by public roads, streets, or alleys] of [those buildings and facilities] even if another utility is closer to a portion of the [buildings and facilities\u2019] load.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Thus, Rule 411(11) grants the utility first serving buildings or facilities on an undivided piece of real property the right to serve the entire electric load on that property. The right attaches at the moment the first utility serves \u201ca customer\u201d and applies to the entire \u201cpremises\u201d on which those buildings and facilities sit. The later destruction of all buildings on the property or division of the property by a public road, street, or alley does not extinguish or otherwise limit the right. This conclusion is consistent with the rule\u2019s purpose of avoiding unnecessary duplication of electrical facilities.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Plaintiff argues that this right of first entitlement lasts only as long as an \u201cexisting customer\u201d is being served. We disagree. If Rule 411(11) were intended to be read as plaintiff argues, it could simply have stated that \u201c[t]he first utility serving a customer pursuant to these rules is entitled to serve the entire electric load of that customer.\u201d However, Rule 411(11) explicitly ties the right of entitlement to the premises, not to the customer. Notably, nothing in Rule 411 or elsewhere in the PSC rules indicates that this right of first entitlement terminates if the initial customer, the initial \u201cbuildings and facilities served,\u201d changes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">For this reason, contrary to the dissent\u2019s contention, our reading of the rule does not redefine \u201ccustomer\u201d as \u201cpremises.\u201d Both this opinion and the dissent give the same effect to the word \u201ccustomer\u201d in Rule 411(11). We agree that to trigger the right of first entitlement, there must first be a \u201ccustomer\u201d served by the utility. We further agree that the \u201cpremises of that customer\u201d dictate the scope of the utility\u2019s right.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Plaintiff argues that Rule 411(2) undercuts our interpretation because it refers to <em>\u201cexisting </em>customers.\u201d However, Rule 411(2) states simply that \u201c[existing customers shall not transfer from one utility to another.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Hence, it establishes nothing more than that existing \u201cbuildings and facilities\u201d cannot transfer from one utility to another. It does not advance plaintiffs argument that eliminating a customer cuts off the right in Rule 411(11) to serve the \u201centire electric load on the premises\u201d of the initial customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In this case, is it undisputed that Cherryland was the first utility to provide electric service to buildings and facilities on the Oleson farm. Once Cherryland did so, Rule 411(11) gave it the right to serve the entire electric load on the premises. That right was unaffected by subsequent changes in the \u201ccustomer,\u201d because the right extends to the \u201cpremises\u201d of the \u201cbuildings and facilities\u201d that existed at the time service was established. Later destruction of the buildings and facilities on the property did not extinguish that right.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Given that Cherryland is entitled to the benefit of the first entitlement in Rule 411(11), it is irrelevant that TCLP is a municipal corporation not subject to PSC regulation. Rule 411(11) both grants and limits rights. It grants a right of first entitlement to Cherryland while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>limiting the right of the owner of the premises to contract with another provider for electric service. Plaintiff put that limitation directly at issue by seeking a declaratory ruling that it is free to contract for electric service with any electricity provider. Assuming arguendo that MCL 124.3 does not restrict TCLP from contracting with plaintiff to provide electric service, Rule 411(11) restricts plaintiff from seeking that service from any entity other than Cherryland. Plaintiff may not circumvent the limitation of Rule 411(11) by attempting to receive service from a municipal corporation not subject to PSC regulation. Thus, MCL 124.3 has no application to the instant dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In sum, the PSC\u2019s determination that Cherryland had the right to serve the entire premises was authorized by law and supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the PSC\u2019s May 2006 order was unlawful or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">THE PSC IS NOT REQUIRED TO IMPOSE INTEREST ON A REFUND</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The PSC\u2019s authority to award interest in addition to a refund under these circumstances is not explicitly authorized by statute. Rather, it has its genesis in the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Detroit Edison Co v Pub Serv Comm.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, the Court of Appeals held that the PSC\u2019s authority to award interest derives from MCL 460.6(1). MCL 460.6(1) vests the PSC with the power and jurisdiction, among other things, to \u201cregulate all rates, fares, fees, charges, services, rules, conditions of service, and all other matters pertaining to the formation, operation, or direction of public utilities.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Because \u201c[t]he selected rate of interest has a direct impact on the fees and charges that a utility\u2019s customers ultimately pay for service,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals concluded that the PSC had authority to determine the amount of interest to award.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">However, plaintiff has cited no authority for the proposition that the PSC <em>must </em>award interest when it grants a refund in these circumstances.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Rather, <em>Detroit Edison </em>makes clear that the PSC has broad discretion when determining the amount of interest to award.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the PSC\u2019s decision not to impose interest on the refund in this case was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Nor has plaintiff demonstrated that the PSC\u2019s failure to award interest was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d We have defined \u201cunreasonable\u201d as \u201carbitrary, capricious or totally unsupported by admissible and admitted evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The PSC declined to impose interest on the refund to plaintiff because it concluded that Cherryland reasonably misconstrued its July 2004 order. This conclusion was not arbitrary or capricious because evidence on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>record supported the PSC\u2019s conclusion that Cherry-land\u2019s interpretation of the order was not clearly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Cherryland\u2019s application for approval of the LRS rate noted that the rate is available only to customers with a load factor greater than 50 percent and at least a 1500-kilowatt load. Plaintiff met these requirements only in August 2003 and July 2005. Moreover, the PSC had previously fined Cherryland for charging plaintiff an unapproved rate. Taken together, this evidence supported the PSC\u2019s determination. It was not clearly unreasonable for Cherryland to change the rate charged to plaintiff because plaintiff had not complied with the load requirements for the LRS rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">MCL 460.558 REQUIRES THAT A FINE BE IMPOSED WHEN A UTILITY FAILS OR NEGLECTS TO COMPLY \u201cWILFULLY OR KNOWINGLY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">MCL 460.558 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">Every corporation, its officers, agents and employes, and all persons and firms engaged in the business of furnishing electricity as aforesaid shall obey and comply with every lawful order made by the commission under the authority of this act so long as the same shall remain in force. <em>Any corporation or person engaged in such business or any officer, agent, or employe thereof, who wilfully or knowingly fails or neglects to obey or comply with such order or any provision of this act shall forfeit to the state of Michigan not to exceed the sum of 300 dollars for each offense. </em>Every distinct violation of any such order or of this act, shall be a separate offense, and in case of a continued violation, each day shall be deemed a separate offense. An action to recover such forfeiture may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state in the name of the people of the state of Michigan, and all moneys recovered in any such action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>together with the costs thereof, shall be paid into the state treasury to the credit of the general fund.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The Court of Appeals reasoned that MCL 460.558 does not apply solely in cases of \u201cwilful or knowing failure to comply with a lawful PSC order; it also applies in the event of negligent noncompliance.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We disagree. Under the Court of Appeals\u2019 construction, MCL 460.558 would require that a fine be imposed any time a utility or its agent fails to comply with a PSC order. If that construction were what the Legislature intended in enacting MCL 460.558, there would have been no need to include the modifiers \u201cwilfully or knowingly.\u201d Rather, the Legislature could simply have mandated a fine in cases in which a party \u201cfails or neglects\u201d to obey a PSC order.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u201cWilfully\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d are adverbs, which generally modify verbs. The most natural reading of MCL 460.558 is that these terms are intended to modify both verbs immediately following them and separated by the disjunctive \u201cor.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The record here indicates that the PSC determined that Cherryland made a mistake by unilaterally imposing the LCI rate. The PSC concluded that Cherryland should instead have sought clarification of its July 2004 order. It was not unlawful or unreasonable to conclude that Cherryland did not 'willfully or knowingly fail or willfully or knowingly neglect to obey or comply with the PSC\u2019s July 2004 order. Hence, MCL 460.558 did not require the PSC to impose a fine on Cherryland.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We hold that a utility\u2019s right of first entitlement under Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(11) entails the right to serve the entire premises. That right is not extinguished when there is a new customer, i.e., new \u201cbuildings and facilities served,\u201d on the premises. We also hold that, absent a statutory mandate to do so, the PSC need not impose interest when it awards a refund to a party. Finally, we hold that the PSC is required to impose a fine pursuant to MCL 460.558 only when a utility willfully or knowingly neglects to comply with its order.

ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Aps\">A. RIGHT TO SERVE</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Rule 411(2) states that \u201c[ejxisting customers shall not transfer from one utility to another.\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(2). Rule 411(11) provides that the \u201cfirst utility serving a customer pursuant to these rules is entitled to serve the entire electric load on the premises of that customer even if another utility is closer to a portion of the customer\u2019s load.\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(11). Rule 411(1)(a) defines \u201ccustomer\u201d as \u201cthe buildings and facilities served rather than the individual, association, partnership, or corporation served.\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(1)(a). And Mich Admin Code, R 460.3102(j) defines \u201cpremises\u201d as \u201can undivided piece of land that is not separated by public roads, streets, or alleys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">In <em>In re Complaint of Consumers Energy Co, </em>255 Mich App 496; 660 NW2d 785 (2003), the subject property was purchased by Meijer, Inc., in August 1999. Consumers Energy Company provided electric service to the property from the 1940s until November 1999, when all the buildings on the property were demolished so that Meijer could build a store and gas station. After Great Lakes Energy Cooperative began providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Meijer with electric service, Consumers filed a formal complaint against Great Lakes, alleging that the latter had violated Rule 411. Consumers argued that because it had continuously served the property and had never relinquished or abandoned its entitlement to do so, it was the \u201cfirst utility\u201d with respect to the property and, thus, was entitled to serve the entire electric load on the premises. The PSC rejected this argument and held that Meijer was not an \u201cexisting customer\u201d of Consumers and, thus, was not obligated to receive its electric service from Consumers. However, the Court of Appeals reversed the PSC and held that Meijer was, in fact, an \u201cexisting customer\u201d and, thus, that \u201cConsumers [was] entitled to serve the entire electric load on Meijer\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The Court of Appeals reached this conclusion by focusing on the fact that \u201ca mere change in ownership does not allow the customer to transfer to another utility,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 503, because the \u201ccustomer\u201d is not \u201cthe individual, association, partnership, or corporation taking service,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 502, citing Rule 411(1)(a). The problem with the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Consumers Energy, </em>however, is that, although it correctly recognized that the \u201ccustomer\u201d is not \u201cthe individual, association, partnership, or corporation served,\u201d it failed to recognize that the \u201ccustomer\u201d is also not the property being served. Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(1)(a). Instead, the \u201ccustomer\u201d consists of the \u201cbuildings and facilities served.\u201d Id. Therefore, when all the buildings on a piece of property have been demolished, the utility no longer has an \u201cexisting customer\u201d on the property to serve. That is, although a change in ownership does not by itself enable the new owner to transfer to another utility, the destruction of all the buildings on a piece of property does enable the new owner to do so, because that destruction is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>equivalent of the destruction of all the \u201cexisting customers.\u201d And there are no rules or statutes that require a new \u201ccustomer\u201d to use the same electrical provider as the former \u201ccustomer\u201d; instead, the regulatory scheme provides merely that the <em>same </em>\u201ccustomer,\u201d as defined by the \u201cbuildings and facilities served,\u201d must use the same electrical provider. Therefore, I believe the PSC correctly ruled in <em>Consumers Energy </em>that Consumers was not entitled to serve Meijer\u2019s new store and gas station, and that the Court of Appeals erred by reversing that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The Court of Appeals in the instant case, being bound by <em>Consumers Energy </em>but apparently unconvinced by its analysis, sought to distinguish the two cases. It did this by focusing on language in <em>Consumers </em>Energy, 255 Mich App at 503, that emphasized that \u201cthe discontinuation of service was directly related to the change in ownership . ...\u201d It interpreted this language as \u201cleav[ing] open the possibility that a discontinuation of service, and demolition of buildings coming about for reasons other than direct furtherance of a plan to change ownership or land uses, can indeed extinguish an existing customer.\u201d <em>Great Wolf Lodge of Traverse City, LLC v Pub Serv Comm, </em>285 Mich App 26, 38; 775 NW2d 597 (2009). That is, it interpreted <em>Consumers Energy</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">as indicating that where service to buildings or facilities is interrupted, or buildings are demolished or facilities are removed, in direct connection with a change of ownership or land use, neither the service interruption nor the replacement of old buildings and facilities with new ones creates a new customer. To avoid interpreting that case, or the definition of \u201cexisting customer,\u201d as locking an incumbent utility into that status for a given parcel in perpetuity if it so chooses, with no regard for periods of interruption in service or elimination of buildings and facilities, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>necessary to recognize that some such interruption or elimination would indeed work an end to the utility-customer relationship. <em>[Id. </em>at 39-40.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Accordingly, it held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">[i]f the changes in buildings and facilities and interruption of service came about in reasonable proximity to and for the purpose of a change in ownership and plan for the site, then under <em>[Consumers </em>Energy], those changes and that interruption did not create a new customer. If, however, the previous owner held on to the site for a significant period after all land uses requiring electricity had been abandoned, requested that electric service be terminated, and demolished buildings or removed facilities, or at least allowed them to stand without electricity, for reasons other than anticipation of an immediate change of ownership or land use, then those actions should be deemed to have extinguished the previously existing customer or customers on the site, thus severing the utility-customer relationship. <em>[Id. </em>at 40.][<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The problem, of course, is that this distinction is nowhere to be found or implied in Rule 411. In my judgment, the Court of Appeals here was attempting to effect a compromise between the actual language of Rule 411 and <em>Consumers Energy. </em>The Court of Appeals apparently recognized that Rule 411 defines \u201ccus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>tomer\u201d as \u201cthe buildings and facilities served,\u201d rather than the parcel of land served. As it explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">If Rule 411(1)(a) calls for carefully distinguishing between individuals, associations, partnerships, or corporations taking service from the buildings and facilities served, with only the latter two constituting a \u201ccustomer,\u201d it also demands distinguishing buildings and facilities served from the parcels served. The rule providing the definition could easily have stated that the customer was the parcel, but instead specified buildings and facilities. It follows, then, that where there are no buildings or facilities being served, there is no customer. <em>[Great Wolf Lodge, </em>285 Mich App at 39.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">However, the Court of Appeals was nevertheless bound to follow <em>Consumers Energy, </em>which held that \u201cfor purposes of Rule 411, a change of ownership and demolition of all buildings served did not create a new customer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38. As a result, the Court of Appeals attempted to reconcile Rule 411 and <em>Consumers Energy </em>by holding that sometimes, as in <em>Consumers Energy, </em>a change of ownership and demolition of all buildings served <em>does not </em>create a new \u201ccustomer,\u201d while sometimes, as perhaps in the instant case, a change of ownership and demolition of all buildings served <em>does </em>create a new \u201ccustomer.\u201d Because this Court is not bound to follow <em>Consumers Energy, </em>I would hold that <em>Consumers Energy </em>was wrongly decided because it is inconsistent with Rule 411, which defines \u201ccustomer\u201d as \u201cthe buildings and facilities served\u201d rather than the parcel of land served.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">I agree with the Court of Appeals that the \u201ccustomer\u201d consists of \u201cthe buildings and facilities served\u201d; the \u201ccustomer\u201d for purposes of the present dispute is neither the owner of the property nor the parcel of land. Therefore, \u201cwhere there are no buildings or facilities being served, there is no customer.\u201d <em>Great Wolf Lodge, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>285 Mich App at 39. However, I do not believe that it matters whether the \u201cchanges in buildings and facilities and interruption of service came about in reasonable proximity to and for the purpose of a change in ownership . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. Instead, I believe that if there are no buildings or facilities being served, there is no \u201ccustomer,\u201d regardless of why there are no buildings or facilities being served or when this came about. In <em>Consumers Energy, </em>once all the buildings on the property had been demolished, Consumers no longer had any \u201ccustomers\u201d on the property and therefore was no longer entitled, under Rule 411, to serve Meijer\u2019s newly constructed store and gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The same is true here. Once all the buildings on the property had been demolished, Cherryland no longer had any \u201ccustomers\u201d on the property and, therefore, was not entitled to serve Great Wolf Lodge\u2019s newly constructed water-park resort. Rule 411(2) provides, \u201cExisting customers shall not transfer from one utility to another.\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(2). Because Rule 411(l)(a) defines \u201ccustomer\u201d to mean \u201cthe buildings . . . served,\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(l)(a), it communicates by extrapolation that \u201c[e]xisting [buildings served] shall not transfer from one utility to another.\u201d In this case, once all the buildings had been demolished, Cherryland no longer had any \u201cexisting customer\u201d on the property that was prohibited from transferring from one utility to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In addition, Rule 411(11) provides, \u201cThe first utility serving a customer pursuant to these rules is entitled to serve the entire electric load on the premises of that customer . .. .\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(11). Because Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(1)(a) defines \u201ccustomer\u201d to mean \u201cthe buildings . . . served,\u201d and Mich Admin Code, R 460.3102(j) defines \u201cpremises\u201d to mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u201can undivided piece of land that is not separated by public roads, streets, or alleys,\u201d Rule 411(11) by extrapolation communicates, \u201cThe first utility serving a [building] pursuant to these rules is entitled to serve the entire electric load on the [undivided piece of land] of that [building] . In this case, once all the buildings on the property had been demolished, there was no \u201cutility serving a building,\u201d and, therefore, no utility, including Cherryland, was \u201centitled to serve the entire electric load on the undivided piece of land of that [nonexisting] building.\u201d And the new \u201ccustomer,\u201d i.e., Great Wolf Lodge\u2019s newly constructed water-park resort, was not obligated under any provision of law to obtain its electric service from the previous customer\u2019s electric service provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The majority holds that a utility\u2019s \u201cright to serve the entire electric load on the premises\u201d of a \u201ccustomer\u201d is \u201cunaffected by subsequent changes in the \u2018customer[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 41.1 do not necessarily disagree with this statement. For example, if Electric Company XYZ served a house on the subject property, Electric Company XYZ would be entitled to serve a subsequently built barn on the same property because, pursuant to Rule 411(11), a utility is \u201centitled to serve the entire electric load on the premises of that customer. . . .\u201d This right is not affected when the \u201ccustomer\u201d <em>changes </em>from being only the house to being both the house and the barn. However, what the majority fails to recognize is that because \u201ccustomer\u201d is defined as \u201cthe buildings .. . served,\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(l)(a), if there are no buildings on the property, there are no \u201ccustomers\u201d on the property.

However, in doing so, the majority loses sight of the fact that in order for there to be a right to serve the entire \u201cpremises,\u201d the utility has to first be serving some \u201ccustomer\u201d on the \u201cpremises.\u201d In this case, once all the buildings on the property had been demolished, Cherryland was no longer serving <em>any </em>\u201ccustomers\u201d on the property and, therefore, no longer possessed any right to serve the entire \u201cpremises.\u201d That is, it was no longer \u201centitled to serve the entire electric load on the premises of that [nonexisting] customer.\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(11). The fact that there is <em>now </em>a new \u201ccustomer,\u201d i.e., building, on the property does not change this result because there are no rules or statutes that require a new \u201ccustomer\u201d to be served by the same electric utility that served the previous \u201ccustomer\u201d on the same piece of property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The majority essentially relies on the use of the term \u201cpremises\u201d in Rule 411(11) to redefine \u201ccustomer\u201d to mean \u201cpremises.\u201d The majority holds that a utility has a right to serve the entire \u201cpremises\u201d of a \u201ccustomer,\u201d even after that \u201ccustomer\u201d ceases to exist. The only way to reach this conclusion is to redefine \u201ccustomer\u201d to mean \u201cpremises.\u201d However, Rule 411(1)(a) clearly defines \u201ccustomer\u201d to mean \u201cthe buildings . . . served[.]\u201d The majority suggests that it must read \u201cpremises\u201d in the way that it does in order to give the word some meaning. However, that is not the case because, although \u201cpremises\u201d may not have the meaning that the majority ascribes to it, it does have a meaning of alternative significance: it means that the first utility serving a \u201ccustomer\u201d on a piece of property is entitled to serve all the \u201ccustomers\u201d on that property. As the Court of Appeals explained, \u201cRule 411(11) concerns extensions of service on premises already being served, and guards against any single premises being served by multiple utilities.\u201d <em>Great Wolf Lodge, </em>285 Mich App at 36. Without the phrase \u201con the premises\u201d in Rule 411(11), this very considerable protection for utilities would not exist. Therefore, \u201cpremises\u201d need not be misconstrued in order to give it substantive meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Although an \u201cagency\u2019s interpretation is entitled to respectful consideration and, if persuasive, should not be overruled without cogent reasons,\u201d <em>Rovas Complaint, </em>482 Mich at 108, it must not be forgotten that in <em>Consumers Energy, </em>when all the buildings that Consumers Energy had served had been demolished by Meijer, the PSC concluded that Meijer did not consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tute an \u201cexisting customer\u201d of Consumers, and the Court of Appeals reversed. Therefore, the PSC\u2019s decision here that Great Wolf Lodge is an \u201cexisting customer\u201d of Cherryland may well have been a result of the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of Rule 411 in <em>Consumers Energy, </em>rather than the PSC\u2019s own interpretation of the rule. Furthermore, even assuming that the PSC\u2019s decision was based on its own interpretation of Rule 411, for the reasons discussed earlier, that interpretation is not persuasive and there are, in fact, \u201ccogent\u201d reasons to overrule it. Great Wolf Lodge, in my judgment, has fully met its burden of showing by clear and satisfactory evidence that the PSC\u2019s decision was inconsistent with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">However, there is no dispute that Cherryland is currently rendering electric service to Great Wolf Lodge. Great Wolf Lodge has consistently argued that this should not prevent it from transferring to another utility because the only reason Cherryland is serving Great Wolf Lodge is that Cherryland refused to remove its service drop so that the buildings could be demolished and the water-park resort could be built. Great Wolf Lodge raised this issue before the PSC, the trial court, the Court of Appeals, and this Court. The PSC summarized Great Wolf Lodge\u2019s argument as follows: Great Wolf Lodge \u201chad a choice of electric service providers in 2001\u201d and \u201cbecause that choice was thwarted by Cherryland\u2019s refusal to remove the service drop, the [PSC] should now declare that [Great Wolf Lodge] has full choice in transmission and distribution services.\u201d The PSC rejected this argument, stating that Great Wolf Lodge \u201chas not cited any legal authority as a basis for the [PSC] to grant the relief sought under the circumstances of this case.\u201d However, neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals addressed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>issue. Therefore, I would remand this case to the trial court for it to be addressed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">B. INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">I agree with the majority that the PSC was not required to award interest on the refund it ordered Cherryland to pay. Although <em>Detroit Edison Co v Pub Serv Comm, </em>155 Mich App 461, 469; 400 NW2d 644 (1986), held that the PSC possesses the <em>authority </em>to award interest on refunds, it did not <em>require </em>the PSC to award interest. Because no statute, rule, or caselaw requires the PSC to award interest on refunds, Great Wolf Lodge has not satisfied its burden of showing by clear and satisfactory evidence that the PSC\u2019s decision to not award interest was unlawful or unreasonable. See MCL 462.26(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">C. FINE</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">I also agree with the majority that the PSC was not required to impose a fine on Cherryland. MCL 460.558 provides that \u201c[a]ny corporation. . . [that] wilfully or knowingly fails or neglects to obey or comply with [a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>PSC] order or any provision of this act [1909 PA 106; MCL 460.551 <em>et </em>seq.] shall forfeit to the state of Michigan not to exceed the sum of 300 dollars for each offense.\u201d Contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion, this language does not encompass mere negligent noncompliance; otherwise, there would have been no need to include the language \u201cwilfully or knowingly\u201d within this statute. \u201cWilfully or knowingly\u201d modifies both \u201cfails\u201d and \u201cneglects,\u201d and, therefore, the PSC is required to impose a fine only where a utility \u201cwilfully or knowingly\u201d \u201cfails,\u201d or \u201cwilfully or knowingly\u201d \u201cneglects,\u201d to \u201cobey or comply with [a PSC] order.\u201d MCL 460.558.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In the instant case, the PSC determined that Cherryland\u2019s understanding of the PSC\u2019s July 22, 2004, order was not unreasonable, and, therefore, Cherryland did not \u201cwilfully or knowingly\u201d fail or neglect to obey or comply with this order. In its July 22, 2004, order, the PSC ordered Cherryland to charge Great Wolf Lodge the large resort service (LRS) rate. Four months later, Cherryland began to charge Great Wolf Lodge the higher large commercial and industrial (LCI) rate. According to Cherryland, it did this because Great Wolf Lodge was not satisfying the 1,500-kilowatt minimum monthly load requirement that must be met for the LRS rate to be charged. The PSC explained that when it ordered Cherryland to charge the LRS rate, it assumed that Great Wolf Lodge was in compliance, and would remain in compliance, with the terms and conditions of the LRS rate, and therefore it did not address what Cherryland should do if Great Wolf Lodge failed to comply with the load requirement for the LRS rate. The PSC concluded that, although \u201cCherryland should have sought clarification of the July 22 order,\u201d \u201cCherryland\u2019s interpretation of the July 22 order was not so clearly unreasonable as to justify the imposition of a fine . .. .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>In other words, because Cherryland reasonably believed that the PSC\u2019s July 22, 2004, order did not preclude it from charging Great Wolf Lodge the LCI rate if Great Wolf Lodge was not complying with the load requirement for the LRS rate, it did not \u201cwilfully or knowingly fail[] or neglect[] to obey or comply with such order.\u201d See MCL 460.558. Accordingly, Great Wolf Lodge has not satisfied its burden of showing by clear and satisfactory evidence that the PSC\u2019s decision to not impose a fine was unlawful or unreasonable. MCL 462.26(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Once all the buildings on the property had been demolished, Cherryland no longer had any \u201ccustomer\u201d on the property, and, therefore, its right to provide electric service to the property was extinguished. Because no rule, statute, or caselaw requires the PSC to impose interest on refunds, the PSC was not required to impose interest on the refund at issue. Finally, because Cherryland did not \u201cwillfully or knowingly fail[] or neglect[] to obey or comply with [the PSC\u2019s July 22, 2004] order,\u201d MCL 460.558, the PSC was not required to impose a fine on Cherryland. Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment regarding the imposition of interest and a fine, vacate the remainder of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, and remand to the trial court for it to address Great Wolf Lodge\u2019s argument that it should not now be considered a Cherryland \u201ccustomer,\u201d even though Cherryland is currently serving Great Wolf Lodge, because Cherryland had coerced Great Wolf Lodge into becoming its \u201ccustomer.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-7\">Hathaway and Zahra, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"> Because the Court of Appeals could not determine from the record whether the discontinuation of service was directly related to the change in ownership, it remanded this case to the PSC \u201cfor full factual development, findings, and conclusions in this regard.\u201d <em>Great Wolf Lodge, </em>285 Mich App at 41. It also</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">vaeate[d] the [PSC\u2019s] holding, and the circuit court\u2019s affirmance, that Cherryland is entitled to continue serving Great Wolf [Lodge]; clarified] that for purposes of Rule 411, \u201ccustomer\u201d means buildings and facilities, not the land on which they once stood; [and] declare[d] that a significant interruption of service to buildings or facilities can extinguish the existence of an existing customer in some situations^] [Id.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\"> The majority suggests that this interpretation is inconsistent with the rule\u2019s \u201cpurpose of avoiding unnecessary duplication of electrical facilities\u201d because when a piece of property is subdivided, new \u201ccustomers\u201d that would be free to contract with different utility companies would be created. <em>Ante </em>at 39-40 &amp; n 22. However, the majority fails to apprehend the significance of Rule 411(14). This rule provides, \u201cRegardless of other provisions of this rule,... a utility shall not extend service to a new customer in a manner that will duplicate the existing electric distribution facilities of another utility, except where both utilities are within 300 feet of the prospective customer.\u201d Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(4). Therefore, the majority\u2019s concerns about the duplication of electrical facilities when property is subdivided need not influence its interpretation of Rule 411(11). Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, Rule 411(14) is not an \u201cirrelevant distraction.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 40 n 20. Indeed, given that the majority believes that it is important enough to point out that its interpretation of Rule 411(11) is \u201cconsistent with the rule\u2019s purpose of avoiding unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>sary duplication of electrical facilities,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 39, I believe that it is equally relevant to point out that, regardless of Rule 411(11), Rule 411(14) clearly serves the same purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\"> To the extent that Great Wolf Lodge argues that it should be allowed to obtain service from Traverse City Light &amp; Power (TCLP), a municipal corporation not subject to PSC regulation, MCL 124.3(2) is applicable. MCL 124.3(2) provides, \u201cA municipal corporation shall not render electric delivery service for heat, power, or light to customers outside its corporate limits already receiving the service from another utility unless the serving utility consents in writing.\u201d MCL 460.10y(2), like Rule 411(1)(a), defines \u201ccustomer\u201d as \u201cthe building or facilities served . ...\u201d In this case, once all the buildings on the property had been demolished, there were no \u201ccustomers . . . already receiving [electric] service from another utility,\u201d and, thus, at that point, MCL 124.3(2) would not have prevented Great Wolf Lodge from obtaining service from TCLP However, whether the fact that the water-park resort is now receiving electric service from Cherry-land prevents the resort from obtaining service from TCLP instead is a question that the trial court should address on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
