We conclude that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\">We hold that, because they constitute final decisions that are quasi-judicial and affect private rights, STC property-classification decisions fall within the ambit of article 6, \u00a7 28 of the Michigan Constitution, which guarantees judicial review. The Legislature lacks the authority to abolish the right to judicial review by enacting a statute. As a consequence, we declare the final sentence of MCL 211.34c(6) unconstitutional because it denies appeal in the courts of STC classification decisions. And because the Legislature has not provided other means for judicial review of STC classification decisions, we hold that the circuit courts have jurisdiction over such appeals pursuant to MCL 600.631.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">This appeal involves nine consolidated cases. All the plaintiffs own property that is subject to property taxes in Michigan. They describe the property as machinery and equipment. For 2008, the tax year in question, the local assessors classified the property for tax-assessment purposes as industrial real property<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or commercial personal property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs timely petitioned the relevant boards of review to reclassify the property as industrial personal property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That reclas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>sification would permit them to take advantage of recently enacted tax exemptions or credits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In each instance, the board denied the request. Plaintiffs thereafter individually petitioned the STC to reclassify the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In each case, the STC denied the request to reclassify the property. Plaintiffs then individually sought and obtained relief in various circuit courts. Defendants appealed the judgments in the Court of Appeals, which granted leave to appeal and consolidated the individual cases. The Court reversed each of the circuit court judgments and remanded for the entry of orders granting summary disposition in defendants\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It held that MCL 211.34c(6) bars an appeal in the courts of an STC classification decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">MCL 211.34c(6) provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn appeal may not be taken from the decision of the state tax commission regarding classification complaint petitions and the state tax commission\u2019s determination is final and binding for the year of the petition.\u201d The Court of Appeals rejected plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the statute violates the constitutional guarantee of a direct appeal of administrative final decisions. The Court held that, although it prevents an appeal of classification decisions in the courts, the statute does not prevent other review, such as seeking a refund in the Michigan Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Plaintiffs sought leave to appeal in this Court and we granted it, limited to whether the circuit courts have subject matter jurisdiction over appeals of an STC decision regarding property classification.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW AND LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The issue of subject matter jurisdiction presented in these cases involves questions of constitutional and statutory interpretation, which are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The General Property Tax Act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> requires local tax assessors to classify \u201cevery item of assessable [real and personal] property\u201d in the local tax assessing unit according to categories established in MCL 211.34c.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It classifies real property into six broad categories: agricultural, commercial, developmental, industrial, residential, and timber-cutover.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Personal property is classified into five broad categories: agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential, and utility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">A property owner who disputes the local tax assessor\u2019s classification \u201cmust notify the assessor and may protest the assigned classification to the March board of review.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A property owner or the assessor may appeal a decision of the board by filing a petition with the STC not later than June 30 of that tax year.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The STC is required to \u201carbitrate the petition based on the written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>petition and written recommendations of the assessor and the state tax commission staff.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Under MCL 211.34c(6), a decision of the STC regarding property classification is final, and no appeal is permitted. However, MCL 211.34c(7) provides that the Department of Treasury may appeal a classification decision to \u201cthe residential and small claims division of the Michigan tax tribunal not later than December 31 in the tax year for which the classification is appealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In reviewing a constitutional challenge, we presume that statutes are constitutional as written.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We exercise the power to declare a law unconstitutional \u201cwith extreme caution.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim that MCL 211.34c(6) violates article 6, \u00a7 28 of the Michigan Constitution, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">All final decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer or agency existing under the constitution or by law, which are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect private rights or licenses, shall be subject to direct review by the courts as provided by law. This review shall include, as a minimum, the determination whether such final decisions, findings, rulings and orders are authorized by law... .[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Article 6, \u00a7 28 is not an absolute guarantee of judicial review of every administrative decision. In order for it to apply, (1) the administrative decision must be a \u201cfinal decision\u201d of an administrative agency, (2) the agency must have acted in a \u201cjudicial or quasi-judicial\u201d capacity, and (3) the decision must affect private rights or licenses. Therefore, we must determine whether STC classification decisions are final decisions of a judicial or quasi-judicial nature that affect private rights or licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">First, it is uncontested that the challenged STC decisions are final decisions of an administrative agency. In each of these cases, the STC sent a letter to the plaintiff advising it that the STC\u2019s decision was final because MCL 211.34c(6) provides for no appeal of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Second, in order for article 6, \u00a7 28 to apply, the STC must have acted in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity in rendering its classification decisions. Decisions of the STC are not judicial decisions. The dispositive question is whether they are quasi-judicial in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">This Court has employed the term \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d broadly: \u201cWhen the power is conferred by statute upon a commission such as the public utilities, or a board such as the department of labor and industry, to ascertain facts and make orders founded thereon, they are at times referred to as quasi-judicial bodies . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals has referred to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary to define \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201cA term applied to the action, discretion, etc., of public administrative officers, who are required to investigate facts, or ascertain the existence of facts, and draw conelu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>sions from them, as a basis for their official action, and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature. \u201d[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">An STC classification decision is not a general rule-making or advisory decision. The STC resolves disputed factual claims on a case-by-case basis. This entails an evaluation of evidence and dispute resolution, which are quasi-judicial functions. Furthermore, MCL 211.34c(6) styles the STC\u2019s actions as arbitrations in which the STC considers written petitions and \u201carbitrates\u201d matters.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, in rendering property classification decisions, the STC acts as an arbitrator adjudicating disputed claims. It is well settled that an arbitrator\u2019s function is quasi-judicial in nature.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Third, in order for article 6, \u00a7 28 to apply to STC classification decisions, they must \u201caffect private rights or licenses.\u201d This case does not involve a license. Therefore, we must determine whether STC classification decisions affect private rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Taxpayers do not have \u201ca vested right in a tax statute or in the continuance of any tax law.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We defined a vested right as \u201can interest that the government is compelled to recognize and protect of which the holder could not be deprived without injustice.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In contrast, article 6, \u00a7 28 of the constitution recognizes and protects administrative decisions that \u201caffect private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>rights.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a \u201cprivate right\u201d as \u201ca personal right, as opposed to a right of the public or the state.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Black\u2019s defines \u201cright\u201d as \u201c[t]he interest, claim, or ownership that one has in tangible or intangible property.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">We conclude that taxpayers have a private right to ensure that their property is taxed the same as similarly situated property.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As applied to this case, the classification of plaintiffs\u2019 property will determine whether plaintiffs are entitled to the same tax treatment received by owners of similarly classified property. Plaintiffs have an interest in the proper interpretation of the statutory definitions of \u201cindustrial personal property,\u201d \u201ccommercial personal property,\u201d and \u201cindustrial real property.\u201d An erroneous interpretation of the statutory definitions could impermissibly increase their tax burden and thus affect their private right. Hence, the STC classification decisions in question affect private rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Aside from requiring a final quasi-judicial decision that affects private rights, article 6, \u00a7 28 provides that such decisions \u201cshall be subject to direct review by the courts <em>as provided by law.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Defendants argued that \u201cas provided by law\u201d means that the Legislature has the authority to limit the jurisdiction of the circuit courts. The Court of Appeals agreed and, in reliance on that language, held that MCL 211.34c(6) prevents an STC classification decision from being appealed in a court. It relied solely on this Court\u2019s 1977 decision in <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>McAvoy </em>held that the Legislature may \u201cexert substantial control over the mechanics of how administrative decisions are to be appealed.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It does not stand for the proposition that the Legislature can limit the jurisdiction of the circuit courts. Rather, <em>McAvoy </em>held that \u201cas provided by law\u201d contemplates that the Legislature will provide the manner in which judicial review shall occur. It recognized the Legislature\u2019s ability to dictate \u201chow,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d type of appeal of an agency decision is permitted. Acknowledging that the Michigan Constitution mandates review, <em>McAvoy </em>opined that \u201cas provided by law\u201d permits the Legislature only to prescribe the details of that review.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> For example, the Legislature can prescribe time frames for filing an appeal, dictate whether a party may obtain a stay pending appeal, and set forth the controlling standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">MCL 211.34c(6) is not an exercise of control over the \u201cmechanics\u201d of an appeal to the courts of an STC classification decision. Rather, it is a complete prohibition of court review of STC classification decisions. There is a significant difference between dictating the mechanics of an appeal and preventing an appeal altogether. Thus, the Court of Appeals erred by concluding that MCL 211.34c(6) is concerned merely with mechanics.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The Legislature may not eradicate a constitutional guarantee in reliance on the language \u201cas provided by law.\u201d Because MCL 211.34c(6) eliminates any appeal of a final administrative decision that is quasi-judicial in nature and affects private rights, it runs afoul of the guarantee in article 6, \u00a7 28. This conclusion assumes that there is no other mechanism for direct review by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The Court of Appeals and defendants have failed to make a persuasive case that an alternative mechanism exists with which to appeal an STC classification decision. The Court suggested that a plaintiff could pay the tax and then seek a refund in the Michigan Tax Tribunal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However, nothing in the Tax Tribunal Act grants the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction over STC classification decisions. Indeed, in 2010, the Tax Tribunal ruled that it lacks jurisdiction over STC classification decisions.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Hence, as a result of that decision and the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion, plaintiffs are left with no forum in which to challenge STC classification decisions, notwithstanding their constitutional right to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Therefore, we hold that the phrase \u201cas provided by law\u201d in article 6, \u00a7 28 does not grant the Legislature the authority to circumvent the protections that the section guarantees. If it did, those protections would lose their strength because the Legislature could render the entire provision mere surplusage. And given that no other mechanism for review of STC classification decisions exists, the last sentence of MCL 211.34c(6) violates article 6, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">To cure this defect, we must determine whether the entire statute is unconstitutional or whether its last sentence is severable. MCL 8.5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">If any portion of an act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be found to be invalid by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>court, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions or applications of the act which can he given effect without the invalid portion or application, provided such portions are not determined by the court to be inoperable, and to this end acts are declared to be severable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">To determine whether severance is appropriate, we must consider whether the portion of MCL 211.34c(6) remaining after its last sentence has been severed is capable of functioning alone.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The subsection consists of four sentences. The first three dictate the process by which a property owner may protest an adverse property classification.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The initial review is made by the March board of review. The next level of review is by the STC. The fourth and final sentence of MCL 211.34c(6) restricts judicial review of STC classification decisions. This final sentence has no effect on the remainder of the subsection. In its absence, the subsection provides for an internal appellate process within the administrative agency. The internal process is separate and distinct from any judicial review. Thus, MCL 211.34c(6) is capable of functioning without its final sentence. Accordingly, the final sentence of MCL 211.34c(6), which shields STC classification decisions from judicial review, is severed and declared unconstitutional.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The remainder of MCL 211.34c(6) remains in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Without the final sentence of MCL 211.34c(6), the General Property Tax Act is silent as to plaintiffs\u2019 right to appeal an adverse STC classification decision. As we have held, however, article 6, \u00a7 28 of the Michigan Constitution mandates that plaintiffs be afforded this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>right. Thus, we must consider what remedy is available to plaintiffs absent a specific legislative directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">The Revised Judicature Act specifically allows appeals of decisions by state agencies when judicial review \u201chas not otherwise been provided for by law.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Because MCL 211.34c(6) precluded judicial review in violation of article 6, \u00a7 28, judicial review \u201chas not otherwise been provided for by law,\u201d and MCL 600.631 applies. Therefore, the circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction over appeals of a decision of the STC regarding property classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">STC property-classification decisions are final decisions of an administrative agency that are quasi-judicial in nature and affect private rights. Consequently, article 6, \u00a7 28 of the Michigan Constitution guarantees judicial review of them, and this guarantee may not be jettisoned by statute. Accordingly, because the final sentence of MCL 211.34c(6) precludes judicial review of STC classification decisions, it violates article 6, \u00a7 28 of the Michigan Constitution. We declare that sentence unconstitutional and sever it, leaving the remainder of MCL 211.34c(6) in fall force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The circuit courts have subject matter jurisdiction over appeals of a decision of the STC regarding property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>classifications.
