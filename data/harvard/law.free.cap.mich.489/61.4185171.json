The Attorney General claims that defendant is not entitled to hold office beyond January 1, 2011, and brought this quo warranto action to oust defendant. See MCL 600.4505(1); MCL 600.4515. Having assumed jurisdiction over this action and having heard oral argument, we hereby dismiss plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">In November 2004, Judge Amy RONAYNE KRAUSE of the 54-A District Court was elected to a six-year term of office beginning on January 1, 2005. In November 2010, Judge RONAYNE KRAUSE was reelected to another six-year term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>that was to begin on January 1, 2011. However, on November 23, 2010, Governor Granholm appointed Judge RONAYNE KRAUSE to fill a vacancy on the Court of Appeals. Judge RONAYNE KRAUSE resigned from the 54-A District Court effective December 13, 2010, and Governor Granholm appointed defendant to the position on December 20, 2010, effective December 22, 2010. Governor Granholm\u2019s term of office as governor ended on January 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The Attorney General brought a quo warranto action in the Court of Appeals, claiming that defendant is not entitled to remain in office beyond the term of office to which he was appointed \u2014 that is, beyond January 1, 2011 \u2014 and that the Governor is not entitled to fill a judicial vacancy for a term that does not begin until after the Governor leaves office. We granted defendant\u2019s application to bypass consideration of the matter by the Court of Appeals and assumed jurisdiction over the action. 488 Mich 1052 (2011); see MCR 7.302(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We conclude the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">(1) A judicial vacancy \u201cshall be filled by appointment by the governor.\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">(2) The resignation of Judge KRAUSE created a vacancy on the 54-A District Court. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cA vacancy shall occur ... in the district court by . . . resignation . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">(3) \u201cThe person appointed by the governor shall hold office until 12 noon of the first day of January next succeeding the first general election held after the vacancy occurs . ...\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">(4) Michigan law defines \u201cgeneral election\u201d as \u201cthe election held on the November regular election date in an even numbered year,\u201d MCL 168.2(h), and sets the November regular election date as \u201cthe first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Tuesday after the first Monday in November,\u201d MCL 168.641(1)(d). Accordingly, in this case, the \u201cfirst general election held after the vacancy occurs\u201d falls on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">(5) Therefore, defendant \u201cshall hold office until 12 noon\u201d on January 1, 2013. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">(6) The argument of plaintiff that an absurd result could conceivably arise under this Court\u2019s interpretation of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 23 in circumstances not presented in this case raises an abstract issue that is not properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">(7) Although we rule in favor of defendant, his argument that it is inconsistent with Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 4 for this Court to issue a writ of quo warranto to oust a judge from office does not represent the law of this state, see <em>In re Servaas, </em>484 Mich 634; 774 NW2d 46 (2009), and this argument confuses judicial removal for reasons of misconduct with a determination that a person is not lawfully entitled to hold judicial office.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The plain language of article 6, \u00a7 23 operates to allow an appointee to hold office for two separate terms when the second term begins before \u201c12 noon of the first day of January next succeeding the first general election held after the vacancy occurs.\u201d Thus, contrary to plaintiffs position and the conclusion of a plurality of justices in <em>Attorney General v Riley, </em>417 Mich 119; 332 NW2d 353 (1983), article 6, \u00a7 23 is a \u201choldover\u201d provision. While we understand why plaintiff relied on <em>Riley </em>in support of his position that Judge Clarke should be treated in the same manner as Justice RILEY and not be permitted to remain on the bench beyond the end of the term during which he was originally appointed, <em>Riley </em>does not control the outcome of today\u2019s case because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>is a plurality decision,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the several rationales articulated in support of the plurality result are inconsistent with article 6, \u00a7 23. Accordingly, we hereby repudiate the <em>Riley </em>plurality opinion on the ground that it is inconsistent with the constitution of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Because defendant is entitled under article 6, \u00a7 23 to hold the office of 54-A District Judge until January 1, 2013, we hereby dismiss plaintiffs action for quo warranto. Pursuant to MCR 7.317(C)(3), we direct the Clerk of the Court to issue the judgment order forthwith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-5\">Young, C.J., and Markman, Hathaway, Mary Beth Kelly, and Zahra, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> \u201c[D]ecisions in which no majority of the justices participating agree with regard to the reasoning are not an authoritative interpretation under the doctrine of stare decisis.\u201d <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197, 206 n 7; 731 NW2d 41 (2007), citing <em>Negri v Slotkin, </em>397 Mich 105, 109; 244 NW2d 98 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b281-6\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al7\">(concurring). I concur in the majority result dismissing the complaint for quo warranto, but only because I believe that there is no conflict between the statutes authorizing \u201choldovers\u201d for district court judges and the Michigan Constitution. Specifically, MCL 168.467m(1) provides that \u201c[i]f a vacancy occurs in the office of district judge, the governor shall appoint a successor to fill the vacancy\u201d who \u201cshall hold office until 12 noon of January 1 following the next general November election at which a successor is elected and qualified.\u201d Additionally, MCL 168.467i provides that the term of office for a district judge \u201cshall be 6 years\u201d and \u201cshall continue until a successor is elected and qualified.\u201d These statutes clearly authorize holdovers for district judges and do not conflict with Const 1963, art <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>6, \u00a7 23. Therefore, defendant is entitled to hold office until noon on January 1, 2013.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-6\">Marilyn Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
