OV 10 should have 15 points assessed when the defendant has engaged in \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d to \u201cexploit[] . . . a vulnerable victim.\u201d MCL 777.40(1)(a). Contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding, in order to assess 15 points for OV 10, the defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct only has to be directed at \u201ca victim,\u201d not any specific victim, and the victim does not have to be inherently vulnerable. Instead, a defendant\u2019s \u201cpredatory conduct,\u201d by that conduct alone <em>(eo ipso), </em>can create or enhance a victim\u2019s \u201cvulnerability.\u201d In this case, defendant engaged in \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d to \u201cexploit\u00fc ... a vulnerable victim\u201d because, before defendant and his cohort robbed the victim, they were lying in wait, armed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>two BB guns and a knife, and hidden from the victim, who was by herself at night in an otherwise empty parking lot. Because the trial court properly assessed 15 points for OV 10, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">I. HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">This case arises from events that occurred in February 2005 in the Orchards Mall parking lot in Benton Harbor. The victim, Jackie Flanagan, drove to the mall and parked her vehicle in front of the Sears store where she intended to shop. The victim chose a well-lit parking spot because it was dark outside. When she got out of her vehicle, she was approached by defendant and his cohort, who were 15 and 16 years old respectively. One of the boys pointed a BB gun at the victim\u2019s face and demanded her purse, wallet, and car keys, while the other boy put a BB gun to the back of the victim\u2019s head. The victim gave the boys her cell phone and car keys but had trouble getting her purse off her shoulder. Defendant\u2019s cohort pushed the victim to the ground and cut the purse from her shoulder with a utility knife. Both boys then fled the scene in the victim\u2019s vehicle. The next day, police recovered the victim\u2019s vehicle and found two BB guns inside it. Further investigation led police to defendant and his cohort.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Defendant was charged with armed robbery and carjacking. He entered a plea of guilty of armed robbery, MCL 750.529, pursuant to a plea bargain offered by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing, defendant challenged the scoring of OV 10, arguing that it was incorrectly scored at 15 points. OV 10 addresses \u201cexploitation of a vulner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>able victim\u201d and requires \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d for the assessment of 15 points. MCL 777.40(l)(a). Defendant argued that there was nothing \u201cpredatory\u201d about this robbery because it was a \u201crandom\u201d act. The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument and concluded that predatory conduct was established for purposes of scoring OV 10 at 15 points because defendant was lying in wait in the parking lot where he robbed the victim. Defendant\u2019s recommended minimum sentence range under the sentencing guidelines was calculated as 126 to 210 months. The trial court sentenced defendant to 180 months to 600 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">On appeal in the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant argued that the trial court had improperly scored OV 10 and that this error affected his sentencing guidelines range.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a published opinion per curiam, the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s judgment of sentence and remanded for resentencing, concluding that OV 10 should have been scored at zero points, not at 15 points. <em>People v Huston, </em>288 Mich App 387, 397-398; 794 NW2d 350 (2010). The Court of Appeals held that the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of a victim must be determined by characteristics personal to the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 395-397. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that at the time of the offense it was dark outside and the victim was alone, which may have made the robbery easier to carry out. <em>Id. </em>at 397. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals reasoned that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>facts failed to establish that the victim was personally or inherently vulnerable and, therefore, that the trial court erred by assessing 15 points for OV 10. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">This Court granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal in order to consider whether the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of a victim, for purposes of scoring OV 10, is limited to the victim\u2019s personal characteristics. <em>People v Huston, </em>488 Mich 876 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The interpretation and application of the legislative sentencing guidelines, MCL 777.1 <em>et seq., </em>involve legal questions that this Court reviews de novo. <em>People v Morson, </em>471 Mich 248, 255; 685 NW2d 203 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">MCL 777.40 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">(1) Offense variable 10 is <em>exploitation of a vulnerable victim. </em>Score offense variable 10 by determining which of the following apply and by assigning the number of points attributable to the one that has the highest number of points:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">(a) <em>Predatory conduct </em>was involved....................15 points</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">(b) The offender exploited a victim\u2019s physical disability, mental disability, youth or agedness, or a domestic relationship, or the offender abused his or her authority status .......................................................................................10 points</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">(c) The offender exploited a victim by his or her difference in size or strength, or both, or exploited a victim who was intoxicated, under the influence of drugs, asleep, or unconscious.............................................................5 points</p>\n<p id=\"b673-17\">(d) The offender did not exploit a victim\u2019s vulnerability .......................................................................0 points</p>\n<p id=\"b673-18\">(2) The mere existence of 1 or more factors described in subsection (1) does not automatically equate with victim vulnerabilily</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>(3) As used in this section:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">(a) <em>\u201cPredatory conduct\u201d means preoffense conduct directed at a victim for the primary purpose of victimization.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">(b) \u201cExploit\u201d means to manipulate a victim for selfish or unethical purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">(c) <em>\u201cVulnerability\u201d means the readily apparent susceptibility of a victim to injury, physical restraint, </em>persuasion, or temptation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">(d) \u201cAbuse of authority status\u201d means a victim was exploited out of fear or deference to an authority figure, including, but not limited to, a parent, physician, or teacher. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">A. \u201cPREDATORY CONDUCT\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 and the dissents\u2019 contentions, MCL 777.40(3)(a) does not define \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d to mean preoffense conduct directed at <em>the </em>victim; instead, MCL 777.40(3)(a) defines \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d to mean \u201cpreoffense conduct directed at <em>a </em>victim .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) As this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">\u201cTraditionally in our law, to say nothing of our classrooms, we have recognized the difference between \u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a.\u2019 \u2018The\u2019 is defined as \u2018definite article. 1. (used, esp. before a noun, with a specifying or particularizing effect, as opposed to the indefinite or generalizing force of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>indefinite article a or an)... <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary, </em>p 1382.\u201d <em>[Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 461; 613 NW2d 307 (2000) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Because the Legislature chose to use the words \u201ca victim\u201d in MCL 777.40(3)(a), we must construe MCL 777.40(3)(a) to mean <em>a </em>victim, rather than <em>the </em>victim. That is, we must take care not to construe MCL 777.40(3)(a) as requiring that the defendant\u2019s preoffense predatory conduct have been directed at one particular or specific victim, but instead as requiring only that the defendant\u2019s preoffense predatory conduct have been directed at <em>a </em>victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Furthermore, from a policy perspective, we are unsure why the Legislature would want a defendant who directed his preoffense conduct toward a specific victim, say, for example, at his ex-girlfriend, to be sentenced more severely than the defendant who directed his preoffense conduct at the community at large by lying in wait, armed, in a parking lot at night, waiting for the first random person to come along so that he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>could be criminally victimized. Who poses the greater threat to society \u2014 the defendant who seeks revenge on his ex-girlfriend, and thus who directs his preoffense conduct only toward a single person, or the defendant who seeks opportunistically to rob the first vulnerable person within the community at large who happens along? Certainly, the latter instills greater fear and apprehension in more people and has a greater impact on society. Indeed, this case illustrates how this fear is diffused throughout the community. The victim here felt vulnerable even <em>before </em>the attack and testified that she specifically \u201ccircled the parking lot\u201d to \u201cpark[] safely under a street lamppost. . . .\u201d Unfortunately, her fears were justified, and defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct effectively made a victim not only of <em>this </em>victim, but all members of the larger community, each of whom must take precautions against criminal behavior and each of whom may have reasonable apprehensions concerning the threat of criminal conduct being directed toward them.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">This also explains why the Legislature chose to assess 15 points for \u201cpredatory conduct,\u201d the highest number of points that can be assessed under OV 10. The hierarchical range of points that may be assessed under OV 10 extends from zero to 15 points. Zero points are to be assessed when \u201c[t]he offender did not exploit a victim\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d MCL 777.40(1)(d). Five points are to be assessed when \u201c[t]he offender exploited a victim by his or her difference in size or strength, or both, or exploited a victim who was intoxicated, under the influence of drugs, asleep, or unconscious\u201d \u2014 things that are largely within the victim\u2019s own control.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> MCL 777.40(1)(c). Ten points are to be assessed when \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>offender exploited a victim\u2019s physical disability, mental disability, youth or agedness, or a domestic relationship, or the offender abused his or her authority status\u201d\u2014 things that are largely outside of the victim\u2019s control. MCL 777.40(l)(b). Finally, 15 points are to be assessed when \u201c[p]redatory conduct was involved\u201d \u2014 something that is <em>always </em>outside of the victim\u2019s control and something that may impact the community as a whole and not only persons with already-existing vulnerabilities. That is, we can only interpret the Legislature\u2019s hierarchical approach in OV 10 as indicating its own view that \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d deserves to be treated as the <em>most serious </em>of all exploitations of vulnerability because that conduct itself created or enhanced the vulnerability in the first place, and it may have done so with regard to the community as a whole, not merely with regard to persons who were <em>already </em>vulnerable for one reason or another. By its essential nature, predatory conduct may render <em>all </em>persons uniquely susceptible to criminal exploitation and transform all persons into potentially \u201cvulnerable\u201d victims. Only in this way can MCL 777.40(l)(a) be understood as connected with MCL 777.40(l)(b) through (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The fact that the Legislature has directed sentencing courts to assess 15 points, the highest number of points that can be scored under OV 10, for \u201cpredatory conduct,\u201d also strongly suggests that the Legislature did not intend \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d to describe <em>any </em>manner of \u201cpreoffense conduct.\u201d Indeed, if that were the case, 15 points could be assessed under OV 10 in almost <em>all </em>cases because there will almost always be some manner of preliminary or \u201cpreoffense conduct.\u201d Few criminal offenses arise utterly spontaneously and without forethought. Most importantly, reading MCL 777.40(1)(a) as requiring 15 points to be assessed for OV 10 in <em>every </em>case would essentially render nugatory MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>777.40(1)(b) through (d), the provisions directing when OV 10 requires a score of 10, 5, and zero points respectively, \u201cand it is well established that \u2018[i]n interpreting a statute, we [must] avoid a construction that would render part of the statute surplusage or nugatory\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v City of Lansing, </em>486 Mich 1, 21; 782 NW2d 171 (2010) (citation omitted) (alteration in <em>Robinson). </em>To enable MCL 777.40(1)(a) whenever there is <em>any </em>\u201cpreoffense conduct\u201d would effectively ensure that MCL 777.40(1)(b) through (d) would never be enabled. Thus, to give meaning to the entirety of MCL 777.40(1), and out of recognition that 15 points for \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d constitutes the highest number of points available under OV 10 and that \u201cpreoffense conduct\u201d is being used to define \u201cpredatory conduct,\u201d we conclude that the latter term does not encompass <em>any </em>\u201cpreoffense conduct,\u201d but rather only those forms of \u201cpreoffense conduct\u201d that are commonly understood as being \u201cpredatory\u201d in nature, e.g., lying in wait and stalking, as opposed to purely opportunistic criminal conduct or \u201cpreoffense conduct involving nothing more than run-of-the-mill planning to effect a crime or subsequent escape without detection.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>People v Cannon, </em>481 Mich 152, 162; 749 NW2d 257 (2008). This is the only interpretation that gives meaning to all the paragraphs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>of MCL 777.40(1), while respecting the obviously hierarchal character of those provisions. In short, \u201cpreoffense conduct\u201d must be read in context. <em>Robinson, </em>486 Mich at 15 (statutory language \u201ccannot be read in isolation, but must be read in context\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In the instant case, although defendant may not have been lying in wait for a <em>specific </em>victim, he was unquestionably lying in wait for <em>a </em>victim. Therefore, his preoffense conduct was directed at \u201ca victim.\u201d MCL 777.40(3)(a). In this regard, it is helpful to consider why defendant was lying in wait, armed and hidden from view. And the answer to this question is quite obvious \u2014 he was doing this in order to place himself in a better position to be able to successfully rob someone in the parking lot. That is, defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct of predatorily lying in wait, armed, and hidden from view was directed at \u201ca victim.\u201d Although defendant may not have known who his victim was going to be when he first undertook these actions, that does not undermine the fact that he was lying in wait for \u201ca victim,\u201d and thus that his preoffense conduct was directed toward such \u201ca victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In addition, defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct was \u201cfor the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d MCL 777.40(3)(a). As <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 161, explained, \u201c \u2018[victimize\u2019 is defined as \u2018to make a victim of.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) And \u201cvictim\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018a person who suffers from a destructive or injurious action <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Therefore, \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d under the statute is behavior that is predatory in nature, \u201cprecedes the offense, [and is] directed at a person for the primary purpose of causing that person to suffer from an injurious action . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, before the robbery, defendant laid in wait while armed and hidden from view for the primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>purpose of eventually causing a person to suffer from an injurious action, i.e., an armed robbery. In light of these facts, defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct constituted \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d both under the statutory definition of this phrase and according to common understanding under which lying in wait constitutes quintessential \u201cpredatory conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">B. \u201cVULNERABILITY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The Court of Appeals concluded and the dissent agrees that the victim was not \u201cvulnerable\u201d because there was nothing in the record to indicate that she suffered from an <em>inherent </em>or <em>personal </em>vulnerability. <em>Huston, </em>288 Mich App at 395-396. We disagree. The Court of Appeals\u2019 and the dissent\u2019s analyses limit \u201cvulnerability\u201d of a victim to inherent or personal characteristics of the victim, and such a limitation is contrary to the express language of MCL 777.40. We read the statute as contemplating vulnerabilities that may arise not only out of a victim\u2019s characteristics, but also out of a victim\u2019s relationships or circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">MCL 777.40(1)(b) and (c) explicitly define characteristics, relationships, and circumstances that may make a victim susceptible to injury, physical restraint, persuasion, or temptation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The specified factors listed in subdivisions (b) and (c) relate to the inherent characteristics of the victim, as well as the victim\u2019s relationships and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Using the statutory language as guidance, <em>Cannon </em>listed factors to be considered by a sentencing court when determining whether a victim was vulnerable. <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 158-159. Those factors include the expressly listed characteristics, relationships, and circumstances identified in subdivisions (b) and (c), which are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">(1) the victim\u2019s physical disability, (2) the victim\u2019s mental disability, (3) the victim\u2019s youth or agedness, (4) the existence of a domestic relationship, (5) whether the offender abused his or her authority status, (6) whether the offender exploited a victim by his or her difference in size or strength or both, (7) whether the victim was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, or (8) whether the victim was asleep or unconscious. [M][<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Both <em>Cannon </em>and the express language of MCL 777.40(2) instruct that the mere existence of one of the listed factors does not automatically render the victim \u201cvulnerable\u201d for purposes of scoring OV 10. <em>Id. </em>at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In contrast to subdivisions (b) and (c), subdivision (a) does not list any specific characteristics, relationships, or circumstances of the victim. Rather, that subdivision merely requires that \u201c[p]redatory conduct was involved\u201d in order to assess 15 points for OV 10. MCL 777.40(1)(a). Recognizing this notable distinction, <em>Cannon </em>explained that the factors it enumerated were <em>not </em>meant as an exhaustive list for purposes of finding \u201cvulnerability.\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 158 n 11. Instead, <em>Cannon </em>clarified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>[t]he absence of one of these factors does not preclude a finding of victim vulnerability when determining whether it is appropriate to assess 15 points for predatory conduct. Rather, the evidence must show merely that it was readily apparent that the victim was susceptible to injury, physical restraint, persuasion, or temptation. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Accordingly, to assess 15 points for OV 10, a court must find that an offender engaged in predatory conduct and exploited a vulnerable victim, using only the statutory definition of \u201cvulnerability.\u201d Again, MCL 777.40(3)(c) defines \u201cvulnerability\u201d as the \u201creadily apparent susceptibility of a victim to injury, physical restraint, persuasion, or temptation,\u201d and such vulnerability may or may not arise from the explicitly listed characteristics, relationships, and circumstances set forth in subdivisions (b) and (c). The statute does not mandate that this \u201csusceptibility\u201d be <em>inherent </em>in the victim. Rather, the statutory language allows for susceptibility arising from external circumstances as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In the instant case, the victim was alone in the dark, and defendant and his cohort outnumbered her. Moreover, a key fact that greatly increased the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of the victim in these specific circumstances was that defendant and his cohort were lying in wait for her, armed and hidden from her view. By lying in wait for a victim in the manner that defendant did here, he made the victim more \u201csusceptib[le] ... to injury [or] physical restraint,\u201d i.e., more \u201cvulnerable.\u201d MCL 777.40(3)(c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>That is, just as the defendant in <em>People v Apgar, </em>264 Mich App 321; 690 NW2d 312 (2004), enhanced the victim\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d by forcing her to smoke marijuana before he sexually assaulted her; and the defendant in <em>People v Kimble, </em>252 Mich App 269; 651 NW2d 798 (2002), enhanced the victim\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d by following her and waiting until she pulled into her driveway before striking; and the defendant in <em>People v Mahon, </em>485 Mich 971; 774 NW2d 691 (2009) (Corrigan, J., concurring), enhanced the victim\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d by waiting for the bar to close and the victim to exit the bar before he assaulted her, the defendant in the instant case enhanced the victim\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d by lying in wait while armed and hidden from view before he robbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We conclude that a person walking alone at night in a parking lot while two armed people hidden from that person\u2019s view lie in wait to rob that person is a \u201cvulnerable\u201d victim because he or she would have a \u201creadily apparent susceptibility ... to injury [or] physical restraint. . . .\u201d MCL 777.40(3)(c). This conclusion avoids the problem that the dissent is concerned about of characterizing all victims of crimes as \u201cvulnerable\u201d victims, while at the same time it recognizes that a defendant\u2019s \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d can establish or enhance the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of a victim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, defendant unquestionably \u201cexploited] \u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201cvulnerable victim\u201d in this case because he \u201cmanipulate [d] [her] for selfish or unethical purposes\u201d by lying in wait for her and then robbing her of her purse and car.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> MCL 777.40(3)(b). As this Court explained in <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 159, \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d \u201cinherently involves some level of exploitation,\u201d and thus \u201cpoints may be assessed under OV 10 for exploitation of a vulnerable victim when the defendant has engaged in conduct that is considered predatory under the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that defendant engaged in \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d to \u201cexploit[] ... a vulnerable victim,\u201d MCL 777.40(1)(a), and thus that the trial court did not err by assessing 15 points for OV 10. For a trial court to assess 15 points for OV 10, the defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct only has to be directed at \u201ca victim,\u201d not any specific victim, and the victim does not have to be inherently vulnerable. Instead, a defendant\u2019s \u201cpredatory conduct,\u201d by that conduct alone <em>(eo ipso), </em>can create or enhance a victim\u2019s \u201cvulnerability.\u201d Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b684-7\">Young, C.J., and Mary Beth Kelly and Zahra, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\"> Defendant\u2019s cohort also entered a guilty plea to armed robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\"> The Court of Appeals originally denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.

Thus, all three prongs of the test must be met in order to assess 15 points for OV 10.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">B. PREDATORY CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">In this case, defendant did not engage in predatory conduct because his preoffense conduct was not di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>rected at this victim, as this Court has concluded is required by MCL 777.40(1)(a). According to <em>Cannon, </em>the preoffense conduct \u201cmust have been \u2018directed at a victim\u2019 before the offense was committed.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Cannon </em>provided the following guidance regarding this part of the test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">A lion that waits near a watering hole hoping that a herd of antelope will come to drink is not engaging in conduct directed at a victim. However, a lion that sees antelope, determines which is the weakest, and stalks it until the opportunity arises to attack it engages in conduct directed at a victim. Contrast that with an individual who intends to shoplift and watches and waits for the opportunity to commit the act when no one is looking. The individual has not directed any action at a victim.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The majority focuses on the use of the phrase \u201ca victim\u201d rather than \u201cthe victim\u201d in the definition of \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d in MCL 777.40(3)(a) to conclude that the offender\u2019s conduct need not be directed at a specific victim. But the definition of \u201cvulnerability\u201d in MCL 777.40(3)(c) requires that a victim have a \u201creadily apparent susceptibility ... to injury, physical restraint, persuasion, or temptation.\u201d This language suggests that, before points can be assessed for preoffense conduct, it must be clear that the victim was ascertainable <em>before </em>the offense took place. It cannot become \u201creadily apparent\u201d to an offender that a victim is susceptible <em>before </em>the offender identifies the victim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>However, it is more reasonable to conclude that the Legislature selected the term <em>\u201ca </em>victim\u201d rather than \u201cthe victim\u201d simply because it contemplated that a defendant might victimize more than one victim. In the case of more than one victim, the Legislature intended 15 points to be assessed for OV 10 when the defendant directed predatory conduct at \u201ca\u201d preselected victim, but ultimately victimized multiple victims.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">In any situation in which a defendant engages in \u201cnothing more than run-of-the-mill planning to effect a crime,\u201d the community at large is still a conceivable target because the offender will inevitably carry out the offense against some member of the community.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, that member of the community may only become the offender\u2019s target by random chance. If simply targeting the community at large and then carrying out an offense against a random victim who comes along is sufficient to establish predatory conduct, then nearly any type of preoffense conduct will suffice for assessing 15 points under OV 10.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under the majority\u2019s analysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>it is difficult to imagine a situation in which a person intending to carry out a crime would not engage in <em>some </em>type of preoffense conduct for the purpose of victimizing <em>someone </em>before actually selecting a victim to carry out the offense against. The majority\u2019s construction of MCL 777.40(3)(a) lacks any limitation on the circumstances in which a court may assess the highest number of points possible under OV 10.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The majority uses hindsight to suggest that defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cdirected at a victim\u201d because he lay in wait for \u201ca victim\u201d whom he ultimately robbed. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>taking this approach, the majority essentially rewrites the applicable statute to state that an offender\u2019s preoffense conduct must be \u201cdirected at a potential victim,\u201d even if that victim is not identifiable at the time of the preoffense conduct.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In contrast, <em>Cannon </em>correctly concluded that an offender\u2019s preoffense conduct must be directed at a specific victim. <em>Cannon\u2019s </em>interpretation of MCL 777.40 was not only consistent with the statutory language, but it properly limited the assessment of 15 points to circumstances in which an offender\u2019s preoffense conduct involved first selecting a specific victim to target.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>In applying the second part of the <em>Cannon </em>test for predatory conduct, the Court of Appeals correctly acknowledged that a defendant\u2019s conduct must have been directed at a specific victim; however, it then erroneously concluded that this defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct was directed at this victim.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reasoned that even though defendant was initially looking for \u201cany victim,\u201d he eventually chose \u201ca lone and isolated victim. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that defendant\u2019s actions were similar to a lion \u201cfocusing on the weakest antelope in the herd\u201d because defendant waited for particular circumstances to arise before seizing his opportunity to commit the offense.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that this was \u201cnot a random attack on just anyone in the parking lot but a planned attack on an individual perceived to be weak.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">From the record, it is reasonable to conclude that defendant\u2019s objective was to rob a shopper in the mall parking lot. To accomplish this offense, defendant waited in the mall parking lot for a shopper to come along. The prosecutor acknowledged that the victim may simply have been the first person who did come along. The apparent reasoning of the prosecutor and the Court of Appeals was that once a random person came along and defendant carried out his intended offense against that random person, defendant\u2019s conduct was targeted at a specific victim. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">If defendant\u2019s act of waiting for <em>someone </em>to come along and then robbing the unlucky person who happened to arrive in that location constituted preoffense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>conduct sufficiently directed at a \u201cspecific\u201d victim, there would be only rare circumstances in which this part of the <em>Cannon </em>test would not be met. It may be true that defendant waited for the right time to approach the victim and commit the offense; however, this same argument can be made about almost every offense involving an attack on an individual. Unless an offense is truly of a random nature, eventually every offender will select a victim or victims against whom to carry out their intended offenses.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">As previously noted, using the analogy suggested in <em>Cannon, </em>the Court of Appeals concluded that defendant\u2019s actions were \u201cakin to focusing on the weakest antelope in the herd.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> However, defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct was much more analogous to a lion simply waiting near a watering hole, hoping that a herd of antelope will come to drink.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Defendant wanted to rob someone, presumably to get money and a vehicle. A shopping mall is a location where potential victims with money would almost certainly arrive. Therefore, defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>dant went to a shopping mall where he waited in the hope of a victim arriving. While it is true that defendant may have narrowed in on this particular victim during the short time between when the victim entered the parking lot and when she got out of her vehicle, almost every crime involves the offender\u2019s eventually settling on one or more targeted persons and waiting for just the right moment to carry out the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>Cannon </em>clearly directed that targeting a specific person, following that person, and waiting for the opportunity to commit an offense against that person is preoffense conduct sufficiently directed at a victim.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> On the record in the instant case, I conclude that defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct of waiting in the mall parking lot was not sufficiently directed at <em>this </em>victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Because a requirement of the <em>Cannon </em>test for predatory conduct cannot be met, and <em>Cannon </em>directed that all three prongs of the test must be answered affirmatively in order to properly assess 15 points for OV 10, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that defendant is not entitled to resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that, for purposes of scoring OV 10, the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of a victim is not limited to inherent or personal characteristics of the victim. However, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that a defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct need not be directed at a specific victim in order to constitute \u201cpredatory conduct.\u201d I believe that the majority opinion creates an overly broad test for \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d and misconstrues the language of MCL 777.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Contrary to the majority\u2019s analysis, I do not believe that defendant engaged in \u201cpredatory conduct.\u201d This Court has held that a defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct must be directed at a specific victim in order to constitute predatory conduct, and the record here does not reflect that defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct was directed at <em>this </em>victim.

Thus, it is unclear what constitutes \u201cgenuinely\u201d predatory conduct and whether the mere planning of a crime would suffice.

Further, the majority concludes that the victim here qualified as a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d because she was alone and outnumbered at night while defendant and his cohort hid in the bushes adjacent to the parking lot. Lastly, the majority holds that a defendant\u2019s preoffense conduct need not have been directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>at a specific victim, even though MCL 777.40(3)(a) defines \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d as \u201cpreoffense conduct directed <em>at a victim </em>for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d (Emphasis added.) I respectfully disagree and would hold that (1) the victim\u2019s vulnerability for purposes of scoring OV 10 must be personal or inherent in the victim, (2) the victim in this case was not a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d within the meaning of MCL 777.40(3)(c), and (3) the preoffense conduct engaged in by an offender for the primary purpose of victimization must be \u201cdirected at one or more specific victims .. . .\u201d <em>People v Cannon, </em>481 Mich 152, 162; 749 NW2d 257 (2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of defendant\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the trial court for resentencing with instructions to assess zero points for OV 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">I. VULNERABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In my view, in order to assess 15 points for predatory conduct under OV 10, the readily apparent vulnerability exploited by the offender must relate to some inherent or personal characteristic of the victim. As this Court declared in <em>Cannon, </em>the exploitation of a vulnerable victim is a prerequisite for the assessment of points under OV 10. <em>Id. </em>at 156. Relying on the definition of \u201cvulnerability\u201d provided by MCL 777.40(3)(c), we held further that \u201cpoints should be assessed under OV 10 only when it is readily apparent that a victim was \u2018vulnerable,\u2019 i.e., was susceptible to injury, physical restraint, persuasion, or temptation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158. Therefore, the first step when applying OV 10 is to ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>whether the victim was a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d within the meaning of the statute. For assessing this threshold determination, <em>Cannon </em>provided a nonexhaustive list of considerations based on the statutory language to guide courts in assessing victim vulnerability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">(1) the victim\u2019s physical disability, (2) the victim\u2019s mental disability, (3) the victim\u2019s youth or agedness, (4) the existence of a domestic relationship, (5) whether the offender abused his or her authority status, (6) whether the offender exploited a victim by his or her difference in size or strength or both, (7) whether the victim was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, or (8) whether the victim was asleep or unconscious. <em>[Id. </em>at 158-159.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Notably, all these factors relate to the victim\u2019s inherent characteristics or personal situation and are independent of the victim\u2019s external physical environment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s conclusion that vulnerability need not be inherent in the victim is misguided because it is inconsistent with <em>Cannon\u2019s </em>statutorily based threshold test for vulnerability under OV 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Because I believe that the readily apparent vulnerability exploited by the offender must relate to some inherent or personal characteristic of the victim, I believe the Court of Appeals correctly held that the victim in this case was not a vulnerable victim, within the meaning of MCL 777.40(3)(c). Merely being alone and outnumbered in a parking lot at night does not relate to an inherent or personal characteristic, but is instead the product of the victim\u2019s external environment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And while hiding in the bushes may have increased defendant\u2019s likelihood of success, it did not actively alter the victim\u2019s state of inherent susceptibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In my view, to hold that OV 10 does not depend on a victim\u2019s inherent state of vulnerability will lead to overscoring because, under the common meaning of \u201cvulnerability,\u201d all victims were vulnerable. Had they not been, the crime would not have been successful. I can think of no situation in which a crime has been successful that it is not possible to point to specific facts of the offense to support the conclusion that the victim was \u201cvulnerable,\u201d as that term is commonly understood. In an effort to narrow such a broad applicability of OV 10, the Legislature chose to limit its application to only situations in which an offender exploited some inherent or personal characteristic of the victim. Accordingly, I believe that this victim was not a vulnerable victim for purposes of scoring OV 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>II. PREDATORY CONDUCT<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Even if I were to determine that this victim was vulnerable, I believe that nonetheless zero points should have been assessed for OV 10 because the preoffense conduct \u2014 hiding in the bushes waiting for a likely victim to happen along \u2014 was not directed at this particular victim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Cannon, </em>a majority of this Court explained that when assessing points for predatory conduct, the preoffense conduct \u201cmust have been \u2018directed at a victim\u2019 before the offense was committed.\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 160, quoting MCL 777.40(3)(a). Additionally, the second prong of the <em>Cannon </em>test for predatory conduct mandated that the preoffense conduct must have been \u201cdirected at one or more specific victims . . . .\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 162. Today\u2019s majority opinion, however, holds that the preoffense conduct need not be directed at a particular victim in order to assess 15 points for predatory conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>I disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s boundless interpretation of \u201cconduct directed at a victim\u201d in MCL 777.40(3)(a) as meaning conduct directed at the \u201ccommunity at large.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 459-461. \u201cWhenever possible, every word of a statute should be given meaning. And no word should be treated as surplusage or made nugatory.\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 158 (quotation marks and citation omitted). In direct contravention of this accepted principle of statutory construction, however, the majority essentially deletes the phrase \u201cdirected at a victim\u201d from the explicit definition of \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d found in MCL 777.40(3)(a). Under the majority opinion, preoffense conduct need only have been engaged in for the primary purpose of eventually victimizing someone, but need not be directed at anyone in particular. This interpretation fails to give effect to the statute\u2019s plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">I think the answer is simple concerning why the preoffense conduct must have been directed at a particular victim or group of victims: one cannot direct conduct at \u201ca victim\u201d without first identifying and selecting a victim. In addition, MCL 777.40(3)(c) defines \u201cvulnerability\u201d as \u201cthe readily apparent susceptibility of a victim to injury, physical restraint, persuasion, or temptation,\u201d and it is not possible to assess the \u201creadily apparent susceptibility\u201d of a victim until that victim is particularly identified. Therefore, I believe that the <em>Cannon </em>majority was correct in holding that the preoffense conduct must be <em>\u201cdirected at </em>one or more <em>specific </em>victims. . ..\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 162 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The majority\u2019s reliance on the differences between the definite and indefinite articles is difficult to understand when the statute so clearly provides that the conduct must be <em>directed at a victim. </em>See MCL 777.40(3)(a). The indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d have little meaning when taken out of context. In the context of MCL 777.40(3)(a), \u201ca victim\u201d means \u201cany one\u201d or \u201cone of many\u201d victims, and that is the only meaning that should be definitively attributed to the Legislature\u2019s choice to use the indefinite instead of the definite article. To now hold that \u201ca victim\u201d actually means the \u201ccommunity at large\u201d is simply not consistent with the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s attempt to mitigate the potential damage caused by its boundless interpretation of \u201ca victim\u201d by declaring that 15 points may be assessed only for preoffense conduct that is \u201ccommonly understood as being \u2018predatory\u2019 in nature . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 462. Although it is correct that when a term is not defined by statute, it must be interpreted according to its common meaning, MCL 8.3a; <em>McCormick v Carrier, </em>487 Mich 180, 192; 795 NW2d 517 (2010), such is not the case here. Instead, the Legislature expressly defined \u201cpredatory conduct\u201d as \u201cconduct directed at a victim for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d MCL 777.40(3)(a). This statutory definition says nothing about how predatory conduct is commonly understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Finally, today\u2019s majority decision creates difficulty distinguishing between mere planning and preparation to commit a crime and actual preoffense conduct that supports assessing points under OV 10 for predatory conduct. See <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 162 (\u201c[T]he Legislature did not intend that 15 points be assessed for preoffense conduct involving nothing more than run-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the-mill planning to effect a crime . . . Before today\u2019s decision, courts only needed to consider the preoffense conduct during the limited window of time between the selection of a particular victim and the time the offense conduct began. Because it is no longer necessary under the position of the majority that the conduct be directed at any <em>specific </em>victim, but only toward the community at large, courts must now consider all conduct the offender engaged in for the primary purpose of victimizing some eventual victim. In my view, rather than clarifying our OV 10 jurisprudence, today\u2019s decision merely muddies the waters more.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\"> While I did not join the <em>Cannon </em>majority in full, <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 163 (Cavanagh, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), I agree that for purposes of scoring OV 10, the preoffense conduct must have been directed at one or more specific victims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\"> While certain factors may at first blush seem substantively externalized, closer examination reveals that they too are premised on the victim\u2019s inherent state of vulnerability. The existence of a domestic relationship and the offender\u2019s abuse of his or her authority status over the victim both consider vulnerabilities that result from a preexisting relationship of trust or authority between the offender and the victim. This relationship renders the victim inherently more susceptible to an offender who chooses to exploit that relationship. Further, when an offender exploits a victim by his or her difference in size or strength, the relevance of this factor is premised on the <em>victim\u2019s </em>size and strength, both of which are inherent and personal characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Additionally, I take issue with the majority\u2019s declaration that differences in size or strength, or being intoxicated, drugged, asleep, or unconscious are \u201cthings that are largely within the victim\u2019s own control.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 460. Differences in size or strength depend in large part on genetics \u2014 inherent characteristics over which the victim has no control. Further, being drugged, intoxicated, or asleep often may be induced by another \u2014 such as the use of a so-called date-rape drug. Likewise, being unconscious may be the result of an injury or ongoing medical treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b699-5\"> I find it notable that when considering the types of vulnerabilities to include in MCL 777.40, the Legislature did not include one of the most obvious circumstances \u2014 being outnumbered \u2014 as a listed vulnerability. While certainly not dispositive, this supports my conclusion that the vulnerability must be inherent, focused on the victim, and not on independent externalities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\"><em> </em>Conversely, when an offender drugs an intended victim, he has <em>actively </em>altered the victim\u2019s inherent state of susceptibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\"> While I agree generally with Justice Hathaway\u2019s discussion of predatory conduct in part 1(B) of her partial dissent, I write separately to elaborate further on my position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\"> On this point, I think the Court of Appeals clearly erred by holding that defendant\u2019s choice of this specific victim to attack sufficed as preoffense conduct directed at the victim. Merely choosing a victim is not conduct directed at a victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\"> I think it is questionable for the majority to label as \u201cclearly dictum\u201d the statement in <em>Cannon </em>that the preoffense conduct must be directed at one or more specific victims. The whole point of the majority opinion in <em>Cannon </em>was to provide the correct framework for lower courts to apply when deciding whether to assess points for predatory conduct under OV 10. <em>Cannon, </em>481 Mich at 154,161-163. The second prong of the analytical framework <em>Cannon </em>provided required that the preoffense conduct be \u201cdirected at one or more specific victims . . ..\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162. The majority argues that this portion of <em>Cannon </em>was \u201cclearly dictum\u201d because it was \u201cnot essential to [the] determination of the case in hand . . ..\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 458 n 4 (quotation marks and citations omitted). I would, however, remind the majority that there were four employees in the restaurant robbed by the <em>Cannon </em>defendant and his cohorts, and, thus, when the majority in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Cannon </em>outlined a structural paradigm for the trial court to apply on remand, it was essential that the trial court be clear on how to apply OV 10 to a crime involving multiple victims. I would not be so quick to label as dictum an essential prong of an analytical framework provided by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
