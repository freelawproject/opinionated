We conclude that the community caretaking exception applies to firefighters no less than to police officers when they are responding to emergency situations that threaten fife or property. We also conclude that the firefighter\u2019s actions in this case were reasonable, thus satisfying the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the circuit court and the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Defendant, Mark Slaughter, resided in a townhouse in Royal Oak, Michigan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In May 2007, defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>neighbor, Kathleen Tunner, saw water running down her basement wall and over her electrical box. She also heard water flowing behind that wall, which adjoined defendant\u2019s townhouse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tunner attempted to locate defendant by knocking on his door, but he was not home. She then called her townhouse management company in a further attempt to locate defendant. After this attempt failed, Tunner dialed 911. The city of Royal Oak dispatched several firefighters to the townhouse, including Lieutenant Michael Schunck. After consulting with Tunner about her emergency call, Schunck entered defendant\u2019s residence. When he went to the basement to shut off defendant\u2019s water and to assess whether any additional measures needed to be taken to prevent a fire, Schunck observed, in plain view, grow lights and several dozen plants that appeared to be marijuana. He then reported what he saw to the Royal Oak police.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The Royal Oak Police Department dispatched an officer to secure defendant\u2019s townhouse while another officer procured a search warrant. After entering defendant\u2019s townhouse, officers seized 48 marijuana plants, grow lights, a watering system, defendant\u2019s state identification card, books on marijuana horticulture, packaging material, and other drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Defendant was charged with manufacturing with the intent to deliver more than 20 but fewer than 200 marijuana plants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court bound defendant over as charged, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>that the firefighter\u2019s entry into the townhouse violated his Fourth Amendment rights and that he did not exercise dominion and control over the seized marijuana plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Although defendant did not appeal the bindover decision, he subsequently filed a pretrial motion to suppress in the circuit court. After hearing testimony and oral argument, the court granted the motion in a written opinion and order. The circuit court concluded that Lieutenant Schunck \u201cdid not attempt to hear or see for himself what was causing the problem [that led Tunner to dial 911], nor did he attempt to verify the existence of running water in the wall prior to entering the defendant\u2019s home.\u201d The circuit court also observed that Schunck had indicated that \u201che would have entered the apartment even if he had shut off the water and/or electrical from the outside\u201d because \u201che has to investigate the [911] calls to the fullest extent possible____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The circuit court applied this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Tyler</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Camara v Muni Court of City &amp; Co of San </em>Francisco<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in concluding that firefighters are required to procure a warrant before entering a building \u201cto prevent a fire from occurring....\u201d Furthermore, it relied on the fact that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Davis,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which articulated the community caretaking exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement, did not contain \u201canything related to the investigation of a possible fire hazard.\u201d Accordingly, the court ruled that the firefighters could not avail themselves of the community caretaking exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling in a split, unpublished decision, albeit on alternative grounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, the majority determined, contrary to the circuit court\u2019s decision, that the community caretaking exception can apply to searches performed by first-response firefighters to abate a possible fire hazard. However, the majority explained that \u201cthe record permits the conclusion that the firefighters were simply too quick to enter into defendant\u2019s unit and failed to investigate the complaint\u201d before entering defendant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the majority concluded that \u201cthere are too many outstanding questions to conclude whether the firefighters acted reasonably\u201d and, therefore, that the circuit court had properly granted the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The dissenting judge agreed with the majority that first-response firefighters can avail themselves of the community caretaking exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. The dissenting judge, however, concluded that the firefighters had acted reasonably in the instant case, indicating that \u201c[t]he firefighters were faced with a possible emergency situation and they needed to make quick judgments about what to do in order to avoid a potential fire.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">This Court granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal and ordered the parties to brief whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">(1) the actions of firefighters may fall under the \u201ccommunity caretaker\u201d exception to probable cause requirements; (2) the \u201cemergency aid\u201d aspect of the community caretaker exception applies in this case; and (3) the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>erred when it held that the firefighters were first obligated to attempt to remedy the condition for which a neighbor called by using means that did not involve entry into the defendant\u2019s home.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">A court\u2019s factual findings at a suppression hearing are reviewed for clear error, but the application of the underlying law \u2014 the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article 1, \u00a7 11 of the Michigan Constitution \u2014 is reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">A. FOURTH AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees every person\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and provides, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">Similarly, article 1, \u00a7 11 of the Michigan Constitution provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\">The person, houses, papers and possessions of every person shall be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures. No warrant to search any place or to seize any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>person or things shall issue without describing them, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">This Court has ruled that the Michigan Constitution \u201cis to be construed to provide the same protection as that secured by the Fourth Amendment, absent \u2018compelling reason\u2019 to impose a different interpretation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Although the entry into defendant\u2019s residence was warrantless, \u201c[u]nder the common law and agreeably to the Constitution search may in many cases be legally made without a warrant. The Constitution does not forbid search, as some parties contend, but it does forbid unreasonable search.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While many warrantless searches are unreasonable pursuant to the warrant requirement,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court has articulated several instances in which warrantless searches are reasonable. These include searches of automobiles,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> searches incident to contemporaneous lawful arrests,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> inventory searches conducted according to established procedure,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> searches conducted dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ing exigent circumstances,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and searches the police undertake as part of their \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d function.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The instant case involves only the last circumstance listed \u2014 searches undertaken as part of a community caretaking function \u2014 and requires this Court to determine the scope of that community caretaking exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. Because it is uncontested that the initial search of defendant\u2019s residence was warrantless, we must determine whether the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">B. THE COMMUNITY CARETAKING EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The United States Supreme Court first recognized the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement in <em>Cady v Dombrowski, </em>which involved the constitutionality of the search of the trunk of an out-of-town police officer\u2019s automobile.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The police officer was hospitalized after a serious automobile accident, and local police officers arriving on the scene of the accident directed that the injured officer\u2019s vehicle be towed to a private garage. Because the private garage was unsecured, local police sought to locate and safeguard the injured officer\u2019s service revolver. After failing to find the revolver on the officer\u2019s person or in the glove compartment of the vehicle, officers searched the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>vehicle\u2019s trunk and discovered the revolver, along with evidence of a murder.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Before addressing the legality of the search, the Court explained that police officers often perform certain duties independent of their duty to investigate crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">Local police officers ... frequently investigate vehicle accidents in which there is no claim of criminal liability and engage in what, for want of a better term, may be described as community caretaking functions, totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In considering the case before it, the <em>Cady </em>Court determined that the officers had acted not to investigate a crime, but out of \u201cconcern for the safety of the general public who might be endangered if an intruder removed a revolver from the trunk of the vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Court concluded that searches conducted to further these community caretaking functions do not necessarily require a warrant in order to be reasonable. Once it had determined that the search was not conducted pursuant to an investigation, the Court analyzed the reasonableness of the search <em>within the scope of the officers\u2019 community caretaking functions: </em>the officers \u201cwere simply reacting to the effect of an accident \u2014 one of the recurring practical situations that results from the operation of motor vehicles and with which local police officers must deal every day.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the end, the Court held that the warrantless search was a reasonable exercise of the officers\u2019 community caretaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>functions and concluded that their search of the vehicle did not violate the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">Where, as here, the trunk of an automobile, which the officer reasonably believed to contain a gun, was vulnerable to intrusion by vandals, we hold that the search was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">This Court has recognized the community caretaking exception as applicable under Michigan law. In <em>People v Davis, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">The police perform a variety of functions that are separate from their duties to investigate and solve crimes. These duties are sometimes categorized under the heading of \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d or \u201cpolice caretaking\u201d functions. When police, while performing one of these functions, enter into a protected area and discover evidence of a crime, this evidence is often admissible....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">[According to the United States Supreme Court, the defining characteristic of community caretaking functions is that they are totally unrelated to the criminal investigation duties of the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">Federal and state courts have included a variety of police activities under the heading of community caretaking functions. Courts have held that impoundment of automobiles and inventory searches of them, as in <em>Cady, </em>responding to missing vehicle complaints, investigating noise complaints, and searching an unconscious person for identification are community caretaking functions.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>Davis </em>further explained that, because \u201c[community caretaking activities are varied and are performed for different reasons,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> not all conduct that falls within the police\u2019s community caretaking functions can be judged equally. Indeed, shortly after issuing the <em>Davis </em>decision, this Court listed several additional types of intrusions that courts have justified pursuant to the exercise of community caretaking functions: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Accordingly, courts must consider the reasons that officers are undertaking their community caretaking functions, as well as \u201cthe level[] of intrusion the police make while performing these functions,\u201d when determining whether a particular intrusion to perform a community caretaking function is reasonable.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> For instance, \u201ca police inventory of a car is much less intrusive than a police entry into a dwelling.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> This is because the privacy of the home stands \u201c \u2018[a]t the very core\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> of the Fourth Amendment and because \u201c[i]n [no setting] is the zone of privacy more clearly defined than when bounded by the unambiguous physical dimensions of an individual\u2019s home . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus, the threshold of reasonableness is at its apex when police enter a dwelling pursuant to their community caretaking functions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>[CJourts have included a multiplicity of police functions within the meaning of the community caretaking function, including entering an apartment to remove a former girlfriend following a domestic dispute, removing an intoxicated person from the street, entering an abandoned boat to ascertain ownership and the safety of the mariners, responding to a missing vehicle complaint, searching an unconscious person for identification, and responding to persons likely to be in need of emergency aid.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>C. FIREFIGHTERS AND THE COMMUNITY CARETAKING EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">This Court asked the parties to brief whether the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement applies to firefighters\u2019 actions. We conclude that the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement applies when a firefighter, responding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>to an emergency call involving a threat to life or property, reasonably enters a private residence in order to abate what is reasonably believed to be an imminent threat of fire inside. Therefore, once it is determined that a firefighter\u2019s entry into a private residence was an exercise of community caretaking functions, and not an exercise of investigative functions, we must consider the reasonableness of the entry within the context of that community caretaking purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">United States Supreme Court caselaw specifically pertaining to firefighters supports this conclusion. In <em>Michigan v Tyler, </em>the Court concluded that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment extends beyond the paradigmatic entry into a private dwelling by a law enforcement officer in search of the fruits or instrumentalities of crime.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201cthere is no diminution in a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy nor in the protection of the Fourth Amendment simply because the official conducting the search wears the uniform of a firefighter rather than a policeman . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The principle most relevant to this case from those decisions applying the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement to firefighters is that the Fourth Amendment applies equally to police officers and firefighters. It thus follows that if a police officer can avail himself of an exception to the warrant requirement, a firefighter can likewise avail himself of an exception if the circumstances permit. Indeed, <em>Tyler </em>is premised on just that principle: that the exceptions to the warrant require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ment apply no less to firefighters than to police officers who have responded to 911 calls requiring imminent action to prevent harm to persons or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Like decisions applying the community caretaking exception to police officers\u2019 actions, <em>Tyler </em>distinguished a firefighter\u2019s community caretaking functions from his investigative functions.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As a general rule, \u201cofficial entries to investigate the cause of a fire must adhere to the warrant procedures of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201cit would defy reason to suppose that firemen must secure a warrant or consent before entering a burning structure to put out the blaze. And once in a building for this purpose, firefighters may seize evidence of arson that is in plain view.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In short, under <em>Tyler, </em>the purpose of a firefighter\u2019s <em>initial </em>entry into a building is crucial in determining whether a warrant is required for that entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The <em>Tyler </em>Court\u2019s application of the Fourth Amendment to firefighters fits directly into the purposes of the community caretaking exception. Thus, as <em>Cady </em>and <em>Tyler </em>illustrate, we must analyze the reasonableness of the initial intrusion in light of the scope of the intrusion and the firefighter\u2019s purpose in entering the residence. If the purpose of a firefighter\u2019s initial entry into a private residence is to abate an imminent threat of fire, then a warrantless entry is lawful under the Fourth Amendment as long as it is reasonable. Contrarily, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>purpose of a firefighter\u2019s entry is solely to investigate a crime, then a warrant is required unless a different exception to the warrant requirement applies. <em>Tyler\u2019s </em>holding and rationale lead inexorably to the conclusion that the community caretaking exception applies to firefighters. Therefore, we hold that the community caretaking exception applies to firefighters.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Application of the community caretaking exception does not provide firefighters with a blank check to enter private residences; rather, it only authorizes <em>reasonable </em>intrusions. Because \u201c[c]ommunity caretaking functions are varied and are performed for different reasons,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> reviewing courts must tailor their analysis to the specifics of a particular intrusion before determining whether it is reasonable. Although neither Michigan caselaw nor that of the United States Supreme Court has specifically analyzed what factors affect whether a firefighter\u2019s intrusion into a private residence is reasonable, there is ample authority within the caselaw applying specific factors in related circumstances that allows this Court to articulate the standards that both protect individuals\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights and allow firefighters to perform their duty to abate serious fire hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">As stated, the privacy of the home stands at the very core of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections, and the zone of privacy is most clearly defined \u201cwhen bounded by the unambiguous physical dimensions of an individual\u2019s home.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In determining whether firefighters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>acted reasonably in entering an individual\u2019s home, a reviewing court must first consider the firefighters\u2019 basis for making the intrusion \u2014 namely, whether, acting in good faith,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> they \u201cpossess [ed] specific and articulable facts\u201d leading them to the conclusion that their actions were necessary to abate an imminent threat of fire inside the private residence.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Their belief in the necessity of their intrusion need not be \u201cironclad,\u201d only \u201creasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Furthermore, courts must not engage in a \u201chindsight determination\u201d that an entry is unreasonable simply because no imminent hazard <em>actually </em>existed.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Rather, courts must determine whether an entry was reasonable on the basis of the circumstances known to the firefighters at the time of entry.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Next, courts should consider the scope of the entry, which \u201cmust be limited to the justification therefor\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>and may not extend beyond what \u201cis reasonably necessary to determine\u201d whether the imminent threat of fire exists inside the private residence.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> If firefighters do, in fact, find such a threat inside the residence, they may \u201cremain in [the] building for a reasonable time\u201d to abate the hazard and to \u201cinvestigate [its] cause,\u201d because investigating the cause of the hazard \u201cmay be necessary to prevent its recurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Finally, in determining whether a particular entry is reasonably necessary, firefighters are not constrained to follow the least intrusive means of abating the imminent threat of fire. Indeed, that firefighters could have abated the fire hazard \u201cby \u2018less intrusive\u2019 means does not, by itself, render the search unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Rather, reviewing courts must consider whether the means and scope of entry were themselves reasonable under the totality of circumstances, not whether they were perfect.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">D. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Because the community caretaking exception is not a blank check for warrantless entry by firefighters, we apply the foregoing analysis to determine whether the firefighters\u2019 entry into defendant\u2019s residence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">As stated, we must first analyze the firefighters\u2019 basis for entering defendant\u2019s private residence. The circuit court\u2019s findings of fact are relevant here and are not clearly erroneous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>[Lieutenant Schunck] was called to [defendant\u2019s townhouse], in the City of Royal Oak. The call was based upon a report of a possible electrical problem with running water. Upon arrival, he spoke to a neighbor [Tunner], who indicated she suspected water was running between a common wall, which shares an electrical panel. [Schunck] attempted to make contact with the owner of the neighboring apartment, but was unsuccessful. If there was water running onto an electrical box, it presented a life hazard and structure fire situation. [Schunck] made entry into the defendant\u2019s home to see if there was water running into the electrical box.. .. [Schunck] went into the apartment to check for running water, and shut off the electricity. It was possible ... to shut off the water to the entire complex from outside, but the general practice is to shut off the individual apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">Upon cross-examination, [Schunck] indicated he did not see or hear any water before or after entering the apartment. In fact, he admitted he did not find any running water in the apartment. [Schunck] also admitted he did not shut off the water of the neighbor, nor did he check that apartment for water or dampness. He also admitted he did not turn off the electrical box for either apartment. [Schunck] was not sure where the meter [was] which would have permitted him to shut off the electricity without entering the apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">Upon re-direct examination, [Schunck] indicated he was not sure if he entered [Tunner\u2019s] apartment. He also indicated he would have entered [defendant\u2019s] apartment even if he had shut off the water and/or electrical from the outside. He testified he has to investigate the calls to the fullest extent possible....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">At no point did the circuit court indicate that it disbelieved Schunck\u2019s testimony. Schunck also testified that he shut off the water to defendant\u2019s townhouse and that he did so from the basement of defendant\u2019s townhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">It is clear from Schunck\u2019s testimony that he acted in good faith. There is no indication that his entry into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>defendant\u2019s residence was pretextual, and only upon entering defendant\u2019s basement to shut off the water to defendant\u2019s residence did Schunck see what appeared to be contraband in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Of course, good faith alone is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment; firefighters must \u201cpossess specific and articulable facts\u201d leading them to the conclusion that their imminent action is necessary to abate the threat to persons or property inside the private residence.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> In this case, Schunck knew of the 911 call and the information it contained. Moreover, he spoke with Tunner, who reported that she saw water coming into her basement from the wall that she shared with defendant and that she heard water flowing behind that wall.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Schunck had no reason to disbelieve Tunner\u2019s assertion, although there was no evidence that he corroborated Tunner\u2019s statement by witnessing or hearing the water himself. Nevertheless, Tunner\u2019s report of water leakage next to her electrical box was specific and articulable evidence supporting Schunck\u2019s conclusion that his imminent action was necessary to abate a condition inside defendant\u2019s residence that he reasonably believed was a threat to persons or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Furthermore, the fact that the townhouse complex contained several units attached to each other elevated the imminence of the potential hazard. Schunck explained that the attached units were \u201creal close together\u201d and that they \u201cshare[d] electrical panels in the basement at the bottom of these [common] walls.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Moreover, because a \u201chigh density\u201d of people lived in \u201call [the] connected apartments,\u201d Schunck explained that \u201ca definite life hazard and possible structur[al] fire type situation\u201d existed. These facts further supported Schunck\u2019s decision to enter defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">We conclude that, in assessing whether an entry was reasonable, courts must also determine whether the scope of the entry was \u201climited to the justification therefor\u201d or whether it extended beyond what was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to abate the hazard inside the private residence.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> In this case, Schunck entered defendant\u2019s townhouse by having one of his crew enter the townhouse through a window in order to let him enter through the front door. Moreover, Schunck shut off the water to defendant\u2019s townhouse from the basement, which was where Tunner believed the water was flowing and where Schunck found, in plain view, the plants he believed to be contraband.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Therefore, the extent of Schunck\u2019s entry and search of defendant\u2019s residence was limited to the area of the residence that the available information indicated was the location of the hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Court of Appeals panel determined that Schunck entered without considering alternative, less intrusive means of abating the hazard. This kind of post hoc analysis is inconsistent with the principles for assessing the reasonableness of entry that we announce today.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Although it was possible for Schunck to turn off the water from outside defendant\u2019s residence, several facts led Schunck to the conclusion that actual entry into defendant\u2019s residence was necessary. First, because defendant\u2019s residence was physically attached to several other units, Schunck sought to minimize disruption to defendant\u2019s neighbors. Schunck believed that turning off defendant\u2019s water from outside the unit would have shut off the water to the entire complex. Generally, he testified, the fire department \u201cisolate[s] the individual problem in the apartment and shut[s] [the water] off from the inside.\u201d Second, even if he had turned off the water to defendant\u2019s residence from the outside, Schunck testified that \u201c[t]here\u2019s no question\u201d he would have still entered the residence because, as an agent of the city of Royal Oak, he needed to be sure the situation was \u201ctotally safe.\u201d Accordingly, there is no indication that Schunck\u2019s entry exceeded what he thought necessary to abate what he believed to be the fire hazard inside defendant\u2019s townhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">On the basis of all these facts, we conclude that Schunck acted reasonably in entering defendant\u2019s residence pursuant to an emergency call. The Fourth Amendment does not prevent firefighters responding to emergency calls from undertaking their duty to protect the public from imminent danger. However, we emphasize that the Fourth Amendment does not give firefighters a blank check to enter and search private residences, and we caution reviewing courts to apply these principles carefully in order to ensure the appropriate protection of private residences under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment strikes a careful balance, as seen in the instant case, between a citizen\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy with his similarly reasonable expectation that emergency personnel will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>act swiftly to protect his residence from the threat to persons or property therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">E. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In addition to the responses made to the dissent throughout this opinion, we offer the following general discussion of the dissent\u2019s criticisms of our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">One of the recurring themes of the dissent is that this opinion does not address how the various community caretaking functions fit within the Fourth Amendment. The response to this criticism is simple: this case only addresses how to apply the Fourth Amendment when a firefighter enters a private residence that he believes to be under the imminent threat of fire. We leave all other variants and all other applications of the community caretaking exception for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">For this reason alone, the dissent\u2019s criticism of this opinion for \u201cnot wad[ing] into [the] judicial morass\u201d of the distinctions among the community caretaking doctrine, the emergency doctrine, and the emergency aid doctrine is off the mark. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s understanding of these doctrines is needlessly complex because it characterizes them as separate and distinct exceptions to the warrant requirement, rather than as aspects of the community caretaking exception.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Readers can judge for themselves whether this opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>thoroughly examined the law relevant to deciding this case. The central purpose of a state court of last resort is not merely to bemoan that \u201cthe scope of [the community caretaking] exception[] is far from clear,\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> but to establish clear principles of law, consistent with the Constitution, that subsequent courts can apply as the facts of any particular case dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">By contrast, the dissent would further muddle Fourth Amendment doctrine by deriving several separate exceptions to the warrant requirement based on the exercise of community caretaking functions. But if there is anything clear from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s articulation of the community caretaking exception, it is that <em>actions pursuant to community care-taking functions qualitatively differ from actions pursuant to criminal investigations. </em>This is the central basis for today\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The dissent would also hold that the community caretaking exception does not apply to entry into private residences. A central part of the dissent\u2019s rationale appears to be that because the decision identifying the community caretaking exception, <em>Cady v Dombrowski, </em>\u201cincluded language that sharply distinguished automobile searches from searches of private residences,\u201d the exception <em>cannot </em>encompass searches of private residences. However, the dissent can identify no United States Supreme Court decision that rejected the application of the community caretaking exception to private residences. Indeed, the dissent admits, in its discussion of the \u201cemergency\u201d and \u201cemergency aid\u201d exceptions, that firefighters acting pursuant to their community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>caretaking functions may, under certain circumstances, enter a private residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The dissent claims that this opinion \u201cextinguishes the emergency and emergency-aid exceptions to the warrant requirement in Michigan. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Far from it. We recognize that these different aspects of the community caretaking exception apply the exception to specific circumstances. Our opinion today merely recognizes that in all these circumstances, we must apply the standard of reasonableness that governs <em>all </em>Fourth Amendment cases.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Thus, while different circumstances will lead to different conclusions regarding the reasonableness of a particular search,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> we are only constitutionally required to forbid <em>unreasonable </em>searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The reasonableness of the instant entry turns on the fact that the responding firefighters believed that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>existed the imminent threat of an electrical fire in defendant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The firefighters reasonably believed that the danger posed an imminent threat to property or life, and they acted reasonably in abating that threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We conclude that the community caretaking exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement applies no less to firefighters than to police officers engaged in abating emergency conditions that concern the protection of life and property. Thus, first-response firefighters may avail themselves of the community caretaking exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. In this case, the firefighter entered defendant\u2019s residence in order to abate what he reasonably believed was the imminent threat of a serious electrical fire. We conclude that he acted reasonably in doing so and that, accordingly, the circuit court and the Court of Appeals majority erroneously suppressed the evidence he discovered in plain view during this entry. We therefore reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision and the Court of Appeals judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for entry of an order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

We simply articulate standards applicable to situations in which a firefighter enters a private residence to abate what he believes to be an imminent threat of fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> The dissent criticizes this opinion for \u201cfail[ing] to explain which community-caretaking functions, beyond responding to an emergency or administering emergency aid, would reasonably justify a warrantless entry into a home.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 349.

In my view, the majority\u2019s decision today extends the communitycaretaking exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement beyond discernable limitation. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">I would affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019judgment, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to grant defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. However, I would do so based on a different analysis than that used by the Court of Appeals. Consistently with many other courts that have considered the issue, I would hold that the communitycaretaking exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement cannot justify a warrantless entry into a private residence. Because the majority concludes otherwise without a sufficient legal basis for doing so, I cannot join its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">I. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects the people from unreasonable searches and seizures.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Michigan Constitution contains a similar protection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both constitutional provisions require a warrant supported by probable cause for searches and seizures to be reasonable, and therefore constitutional, unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">A person\u2019s home is entitled to the most heightened Fourth Amendment protection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, a warrantless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>entry into a home is presumptively unreasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It violates the Fourth Amendment unless an exception to the warrant requirement exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">A. EXCEPTIONS TO THE WARRANT REQUIREMENT GENERALLY</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Exceptions to the warrant requirement generally relate to two important functions of law enforcement and other state actors: criminal-investigation functions and so-called \u201ccommunity-caretaking\u201d functions. The exceptions for criminal-investigation functions exist because sometimes obtaining a warrant is impracticable due to the need to act expeditiously when investigating criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Such exceptions include searches incident to lawful arrests<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and searches conducted because of the existence of exigent circumstances, for instance, when the police are pursuing a fleeing felon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Neither party to this case asserts that the warrantless entry into defendant\u2019s home occurred in the course of investigating criminal activity. Thus, none of the warrant exceptions under the criminal-investigation umbrella justify the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Other exceptions to the warrant requirement further the government\u2019s interest in protecting individuals or the general public from harm. These exceptions relate to the community-caretaking functions of state actors. They are \u201ctotally divorced from the detection, investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>gation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For example, an official\u2019s community-caretaking functions justify the inventory exception to the warrant requirement, which allows searches conducted according to established police procedures.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Community-caretaking functions also include the administration of emergency aid,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which provides another exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The firefighters in this case were investigating a potential water leak and electrical problem,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which is \u201ctotally divorced\u201d from any criminal investigation. However, several of the exceptions to the warrant requirement that form part of the government\u2019s community-caretaking functions are implicated under the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Yet determining that this case implicates the community-caretaking functions of governmental actors answers only the beginning of the inquiry. As previously stated, the community-caretaking function is the foundational premise for several exceptions to the warrant requirement. Three such exceptions are significant to this case and will be discussed herein: the general community-caretaking exception, the emergency exception,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the emergency-aid exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>In discussing these exceptions, one essential distinction is paramount. Although all the exceptions fall under the rubric of an official\u2019s community-caretaking functions, they involve different circumstances, and different standards are used in assessing their application.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, although the exercise of communitycaretaking <em>functions </em>involves many different factual circumstances, warrantless entries pursuant to the community-caretaking <em>exception </em>are justified in only a narrow subset of those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">B. THE \u201cCOMMUNITY-CARETAKING,\u201d \u201cEMERGENCY,\u201d AND \u201cEMERGENCY-AID\u201d EXCEPTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">As the majority correctly states, one exception to the warrant requirement is the search of a vehicle conducted as part of a police officer\u2019s communitycaretaking functions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This exception, first established in <em>Cady v Dombrowski, </em>is commonly referred to as the community-caretaking exception to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>A related exception also involves the exercise of community-caretaking functions, but is grounded on the need for immediate action by police or firefighters to address emergency situations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This exception is sometimes subdivided into the emergency exception and the emergency-aid exception.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Unfortunately, the scope of these exceptions is far from clear. Consequently, courts across the country have rendered vastly different decisions about the proper application of the community-caretaking, emergency, and emergency-aid exceptions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These anomalous results stem primarily from conflicting nomenclature regarding the exceptions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The South Dakota Supreme Court recently summarized this confusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">A review of the caselaw reveals a breadth of decisions discussing and applying various exceptions including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>emergency doctrine, the emergency aid doctrine, and the community caretaker doctrine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">Some of the avowed distinctions between these three doctrines can be frail, bordering on the meaningless. Neither have they been consistently applied, thus creating contradictory and sometimes conflicting doctrines. Some courts treat these exceptions interchangeably. Others declare that the community caretaker exception applies, but then use law applicable to one of the other exceptions, such as the emergency doctrine.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Pursuant to <em>Michigan v Tyler </em>and <em>Brigham City v Stuart,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is well settled that police and firefighters may enter a private residence without a warrant in emergency circumstances. Such circumstances include, at a minimum, responding to a fire in progress and assisting injured persons in need of medical treatment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, the law remains unclear regarding the proper application of the warrant exception to actions conducted pursuant to community-caretaking functions that are not in response to an emergency situation. The United States Supreme Court has not seen fit to extend the community-caretaking exception established in <em>Cady </em>beyond the context of automobile searches. This, in my view, should be the starting point for the Court\u2019s analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The majority does not wade into this judicial morass. Instead, it ignores it, proceeding as if the law is clear and dictates its result. In so doing, it does precisely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>what <em>State v Deneui </em>cautioned against: creating contradictory and conflicting doctrines using inconsistent language.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">For example, the majority proclaims that \u201cthe community caretaking exception applies to firefighters .. . when they are responding to emergency situations that threaten life or property.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This is a correct characterization of the scope of the emergency exception to the warrant requirement, not of the community-caretaking exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">However, the majority also states that, as long as the entry was \u201can exercise of [the state actor\u2019s] community caretaking functions,\u201d courts need assess only the reasonableness of the entry.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This suggests that a firefighter\u2019s entry into a residence pursuant to a communitycaretaking function absent any imminent threat would be sanctioned as long as a court determines the entry was reasonable. This standard could conceivably be characterized as a wholly independent communitycaretaking exception along the lines of that created by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">However, the majority lacks an adequate legal basis for extending the community-caretaking exception discussed in <em>Cady </em>to entries of residences generally and to the facts of this case specifically. The majority relies almost exclusively on the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Tyler </em>and our decision in <em>People v Davis.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As I will explain, the majority\u2019s reliance on those decisions is unfortunate. <em>Tyler </em>is of nominal usefulness, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>Davis </em>suggests a result opposite to that reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">A. DOES THE COMMUNITY-CARETAKING EXCEPTION JUSTIFY WARRANTLESS ENTRIES INTO PRIVATE RESIDENCES?</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The majority recognizes that the privacy of the home stands at the very core of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. But it assumes without analysis that warrantless entries into a private residence to engage in communitycaretaking functions are permissible if reasonable.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> I cannot agree. The majority\u2019s conclusion assumes, without deciding, what should be the threshold question.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">1. <em>TYLER </em>DOES NOT SUPPORT THE MAJORITY\u2019S HOLDING</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tyler </em>did not cite or discuss <em>Cady, </em>the seminal case that created the community-caretaking exception. Nor do the words \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d appear anywhere in <em>Tyler. </em>Rather, <em>Tyler </em>is typically viewed as involving the emergency exception to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Yet the majority uses <em>Tyler </em>as a central basis for its holding interpreting a warrant exception that <em>Tyler </em>never mentioned. Reliance on a case involving one exception to the warrant requirement to formulate the parameters of another exception to the warrant requirement is erroneous.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Tyler </em>held that \u201c[a] burning building clearly presents an exigency of sufficient proportions to render a warrantless entry \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Courts construing <em>Tyler </em>have generally read this exception to the warrant requirement narrowly, confining it to situations involving an imminent need for police intervention to protect life or property.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Many courts have also noted that the critical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>inquiry is \u201cwhether there is a \u2018true immediacy\u2019 that absolves an officer from the need to apply for a warrant and receive approval from an impartial magistrate.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Thus, <em>Tyler </em>provides a basis for concluding that firefighters may enter onto property without a warrant under emergency circumstances, such as to fight a fire in progress. However, the majority reads more into <em>Tyler </em>by concluding that it \u201clead[s] inexorably to the conclusion that the community caretaking exception applies to firefighters.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This conclusion is simply wrong. It stretches Tyler\u2019s holding far beyond what that opinion actually said. In fact, <em>Tyler </em>only leads \u201cinexorably\u201d to the conclusion that firefighters may enter a burning building in order to fight a fire in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Because <em>Tyler </em>did not discuss the communitycaretaking exception, much less establish rules for its application, the majority should not have placed such reliance on it. Finally, as I explain later, I do not believe that the prosecution in this case established a factual record that justified a warrantless entry under any exception to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">2. <em>DAVIS </em>DOES NOT SUPPORT THE MAJORITY\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">With <em>Tyler </em>properly limited to emergency situations, the majority opinion is left to relying solely on our decision in <em>Davis. </em>But <em>Davis </em>does not support it either.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\"><em>Davis </em>explicitly stated that its holding was based on the emergency-aid exception, not the communitycaretaking exception.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Thus, its discussion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>broader community-caretaking exception is dicta and is not binding on this Court. Nonetheless, to the extent that <em>Davis </em>is informative here, it points to a result the opposite of that reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\"><em>Davis </em>involved the warrantless entry of a hotel room by police officers after they received reports of gunshots being fired. In its discussion of community-caretaking functions, the Court was extremely careful to note the significant difference in privacy interests between a car and a dwelling.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The <em>Davis </em>Court ultimately held that the warrantless entry in that case could not be justified under the emergency-aid exception.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Once the <em>Davis </em>Court so held, it did not make an independent community-caretaking analysis to determine whether the warrantless entry could be justified on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Hence, <em>Davis </em>created a sliding scale for assessing the reasonableness of searches undertaken on the basis of community-caretaking functions. Because of the greater Fourth Amendment protections afforded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>residences, there are few community-caretaking functions that would justify a warrantless search of a residence under <em>Davis. </em>Only when governmental officials act to address an emergency and their actions meet the standard for the emergency or emergency-aid exceptions is a warrantless entry into a home proper.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Two Michigan cases, <em>People v Toohey </em>and <em>People v Krezen, </em>have discussed the community-caretaking function of police officers in upholding automobile searches under the inventory exception to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The <em>Toohey </em>Court surveyed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Cady </em>and <em>South Dakota v </em>Opperman.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> It noted that inventory searches of automobiles satisfy the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement if they are \u201cconducted pursuant to standardized police procedure . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Although <em>Toohey </em>and <em>Krezen </em>discussed the community-caretaking functions of the police in impounding automobiles, neither decision discussed an independent communitycaretaking exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In sum, no decision from this Court has expressly defined the parameters of a community-caretaking ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ception to the warrant requirement. <em>Krezen, Toohey, City of Troy v Ohlinger, </em>and <em>Davis </em>all discussed the community-caretaking <em>functions </em>of law enforcement officers.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> But in none of those cases did the Court uphold a warrantless entry or search on the basis of the community-caretaking <em>exception. </em>Rather, the <em>Krezen </em>and <em>Toohey </em>decisions relied on the inventory exception. The <em>Ohlinger </em>and <em>Davis </em>decisions relied on, and fashioned a test for the application of, the emergency-aid exception. Therefore, this Court has no controlling authority on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">3. SURVEY OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>Tyler </em>and <em>Davis </em>do not support, much less mandate, the majority\u2019s result. Because there is no controlling Michigan authority, I turn to other jurisdictions for guidance. Many courts have observed that the <em>Cady </em>decision included language that sharply distinguished automobile searches from searches of private residences.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Therefore, they have limited the community-caretaking exception solely to the former.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Recently, the United States Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of Appeals for the Third Circuit joined the majority of other federal circuits and adopted this approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">We agree with the conclusion of the Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits on this issue, and interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cady </em>as being expressly based on the distinction between automobiles and homes for Fourth Amendment purposes. The community caretaking doctrine cannot be used to justify warrantless searches of a home. Whether that exception can ever apply outside the context of an automobile search, we need not now decide. It is enough to say that, in the context of a search of a home, it does not override the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment or the carefully crafted and well-recognized exceptions to that requirement.[<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Numerous other courts have tacitly rejected extending the community-caretaking exception to warrantless entries into private residences.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Similarly, others have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>evaluated the warrantless entry under the emergency or emergency-aid exceptions only and, finding them inapplicable, declared the entry unconstitutional without considering a broader community-caretaking exception.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Cases from jurisdictions in which the courts have ostensibly permitted warrantless entries into private residences pursuant to the community-caretaking exception are also instructive. For example, in <em>United States v </em>Quezada,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> the Eighth Circuit upheld a warrantless entry into the defendant\u2019s apartment. The <em>Quezada </em>Court stated that \u201c[a] police officer may enter a residence without a warrant as a community caretaker where the officer has a reasonable belief that <em>an emergency exists </em>requiring his or her attention.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Thus, the warrantless entry in that case, like the entries in <em>Tyler </em>and <em>Mincey v Arizona, </em>was premised on an emergency situation, not simply that the officer was acting in a community-caretaking capacity.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Many other cases that purportedly allowed warrantless entries into homes under the community-caretaking exception similarly relied on the fact that an emergency situation was involved.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Cases like <em>Quezada </em>persuasively illustrate how the law pertaining to the community-caretaking exception, the emergency exception, and the emergency-aid exception are often muddled. Courts often confuse a police officer\u2019s actions pursuant to a community-caretaking <em>function </em>with the community-caretaking <em>exception </em>to the warrant requirement. Moreover, these cases also reveal the dearth of authority for a communitycaretaking exception to the warrant requirement that applies to homes independently of the emergency or emergency-aid exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The majority ignores all of this and assumes, without really deciding the issue, that community-caretaking duties can justify a warrantless entry into a private residence. This assumption is precariously based, given the dearth of authority to support it. I would hold that, to the extent an independent community-caretaking exception to the warrant requirement may be recognized in Michigan, it cannot justify a warrantless entry into a private residence. Rather, such entries must be justified by another exception, such as the emergency or emergency-aid exceptions discussed in <em>Tyler </em>and <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">4. THE MAJORITY\u2019S MISCONSTRUCTION OF FOURTH AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The majority\u2019s articulation of the general legal principles applicable to this case is generally accurate. For example, I do not dispute that the touchstone of Fourth Amendment analysis is reasonableness. The problem is that the majority opinion restricts itself to general legal principles. Indeed, a simple reason exists why the majority does not answer my refutation of <em>Tyler </em>and <em>Davis </em>as a basis for its holding or my discussion of the other caselaw: it cannot. Instead, it attempts to distract from this failure by dismissing my opinion as \u201cbemoan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>[ing]\u201d the state of the law in this area.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The majority also claims that my approach would \u201cfurther muddle Fourth Amendment doctrine . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> To the contrary, my analysis fully examines and evaluates the existing nuances in Fourth Amendment doctrine recognized by courts across the country, including this one. Such nuances are lost on the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">If, as the majority asserts, my understanding of these nuances is \u201cneedlessly complex,\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> so too is the understanding of countless other judges and commentators. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the emergency and emergency-aid exceptions are not merely \u201caspects\u201d of the community-caretaking exception.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> As previously explained, the community-caretaking <em>functions </em>of police and other state actors provide the basis for several distinct exceptions to the warrant requirement. These exceptions include the inventory exception, the emergency exception, and the emergency-aid exception.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Each exception is subject to a different standard for assessing whether a warrantless entry or search conducted pursuant to that exception was reasonable.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The majority opinion falls short because it creates out of whole cloth a previously unrecognized communitycaretaking exception to the warrant requirement. Its wholly unsupported decision not only to adopt that exception but to extend it to warrantless entries into private residences compounds this error. Moreover, the majority refuses to recognize that its stated standard for this new exception is the essence of the standard for the emergency exception to the warrant requirement. Implicit in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>failure is the inevitable conclusion that, under the majority\u2019s new exception, warrantless entries into a home to perform nonemergency communitycaretaking functions can be reasonable.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In sum, the majority\u2019s opinion today (1) extinguishes the emergency and emergency-aid exceptions to the warrant requirement in Michigan by creating a broader community-caretaking exception with no discernable limitation,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> (2) exposes the perils of distilling broad Fourth Amendment principles from inapposite authority and without comprehensive analysis, (3) pays only lip service to United States Supreme Court precedent emphasizing the difference between the home and a vehicle,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> (4) ignores the United States Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that the warrant requirement is subject only to specifically established and well-delineated exceptions,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> (5) directly contravenes <em>Davis </em>by applying a general reasonableness standard to all warrantless entries carried out to perform community-caretaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>functions,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and (6) fails to explain which communitycaretaking functions, beyond responding to an emergency or administering emergency aid, would reasonably justify a warrantless entry into a home.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">B. DOES THE COMMUNITY-CARETAKING EXCEPTION APPLY TO FIREFIGHTERS?</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">This portion of the majority\u2019s holding is unique.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> No jurisdiction has extended the community-caretaking exception to the warrant requirement to firefighters.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>As previously mentioned, <em>Tyler </em>established that firefighters are entitled to enter private residences without a warrant in emergency situations, including fighting a blazing fire. <em>Stuart </em>makes clear that police may enter homes to render emergency aid to someone inside in clear need of medical treatment.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Both of these exceptions are subsumed within the broader rubric of community-caretaking functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Because I would not allow the community-caretaking exception to justify warrantless entries into private residences by any state actors, I would not reach this issue. However, under the majority\u2019s broad new community-caretaking exception, firefighters and police officers may effectively enter private residences at any time and for virtually any reason without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">C. APPLICATION TO THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Under existing law, the firefighters in this case were permitted to enter defendant\u2019s townhouse only to combat an ongoing emergency. The thin factual record precludes the conclusion that a reasonable person could have believed that an emergency existed in defendant\u2019s townhouse. At best, the facts establish that a potential fire threat existed in the townhouse neighboring defendant\u2019s, which belonged to Kathleen Tunner.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The only facts that the firefighters responding to Tunner\u2019s phone call knew when they entered defendant\u2019s home were that (1) Tunner had observed water running over <em>her </em>electrical box and (2) she <em>thought </em>that she heard water running between the common wall her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>townhouse shared with defendant\u2019s townhouse. As the majority observes, Royal Oak Fire Department Lieutenant Michael Schunck testified that he did not independently confirm that water was running in Tunner\u2019s home. Hence, he did nothing to respond to the only possible emergency of which he was aware when he arrived \u2014 a potential fire hazard in Tunner\u2019s townhouse.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In concluding to the contrary, the majority discounts the legal principle that a warrantless entry into a home is presumptively unreasonable.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The government bears the burden of proving that a \u201c \u2018carefully delineated\u2019 \u201d exception to the warrant requirement applies.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Indeed, the facts justifying the entry in this case are significantly less compelling than those present in <em>Davis. </em>In <em>Davis, </em>the police had received a radio dispatch informing them that the manager at a motel had reported hearing gunshots fired in or near one of two motel rooms. The dispatcher identified two possible rooms and directed police officers to a possible witness, but did not suggest that any person was injured. With this dispatch as their only source of information, the police arrived at the motel and proceeded to one of the two rooms. Once there, they encountered an occupant who was unwilling to open the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Notably, the police had not themselves heard shots fired. Nor did they interview any witnesses who heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>them, not even the desk clerk, whom the dispatcher had identified as the source of the information. The initial source of information gave very little detail about the situation. The record did not indicate that the police made inquiries of the manager who approached them or that they knocked on other doors. They encountered no circumstances that suggested that shots had in fact been fired. Under these facts, the <em>Davis </em>Court unanimously refused to apply the emergency-aid exception to uphold the warrantless entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Thus, <em>Davis </em>involved a situation in which gunshots had been fired \u2014 a situation specifically recognized by courts as falling within the emergency exception.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Yet the <em>Davis </em>Court refused to apply the exception absent police corroboration of the shots independent of the phone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">This case involves an alleged water leak and potential electrical problem \u2014 not a scenario specifically recognized as falling within the emergency exception. Just as in <em>Davis, </em>however, the warrantless entry was carried out without any independent corroboration that water was actually leaking and causing a potential electrical problem in defendant\u2019s home. If there was no water leaking, there was no electrical problem and hence no emergency or imminent threat to life or property. Therefore, there was no exception to the warrant requirement that justified the warrantless entry in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The majority concludes to the contrary by establishing a broad, undefined new community-caretaking exception to the warrant requirement wholly unsupported by existing law. Indeed, the scope of the majority\u2019s newly created exception to the warrant requirement is limitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Finally, I question the legal significance of at least one of the facts the majority finds significant when evaluating the reasonableness of the warrantless entry. The majority contends that because the townhouse complex contained several units attached to one another, this fact \u201celevated the imminence of the potential hazard.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Not so. Certainly, the fact that the townhouse complex has numerous attached units elevated the potential <em>scope </em>of the fire threat and the number of people who potentially might have been affected. But that fact is utterly irrelevant to the imminence of a fire threat from water running over an electrical box. The question of the <em>imminence </em>of a fire might be influenced by whether someone saw sparks flying from the box or saw a large quantity of water flowing over it. But the scope of the threat and the imminence of the threat are distinctly different inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">For these reasons, I agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that it is impossible to determine whether the firefighters acted reasonably in entering defendant\u2019s apartment. Thus, I would hold that the prosecution did not meet its burden of establishing that an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement justified the firefighters\u2019 entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to extend the community-caretaking exception to the warrant requirement to allow entry into private residences. I would hold that firefighters, as well as police officers, may enter a private residence only pursuant to the emergency and emergency-aid exceptions. The prosecution failed to establish a record indicating that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>firefighters in this case reasonably believed that immediate entry into defendant\u2019s townhouse was necessary to address an emergency situation. Therefore, I would affirm the judgment, but not the reasoning, of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-6\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Marilyn Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\"> US Const, Am IV</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\"> See <em>Katz v United States, </em>389 US 347, 357; 88 S Ct 507; 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-11\"> See <em>Silverman v United States, </em>365 US 505, 511; 81 S Ct 679; 5 L Ed 2d 734 (1961) (\u201cAt the very core [of the Fourth Amendment] stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d); see also <em>Kyllo v United States, </em>533 US 27, 37; 121 S Ct 2038; 150 L Ed 2d 94 (2001) (\u201cIn the home, our cases show, <em>all </em>details are intimate details, because the entire area is held safe from prying government eyes.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\"> See, e.g., <em>Welsh v Wisconsin, </em>466 US 740, 750; 104 S Ct 2091; 80 L Ed 2d 732 (1984), citing <em>Payton v New York, </em>445 US 573, 586; 100 S Ct 1371; 63 L Ed 2d 639 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b547-13\"> <em>Arizona v Gant, </em>556 US 332; 129 S Ct 1710; 173 L Ed 2d 485 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b547-14\"> <em>United States v Santana, </em>427 US 38, 41-43; 96 S Ct 2406; 49 L Ed 2d 300 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\"> <em>Cady v Dombrowski, </em>413 US 433, 441; 93 S Ct 2523; 37 L Ed 2d 706 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> <em>South Dakota v Opperman, </em>428 US 364, 368-372; 96 S Ct 3092; 49 L Ed 2d 1000 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\"> <em>People v Davis, </em>442 Mich 1, 25; 497 NW2d 910 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> For the reasons explained in part 11(C) of this opinion, the majority\u2019s characterization of the circumstances here as an \u201cimminent threat of fire,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 317, is inapt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b548-10\"> There is some disagreement over whether the emergency exception is justified by community-caretaking considerations or by exigent circumstances.

Additionally, the <em>Cady </em>doctrine deals primarily with warrantless searches and seizures of automobiles (and will be limited to those circumstances except in unusual circumstances), while the emergency doctrine deals with warrantless entries of, but is not limited to, private residences.

But as the majority notes, <em>Davis </em>established a specific standard for how courts could assess reasonableness in the emergency-aid context. The majority today applies a similar standard to assess the reasonableness of entries in emergency situations, such as to abate an imminent threat of fire. However, the majority errs when it grounds its decision in the community-caretaking exception because it gives no equivalent standard applicable to warrantless entries to perform nonemergency communitycaretaking functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The majority claims that any such standard would he dictum because the only question here is whether a firefighter may enter a home to address the threat of an imminent fire. This would be an adequate response if the majority were applying the emergency exception, but not when it creates a new community-caretaking exception. Surely we need not decide the reasonableness of every possible emergency police officers or firefighters may encounter. However, as previously noted, the majority\u2019s decision is based on a new community-caretaking exception without a standard in the event of a nonemergency. The majority leaves lower courts to guess when other, less urgent community-caretaking functions can reasonably justify warrantless entries and searches of homes. Our lower courts and the public deserve more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> See <em>ante </em>at 319 <em>(\u201cTyler\u2019s </em>holding and rationale lead inexorably to the conclusion that the community caretaking exception applies to firefighters.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\"> I do not dispute that firefighters, as well as police officers, could also invoke the emergency-aid exception to justify a warrantless entry into a home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\"> Even Tunner did not consider the situation in her townhouse to be an imminent hazard.
