The Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA) prohibits a \u201cpublic body\u201d from using public resources to make a \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d for political purposes. MCL 169.257(1). At issue in this case is whether a public school district\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction plan that collects and remits political contributions from its employees to the Michigan Education Association\u2019s political action committee (MEA-PAC) runs afoul of \u00a7 57 of MCFA, MCL 169.257(1). We hold that it does. Through administration of a payroll deduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>plan that remits funds to a partisan political action committee, a school district makes both a \u201ccontribution,\u201d because public resources are being used to advance the political objectives of the committee, and an \u201cexpenditure,\u201d because public \u201cservices\u201d and \u201cfacilities in assistance of\u201d these same political objectives are being provided. Thus, the school district\u2019s payroll deduction plan is prohibited by MCL 169.257. This interpretation is consistent not only with the language of the statute, but also with the evident purpose of \u00a7 57, which is to mandate the separation of the government from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political activities. Accordingly, we grant the motion for rehearing, vacate the December 29, 2010, decision of this Court, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Petitioner, the Michigan Education Association (MEA), is a voluntary, incorporated labor organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that represents approximately 136,000 members employed by public schools, colleges, and universities throughout Michigan. The MEA-PAC is a separate segregated political fund established by the MEA in accordance with \u00a7 55 of MCFA, MCL 169.255. The MEA-PAC is significantly funded by payroll deductions of MEA members who have authorized the deductions. The purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in politics by electing candidates favored by the MEA and by furthering the enactment of MEA legislative and executive policy initiatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\">As a public-employee labor organization, the MEA has entered into collective bargaining agreements with various public school districts across the state. Some number of these agreements, including that between the MEA\u2019s locally affiliated Kalamazoo County/Gull Lake Education Associations and the Gull Lake Community Schools (the school district), require that a school district administer a payroll deduction plan for the contributions of MEA members to the MEA-PAC. Administration of the payroll deduction plan requires the school district to distribute payroll deduction forms; collect, enter, and monitor the data of participating MEA members; and record, track, and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC. In return for these services, the MEA has proposed to pay all costs that the school district incurs in administering the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">In this case, the school district conditioned acceptance of the collective bargaining agreement on the MEA obtaining a declaratory ruling concerning the validity of the payroll deduction plan. Accordingly, on August 22, 2006, the MEA filed a request for a declaratory ruling with respondent, the Secretary of State, to determine whether the school district could make and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent ruled that, absent express statutory authority, the school district is prohibited from expending public resources for a payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-PAC. The MEA appealed to the circuit court, which held that respondent\u2019s ruling was \u201carbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion,\u201d reasoning that, although the school district\u2019s administration of the plan constitutes an \u201cexpenditure\u201d under MCFA, when the costs of administering the plan have been reimbursed, \u201cno transfer of money to the MEA-PAC has occurred, and therefore an \u2018expenditure\u2019 has not been made within the meaning of the MCFA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \u00a7 57 of MCFA prohibits a \u201cpublic body,\u201d such as a school district, from using public resources \u201cto make a contribution or expenditure.\u201d According to the Court, the costs associated with the plan constitute an \u201cexpenditure,\u201d and the reimbursement of such costs does not alter that conclusion. <em>Mich Ed Ass\u2019n v Secretary of </em>State, 280 Mich App 477, 486; 761 NW2d 234 (2008). Judge WHITBECK dissented and would have affirmed the trial court, but on different grounds. He reasoned that the costs incurred by the school district in its administration of the payroll deduction plan do not constitute an \u201cexpenditure\u201d as MCFA defines it. <em>Id. </em>at 490. The MEA then sought leave to appeal in this Court. On November 5, 2009, we heard oral arguments on the application,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and nearly seven months later we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>granted the MEA\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, on December 29, 2010, a majority of this Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and held that a school district\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction plan that remits funds to the MEA-PAC \u201cis not precluded by any prohibition in MCL 169.257(1) and is therefore permitted.\u201d <em>Mich Ed Ass\u2019n v Secretary of State, </em>488 Mich 18, 21; 793 NW2d 568 (2010). Respondent moved for rehearing of the Court\u2019s December 29, 2010, decision, arguing that the Court committed error by holding that a public school\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction plan that remits funds to a partisan political action committee was not prohibited by MCL 169.257(1). We now grant respondent\u2019s motion for rehearing, and we vacate the December 29, 2010, decision of this Court, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">II. STANDARD of review</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The interpretation of statutes constitutes a question of law that this Court reviews de novo on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Eggleston v Bio-Med Applications of Detroit, Inc, </em>468 Mich 29, 32; 658 NW2d 139 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">III. PURPOSE OF MCL 169.257</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that the Legislature of this state is empowered to enact laws to promote and regulate political campaigns and candidacies.\u201d <em>Council No 11, AFSCME v Civil Serv Comm, </em>408 Mich 385, 395; 292 NW2d 442 (1980) (citations omitted). The people of Michigan have granted the Legislature broad powers to regulate elections. Among other things, our Constitution empowers the Legislature to set forth the qualifications of electors; the time, place, and manner of elections; and limitations on terms of office. Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 10. Furthermore, Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 4 requires the Legislature to preserve the integrity of elections, providing in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">The legislature shall enact laws to preserve the purity of elections, to preserve the secrecy of the ballot, to guard against abuses of the elective franchise, and to provide for a system of voter registration and absentee voting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Charged to preserve the \u201cpurity of elections\u201d and to \u201cguard against abuses of the elective franchise,\u201d the Legislature enacted MCL 169.257, commonly referred to as \u00a7 57 of MCFA. Section 57 prohibits a \u201cpublic body\u201d from using public resources \u201cto make a contribution or expenditure\u201d for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The clear purpose of \u00a7 57, as reflected in its language, is to mandate the separation of the government from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>cesses, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political activities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">IV ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">MCL 169.257(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure or provide volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under [MCL 169.204(3)(a)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">There is no question that a school district constitutes a \u201cpublic body\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 57.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the issue in this case is whether by administering a payroll deduction plan that remits funds to a political action committee, a school district makes a \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d within the meaning of the same provision. If the plan does, it is expressly prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">A. \u201cCONTRIBUTION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">MCL 169.204(1) defines a \u201ccontribution\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\u201cContribution\u201d means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment, expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance, loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">An \u201cin-kind contribution\u201d is defined as a \u201ccontribution .. . other than money.\u201d MCL 169.209(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan that facilitates payments to the MEA-PAC is prohibited by MCL 169.257(1) because the school district uses its public resources \u201cto make a contribution\u201d in a variety of ways. First, the school district employs public resources to administer the plan that allows MEA members \u201cto make a contribution.\u201d For example, the school district must use its paper, pens, and copiers to develop and execute payroll deduction authorization forms; school personnel must collect, enter, and monitor the data of participating MEA members into computers and accounting software, all of which must be specifically configured to record, track, and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC; school personnel must then be prepared to respond to individual teachers who find it necessary from time to time to adjust or correct or withdraw their own deduction authorizations; and this process must necessarily involve the use of public office space, equipment, and employee time. Use of the school district\u2019s resources to facilitate MEA members\u2019 \u201ccontributions\u201d constitutes a straightforward violation of MCL 169.257(1). More specifically, \u00a7 57(1) prohibits the school district from using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>its resources \u201cto make a contribution.\u201d To \u201cmake\u201d pertinently means \u201cto cause to exist or happen[.]\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2000), def 2. The school district \u201cmakes\u201d a \u201ccontribution\u201d to the MEA-PAC because it \u201ccauses to exist or happen\u201d \u201ccontributions\u201d from MEA members that otherwise would not be made but for the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">Second, the school district itself makes a prohibited \u201ccontribution\u201d to the MEA-PAC because its administration of the payroll deduction plan constitutes something of \u201cascertainable monetary value.\u201d There is inherent value to the MEA-PAC in having payroll deductions automatically taken from members\u2019 wages as opposed to requiring individual solicitations by the MEA-PAC. That there is such \u201cascertainable monetary value\u201d is self-evident from the very fact that the MEA-PAC has affirmatively sought out the assistance of the school district and has litigated to the highest court of this state an appeal asserting its right to enter into the instant agreement with the school district. Parties do not typically enter into contracts absent a belief that the rights or benefits accorded them under the contract have some \u201cascertainable monetary value,\u201d and the instant contract seems no different. Such value can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>almost certainly be identified as the sum of (a) the additional contributions resulting from the ease of the payroll deduction process compared to a political contribution process in which individual solicitations must be undertaken and (b) the reduced administrative and transactional costs of the former process compared to the latter process. The MEA obviously prefers the payroll deduction process because it is a more efficient, and a more productive, process by which to secure funding for its political activities. The school district is not incidental to this process, but constitutes an indispensable element. Without the school district\u2019s contracted-for services, some lesser amount of contributions would presumably be raised on behalf of the MEA-PAC, and at a greater cost.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Third, the administration of the payroll deduction plan also constitutes an \u201cin-kind contribution,\u201d defined by MCL 169.209(3) as a \u201ccontribution... other than money.\u201d Although it is clearly possible to quantify the time spent by employees and the resources expended by the school district in administering the deduction plan, and thereby to ascertain the cost of such a \u201ccontribution\u201d to the school district, it is more difficult to quantify the intangible benefits that the MEA receives from the deduction plan. However, it is quite certain that these benefits substantially outweigh the costs to the school district, and therefore cannot be calculated simply by reference to the school district\u2019s costs. The most significant of these is simply the extent of <em>access </em>to a district\u2019s MEA membership that is afforded the MEA-PAC by the deduction plan. Such access avoids any need on the part of the MEA-PAC to establish its own administrative apparatus for political fundraising, vitiates its need to engage in mailings and alternative forms of communications with its members, and dispenses with its burden of having to process checks, money orders, or credit cards from contributors, as would be necessary for any other solicitor of political contributions. As MEA\u2019s counsel at oral argument acknowledged, this procedure has proven to be an \u201ceffective\u201d means to raise money. Almost certainly, the marginal administrative costs of the payroll deduction plan to the school district, which already may have in place a mechanism by which taxes and charitable contributions can be deducted from employees\u2019 paychecks, will be less than the administrative costs of an equivalent plan to the MEA, which does not already have a similar mechanism in place. The difference between these respective costs can fairly be described as an \u201cin-kind contribution\u201d by the school district to the MEA-PAC, however difficult it may be specifically to quantify in dollars. It is a \u201ccontribution... other than money\u201d that is made for the \u201cpurpose of influencing the nomination or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The services undertaken on behalf of the MEA-PAC are \u201cmade for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question,\u201d MCL 169.204(1), because, as discussed earlier, the purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in partisan politics.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the school district\u2019s administration of the deduction plan constitutes a \u201ccontribution\u201d as that term is defined by MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>169.204(1).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because the school district employs public resources to make this \u201ccontribution,\u201d its administration of the deduction plan is a straightforward violation of \u00a757 of MCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">B. \u201cEXPENDITURE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Section 57 of MCFA also prohibits a \u201cpublic body\u201d from using public resources to make an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d MCL 169.257(1). An \u201cexpenditure\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. [MCL 169.206(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-PAC constitutes a prohibited \u201cexpenditure\u201d because the school district directly provides \u201cservices\u201d and \u201cfacilities in assistance of\u201d the MEA-PAC. The school district provides \u201cservices\u201d to the MEA-PAC in its administration of the deduction plan by developing and executing payroll deduction authorization forms; by collecting, entering, and monitoring the data of MEA members by means of computers and accounting software, all of which must be configured to record, track, and transmit payroll deduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tions to the MEA-PAC; and by accommodating individual teachers who find it necessary from time to time to adjust or correct or withdraw their deduction authorizations. Further, the school district provides \u201cfacilities in assistance of\u201d the MEA-PAC through the use of public office space and equipment. These \u201cservices\u201d and \u201cfacilities in assistance of\u201d the MEA-PAC are, once again, made for the purpose of \u201cthe nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question,\u201d MCL 169.206(1), because, as discussed previously, the purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in politics, by electing candidates favored by the MEA and by enacting MEA legislative and policy initiatives. Thus, the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan constitutes an \u201cexpenditure\u201d as that term is defined by MCL 169.206(1) and is specifically prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Justice HATHAWAY concedes that the school district\u2019s administration of the deduction plan \u201cfalls within the general definition of \u2018expenditure\u2019 under MCL 169.206(1)....\u201d <em>Post </em>at 256. However, she would hold, as would Justice CAVANAGH, that the plan also falls within a specific statutory <em>exclusion </em>from the definition of an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d This exception provides that an \u201cexpenditure\u201d does not include \u201c[a]n expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee.\u201d MCL 169.206(2)(c). According to Justice HATHAWAY, a school district\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction plan that remits payments to a political action committee constitutes an \u201c \u2018expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee\u2019 \u201d and is, therefore, allowed under \u00a7 57. <em>Post </em>at 257, quoting MCL 169.206(2)(c). However, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>analysis overlooks the fact that a <em>\u201cpublic body,\u201d </em>such as a school district, is not authorized to establish a separate segregated fund under MCFA and, therefore, may not rely on the \u00a7 6(2)(c) exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">Instead, this exclusion is clearly designed to apply only to corporations and labor organizations that possess the authority to create, establish, administer, or fund separate segregated funds in the first place. This interpretation, limiting the \u00a7 6(2) (c) exclusion to corporations and labor organizations, is a necessary implication from the structure of MCFA for three reasons. First, \u00a7 54 of MCFA, MCL 169.254, imposes the same rule, prohibiting the making of a \u201ccontribution or expenditure,\u201d on corporations and labor organizations that \u00a7 57 imposes on public bodies. In pertinent part, \u00a7 54 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">Except with respect to the exceptions and conditions in ... <em>section 55 </em>[MCL 169.255],.. a corporation, joint stock company, domestic dependent sovereign, or labor organization shall not make a contribution or expenditure .... [MCL 169.254(1) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Second, unlike \u00a7 57, \u00a7 54 does not constitute an absolute prohibition against making a \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d; rather, pursuant to \u00a7 55,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">[a] corporation organized on a for-profit or non-profit basis, a joint stock company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization formed under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes. A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate committees, ballot question committees, political party committees, political committees, and independent committees. [MCL 169.255(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Third, there is no similar counterpart in \u00a7 57 that allows a \u201cpublic body\u201d to make \u201can expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund . . . Thus, under \u00a7 55, the <em>only </em>entities allowed to establish a separate segregated fund are corporations, joint stock companies, domestic dependent sovereigns, or labor organizations, such as the MEA. Considered together, \u00a7 55 and the \u00a7 6(2)(c) exclusion that permits an \u201cexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund\u201d provide a limited mechanism allowing entities such as the MEA to create, establish, administer, or fund a separate segregated fund for purposes that would otherwise be disallowed by \u00a7 54. In contrast, a \u201cpublic body,\u201d such as a school district, is not entitled to create, establish, administer, or fund a separate segregated fund, under \u00a7 55 or any other provision, and thus may not. rely on the \u00a7 6(2) (c) exclusion from the definition of an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Even if, as Justice HATHAWAY claims, the \u00a7 6(2)(c) exclusion is not limited to \u00a7 55 entities, her application of the exclusion remains illogical. Justice HATHAWAY concludes that although a school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan constitutes an \u201cexpenditure,\u201d it is nevertheless</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under MCL 169.206(2)(c), which provides that an \u201cexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee\u201d is not an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d A public school\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction system falls squarely within the statutory exception. The system is set up to facilitate MEA member contributions to their separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>segregated fund, the MEA-PAC. Therefore, the administration of the system is <em>not </em>an \u201cexpenditure\u201d under the MCFA. <em>[Post </em>at 256.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Justice HATHAWAY thus concludes that the administration of a payroll deduction plan falls \u201csquarely within the statutory exception.\u201d Under MCL 169.206(2)(c), an \u201cexpenditure\u201d does not encompass what would otherwise be an \u201cexpenditure\u201d for (a) establishment of a separate segregated fund or independent committee, (b) administration of a separate segregated fund or independent committee, or (c) solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee. Thus, in order to fall within the purview of this exception, a \u201cpublic body\u201d must be engaged in one of these enumerated activities. In this case, however, the school district is engaged in none.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>First, the school district is not making an \u201cexpenditure\u201d for the <em>establishment </em>of a separate segregated fund or independent committee because the separate' segregated fund, the MEA-PAC, has already been established by the MEA. In any event, the school district could not establish a separate segregated fund in the first place, because that authority is limited to the entities enumerated in \u00a7 55 (corporations, joint stock companies, domestic dependent sovereigns, and labor organizations).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">Second, the school district is not making an \u201cexpenditure\u201d for the <em>administration </em>of a separate segregated fund or independent committee because the school district is not \u201cadministering\u201d the MEA-PAC; rather, the school district is simply administering the payroll deduction plan that remits funds to the MEA-PAC. That is, the school district makes no determinations at all concerning amounts of funds to be raised from MEA members or other funding sources; the nature and substance of communications to MEA members and other funding sources about the need and urgency of such contributions; the identification of political candidates and causes as beneficiaries of the MEA-PAC, and in what amounts; or strategies for optimizing the impact of MEA-PAC participation in political campaigns and causes. Justice HATHAWAY, however, would hold that the plain language of the statute dictates that the administration costs- at issue are excluded from the statutory term \u201cexpenditure.\u201d See <em>post </em>at 256. In so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>asserting, Justice HATHAWAY misinterprets the statute, because the only administrative costs that are excluded under this exclusion are those associated with administering a \u201cseparate segregated fund or independent committee.\u201d MCL 169.206(2)(c). That the school district is administering a <em>process </em>by which payments are <em>remitted </em>to such a fund is hardly the equivalent of administering the fund itself, such that the \u00a7 6(2) (c) exclusion would apply. Justice HATHAWAY is confused in this regard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Third, the school district is not making an \u201cexpenditure\u201d for the <em>solicitation of contributions </em>to a separate segregated fund or independent committee; rather, the school district is using public resources for processing payments to the MEA-PAC. As discussed earlier, the school district\u2019s \u201cexpenditure\u201d consists of the use of personnel, office space, computers, software, and other public resources to remit payments to the MEA-PAC. The school district is not, for example, maintaining an advertising campaign on behalf of the MEA-PAC, cold-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>calling MEA members, or preparing mailers or brochures to enlist contributors. As such, the school district\u2019s use of public resources for processing payments to the MEA-PAC cannot be viewed as <em>soliciting </em>contributions, but only as facilitating such contributions, an entirely distinct concept. It follows that because the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not fall within any of the three enumerated exclusions set forth in MCL 169.206(2) (c), it is not excluded from the definition of an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">C. KELEVANCE OF ADVANCE PAYMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Having determined that the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan that remits payments to the MEA-PAC constitutes both a \u201ccontribution\u201d and an \u201cexpenditure,\u201d the question remains whether the MEA\u2019s preparedness to pay in advance the school district\u2019s costs associated with the plan remedies what would otherwise constitute a violation of \u00a7 57. For the reasons that follow, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The Court of Appeals correctly held that there is \u201cnothing in the plain language of the MCFA that indicates reimbursement negates something that otherwise constitutes an expenditure.\u201d <em>Mich Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>280 Mich App at 486. A court\u2019s primary purpose in interpreting a statute is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, </em>456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998). \u201cCourts may not speculate regarding legislative intent beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the words expressed in a statute. Hence, nothing maybe read into a statute that is not within the manifest intent of the Legislature as derived from the act itself.\u201d <em>Omne Fin, Inc v Shacks, Inc, </em>460 Mich 305, 311; 596 NW2d 591 (1999) (citations omitted). The Legislature declined to provide that advance payments remedy what would otherwise constitute a violation of \u00a7 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The suggestion that advance payments remedy a violation of \u00a7 57 is belied by the terms of the statute. Section 57 provides that \u201c[a] public body . .. <em>shall not use or authorize the </em>use\u201d of public resources to make a \u201ccontribution or expenditure . ...\u201d MCL 169.257(1) (emphasis added). The use of \u201cshall\u201d in a statute generally \u201cindicates a mandatory and imperative directive.\u201d <em>Burton v Reed City Hosp Corp, </em>471 Mich 745, 752; 691 NW2d 424 (2005) (citations omitted). As such, the statute mandates that the school district not \u201cuse or authorize the use of\u201d its public resources to make a \u201ccontribution\u201d or an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d Nothing in MCFA leads to the conclusion that the Legislature intended \u00a7 57 to be interpreted any differently. Irrespective of whether the school district is reimbursed for its administration of the payroll deduction plan, the school district nonetheless has employed public resources to make a \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d for political purposes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The advance payment of expenses simply does not negate what \u00a7 57 is intended to prohibit. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the gravamen of \u00a7 57 is not that a \u201cpublic body\u201d whose resources have been employed for private political purposes be compensated on a dollar-for-dollar basis, but that public resources not be used for such purposes in the first place. That the costs of dismantling the wall separating government and partisan political campaigning are to be paid by those who desire to use taxpayer resources for partisan political campaigning is not the point of \u00a7 57; rather, it is that the wall not be dismantled.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\">Furthermore, the unquantifiable cost to the school district, as well as to taxpayers, parents, and students, of having time and resources diverted from the school district\u2019s primary responsibilities of administering schools and educating students in order to administer a process of raising political contributions for the MEA-PAC cannot simply be paid in advance or reimbursed. Time is a zero-sum resource, and it is irretrievably lost to taxpayers, parents, and students when it is taken away from the former responsibilities and redirected to the latter responsibilities. If some lesser portion of each day is devoted to the interests of the school district and a greater portion of each day is devoted to the partisan political interests of a labor organization, taxpayers, parents, and students suffer. Although advance payment may recompense the school district its employees\u2019 salaries for the time spent on administration of the plan and for the use of supplies and other public resources, monetary reimbursement, paid in advance or otherwise, is simply insufficient to recover the time that is diverted from the primary obligations of the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Moreover, because neither advance payments nor reimbursements prevent the prohibited \u201cuse\u201d of public resources from occurring in the first place, the act is punishable as a misdemeanor and subject to a fine that may be \u201cequal to the amount of the improper contribution or expenditure.\u201d MCL 169.257(2)(b). The fact that one of the penalties for making an improper \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d requires the violator to pay an amount that is \u201cequal to the amount of the improper contribution or expenditure\u201d indicates strongly that such a payment, whether in the form of a \u201cpenalty\u201d or a \u201creimbursement,\u201d does not transform an improper \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d into a proper one. Had the Legislature intended otherwise, the misdemeanor statute would more likely have read that the criminal sanction to be paid is \u201cequal to the amount of the improper contribution or expenditure, <em>less any reimbursement of such contribution or expenditure.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>V RESPONSE TO DISSENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\">As discussed previously, Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s position that the school district\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction plan is not an \u201cexpenditure\u201d because the cost of administration is an \u201cexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee,\u201d MCL 169.206(2)(c) \u2014 an enumerated exception to the statutory definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d \u2014 lacks merit for two reasons. First, a school district\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction plan is not excluded from the definition of an \u201cexpenditure\u201d under that section because a \u201cpublic body,\u201d such as a school district, is not authorized to create a separate segregated fund under MCFA and, therefore, may not rely on the \u00a7 6(2)(c) exclusion from the definition of an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d Second, even if a \u201cpublic body\u201d is entitled to rely on this exclusion, the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not fall within the statutory exception because the school district\u2019s \u201cexpenditure\u201d cannot be characterized as \u201c[a]n expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee.\u201d As also previously discussed, the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction system is a prohibited \u201ccontribution.\u201d However, Justice HATHAWAY reasons that the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not constitute a \u201ccontribution.\u201d This latter aspect of her opinion warrants further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>(a) In circular fashion, Justice HATHAWAY would hold that the definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d encompasses the term \u201cexpenditure\u201d and, thus, because the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not constitute an \u201cexpenditure,\u201d it also cannot be a \u201ccontribution.\u201d Justice HATHAWAY then states that \u201c[t]he only other way that the administration of the system could be a \u2018contribution\u2019 under the MCFA would be if administering the system resulted in a \u2018transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value ....\u2019\u201d <em>Post </em>at 258. This assertion is erroneous. As discussed earlier, an \u201cin-kind contribution,\u201d which is a \u201ccontribution ... other than money,\u201d also constitutes a \u201ccontribution.\u201d MCL 169.209(3). Similarly, MCFA defines as a \u201ccontribution\u201d a \u201cpayment.\u201d MCL 169.204(1). The school district arguably makes a \u201cpayment\u201d to the MEA-PAC when it transfers money from participating MEA members to the MEA-PAC. Although in these circumstances the school district only acts as a conduit, a \u201ccontribution\u201d made at the direction of another person \u201cshall be regarded as an expenditure or contribution attributable to both persons for purposes of expenditure or contribution limits.\u201d MCL 169.270.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>(b) Justice HATHAWAY further errs, in our judgment, as did the former majority opinion, by concluding that her interpretation is necessary to avoid absurd results. In discussing whether the administration of the payroll deduction plan constitutes a \u201ctransfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value\u201d and thus a \u201ccontribution,\u201d Justice Hathaway states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-3\">There are two possible interpretations of the word \u201ctransfer\u201d in the statute. The first interpretation would require that any conveyance of value for services provided to a campaign, regardless of whether the services are paid for, would constitute a contribution. The second would require a net conveyance of value in order to be a \u201ctransfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value.\u201d I believe that the latter is the only logical interpretation. Any other interpretation of \u201ccontribution\u201d would lead to an absurd result, and statutes must be construed to prevent absurd results. For example, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, a print shop that sells signage to a campaign in the normal course of business would be making a contribution to the campaign because it has transferred something of monetary value to the campaign, even though the shop has been compensated for the cost of providing the signage. Such an interpretation of \u201ccontribution\u201d defies common sense, and I do not read the statute in this manner. <em>[Post </em>at 259-260 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">By emphasizing that her interpretation is necessary to avoid \u201cabsurd results,\u201d Justice HATHAWAY appears to concede that the more natural interpretation of the law is that asserted by this majority opinion. Resort to an \u201cabsurd results\u201d analysis is generally necessary only to avoid an interpretation that would otherwise flow from a statute by the application of traditional principles of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In essence, Justice HATHAWAY believes that it is necessary to read MCL 169.204(1) as if it referred to a <em>\u201cnet </em>transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>value,\u201d which it does not, in order to avoid the allegedly \u201cabsurd result\u201d to which our interpretation of MCL 169.204(1) would lead. What is this allegedly \u201cabsurd result\u201d? What is this result that is \u201cquite impossible that [the Legislature] could have intended\u201d? <em>Pub Citizen v United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>491 US 440, 471; 109 S Ct 2558; 105 L Ed 2d 377 (1989) (Kennedy, J, concurring). What is this result that is \u201cunthinkable\u201d or \u201cbizarre\u201d? <em>Green v Bock Laundry Machine Co, </em>490 US 504, 527; 109 S Ct 1981; 104 L Ed 2d 557 (1989) (Scalia, J, concurring). What is this result that \u201ccannot rationally . . . mean\u201d what it seems to mean? <em>Id. </em>at 528.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That .there be no exchanges of value between a \u201cpublic body\u201d and a partisan political action committee? That the government not further the partisan interests of a political action committee? That taxpayer resources not be employed to collect, and facilitate, partisan political contributions? While these results may be \u201cabsurd\u201d to the dissenting justices, we do not find them to be \u201cabsurd\u201d at all. Once again, the dissenting justices seem to equate an absurd result with a disagreeable result. <em>Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>476 Mich 55, 84-86; 718 NW2d 784 (2006) (Markman, J., concurring); <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 370; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (Markman, J., dissenting). Furthermore, the specific \u201cabsurd result\u201d alleged here by Justice HATHAWAY, that a print shop could not. sell signs to a campaign because this would constitute a \u201ccontribution,\u201d is itself absurd. A print shop is not a \u201cpublic body\u201d and therefore, unlike a school district, is not regulated by \u00a7 57 of MCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>(c) The former majority opinion also erred when it concluded that MCL 408.477 of the wages and fringe benefits act provides authority for the school district to administer the payroll deduction plan.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Mich Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>488 Mich at 38 n 29. \u201c[S]chool districts and school officers have only such powers as the statutes expressly or impliedly grant to them.\u201d <em>Jacox v Van Buren Consol Sch Dist Bd of Ed, </em>293 Mich 126, 128; 291 NW 247 (1940). \u201c \u2018The extent of the authority of the people\u2019s public agents is measured by the statute from which they derive their authority, not by their own acts and assumption of authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sittler v Mich College of Mining &amp; Technology Bd of Control, </em>333 Mich 681, 687; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>53 NW2d 681 (1952) (citation omitted). Contrary to the former majority opinion, the authority to administer a payroll deduction plan for a political action committee is not expressly or impliedly granted to schools by any statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">While MCL 408.477 of the wages and fringe benefits act refers to payroll deductions, it does not authorize school districts to administer payroll deductions <em>for political action committees. </em>MCL 408.477(1) provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">Except for those deductions required or expressly permitted by law or by a collective bargaining agreement, an employer shall not deduct from the wages of an employee, directly or indirectly, any amount including an employee contribution to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation or labor organization under section 55 of the Michigan campaign finance act, Act No. 388 of the Public Acts of 1976, being section 169.255 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, without the full, free, and written consent of the employee, obtained without intimidation or fear of discharge for refusal to permit the deduction.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">From this provision, the former majority opinion summarily concluded that, \u201cunder the plain language of MCL 408.477, public bodies have the authority to administer a payroll deduction plan that contributes money to the MEA-PAC if the MEA enters into a collective bargaining agreement that expressly permits the deductions.\u201d <em>Mich Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>488 Mich at 38 n 29. This is another example of the former majority opinion\u2019s misinterpretation of a statute. MCL 408.477 has absolutely nothing to do with whether a \u201cpublic body\u201d may administer a payroll deduction plan for the benefit of the MEA-PAC. Rather, the statute describes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>approval required for an employer to deduct a portion of an employee\u2019s wages and states that in order to deduct wages from an employee, the employer must obtain the employee\u2019s voluntary consent. The statute also provides that such consent is not required when the wage deduction is expressly permitted by law or by a collective-bargaining agreement. The most that can be discerned from this statute as it pertains to the instant case is that, if the school district is to deduct wages from its employees, it must obtain the employees\u2019 voluntary consent unless the deduction is expressly permitted by law or a collective-bargaining agreement. However, neither MCL 408.477 nor any other statute provides <em>authority </em>for a \u201cpublic body\u201d to administer a payroll deduction plan that contributes money to a <em>political action committee. </em>Therefore, even if the school district\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction plan did not constitute a \u201ccontribution\u201d or an \u201cexpenditure,\u201d which it clearly does, the school district would still lack the <em>authority </em>to administer such a plan because no statute gives the school district this authority and the school district only has the authority granted to it by statute. Indeed, as explained earlier, the Legislature has affirmatively and expressly forbidden a school district, or any other public body, from making a \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d to a political action committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">VI. JUSTIFICATION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The dissenting justices assert, explicitly or implicitly, that this opinion undoes their opinion of December 29, 2010, upon rehearing without offering any new justification for doing so other than the views expressed in the dissent from that opinion. See <em>post </em>at 251 (Hathaway, J., dissenting), and <em>post </em>at 236 n 1 (Cavanagh, J., dissent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ing). For the benefit of the dissenting justices, we will attempt to provide this justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">First, contrary to Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s assertion, we respectfully disagree that the previous majority opinion \u201cfollowed the language of the law.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 252. Indeed, we believe that opinion to have interpreted MCFA in a manner that bore little resemblance to its actual language. The previous majority opinion (a) effectively inserted words into the law that are absent from the law, e.g., construing the \u201ctransfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value\u201d to require that there be a \u201ctransfer of anything of <em>net </em>ascertainable monetary value,\u201d see <em>Mich Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>488 Mich at 36, (b) effectively altered words in the law, e.g., substituting for \u201cascertainable monetary value\u201d <em>\u201cascertained\u201d </em>monetary value, <em>id. </em>at 37, (c) applied the facts to the law in an implausible fashion, e.g., asserting that the administration of the payroll deduction plan was not done for the \u201c \u2018purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>quoting MCL 169.204(1), (d) mischaracterized the facts, e.g., asserting that the administration of the payroll deduction plan by the school constituted no \u201ctransfer of ascertainable monetary value\u201d to the MEA-PAC but \u201cmerely allow[ed] <em>someone else </em>to make a contribution,\u201d <em>Mich Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>488 Mich at 37, (e) failed to analyze relevant and determinative provisions of the law, e.g., the definition of an \u201cin-kind contribution,\u201d (f) paraphrased the law in an imprecise manner, e.g., summarizing an exception to the law\u2019s broad prohibition that is applicable to the administration of a separate segregated fund or independent committee as one applicable to the administration of contributions, <em>id. </em>at 29-30, and (g) overlooked words of the law, e.g., asserting that because the administration of the payroll deduction plan does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>not constitute an \u201cexpenditure,\u201d the \u201conly other way\u201d that it could constitute a \u201c \u2018contribution\u2019 \u201d would be if a \u201c \u2018transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value\u2019 \u201d resulted, <em>id. </em>at 34, quoting MCL 169.204(1), despite the fact that MCFA defines a \u201ccontribution\u201d in other ways to include \u201ca payment\u201d or an \u201cin-kind contribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Second, while the dissenting opinions make light of the fact that we supposedly have little justification for this new opinion other than the views expressed in the dissent from the original opinion, we believe that such a justification is actually rather compelling. That is, we believe that the previous dissent was in accordance with the language and intent of MCFA, while the previous majority opinion was not,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and as between an analysis of the law that is in accordance with its language and intent and one that is not, we prefer the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Third, we \u201cjustify\u201d granting the motion for rehearing, and reconsidering our previous decision, because we believe that the issue before the Court is one of considerable importance to the people of this state and to the integrity of the state\u2019s political and public processes. Through MCFA, the people have sought to maintain a separation of politics and the government in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>political activities. The previous majority opinion, and the present dissenting opinions, would dismantle this separation. They would increasingly involve the taxpayer in the subsidization of partisan political activities and increasingly erode the neutrality of public institutions in these same activities. While the dissenting justices seem very little moved by these concerns, we believe that they are substantial. It should be a matter of great pride to the people of Michigan that its history, with very few exceptions, has been a history characterized by electoral fair play and an honest political process. Both parties, and their supporters, can take credit for this history. We believe that the people of this state understand well the importance to this history of a legal system in which parties and political action committees cannot commandeer taxpayer resources and in which government cannot place a thumb on the scale concerning who will prevail in the political process. In short, we believe that the people understand well, for it is at the root of MCFA, that to breach these principles is incompatible with a government that is \u201cinstituted for ... [the] <em>equal </em>benefit.. . and protection\u201d of the people. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Finally, we believe that the former majority\u2019s remarkable treatment of this case itself constitutes grounds for granting rehearing. This case was alternately subject to unprecedentedly <em>dilatory </em>treatment and unprecedentedly <em>accelerated </em>treatment. See <em>Mich Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>488 Mich at 64-68 (Markman, J., dissenting). Before this case was heard in November of last year, it was subject to the lengthiest delay, by far, of any of the 280 cases considered under the procedures of MCR 7.302(H)(1), which authorize this Court to order oral argument before deciding whether to grant leave to appeal. See also footnote 4 of this opinion. Subsequently, after finally granting leave to appeal and hearing oral argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ments, a majority opinion was prepared in near-record time, the period for dissenting justices to respond to this opinion was substantially shortened, and, in December, these opinions issued in what approached, if not exceeded, record time for a major decision of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">MCL 169.257 prohibits a \u201cpublic body\u201d from using public resources to make a \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d for political purposes. Through administration of the payroll deduction plan in this case, remitting payments to the MEA-PAC, the school district makes both a \u201ccontribution\u201d and an \u201cexpenditure\u201d as defined by MCFA. The MEA-PAC\u2019s offer to reimburse the school district for expenses incurred in its administration of the plan does not remedy an otherwise clear violation of MCL 169.257. This interpretation is consistent not only with the language of the statute, but also with the evident purpose of MCL 169.257, which is to mandate the separation of the government from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political activities. The payroll deduction plan in this case is inconsistent with this legislative purpose and inconsistent with the language of the law.

As discussed, our position, limiting the \u00a7 6(2)(c) exclusion to \u00a7 55 entities, such as corporations and labor organizations, is a necessary and logical implication derived from MCFA. In discerning legislative intent, \u201c[t]he whole act provides [the] proper \u2018frame of reference,\u2019 \u201d and each section must be considered together with other sections. <em>Metro Council No 23, AFSCME v Oakland.

The exclusion of certain expenditures from the definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d in \u00a7 6(2)(c) invokes exactly the same operative language as \u00a7 55 and is plainly directed toward elaborating on \u00a7 55 by making clear that no expenditures authorized by \u00a7 55 for the establishment of a separate segregated fund will be treated as a prohibited expenditure by \u00a7 54. This does not render \u00a7 6(2)(e) \u201csuperfluous\u201d or \u201ccompletely unnecessary,\u201d as Justice Cavanagh claims. <em>Post </em>at 247. Rather, as already explained, \u00a7 (6)(2)(c) serves to underscore, and to make explicit, what is otherwise only implicit in \u00a7 55 \u2014 that \u201cexpenditures\u201d permitted by \u00a7 55 are not otherwise prohibited by \u00a7 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Furthermore, if \u00a7 (6)(2)(c) is interpreted to apply to public bodies, which are not authorized to establish separate segregated funds in the first place, the operative language of \u00a7 57, which prohibits the use of public resources to subsidize partisan political activities, would be rendered null and void. When a political action committee commandeers the resources of the government to raise political contributions for its own benefit, as occurred here, that conduct could always he categorized under Justice Cavanagh\u2019s interpretation as falling within the \u00a7 6(2)(c) exception and rendered permissible. Thus, the \u00a7 6(2) (c) exception would entirely consume the rule prohibiting public bodies from making \u201cexpenditures\u201d for political purposes, and the Legislature would effectively have taken with the right hand what it had just given with the left. Under such an interpretation, \u00a7 6(2) (c) would allow the Secretary of State\u2019s office, for example, to solicit contributions to a partisan or special interest political action committee with each driver\u2019s license renewal communication; it would allow Secretary of State employees to administer the political contributions received through this process; it would allow Secretary of State facilities and computers to he deployed to malee and print relevant informational pamphlets and political action committee materials; and it would allow the Secretary of State\u2019s office to attach the postage for these solicitations. This interpretation cannot conceivably he what the Legislature intended when it enacted MCFA. Reading MCFA in its entirety, and in context, it is clear that the Legislature intended the \u00a7 6(2)(c) exception to apply only to those entities that possess the authority to create, establish, administer, or fund separate segregated funds in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\"> Justice Cavanagh concludes that MCFA excepts from the definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d an \u201cexpenditure\u201d for the (a) establishment of contributions to a separate segregated fund, (b) administration of contributions to a separate segregated fund, and (c) solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund. Reading \u00a7 6(2) (c) in isolation could support his interpretation; however, reading MCFA in its entirety, in particular after due consideration of MCL 169.255(1), makes clear that the only reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 6(2) (c) is that it pertains to the \u201cestablishment\u201d or \u201cadministration\u201d of a \u201cseparate segregated fund\u201d and not the \u201cestablishment\u201d or \u201cadministration\u201d of \u201ccontributions.\u201d See <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (\u201cThe statutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that something different was intended.\u201d). His interpretation disregards the fact that this Court must consider \u00a7 6(2)(c) and \u00a7 55 together, \u201cso as to produce, if possible, an harmonious and consistent enactment\u201d of MCFA. <em>State Treasurer v Wilson, </em>423 Mich 138, 145; 377 NW2d 703 (1985).

And \u00a7 6(2)(c), which uses nearly identical language, must be interpreted the same way, \u201cso as to produce... an harmonious and consistent enactment\u201d of MCFA. <em>Wilson, </em>423 Mich at 145.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> Justice Hathaway asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">This argument is unfounded and contrary to the plain language of the statute.

If the school district has provided a service \u201cat cost\u201d to the MEA-PAC, even though the \u201cascertainable monetary <em>value\u201d </em>of that service to the MEA-PAC exceeds that cost, as it almost always will in an economy in which service providers typically seek to profit from their services, further inquiry would he necessary concerning the specific terms of the school district-political action committee transaction, even if such a transaction were permissible in the first place under \u00a7 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b435-4\"> If the MEA-PAC is allowed to commandeer the resources of a \u201cpublic body\u201d simply by reimbursing its costs, there is nothing that would prevent the political action committee of any corporation from demanding or receiving the same treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b436-4\"> The MEA also argues with regard to reimbursements that because the school district is reimbursed all costs and expenses, its administration of the deduction plan does not amount to a \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d given that a \u201ccontribution\u201d does not encompass \u201c[a]n offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and unconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within 30 business days after receipt,\u201d MCL 169.204(3)(c), and an \u201cexpenditure\u201d does not include \u201c[a]n offer or tender of an expenditure if expressly and unconditionally rejected or returned,\u201d MCL 169.206(2)(e). However, this argument clearly lacks merit because the MEA-PAC\u2019s offer to <em>reimburse expenses </em>can hardly be said to constitute a \u201crejection, return, or refund\u201d of a \u201ccontribution\u201d or an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d When the school district collects and remits payments from MEA members to the MEA-PAC, it makes an \u201coffer or tender\u201d of a \u201ccontribution or expenditure.\u201d To qualify for the \u201coffer or tender\u201d exception, the MEA-PAC would have to unconditionally \u201creject or return\u201d the services of the school district, something that it neither does nor has any intention of doing. Because the school district\u2019s services are unconditionally accepted by the MEA-PAC, the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not excluded from the definition of a \u201ccontribution\u201d or an \u201cexpenditure\u201d under either section of MCFA. Finally, the obvious should be observed, <em>to wit, </em>although the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>excluded from the definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d \u201can offer or tender\u201d of a \u201ccontribution or expenditure\u201d that has been rejected, returned, or refunded, there is no similar exclusion for \u201creimbursements,\u201d an exclusion that should he thought to have been obvious, if genuinely intended. Justice Hathaway nonetheless intuits from the \u201creject or return\u201d exception that \u201ccontribution\u201d in MCL 169.204(1) \u201cclearly requires ... a net transfer of value ... <em>Post </em>at 260-261.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b438-5\"> Justice Cavanagh asserts that MCL 169.270 does not apply in this case \u201cbecause an MEA member is not seeking to circumvent the MCFA\u2019s contribution limits,\u201d <em>post </em>at 243. However, MCL 169.270 contains no subjective component.

I write separately to emphasize, once again, that granting a rehearing motion is not limited to cases in which new legal arguments were presented to the Court and to clarify that this is not a case in which it can fairly be said that \u201cprecedent\u201d has been disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">As Justice ZAHRA recently explained in detail in <em>Anglers of the AuSable, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Environmental Quality,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>MCR 7.313(E) governs motions for rehearing in this Court. It is a discretionary rule because it does not contain a standard governing when we should grant a motion for rehearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The rule does not limit our discretion to grant rehearing to only those cases in which a party has presented new legal arguments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The rule\u2019s lack of any language limiting our discretion supports the principle that, in addressing a motion for rehearing, it is appropriate for each justice to individually determine whether this Court properly interpreted and applied the law in the case before the Court for rehearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As Justice ZAHRA observed in <em>Anglers, </em>other members of this Court have voted to grant rehearing and overturn precedent, applying this principle, albeit without explicit recognition of the discretion afforded by the rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">I also share the view articulated by Justice Zahra in <em>Anglers </em>that in addition to considering whether the matter was previously decided correctly under the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>erning legal principles, the jurisprudential significance of the legal issues presented should also be considered when deciding a motion for rehearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is only with careful review of this Court\u2019s prior rulings that I approach a decision on a motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">In this case I agree, first, with the legal analysis of the provisions of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at issue set forth in Justice MARKMAN\u2019s opinion. The public school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan is both a \u201ccontribution\u201d and an \u201cexpenditure\u201d for political purposes under the MCFA, which violates MCL 169.257(1). Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s position that \u201cnothing in the plain language of MCL 169.257(1) prohibits a school district from administering a payroll deduction system that allows [MEA] members to automatically send contributions to the . .. MEA-PAC\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> misconstrues the MCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Second, this case plainly involves issues of substantial jurisprudential importance to our state. This case concerns \u201cthe separation of the government from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from . . . subsidizing] partisan political activities.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The legality of the administration of the payroll deduction plan is of considerable public interest given that the plan would have essentially allowed taxpayers to help fund a political action committee. Moreover, the case involved an issue of first impression that is not likely to reappear before the Court on a regular basis. Through the MCFA, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Legislature intended to keep public resources out of the political process, and the statute could not make this plainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Notably, the grant of the rehearing motion, which was timely filed, asked the Court to rehear a case that was decided several days before I was sworn in and after the case had pended for more than two years in our Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To the extent that this case may be deemed to be precedent, its precedential value is <em>de minimis, </em>at best. As noted by Justice MARILYN KELLY in <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>\u201c[s]tare decisis attempts to balance two competing considerations: the need of the community for stability in legal rules and decisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Robinson v Detroit,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court set forth four factors to be considered before this Court overrules a previously decided case. The purpose of enunciating these factors was to ensure that respectful consideration would be given to the cases decided by our predecessors before such cases are overruled. \u201cThe first question, of course, should be whether the earlier decision was wrongly decided.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consistently with Justice MARILYN KELLY\u2019s explanation in <em>Petersen</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of the competing considerations that the doctrine of stare decisis attempts to reconcile, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>remaining three factors balance the need to correct error against the desire for stability and reliability in the law. Specifically, the Court observed that it should also review \u201cwhether the decision at issue defies \u2018practical workability,\u2019 whether reliance interests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in the law or facts no longer justify the questioned decision.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When a case is considered on rehearing, none of the <em>Robinson </em>factors outweighs the need to issue a legally correct opinion. No reasonable legal reliance can be placed on an opinion that has not yet ended its procedural course, however extended, in our Court. The opinion at issue was only days old when the composition of the Court changed. The rehearing motion, timely filed, necessarily required adjudication by the newly composed Court. As a justice of the Court who had not before considered the merits of the underlying claim, it is my constitutional duty to address the legal merits of the issues presented. Simply put, I would be derelict in my duty if I were to give deference to legal reasoning with which I find fault. On rehearing, this case rises or falls on the merits of the legal claim. Blind allegiance to the notion of stare decisis is not appropriate and is a wholly unpersuasive rationale for allowing a days-old decision to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\">In sum, rehearing was warranted in this case because, in my view, the MCFA plainly requires holding that the public school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan is both an \u201cexpenditure\u201d and a \u201ccontribution\u201d that violates the act and the issue was both properly before the Court for rehearing and a matter of substantial jurisprudential significance to our state.</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Zahra, J., concurred with Mary Beth Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\"> <em>Anglers of the AuSable, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Environmental Quality, </em>489 Mich 884, 885 (2011) (Zahra, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 885-886.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 887.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\"> See <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 888, citing <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co v Mich Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n (On Rehearing), </em>484 Mich 1; 795 NW2d 101 (2010); <em>Duncan v Michigan, </em>488 Mich 957 (2010) (Davis, J., concurring); <em>McCready v Hoffius, </em>459 Mich 1235 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b449-5\"> See <em>Anglers, </em>489 Mich at 889.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\"> MCL 169.201 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> <em>Post </em>at 251.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 231.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b450-5\"> The Court of Appeals issued its opinion in this case on August 28, 2008.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The proper interpretation of a statute is a legal question that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Herman v Berrien Co, </em>481 Mich 352, 358; 750 NW2d 570 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The MCFA\u2019s general rule regarding prohibited \u201ccontributions\u201d and \u201cexpenditures\u201d is provided in MCL 169.254(1), which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">Except with respect to the exceptions and conditions in ... [MCL 169.255], and to loans made in the ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>course of business, a corporation, joint stock company, domestic dependent sovereign, or labor organization shall not make a contribution or expenditure ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">Thus, according to the plain language of MCL 169.254(1), MCL 169.255 is an exception to the general rule in MCL 169.254(1). That exception states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\">A corporation organized on a for profit or nonprofit basis, a joint stock company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization formed under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes. A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate committees, ballot question committees, political party committees, political committees, and independent committees. [MCL 169.255(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Finally, MCL 169.257(1) specifically addresses how the MCFA applies to \u201cpublic bodies,\u201d which includes school districts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Thus, under MCL 169.254(1) and MCL 169.257(1), private entities and \u201cpublic bodies\u201d are barred from making \u201ccontributions\u201d and \u201cexpenditures\u201d unless an exception applies. The MCFA provides detailed definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d; therefore, in order to properly apply the relevant portions of the MCFA to the facts of this case, it is necessary to closely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>consider those statutory definitions to fully understand what constitutes a prohibited \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d as defined in the MCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">A. \u201cCONTRIBUTION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The MCFA defines \u201ccontribution\u201d in MCL 169.204(1), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201cContribution\u201d means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment, expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance, loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">This statutory definition can be divided into two portions: (1) a list of actions that could constitute a \u201ccontribution,\u201d i.e., \u201ca payment, gift, subscription, assessment, expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance, loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person,\u201d and (2) the purpose for which the actions must be taken in order to constitute a \u201ccontribution,\u201d i.e., \u201cfor the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\u201d Stated another way, the statutory definition requires a court to determine (1) whether a party\u2019s conduct falls within the list of actions provided and, if so, (2) the purpose for that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>As the majority insists, the list of actions provided in the first portion of the definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d arguably could include the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan. But even accepting arguendo the majority\u2019s conclusion that the administration of the plan represents \u201ca transfer of [something] of ascertainable monetary value\u201d to the MEA\u2019s political action committee (MEA-PAC), the question remains whether the school district administers the plan \u201cfor the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">As the previous majority opinion in this case explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">a public school\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction system is not an impermissible contribution under the MCFA because the system is not administered \u201cfor the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\u201d When a public body administers a payroll deduction plan, it does not do so in an attempt to influence a political race or a ballot question. Rather, administering the plan is one step removed: it merely allows <em>someone else </em>to make a contribution for the purpose of influencing a political issue. The public body administers the plan simply because it is required to do so as part of a labor contract between the public body and its employees. Consequently, because a public school\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction system is not done for the purpose of influencing a political issue, the administration of the system is not a contribution under the MCFA. <em>[Mich Ed Ass\u2019n v Secretary of State, </em>488 Mich at 37-38 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The majority attempts to counter the previous majority\u2019s explanation of the plain meaning of the MCFA\u2019s definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d by first claiming that the school district makes a \u201ccontribution\u201d because, by administering the payroll deduction plan, it \u201cprovid[es] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>valuable services to the MEA-PAC in aid and furtherance of its political activities.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 209 n 12. This analysis, however, impermissibly strays from the statutory language because it focuses on the arguable <em>result </em>of the school district\u2019s administration of the plan rather than the school district\u2019s <em>purpose </em>in administering the plan, as the statute requires. The fact that, at some remote time in the future, the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan eventually <em>results </em>in the furtherance of the MEA\u2019s political activities does not necessarily make the school district\u2019s actions a \u201ccontribution\u201d as defined in MCL 169.204(1). Rather, the administration of the payroll deduction plan is only a \u201ccontribution\u201d if, at the time the school district performs the service, it does so \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of influencing an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Second, the majority argues that, in considering the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan under MCL 169.204(1), the focus should not be on whether the school district is attempting to influence a political race, but whether the payment that it provides is intended for that purpose. While the majority is correct to focus on the \u201cpayment,\u201d the majority confuses the two payments at issue in this case: the MEA member\u2019s \u201cpayment\u201d in the form of money deducted from his or her paycheck and the school district\u2019s arguable \u201cpayment\u201d in the form of administering the payroll deduction plan that transfers the employee\u2019s donation to the MEA-PAC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the employee\u2019s dona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tion to the MEA-PAC is likely a \u201ccontribution\u201d because it is made \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of influencing a political race, the majority erroneously imputes the employee\u2019s purpose in making the contribution to the school district. It is not the purpose behind the employee\u2019s donation that is the focus of the relevant inquiry; rather, it is the purpose behind the school district\u2019s decision to administer the payroll deduction plan, which merely transfers donations from the employee to the MEA-PAC, that must be considered. Similarly, the majority erroneously imputes <em>the MEA\u2019s </em>purpose in collecting contributions to the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan. See <em>ante </em>at 208 (claiming that the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan is a \u201ccontribution\u201d because \u201cthe purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in partisan politics\u201d). What the majority fails to grasp is that, when properly applied to this case, MCL 169.204(1) is focused solely on <em>the school district\u2019s </em>purpose in acting in a specific fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In order to determine the school district\u2019s \u201cpurpose,\u201d one must first define the word and then apply that definition to the facts of this case. The MCFA does not define \u201cpurpose\u201d; therefore, it is proper to consult a dictionary to assist the Court in determining the word\u2019s common meaning. <em>McCormick v Carrier, </em>487 Mich 180, 195; 795 NW2d 517 (2010); see, also, MCL 8.3a. \u201cPurpose\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] result or effect that is <em>intended </em>or desired; <em>intention.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982), def 2 (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>added). Thus, in order to determine the school district\u2019s purpose for administering the payroll deduction plan, one must consider the school district\u2019s <em>intent. </em>\u201cIntent,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201c[t]he state of mind operative at the time of an action\u201d and \u201c[hjaving the mind fastened upon some purpose.\u201d <em>Id., </em>defs 2 and 3. Similarly, \u201cintention\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] plan of action; design\u201d and \u201c[a]n aim that guides action ....\u201d <em>Id., </em>defs 1 and 2. In light of these definitions, in order to determine the school district\u2019s purpose as it relates to the statutory definition of \u201ccontribution,\u201d one must determine the school district\u2019s \u201caim that guides [its] action\u201d and the \u201cstate of mind operative\u201d when the school district administers the payroll deduction plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">As the majority notes, the school district and the MEA entered into a collective-bargaining agreement, part of which required the school district to administer the payroll deduction plan at issue in this case. Because the school district is required by contract to administer the payroll deduction plan, the school district\u2019s purpose in administering the plan is to satisfy its bargained-for contractual duties. The school district\u2019s purpose was <em>not </em>to \u201cinfluencie] the nomination or election of a candidate\u201d or \u201cthe qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\u201d MCL 169.204(1). Therefore, although the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan may, in some tangential or remote sense, eventually influence an election, that was not the school district\u2019s purpose. Consequently, the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not a \u201ccontribution\u201d as defined by the MCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The majority also attempts to support its \u201ccontribution\u201d analysis with a quotation from MCL 169.270.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 222. But, in my view, that statute is intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>prevent an entity from circumventing the contribution limits in MCL 169.252 and MCL 169.252a by transferring money to other entities and then directing those entities to make \u201ccontributions\u201d or directing another entity to use its own resources to make a \u201ccontribution.\u201d Indeed, the statute expressly states that it applies \u201cfor purposes of expenditure and contribution limits.\u201d MCL 169.270. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation, the statute is focused on enforcing contribution limits, not determining whether a particular act is a \u201ccontribution\u201d or \u201cexpenditure\u201d as defined in MCL 169.204 and MCL 169.206. Notably, because an MEA member is not seeking to circumvent the MCFA\u2019s contribution limits by making a contribution through the payroll deduction plan, MCL 169.270 is not applicable to the school district in this case. The MEA member does not \u201ccontrol\u201d a \u201ccontribution\u201d made by the school district or \u201cdirect\u201d the school district to make a contribution from the school district\u2019s own funds. Rather, the MEA member makes a contribution out of his or her own funds, and the school district merely transfers those funds. Throughout the entire transaction, the contribution is always attributable to the MEA member.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">Furthermore, by claiming that the school district exceeds its inferential contribution limit of zero when it administers the payroll deduction plan, the majority once again improperly imputes to the school district the MEA member\u2019s purpose for making the contribution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>As this opinion explains, an act is not a \u201ccontribution\u201d as defined in MCL 169.204(1) unless the act is performed for the specific purpose of \u201cinfluencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\u201d Because the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not performed for that purpose, the school district does not make a \u201ccontribution\u201d and, thus, does not exceed any arguably applicable contribution limit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Finally, the majority questions the school district\u2019s authority to administer the payroll deduction plan at issue in this case. However, this concern is misplaced because school districts, by statute, have the authority to enter into collective-bargaining agreements, MCL 423.209,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and school districts may administer a payroll deduction plan as part of a collective-bargaining agreement pursuant to the wages and fringe benefits act, specifically MCL 408.477(1). Thus, in the abstract, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>majority\u2019s argument that the wages and fringe benefits act does not directly grant school districts the authority to administer a payroll deduction plan is correct, but the majority errs when it concludes that the wages and fringe benefits act is irrelevant to this case. Rather, when that act is considered in tandem with MCL 423.209, the statutes \u201cexpressly or impliedly grant\u201d school districts the authority to enter collective-bargaining agreements that require a school district to administer a payroll deduction plan. <em>Jacox v Van Buren Consol Sch Dist Bd of Ed, </em>293 Mich 126, 128; 291 NW 247 (1940). Because the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan is neither a \u201ccontribution\u201d nor an \u201cexpenditure\u201d for the reasons discussed in this dissent, administration of the plan does not violate MCL 169.257 and, thus, is lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\">B. \u201cEXPENDITURE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Although the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not a prohibited \u201ccontribution,\u201d it could nevertheless be barred under MCL 169.257 if it meets the statutory definition of \u201cexpenditure.\u201d Therefore, that definition must also be examined in the context of this case. The MCFA defines \u201cexpenditure\u201d in MCL 169.206(1), which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201cExpenditure\u201d means a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. Expenditure includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">(a) A contribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>nation or election of a candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The MCFA, however, also expressly excludes some conduct that would otherwise meet its general definition of \u201cexpenditure.\u201d Notably, MCL 169.206(2) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">Expenditure does not include any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">(c) An expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The majority argues that the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan is barred by the MCFA because it is an \u201cexpenditure\u201d under the general definition in MCL 169.206(1) and the exclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) does not apply to public bodies. The majority concludes that the \u201cexclusion is clearly designed to apply only to corporations and labor organizations that possess the authority to create, establish, administer, or fund separate segregated funds in the first place.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 211. Furthermore, the majority claims that MCL 169.257 and MCL 169.254 apply to public bodies and private entities respectively the same general rule barring \u201cexpenditures,\u201d but, because MCL 169.257 does not refer to the exception in MCL 169.255 permitting some types of \u201cexpenditures,\u201d MCL 169.257 represents an \u201cabsolute prohibition\u201d against expenditures by public bodies. I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">To begin with, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, neither the general definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d in MCL 169.206(1) nor the exclusion from the general definition in MCL 169.206(2)(c) indicates that the exclusion only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>applies to private entities. Thus, there is simply no basis in the statutory language to support the majority\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">Likewise, nothing in MCL 169.257 supports the majority\u2019s conclusion that the exclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) from the definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d does not apply to public bodies. While the majority is correct that the exceptions in MCL 169.255 do not apply to public bodies, that fact does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion that the exclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) also does not apply with equal force to public bodies. In fact, the majority\u2019s claim that this exclusion is \u201cplainly directed toward elaborating on [MCL 169.255] by making clear that no expenditures authorized by [MCL 169.255] for the establishment of a separate segregated fund will be treated as a prohibited expenditure,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 212 n 13, leaves no distinction between the two statutes. Therefore, if the majority were correct that MCL 169.206(2)(c) does not apply to public bodies, MCL 169.206(2) (c) would be completely unnecessary because, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, it says the exact same thing as MCL 169.255. The majority\u2019s efforts to read these two statutes \u201charmonious [ly]\u201d are strained and render MCL 169.206(2) (c) superfluous. I decline to adopt such an interpretation because the result is impermissible under the rules of statutory interpretation. <em>People v McGraw, </em>484 Mich 120, 126; 771 NW2d 655 (2009) (\u201cIn interpreting a statute, we avoid a construction that would render part of the statute surplusage or nugatory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Rather, I believe that MCL 169.257 explains that public bodies are not to make \u201cexpenditures\u201d as defined in MCL 169.206(1), but if the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan satisfies the exclusion from the definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d found in MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>169.206(2)(c), administration of the plan is not an \u201cexpenditure\u201d and the plan does not violate MCL 169.257. Thus, in a sense, the majority is correct that MCL 169.257 creates an \u201cabsolute prohibition\u201d against expenditures by public bodies, but the majority misses the boat when it concludes that this \u201cabsolute prohibition\u201d bars the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan at issue in this case. Because the school district\u2019s administration of the plan is excluded from the definition of \u201cexpenditure,\u201d there is simply no \u201cexpenditure\u201d to prohibit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The majority\u2019s erroneous analysis further results from its insistence that the exclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) only applies to expenditures for the establishment or administration <em>of a separate segregated fund. </em>This interpretation of MCL 169.206(2)(c) is misguided because the statutory exclusion focuses on expenditures associated with <em>contributions </em>to a separate segregated fund, not expenditures associated with the <em>creation </em>or <em>management </em>of a separate segregated fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Specifically, MCL 169.206(2)(c) provides that an \u201cexpenditure\u201d does not include \u201c[a]n expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation <em>of contributions to a separate segregated fund </em>. . ..\u201d The majority errs because it replaces \u201cto\u201d with \u201cof\u201d and ignores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the word \u201ccontributions\u201d when considering \u201cestablishment\u201d and \u201cadministration\u201d as used in MCL 169.206(2)(c). Stated another way, the majority\u2019s analysis rewrites the statute as follows: \u201c \u2018[e]xpenditure\u2019 does not include . . . [a]n expenditure for the establishment <em>or </em>administration <em>of a separate segregated fund </em>or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund . . . Therefore, the majority\u2019s interpretation impermissibly adds words to the statute. See <em>Hiltz v Phil\u2019s Quality Market, </em>417 Mich 335, 347; 337 NW2d 237 (1983). Indeed, the majority opinion expressly states that \u201cthe school district is not making an \u2018expenditure\u2019 for the administration <em>of a separate segregated fund . . . </em>because . .. the school district is simply administering the payroll deduction plan . .. .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 215 (emphasis altered); see, also, <em>ante </em>at 216 (claiming that MCL 169.206[2][c] supports the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe only administrative costs that are excluded under this exclusion are those associated with administering a \u2018separate segregated fund or independent committee\u2019 \u201d). By its own words, the majority displays its need to impermissibly change the language of the statute in order to support its holding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\">Thus, although I agree with the majority that the school district is not making an \u201cexpenditure\u201d for the administration of a separate segregated fund, that point is irrelevant because that is not what the statutory exclusion requires. Rather, by administering <em>contributions to </em>a separate segregated fund, the school district\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>conduct falls squarely within the statutory exclusion from the general definition of \u201cexpenditure.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">C. PURPOSE OF MCL 169.257</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Finally, the majority supports its interpretation of the MCFA by claiming that the purpose of MCL 169.257 \u201cis to mandate the separation of the government from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political activities,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 202-203, and that only its analysis is consistent with that purpose. To begin with, the majority\u2019s soaring rhetoric could easily be classified as nothing more than an impassioned plea in support of the policy that the majority wishes to impose, see, e.g., <em>ante </em>at 229-230, but more importantly, the majority goes well beyond the statutory language in a misguided effort to determine this provision\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Focusing instead on the statutory language alone, it is clear that the purpose of MCL 169.257 is simply to prevent a public body from using its resources \u201cto make a contribution or expenditure\u201d as those words are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>defined in MCL 169.204 and MCL 169.206, respectively. The majority fails to realize that my interpretation of the MCFA is consistent with the true purpose of MCL 169.257 as determined from the language of that provision because the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan at issue in this case is neither a \u201ccontribution\u201d nor an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\">HI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In my view, the school district\u2019s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not violate the MCFA because it is neither a \u201ccontribution\u201d nor an \u201cexpenditure\u201d under the statutory definitions of those terms.

To interpret the MCFA, we must follow the established rules of statutory construction. \u201cAssuming that the Legislature has acted within its constitutional authority, the purpose of statutory construction is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, a Court must interpret the language of a statute in a manner that is consistent with the legislative intent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In determining the legislative intent, the actual language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>of the statute must first be examined.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cAs far as possible, effect should be given to every phrase, clause, and word in the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When considering the correct interpretation, a statute must be read as a whole.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Individual words and phrases, while important, should he read in the context of the entire legislative scheme.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In defining particular words within a statute, a court \u201cmust \u2018consider both the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as \u201cits placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When a statute explicitly defines a term, the statutory definition controls.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AuT\">Section 57 of the MCFA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-3\">A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or other public resources <em>to make a contribution or expenditure or provide volunteer personal services </em>that are excluded from the definition of contribution under [MCL 169.204(3)(a)]. [MCL 169.257(1) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The clear language of \u00a7 57(1) specifically prohibits a public body from using, or authorizing the use of, public resources to do three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a contribution, or (3) provide volunteer services that are excluded from the definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d under MCL 169.204(3)(a). The plain language of the statute does not prohibit any other activity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Therefore, if the administration of the payroll deduction system is not tantamount to doing one of these three things, the administration of the system is permissible under Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">A. EXPENDITURE</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The first issue is whether a public school\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction system that remits funds to the MEA-PAC is an impermissible \u201cexpenditure\u201d under \u00a7 57. \u201cExpenditure\u201d is specifically defined in the MCFA. The definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d is set forth in MCL 169.206, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">(1) \u201cExpenditure\u201d means a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. Expenditure includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">(a) A contribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">(2) <em>Expenditure does not include any of the following:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">(a) An expenditure for communication by a person with the person\u2019s paid members or shareholders and those individuals who can be solicited for contributions to a separate segregated fund under [MCL 169.255].</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">(c) <em>An expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee. </em>[MCL 169.206 (emphasis added).]</p>\n<p id=\"b471-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d is expansive. It includes a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The definition also includes a contribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. However, MCL 169.206(2) also expressly excludes items from being classified as expenditures even though they may qualify under the general definition outlined in MCL 169.206(1). Notably, any \u201cexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to <em>a separate segregated fund or independent committee\u201d </em>is specifically <em>excluded </em>from the definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d by MCL 169.206(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">Turning to the facts of this case, the administration of a payroll deduction system does arguably provide services to the MEA and the MEA-PAC in facilitating payroll deductions from members by providing personnel and computer services. The system allows MEA members to authorize the school to automatically deduct money from their paychecks and remit the funds to the MEA-PAC. The MEA-PAC is a separate segregated fund under MCL 169.255 because it has been established by the MEA, a labor organization, to make contributions to and expenditures on behalf of candidate committees, ballot question committees, political party committees, political committees, and independent committees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the payroll deduction system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>administers member contributions to a separate segregated fund. Although this process falls within the general definition of \u201cexpenditure\u201d under MCL 169.206(1), the administration of such a system is explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under MCL 169.206(2)(c), which provides that an \u201cexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee\u201d is not an \u201cexpenditure.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A public school\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction system falls squarely within the statutory exception. The system is set up to facilitate MEA member contributions to their separate segregated fund, the MEA-PAC. Therefore, the administration of the system is <em>not </em>an expenditure under the MCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The majority erroneously asserts that the school district\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction system is not an \u201cadministration... of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> because the district is not administering a fund; rather, the district is only administering the payroll deduction system that remits funds to the MEA-PAC. This argument is unfounded and contrary to the plain language of the statute. The plain language of the statute applies to the administration of <em>contributions </em>to a separate segregated fund; the statute does not specify who has to make the contributions. The MEA members\u2019 contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>tions to the MEA-PAC are administered through the payroll deduction system. Thus, the district, by administering the payroll deduction system, is administering contributions to the MEA-PAC, an action that is explicitly allowed according to the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">In sum, administration of a payroll deduction system is an \u201cexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee\u201d and thus falls within an enumerated exception to the statutory definition of \u201cexpenditure.\u201d Therefore, the administration of the payroll deduction system is not an \u201cexpenditure\u201d as defined by the MCFA and is not prohibited by \u00a7 57 on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">B. CONTRIBUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The next issue is whether administration of the payroll deduction system is an impermissible \u201ccontribution\u201d under the MCFA. \u201cContribution,\u201d like \u201cexpenditure,\u201d is specifically defined by the MCFA. The definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d under the MCFA is set forth in MCL 169.204, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">(1) \u201cContribution\u201d means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment, <em>expenditure, </em>contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance, loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, <em>or a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value </em>to a person, <em>made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">(2) Contribution includes the <em>full purchase price </em>of tickets or payment of an attendance fee for events such as dinners, luncheons, rallies, testimonials, and other fund-raising events; an individual\u2019s own money or property other than the individual\u2019s homestead used on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>that individual\u2019s candidacy; the granting of discounts or rebates not available to the general public; or the granting of discounts or rebates by broadcast media and newspapers not extended on an equal basis to all candidates for the same office; and the endorsing or guaranteeing of a loan for the amount the endorser or guarantor is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">(3) <em>Contribution does not include any of the following-.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">(a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or indirectly, repaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">(b) Food and beverages, not to exceed $100.00 in value during a calendar year, which are donated by an individual and for which reimbursement is not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">(c) <em>An offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and unconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within 30 business days after receipt. </em>[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">The definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d includes the term \u201cexpenditure.\u201d Because \u201cexpenditure\u201d is explicitly defined by the MCFA, the statutory definition controls.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As explained earlier, the administration of a payroll deduction system is not an \u201cexpenditure\u201d under the MCFA and thus cannot be a contribution on that basis. The only other way that the administration of the system could be a \u201ccontribution\u201d under the MCFA would be if administering the system resulted in a \u201ctransfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value... made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">The majority argues that the actual and intangible costs associated with the administration of a payroll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>deduction system constitute a contribution because there is a transfer of something of ascertainable monetary value from the school district to the MEA-PAC and the transfer, although made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, is made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The majority asserts that the resources expended to administer the payroll deduction system have an ascertainable monetary value, and the fact that they are expended for the benefit of the MEA-PAC conveys value to the MEA-PAC. The majority further argues that prepayment for the services does not negate the transfer because MEA-PAC still receives the benefit of the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">I disagree with this interpretation of the word \u201ctransfer\u201d in the statute. Because \u201ctransfer\u201d is a nontechnical word that is not defined within the statute, the proper course of action is to first look to the plain meaning of the term to ascertain what the Legislature intended by using \u201ctransfer\u201d to define a \u201ccontribution.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cTransfer\u201d is defined as \u201cto convey or remove from one place, person, etc., to another.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In order for there to be a contribution, \u201canything of ascertainable monetary value\u201d must be conveyed from one entity to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">There are two possible interpretations of the word \u201ctransfer\u201d in the statute. The first interpretation would require that any conveyance of value for services provided to a campaign, regardless of whether the services are paid for, would constitute a contribution. The second would require a net conveyance of value in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>be a \u201ctransfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value.\u201d I believe that the latter is the only logical interpretation. Any other interpretation of \u201ccontribution\u201d would lead to an absurd result, and statutes must be construed to prevent absurd results.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For example, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, a print shop that sells signage to a campaign in the normal course of business would be making a contribution to the campaign because it has transferred something of monetary value to the campaign, even though the shop has been compensated for the cost of providing the signage. Such an interpretation of \u201ccontribution\u201d defies common sense, and I do not read the statute in this manner. Instead, I conclude that the statute requires a net conveyance of \u201canything of monetary value\u201d in order for there to be a campaign contribution. If costs for administering the payroll deduction system are paid in advance, there is no net conveyance of anything of monetary value, and there is no contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Furthermore, my conclusion that a \u201ccontribution\u201d under MCL 169.204(1) requires a net transfer of value comports with the remainder of that section, which specifically <em>excludes </em>from the statutory definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d any \u201ccontribution if expressly and unconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within 30 business days after receipt.\u201d MCL 169.204(3)(c). In other words, if the contribution is rejected, returned, or refunded, it is no longer a \u201ccontribution\u201d under the MCFA. Moreover, MCL 169.204(2) explains that a \u201ccontribution\u201d includes \u201cthe granting of discounts or rebates not available to the general public... .\u201d This implies that when an entity provides products or services at full price, the entity is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>making a contribution. Thus, the statute clearly requires that there be a net transfer of value in order for there to be a contribution under the MCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">The majority erroneously asserts that the payroll deduction system constitutes something of \u201cascertainable monetary value\u201d because there is inherent value to the MEA-PAC in having payroll deductions automatically taken from members\u2019 wages as opposed to requiring individual solicitations by the MEA-PAC. This argument ignores the plain definition of the term \u201cascertainable.\u201d \u201cAscertainable\u201d is also a nontechnical word that is not defined within the statute, so we must look to the ordinary meaning of the word to discern what the Legislature intended. \u201cAscertain\u201d is defined as \u201cto find out definitely; learn with certainty or assurance.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the phrase \u201cascertainable monetary value\u201d in the statute requires that the monetary value conferred be determined definitely, with certainty and assurance. The majority hypothetically opines that the intangible benefits the union receives because of the payroll deduction system confers something of ascertainable monetary value. The majority reasons that ascertainable monetary value is self-evident from the fact that the defendant has bargained for the payroll deduction system in its contract with the school district and has appealed the right to enforce the provision in this Court. However, these actions do not definitely identify with certainty the amount of monetary value that the payroll deduction system confers to the MEA. Therefore, according to the terms of the statute, the intangible benefits conferred to the MEA by the administration of a payroll deduction system do not constitute a \u201ccontribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>In this instance, the MEA plans to prepay the school district for all ascertainable costs \u2014 those which are definitely and certainly identified \u2014 associated with the administration of a payroll deduction system, and in fact asked the Secretary of State for a declaratory ruling regarding the costs to be prepaid. Thus, the administration of the payroll deduction system will not result in a net transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value as all costs will be ascertained and prepaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The majority also erroneously asserts that the payroll deduction system constitutes an \u201cin-kind contribution\u201d under MCL 169.209(3) as a \u201ccontribution. . . other than money.\u201d Again, the majority identifies the hypothetical intangible benefits that the administration of a payroll deduction system confers on the MEA as the impermissible contributions J However, this argument ignores that an in-kind contribution must still be a \u201ccontribution\u201d as defined by the statute. The hypothetical intangible benefits are not contributions because, as discussed, they do not have an ascertainable monetary value. The MEA contemplates prepaying all costs associated with the administration of the deduction system that can be ascertained. Accordingly, there is no contribution under the MCFA, and a public school\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction system is not prohibited by \u00a7 57 on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">C. VOLUNTEER PERSONAL SERVICES</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The final issue is whether the administration of the system in question impermissibly \u201cprovide[s] volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under section 4(3)(a)\u201d of the MCFA. As noted earlier, \u00a7 4(3) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Contribution does not include any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>(a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or indirectly, repaid. [MCL 169.204(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-3\">Although such services are thus not considered a contribution for purposes of the rest of the MCFA, \u00a7 57 specifically indicates that public bodies cannot use public resources to provide volunteer services that are not compensated. However, the administration of the payroll deduction system at issue does not involve volunteer services by public employees because the MEA intends to prepay for all services rendered. Because volunteer services are not defined by the statute, again the proper course of action is to look to the plain meaning of the terms to discern the legislative intent. \u201cVolunteer\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who performs a service willingly and without pay.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Willingness to perform an activity is not enough to fall within the scope of this subsection; the activity must also be performed without pay. In this case, the MEA fully anticipates payment and plans to prepay for any administration costs. As a result, a public school\u2019s administration of a payroll deduction system does not \u201cprovide volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under section 4(3)(a)\u201d of the MCFA and is not prohibited by \u00a7 57 on this final ground. Therefore, the administration of a payroll deduction system by a public school is permitted under the MCFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">H. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to vacate this Court\u2019s December 29, 2010, opinion. A public school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>may administer payroll deductions for its employees who remit funds to the MEA-PAC because MCL 169.257(1) only prohibits a public body from using public resources to do three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a contribution, and (3) provide volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d under MCL 169.204(3)(a). The administration of the system at issue does not meet any of those criteria. Thus, the administration of the payroll deduction system is permitted under the MCFA, and the Court of Appeals erred by concluding that it is not. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> The MEA-PAC is a segregated fund under MCL 169.255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\"> Recall the words of now Chief Justice Young just two years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">The facts have not changed.
