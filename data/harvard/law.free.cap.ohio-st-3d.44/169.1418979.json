In <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Stickrath </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 38, 531 N.E. 2d 716, we held in the syllabus that when this state \u201cpermits a person on parole to reside in another state and be supervised by the other state [under the Interstate Compact], the other or \u2018receiving\u2019 state does not have authority to grant a final discharge to the parolee.\u201d Since the documents submitted by petitioner indicate he was so discharged without approval of the Ohio Adult Parole Authority, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-17\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
