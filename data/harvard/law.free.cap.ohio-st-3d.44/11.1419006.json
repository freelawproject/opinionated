For the reasons which follow, we hold that loss of consortium is not a separate \u201cbodily injury\u201d and thus reverse the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">As we construe the policy language at issue here, we do so utilizing the long-standing rules of construction and interpretation applicable to contracts generally. <em>Gomolka </em>v. <em>State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St. 2d 166, 167, 24 O.O. 3d 274, 275, 436 N. E. 2d 1347, 1348. The most important of these rules is one of abstention: \u201cWhen the language of an insurance policy has a plain and ordinary meaning, it is unnecessary and impermissible for this court to resort to construction of that language. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Reddick </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St. 2d 119,121 [66 O.O. 2d 259].\u201d <em>Karabin </em>v. <em>State Automobile Mut.

See <em>Gomolka, supra, </em>at 168, 24 O.O. 3d at 276, 436 N.E. 2d at 1348 (court may not enlarge contract of insurance where provisions \u201care clear and unambiguous\u201d). Thus, in reviewing an insurance policy, words and phrases used therein \u201cmust be given their natural and commonly accepted meaning, where they in fact possess such meaning, to the end that a reasonable interpretation of the insurance contract consistent with the apparent object and plain intent of the parties may be determined. * * * The insurer, having prepared the policy, must also be prepared to accept any reasonable interpretation, consistent with the foregoing, in favor of the insured. * * *\u201d <em>Gomolka, supra, </em>at 167-168, 24 O.O. 3d at 275-276, 436 N.E. 2d at 1348; <em>Dealers Dairy Products Co. </em>v. <em>Royal Ins.

The limit of liability shown in the Declarations or in this endorsement for \u2018each accident\u2019 for property damage liability is our maximum limit of liability for all damages to all property resulting from any one auto accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-15\">\u201cThis is the most we will pay regardless of the number of covered persons, claims made, vehicles or premiums shown in the declarations, or vehicles involved in the auto accident. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-17\">It is at first obvious that \u201cPart A, Liability Coverage\u201d provides a broad, general statement as to Buckeye Union\u2019s liability coverage for damages for bodily injury or property damage, <em>i.e., </em>that Buckeye Union will pay such damages \u201cfor which any covered person becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident.\u201d This broad assurance is unambiguously tempered, however, by the conspicuously labeled section entitled \u201cLimit of Liability,\u201d and the limitations for \u201ceach person\u201d and \u201ceach accident\u201d provided therein. \u201cOne may not regard only the right hand which giveth, if the left hand also taketh away. The intention of the parties must be derived instead from the instrument as a whole, and not from detached or isolated parts thereof.\u201d <em>Gomolka, supra, </em>at 172, 24 O.O. 3d at 278-279, 436 N.E. 2d at 1351, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-18\">The plain and ordinary language of this policy is subject to but one reasonable interpretation, consistent with the natural and commonly accepted meaning of the words and phrases within the \u201cLimit of Liability\u201d section. Resort to \u201cconstruction\u201d of the various terms is thus unnecessary. Although many semantic hairs have been split by the parties and lower courts regarding this language, appellee Tomlinson does not have a <em>separate </em>claim for an amount over and above the amount paid to her husband under this policy quite simply because any damage she suffered was not a separate \u201cbodily injury sustained by [her] * * * <em>in </em>any one auto accident.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-19\">The issue as framed by the court of appeals below was whether a claim for loss of consortium can be concluded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>be a separate \u201cbodily injury\u201d under the policy. The court concluded that it may. This was error. The term \u201cbodily injury\u201d is not specifically defined within Buckeye Union\u2019s policy, and thus must be given its commonly accepted meaning. <em>New Amsterdam Cas. Co., supra. </em>\u201cThe words \u2018bodily injury\u2019 are commonly and ordinarily used to designate an injury caused by external violence * * <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. Ltd. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 222, 233, 12 O.O. 18, 23, 16 N.E. 2d 316, 321. In contrast, an action for loss of consortium involves, not an injury to the complainant\u2019s body, but rather an injury to the complainant\u2019s relationship with his or her spouse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">\u201cThe \u2018gist\u2019 of the wife\u2019s action for loss of the consortium of her husband against a defendant who either intentionally or negligently causes injury to her husband is the direct hurt which she has suffered by reason of the loss of her husband\u2019s society, services, sexual relations and conjugal affection which -includes companionship, comfort, love and solace.\u201d <em>Clouston </em>v. <em>Remlinger Oldsmobile Cadillac, Inc. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 65, 72, 51 O.O. 2d 96, 100, 258 N.E. 2d 230, 234.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Although \u201cthe wife of a husband who has been incapacitated suffers great pain and endures constant anguish,\u201d <em>Clouston, supra, </em>at 73, 51 O.O. 2d at 101, 258 N.E. 2d at 235, such physical manifestations do not render a claim for loss of consortium a \u201cbodily injury\u201d as that term is commonly understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Moreover, the legislature has recognized this common distinction between \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201closs of consortium\u201d by its enactment of separate statutes of limitation for each: R.C. 2305.10, applicable to actions for bodily injury; and R.C. 2305.09, applicable to injuries to the rights of a plaintiff not arising upon contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK\">\u201cThe action of a spouse for loss of consortium and medical expenses <em>arising from bodily injuries suffered by the other spouse </em>as a result of the tort of a third party is an action for an injury to the rights of the former spouse not arising upon contract, the commencement of which is governed by the four-year statute of limitation (R.C. 2305.09). <em>(Corpman </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>171 Ohio St. 233, approved and followed.)\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Angelas </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 99, 53 O.O. 2d 282, 264 N.E. 2d 911, paragraph one of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Hershberger </em>v. <em>Akron City Hosp. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St. 3d 1, 6516 N.E. 2d 204, 208, and cases cited therein; <em>Kraut </em>v. <em>Cleveland Ry. Co. </em>(1936), 132 Ohio St. 125, 7 O.O. 226, 5 N.E. 2d 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">A claim for loss of consortium is a derivative action, <em>deriving from </em>a spouse\u2019s claim for bodily injury. See <em>Clouston, supra. </em>\u201cA derivative action clearly stems from a single accident or occurrence. Indeed, the derivative actions would not exist but for the primary action.\u201d <em>Dues </em>v. <em>Hodge </em>(1988), 36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Ohio St. 3d 46, 48, 521 N.E. 2d 789, 792. It was on this basis that the court in <em>Dues, </em>concerning a derivative action for negligent infliction of serious emotional distress, held that \u201c[a]n insurance policy provision that limits recovery for all causes of action arising out of bodily injury to one person to a single limit of, liability is a valid restriction of uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. The fact that the limitation in <em>Dues </em>involved a restriction of uninsured motorist coverage, while the instant case involves a restriction of liability coverage, is a distinction without a legal difference. See <em>Shearer </em>v. <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 1, 7, 7 O.O. 3d 1, 4, 371 N.E. 2d 210, 213. Thus, we hold that an insurance policy provision that limits recovery for all causes of action arising out of or because of bodily injury to one person to a single limit of liability is a valid restriction of automobile liability insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Appellee raises an additional distinction between the policy language involved in <em>Dues </em>and that of the instant case. The State Farm policy at issue in <em>Dues </em>limited liability coverage as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cUnder \u2018Each Person\u2019 is the amount of coverage for all damages due to <em>bodily injury </em>to one <em>person. </em>Under \u2018Each Accident\u2019 is the total amount of coverage for all damages due to <em>bodily injury </em>to two or more <em>persons </em>in the same accident.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Appellee argues that \u201cdue to,\u201d as used in the State Farm policy and interpreted by this court as meaning \u201carising out of,\u201d differs from the language used in Buckeye Union\u2019s policy. Specifically, appellee argues that \u201cresulting from,\u201d as used in the \u201ceach accident\u201d provision of Buckeye Union\u2019s policy is broader than \u201cfor\u201d and thus Buckeye Union recognizes loss of consortium \u2022 claims under its \u201ceach accident\u201d provision. We find appellee\u2019s arguments misleading, and are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">According the words used in each policy their commonly accepted meanings, we hold that, when read in context, \u201cdue to,\u201d \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cresulting from\u201d are all used as synonyms for \u201cbecause of\u201d or \u201carising out of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (1986) 699, defines \u201cdue to\u201d as <em>\u201cprep: </em>because of,\u201d and provides a cross-reference to \u201cdue * * * 5: owing or attributable: ASCRIBABLE \u2014 used with <em>to.\u201d </em>Similarly, \u201cfor\u201d is defined as <em>\u201cprep </em>* * * 8a: because of * * *: on account of * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 886. Finally, \u201cresult,\u201d when used as an intransitive verb, is defined as \u201c1: to proceed, spring, or <em>arise as a consequence, </em>effect, or conclusion * * (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 1937. Both the Buckeye Union policy and that at issue in <em>Dues </em>validly limit recovery for all damages \u201cbecause of\u201d or \u201carising out of\u201d bodily injury to one person to a single limit of liability. <em>Dues, supra, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, since both Ronald Tomlinson\u2019s personal injuries and appellee\u2019s loss of consortium arose out of or because of bodily injury to Ronald Tomlinson, a single $25,000 limit of liability applies to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Furthermore, the \u201ceach accident\u201d language of the Buckeye Union policy is expressly made \u201c[sjubject to * * * [the] limit for \u2018each person,\u2019 \u201d and thus cannot provide broader coverage than such \u201ceach person\u201d limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">For all the foregoing reasons, and absent a definitional provision in the insurance policy to the contrary, a claim for loss of consortium, deriving from bodily injury sustained by a spouse, is not a separate bodily injury for purposes of the single person limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>of liability of an automobile liability insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Finally, even if appellee\u2019s loss of consortium claim were considered a separate bodily injury, which we today hold it is not, it is apparent that the policy language would further preclude a separate per-person recovery because her \u201cbodily injury\u201d was not \u201csustained <em>* * * in </em>any one auto accident\u201d (emphasis added) as required by the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accord <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(Dec. 31,1987), Preble App. No. CA87-05-011, unreported.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">dissenting. The central issue in this case is <em>not, </em>as the majority claims, one of whether loss of services and consortium constitutes a separate claim for \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the liability coverage provided in Buckeye Union\u2019s policy. Rather, our decision should turn on whether the limit of liability, as written in the policy, restricts the total recovery to $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">The overall limit of coverage for the policy in question is $50,000. The parties agree that bodily injury to the plaintiff Ronald Tomlinson resulting from an auto accident was, or exceeded, $25,000. It is undisputed that Nancy Tomlinson\u2019s separate cause of action for loss of consortium was worth at least $25,000. Nancy was not injured in the accident. Therefore, our decision is solely one of determining whether the insurance company, in its limit-of-liability section, is entitled to limit the combined recovery for these two claims to $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">The applicable policy language in the Buckeye Union policy is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-16\">\u201cThe limit of liability shown in the Declarations for \u2018each person\u2019 for Bodily Liability <em>is our maximum limit of liability for all damages for bodily injury </em>sustained by any one person in any one auto accident.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-17\">These words should be given their plain meaning. The limit applies to \u201cdamages for bodily injury.\u201d The majority properly concludes that a claim for loss of consortium is not a claim for bodily injury. Since the majority finds that the loss of consortium is not a bodily injury, there is <em>no </em>basis to apply the limit to the claim of Nancy Tomlin-son. Accordingly, the overall limit of $50,000 should apply to the combined claims of Nancy and Ronald.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-18\">What the majority has done is to apply a limitation on payments \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d to prevent payment on a claim which is not a claim for bodily injury. The majority, in its syllabus and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>in its opinion, attempts to avoid the application of the policy language as it is written. The majority uses the words \u201carising out of or because of bodily injury\u201d as if those words were contained in the policy. <em>They are not. </em>The majority has thus converted a limitation which is plainly written to apply only to bodily injury (which loss of consortium is not) into a limitation applying to claims arising out of bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">To resolve this case against the party who drafted the policy language, there is no need to resort to \u201cstrict construction\u201d against the insurance company (even though the strict-construction doctrine is firmly established in the law of this state). All that is required is the ability to distinguish a claim for bodily injury from a claim arising out of or derivative to a bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">This court should not judicially rewrite the language of insurance policies to protect the insurer. To do so violates deeply ingrained principles of contract and insurance law. <em>King </em>v. <em>Nationwide Ins.
