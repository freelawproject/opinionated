(Doc. ## 1, 50.) BASF avers all Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in the federal district of Colorado. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) W-Limited by contrast, argues that it is not subject to either general or specific jurisdiction in Colorado. (Doc. # 60.) The following facts are drawn from the Complaint and are taken as true for the purposes of the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BASF is incorporated in Delaware, and its principal place of business is in Florham Park, New Jersey. (Doc. # 50 at \u00b6 1.) BASF researches, develops, tests, and sells different products and technologies in the agrochemical field. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.) BASF researched and developed pyraclostrobin, a \"break-through fungicidal chemical for use (1) in disease control and plant health in a variety of plants, (2) as a seed treatment for disease control and plant health in a variety of crops, and (3) as a drench for soil borne disease control and improved plant health in production ornamentals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) BASF obtained two patents\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   relating to the process of manufacturing the pyraclostrobin chemical compound. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43, 44, 48.) As a result, BASF has manufactured, marketed, and sold pyraclostrobin end-use products under various different brands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) Accordingly, BASF received several registrations for pyraclostrobin from both the Environmental Protection Agency and state authorities as early as September 30, 2002. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant W-Limited is a limited liability company that is incorporated and has its principal place of business in Hong Kong.

Further, W-Limited allegedly established W-USA as a distributor for sales to the United States market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) W-Limited imports and supplies crop protection products to W-USA and/or W-LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) W-USA purportedly registered and sold infringing products, obtained in violation of the '392 and '451 patents, in Colorado. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 76-81.)

Although BASF alleges in its responses that W-Limited directed W-USA to take action, BASF does not present any specific facts to support\n   <em>\n    what kind\n   </em>\n   of action was suggested or if that action related to W-USA's registration or distribution of the disputed products. Moreover, W-Limited argues it does not control W-USA. (Doc. # 70 at 9.) To support this assertion, Vijay Mundhra, the Managing Director and controlling owner of W-Limited, declared that W-Limited does not \"own any of [W-USA]'s membership interests,\" and W-Limited \"had nothing to do with [W-USA]'s attempts to register these products in the United States.\" (Doc. # 61-1 at \u00b6 8, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although Mr. Mundhra did own both W-Limited and W-USA at one point, he sold more than 50% of the controlling interest to a private equity group in April 2016. (Doc. # 70-1 at \u00b6 2.) Mr. Mundhra currently owns only 25% of W-USA's membership interests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.) Mr. Mundhra admits that he is on the board of W-USA, but as a minority owner, he does not have control of the company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.) Further, W-USA pays W-Limited for products supplied to W-USA, therefore W-USA \"is not an affiliate of or owned or controlled\" by W-Limited and W-USA's profits do not flow to W-Limited. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.) Lastly, Mr. Mundhra asserts W-Limited was not involved in supplying or facilitating W-USA's acquisition of the products at issue because W-Limited \"did not broker the allegedly-infringing products for\" W-USA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that BASF has not pled enough facts to support its alter ego or agency theories for purposes of establishing general jurisdiction. As such, the Court will next consider whether W-Limited is subject to general jurisdiction notwithstanding its affiliation with W-USA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. General Jurisdiction - W-Limited as a Sole Entity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   W-Limited, by itself, is not subject to general jurisdiction. Plaintiff avers that jurisdiction in Colorado is appropriate because Defendants have continuous and systematic general business contacts in Colorado: \"they have committed acts of patent infringement in the State of Colorado ... [they] regularly transact business within the [s]tate ... and [they] regularly and purposefully avail themselves of the benefits of the [s]tate ... by ... marketing, using, shipping, offering to sell or selling, or causing others to use, offer to sell, or sell, agrochemical products in the State ...\" (Doc. # 50 at \u00b6 8.) To supplement these allegations, Plaintiff, in its Response, argues that W-Limited is \"at home\" in the United States because it generates approximately 50% of its total revenue from the United States. (Doc. # 65 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   BASF's allegations misconstrue the minimum contacts analysis in evaluating general jurisdiction in the forum state, specific jurisdiction, and jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2). Rule 4(k)(2) establishes jurisdiction \"[w]hen a plaintiff's claims arise under federal law and the defendant is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   subject to the jurisdiction of any state's court of general jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    GCIU-Employer Ret.

Thus, the Court will first consider whether W-Limited is subject to general jurisdiction in Colorado before analyzing specific jurisdiction and jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the general jurisdiction inquiry may investigate \"an appraisal of a corporation's activities in their entirety,\" the inquiry still focuses on whether a corporation is \"at home\" in the\n   <em>\n    forum state\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    BNSF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604332\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1549/#p1558\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added). Moreover, the minimum contacts inquiry is not whether a foreign corporation's in-forum contacts can be said to be in some sense \"continuous and systematic;\" it is whether that corporation's \"affiliations with the state are so continuous and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n    564 U.S. at 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

BASF asserts that the Amended Complaint has enough facts to establish how W-Limited is subject to specific jurisdiction because its affiliates \"obtained the necessary registrations for the infringing pyraclostrobin products\" in Colorado and \"W-Limited's relationship to [the other Defendants is] clear.\" (Doc. # 65 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   These allegations generally argue that the first prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   test-requiring an intentional act directed at the forum state-have been met because the facts as alleged should be taken as true and therefore evidence W-Limited's intentional actions to direct business to Colorado.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court agrees that the Amended Complaint alleges enough facts to explain how all Defendants,\n   <strong>\n    except\n   </strong>\n   W-Limited, are subject to jurisdiction in Colorado. BASF details how W-USA, W-LLC, RightLine and Greenfields sought registration and approval for different products, some of which are at issue in this litigation. (Doc. # 50 at \u00b6 9-18, 23-37.) Then BASF merges all defendants under one name, Willowood, to further detail \"Willowood's Regulatory Registrations\" and \"Acts Giving Rise to This Action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-87.) However, BASF's argument assumes the truth of the alter ego theory, which this Court has already rejected in Section IV(a). The Court notes that merging all defendants under one name cannot accurately detail which facts plausibly establish jurisdiction, especially when certain alleged facts cannot apply specifically to W-Limited. For example, BASF alleges, \"Willowood has been seeking registrations of its Willowood Pyrac 2EC with numerous state regulatory authorities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62.) Although BASF alleges, in great detail, how every other\n   defendant sought registration of this product, BASF never alleges that W-Limited attempted to register a product itself. Thus, having no way of distinguishing when W-Limited's actions differ from all other Defendants, the Court cannot assume that such statements equally apply to W-Limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Moreover, the Court must take as true BASF's\n   <strong>\n    well-pled\n   </strong>\n   facts-as opposed to conclusory allegations-and only to the extent those facts are not contradicted by W-Limited's affidavits.\n   <em>\n    Melea, Ltd\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068083\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/1060/#p1065\">\n    511 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1065 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202196057\">\n    2018 WL 2196057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3 (finding that the allegation, \"defendants have knowingly and intentionally aimed unlawful and tortious acts at Plaintiff, in this district\" is insufficient to establish jurisdiction because it is conclusory and contradicted by defendants' affidavits).

Moreover, BASF has failed to allege any fact to support that any percentile of W-Limited's revenue was generated from selling\n   <strong>\n    the infringing products\n   </strong>\n   in the United States for Rule 4(k)(2) jurisdiction. Finally, after setting aside BASF's conclusory and contradicted allegations, the Court finds nothing in the Amended Complaint that supports a conclusion that W-Limited purposefully directed its activities to Colorado. The Court accordingly need not reach the question of whether BASF's injuries arose out of W-Limited's contacts with the forum because W-Limited did not purposefully sell the infringing products at issue in Colorado. Thus, the Court finds that it does not have specific jurisdiction over W-Limited pursuant to the Colorado long-arm statute or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 60.) and Defendant Willowood Limited is DISMISSED from this civil action.
