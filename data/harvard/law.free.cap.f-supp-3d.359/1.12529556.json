INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff, a former Administrative Law Judge for Defendant District of Columbia, was terminated from her job in 2013. According to Defendant, the termination occurred because Plaintiff missed 90 minutes of work daily for over a year after Defendant denied her request to keep an alternate work schedule that would have allowed her to arrive and leave 90 minutes early.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following her firing, Plaintiff brought a litany of claims against Defendant. Many of her claims did not survive the motion-to-dismiss stage, but seven proceeded to discovery and now are the subject of Defendant's motion for summary judgment. Those claims include the failure to allow her to work an alternate work schedule in violation of (1) the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for failure to reasonably accommodate, and in violation of (2) Title VII and (3) the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (DCHRA) for race discrimination. Plaintiff also claims that Defendant violated (4) the ADA and (5) the DCHRA when it retaliated against her for making a reasonable accommodation request and discriminated against her for her disability by firing her. Plaintiff further asserts that her termination violated (6) the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act, because she made two purported protected disclosures that led to her termination. And, finally, Plaintiff avers that Defendant compensated her below the minimum wage in violation of (7) the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the court grants summary judgment in favor of Defendant as to all of Plaintiff's claims, except for the denial of reasonable accommodation under the ADA. As to that claim, the court finds that Plaintiff has made out a prima facie case and may present her case to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff submitted a request for accommodation on April 16, 2010, specifically, to work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and to telecommute as needed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3, due to conditions such as lupus, \"failed back surgery syndrome,\" and a lumbar disc disorder,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Exs. 2, 3, ECF Nos. 72-2, 72-3.

Dr. Byrne noted that Plaintiff was \"under his care for a disability of her knees\" and recommended that her employer allow Plaintiff to work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. to avoid rush hour traffic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot.; Ex. 10, ECF No. 72-10 [hereinafter Physician Letter].

Failure to Accommodate under the ADA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before addressing Defendant's arguments, the court notes that Plaintiff made two, possibly three, requests for reasonable accommodation, one of which does not present a cognizable claim. Plaintiff first asked for accommodation in April 2010, seeking both an alternate work schedule (7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) and occasionally to work from home. Def.'s Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 3. Defendant never formally denied this first request, however, because Plaintiff failed to respond to Defendant's follow up for additional information and soon thereafter began a nearly two-year-long leave of absence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. As to this first accommodation request, Plaintiff can state no claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff made a second request for accommodation after she returned from her leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 9. The record as to this request is muddled, however. On April 30, 2012, Plaintiff asked to work a \"Flexible Work Schedule,\" which her supervisor recommended for approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Ex. 5, ECF No. 72-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Defendant apparently took no final action as to this request until November 2012. Kameron Kima-Cherry, an employee in Defendant's Human Resources Department, disapproved the alternate work schedule on November 14, 2012,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and Plaintiff's supervisor, Chief Judge Crawford, instructed Plaintiff on November 19, 2012, that she was required to work the \"standard tour of duty hours\" of 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Ex. 11, ECF No. 72-11. The record contains neither a reason for the long delay in responding to Plaintiff's request nor a reason for rejecting it. Then, according to Plaintiff, on or about December 4, 2012, she left a letter from her doctor on the chair of Chief Judge Crawford, which asked that she be able to work an alternate work schedule-a possible third request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 12. The record is silent as to what, if any, action Defendant took following receipt of the doctor's letter. The court evaluates these two additional requests against Defendant's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To make out a prima facie case of discrimination based on a failure to accommodate, a \"plaintiff must demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence: (1) that she was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the employer had notice of her disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation she could perform the essential functions of her job; and (4) that the employer refused to make such accommodations.\"\n   <em>\n    Etheridge v.

Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to establish a prima facie case for two reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, it contends that Plaintiff does not meet the third element because \"she cannot show a causal connection between the accommodation sought and her limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5905014\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/27/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, Defendant maintains that Plaintiff cannot meet the fourth element because \"she cannot show that [Defendant] failed to engage in the interactive process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5905014\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/27/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court rejects both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    1. Causal Connection between the Accommodation Sought and Plaintiff's Limitation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant's first contention-that Plaintiff cannot show a causal connection between the accommodation sought and her limitation-fails because Plaintiff's physician letter, dated November 30, 2012, is to the contrary. \"[W]hen an employee seeks a workplace accommodation, the accommodation must be related to the limitation that rendered the person disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654570,3572829\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/936/\">\n    531 F.3d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 944 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). According to her physician, Plaintiff had a \"disability of her knees\" and \"[s]he needs accommodation so that she can avoid the rush hour traffic ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   which would significantly be detrimental to her recovery because of the motion in her knee during driving and potential stop and go situations in her car.\" Physician Letter. The physician's letter creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether there is a causal connection between Plaintiff's request for alternative work hours and the limitation that rendered her disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    2. Interactive Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant's second contention-that Plaintiff failed to participate in the required interactive process-also fails. The interactive process is \"a flexible give-and-take between employer and employee so that together they can determine what accommodation would enable the employee to continue working.\"\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

Courts \"should attempt to isolate the cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178994,4110651\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/24/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant's argument focuses primarily on Plaintiff's failure to supply the follow-up information requested by her employer on April 22, 2010, after Plaintiff submitted her first request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 10-15. But that is not the relevant inquiry. The pertinent question is which party, if any, was responsible for the ineffectiveness of the interactive process following Plaintiff's second and third demands. There is no evidence that anyone requested additional information from Plaintiff after she made her second request for a modified work schedule in April 2012. Indeed, as discussed, Defendant offers no explanation for why, even though Plaintiff's supervisor approved her request for an alternate work schedule the day she submitted it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Ex. 5, the agency did not formally deny it until six months later, on November 14, 2012,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178994,4110651\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/24/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, the record is silent as to what steps, if any, Defendant took following its receipt of the letter from Plaintiff's physician in December 2012, which explicitly justified Plaintiff's need for an alternate work schedule. Defendant complains that Plaintiff did not provide the letter to Human Resources,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 15, but otherwise does not defend what appears to be inaction on its part. Based on these disputed facts, a reasonable juror could find that Defendant, not Plaintiff, failed to engage in the interactive process. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA survives summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Race Discrimination under Title VII and DCHRA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Next, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant denied her an alternate work schedule based on her race. To prove a Title VII and DCHRA race discrimination claim, a plaintiff must show that she suffered an adverse employment action because of her race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baloch v.

Moreover, Plaintiff offers no proof that the people responsible for her termination even knew she made the disclosure.

Failure to comply will result in corrective or adverse action.\" Def.'s Mot.; Ex. 11, ECF No. 72-11.
