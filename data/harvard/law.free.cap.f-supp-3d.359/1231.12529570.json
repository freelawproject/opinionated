The Court's rulings on these issues follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court divides its background discussion into three sections: (A) a brief procedural history of the case before the Court's April 8, 2016 Order dismissing Plaintiffs' claims; (B) the Court's Dismissal Order; and (C) the Eleventh Circuit's Opinion reversing the Court's Dismissal Order and remanding for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs William L. Roberts, II, p/k/a Rick Ross, Jermaine Jackson, and Andrew Harr filed this action in December 2013 alleging that the musical composition\n   <em>\n    Party Rock Anthem\n   </em>\n   infringed on their copyright to the musical composition\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   (DE 1). Plaintiffs sued the authors of\n   <em>\n    Party Rock Anthem\n   </em>\n   and various individuals and entities involved in marketing, advertising, and otherwise exploiting that song.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the operative second amended complaint (DE 158), Plaintiffs alleged four claims: Count l-Defendants' musical composition\n   <em>\n    Party Rock Anthem\n   </em>\n   infringes their copyright to the musical composition\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   ; Count II-Defendants' licensing their musical composition\n   <em>\n    Party Rock Anthem\n   </em>\n   to KIA Motors for use in advertisements infringes their copyright to\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   ; Count III-Defendants' marketing\n   merchandise, including T-Shirts, bearing the phrase \"Everyday I'm Shufflin\" infringes on their copyright to\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   ; and Count IV-Defendants' marketing merchandise, including T-Shirts, with the phrase \"Everyday I'm Shufflin\" infringes on their trademark to the phrase \"Everyday I'm Hustlin'.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For their part, Defendants asserted many defenses to Plaintiffs' claims, including, among others, that (1) Plaintiffs do not own a valid copyright in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   and (2)\n   <em>\n    Party Rock Anthem\n   </em>\n   does not infringe on\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   , based on the fair use doctrine. In May 2015, Plaintiffs dismissed their trademark claim (Count IV). (DE 201). Several months later, the Court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count III of the second amended complaint (DE 331), but denied their motion for summary judgment on fair use. (DE 347). The Court held that because Defendants' use of\n   <em>\n    Party Rock Anthem\n   </em>\n   does not constitute parody, they could not argue this at trial, but they could pursue their fair use defense outside the parody context. (DE 347).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Parties also filed competing summary judgment motions on the merits elements of Plaintiffs' copyright infringement claims: (1) ownership of a valid copyright; and (2) copying. The Parties subsequently filed pretrial motions\n   <em>\n    in limine, Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions, as well as proposed jury instructions and a pretrial stipulation. The Court held a pretrial conference in October 2015. (DE 367). Following the pretrial conference, the Court issued a Request to the Register of Copyrights regarding the multiple registrations for the\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   copyright.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Parties then submitted supplemental briefing based on the Registrar's response that it would not have issued any of the three copyright registrations to\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   had it known of the various inaccuracies in the registrations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Court's April 2016 Order Dismissing This Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 8, 2016, the Court entered its Order dismissing Plaintiffs' claims. (DE 399). In the Order, the Court initially set out to resolve this issue: \"Was the musical composition\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   validly registered with the Copyright Office, and, if so, do Plaintiffs have an ownership interest in the exclusive right to prepare derivative works for the musical composition\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   ?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to copyright validity, the Court held that none of Plaintiffs' three copyright registrations were valid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because (1) each contained inaccurate information and Plaintiffs had knowledge of the inaccuracies; and (2) the Registrar had established that the inaccuracies, if known, would have caused her to refuse registration for the copyrights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because registration is a prerequisite to filing an\n   infringement suit, the Court held Plaintiffs' infringement claims were barred and dismissed the case. (DE 399 at 16-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As to copyright ownership, the Court first stated that because it had determined Plaintiffs lacked a valid copyright registration, it \"need not decide whether Plaintiffs have standing to assert [their] copyright infringement claims in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even so, the Court proceeded to \"illustrate some of the problems with Plaintiffs' contention that they are 'the legal and/or beneficial copyright owners of the musical work at issue,\n   <em>\n    Hustlin\n   </em>\n   '.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court then explained the facts about Roberts', Harr's, and Jackson's legal ownership interests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    at 29-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court noted-without deciding-many legal and factual disputes relating to Plaintiffs' purported legal ownership of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin',\n   </em>\n   including: (i) the validity and effect of Roberts' 2006 assignment of his interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to his wholly-owned company, 3 Blunts Lit at Once, LLC (\"3 Blunts\"), given that 3 Blunts was administratively dissolved in 2004 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32); (ii) whether Harr &amp; Jackson created\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   as a \"work for hire\" for their wholly-owned company, Trac-N-Field Entertainment, LLC (\"TNF\") (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34); (iii) whether Harr and Jackson ever assigned their interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to TNF (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 FN 35); (iv) the effect and impact of the October 2005 SNS/TNF agreement, signed by Harr but not Jackson (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35); (v) the effect and meaning of the May 2006 co-publishing agreement (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36); (vi) the effect and meaning of the November 2006 NottingDale agreement (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37); and other legal and factual disputes on legal ownership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Court never ruled on any of these legal and factual disputes relating to legal ownership, nor did it otherwise resolve the Parties' respective legal ownership interests. (Indeed, with regard to Jackson and Harr, the Court presented\n   <em>\n    five\n   </em>\n   possible scenarios.) However, the Court did observe that \"[u]nfortunately, as of this date, neither Harr, nor Jackson, nor Roberts, nor TNF, nor FNG, nor Sony, nor Defendants, nor their counsel, nor the Court can 'figure out' who owns what with regard to the musical composition\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court similarly did not address the crux of the Parties' dispute on beneficial ownership: their competing legal arguments about the definition and scope of beneficial ownership under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, it determined there was no evidence that any of the Plaintiffs ever received-or were even entitled to receive-royalty payments for the preparation of derivative works based on\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court has not found in the voluminous briefing, nor have the Parties identified, any record evidence demonstrating\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   royalty payment to Roberts, Harr, or Jackson relating to the right to prepare derivative works of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   Nor is there any evidence that Plaintiffs, themselves, are even entitled to royalties for the exploitation of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   Roberts has not produced any royalty statements showing any royalties he received from 3 Blunts or FNG in exchange for any transfer of his ownership interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   Likewise, Harr and Jackson\n   have produced no royalty statements showing any royalties received from TNF or FNG in exchange for any transfer of any ownership interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin\n   </em>\n   ....

In sum, there is no evidence that Harr, Jackson, or Roberts personally receive any royalties for the licensing or commercial exploitation of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (DE 399 at 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the conclusion section of the Dismissal Order, the Court stated that none \"of these Plaintiffs, either legally or beneficially, hold the kind of clearly delineated exclusivity over at least one strand of the bundle of rights that would permit [them] to sue for infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted).

Accordingly, this Court must now resolve the undecided legal issues in light of the Eleventh Circuit's ruling that Plaintiffs have established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs ignore the practical implications of this Court simply deciding, based on the Eleventh Circuit's comments in dicta on ownership, that the ownership issue has been \"take[n] care of,\" \"at least for purposes of proceeding to trial, and the Court need not, therefore, wade into the various agreements, etc.\" (DE 447 at 7). Plaintiffs readily acknowledged at the November 14 status conference that numerous, \"purely legal\" ownership issues remain for the Court, not a jury, to decide. But besides saying that the time to resolve these issues is \"not now,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' counsel offered no procedural or substantive proposal for how, or when, the Court would rule on these purely legal issues. For all these reasons, the Court finds that the Eleventh Circuit did not resolve the Parties' summary judgment arguments on ownership. The Court will therefore turn to the Parties' competing positions, accepting that Plaintiffs have established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of ownership, and are thus entitled to a rebuttable presumption on the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Legal Ownership\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The background facts regarding Plaintiffs' purported legal ownership interests are set forth in the Court's 2016 Dismissal Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (DE 399 at 29-39; 43). Based on these facts and the Parties' arguments, the Court now determines that there are no genuine issues of material fact on Roberts' legal ownership interest: He is not a legal owner of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   Triable issues of fact remain, however, regarding Harr and Jackson's legal ownership interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     Roberts Is Not A Legal Owner Of\n     <em>\n      Hustlin'\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Parties agree that Roberts' legal ownership claim depends on the validity and effect of his May 2006 assignment of his interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to 3 Blunts, given that 3 Blunts administratively dissolved in 2004. As discussed, neither the Court's Dismissal Order nor the Eleventh Circuit's Opinion resolved this question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the assignment was ineffective and void, and therefore legal ownership of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   remained with Roberts, because: (1) Section 15.01 of the Sony/ATV Agreement provides that upon 3 Blunts' dissolution, Roberts would individually be substituted as the contracting party in place of 3 Blunts; (2) under Florida law, dissolved entities may only \"wind up\" their business, and cannot engage in conducting \"new business,\" and here, acquiring ownership of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   from Roberts constitutes \"new business\"; and (3) the assignment language in the agreement describes the assignee as \"3 Blunts Lit at Once, LLC, its successors and assigns,\" and Roberts is a \"successor\" of 3 Blunts given its dissolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants respond that the assignment of copyright per the agreement was effective, and stripped Roberts of his legal ownership, because: (1) Section 15.01 only provides for the substitution of Roberts in place of 3 Blunts if Sony/ATV exercises an option-by sending a notice-which never occurred here; (2) dissolved entities are allowed to \"marshal\" and \"collect\" assets, which 3 Blunts was doing when it obtained Roberts' copyright; and (3) \"Florida law accords very little significance to the fact that a company is administratively dissolved.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants that Roberts conveyed his legal ownership interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to 3 Blunts, despite 3 Blunts' status as administratively dissolved. Section 15.01 of the Sony/ATV Agreement-which Roberts relies on to argue that he was \"substituted\" into the agreement for 3 Blunts-states, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   In the event of your [ (3 Blunts') ] dissolution ... then at any time after the occurrence of any such event, in addition to any other remedies under this agreement or otherwise, Sony shall have the option\n   <strong>\n    by notice\n   </strong>\n   to require that Controlled Songwriter [ (Roberts) ] render his personal services directly to it for the remaining balance of their Term, including any extensions thereof, for the purpose of writing, delivering and releasing musical compositions upon all the same terms and conditions as are contained herein. In such event Controlled Songwriter shall be deemed substituted for you as a Party to this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (DE 235-2) (emphasis added). This provision does not support Roberts' argument. It provides that if 3 Blunts is dissolved, then Sony/ATV has \"the option\" of substituting Roberts for 3 Blunts as a party to\n   the Sony/ATV Agreement, but only after providing \"notice\" of invoking the option. That never happened here, and therefore Roberts was never substituted into the agreement under Section 15.01. And even if such substitution had occurred under Section 15.01, that provision only applies to the agreement between 3 Blunts and Sony/ATV; it has no bearing on the separate assignment of copyright from Roberts to 3 Blunts. Nor does the agreement's description of the assignee as \"3 Blunts Lit at Once, its\n   <em>\n    successors and assigns\n   </em>\n   \" support Plaintiffs' position that Roberts remained legal owner of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   There is no support for this argument in law or fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The actions of Roberts and 3 Blunts after the May 2006 Sony/ATV Agreement demonstrate that Roberts conveyed his interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to 3 Blunts. It was 3 Blunts-not Roberts-that, more than six years later, entered into an agreement with Sony that purported to grant 3 Blunts the right to sue for alleged infringement of the\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   copyright. And during this litigation, Plaintiffs maintained that the agreement was effective insofar as 3 Blunts transferred its interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to Sony/ATV, which would not be so if the initial assignment to 3 Blunts was \"legally ineffective.\" Roberts, in responding to Defendants' interrogatories, also stated that his\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   revenue share was \"18.75% through 4 Blunts,\" consistent with the assignment to 4 Blunts in the July 2006 addendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Florida law does not support Roberts' argument that his assignment to an administratively dissolved was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio.\n   </em>\n   Under the Florida Limited Liability Act in effect at the time of Roberts' transfer to 3 Blunts and 3 Blunts transfer to Sony/ATV, 3 Blunts \"continue[d] its existence,\" notwithstanding its administrative dissolution.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20608.4431\">\n    Fla.

That statute provides that a \"transfer of copyright ownership, other than by operation of law, is not valid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum of the transfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner's duly authorized agent.\" Defendants have made no argument-other than the work for hire argument, which the Court cannot resolve on summary judgment for reasons already explained-that the Runners' legal interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   was assigned to TNF \"by operation of law.\" Thus, without a written agreement conveying Jackson and Harr's legal interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to TNF, the Court cannot rule on summary judgment\n   that their interest was conveyed. There is no assignment agreement in the record, and both Harr and Jackson attest that they \"do not recall either seeing or ever signing an assignment of [their] copyright interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to Trac N Field.\" (DE 228-11 \u00b6 8, Harr Aff.; DE 228-12 \u00b6 7, Jackson Aff.). A triable issue of fact for the jury therefore exists on whether Harr and Jackson conveyed their interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to TNF by written agreement, consistent with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20204\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    (c)\n    <em>\n     The Effect Of The October 2005 SNS/TNF Agreement Must Also Be Decided By A Jury\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   If Harr and Jackson did not create\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   as a work for hire, and if they never assigned their interest to TNF, then the extent of their legal ownership in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   will depend, in part, on the effect of the October 2005 SNS/TNF Agreement. In October 2005, TNF, furnishing the services of Jackson and Harr, entered into a producers' agreement regarding\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   with SNS. (DE 376 \u00b6 38). The October 2005 Agreement refers to Harr and Jackson collectively as \"The Runners\" or \"you.\" (DE 230-5 at 46). The agreement states that \"You will furnish to us your services as a record producer in connection with the recording of the master musical recording (Master) presently entitled 'Hustlin'.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The agreement further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   You warrant and represent that you are the copyright owner of fifty-percent (50%) of the Controlled Composition resulting from your authorship contributions.

Plaintiffs take this position despite positing the following undisputed facts: (1) \"On October 11, 2005, Harr\n   <em>\n    and Jackson\n   </em>\n   entered into a producer agreement with SNS ...for the sound recording of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   \" (DE 376 \u00b6 97) (emphasis added); and (2) \"TNF is authorized by Harr and Jackson to commercially exploit their musical works, enter into contracts for that purpose, and collect and pay monies from the commercial exploitation of their musical works including\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95). At his deposition, Jackson testified that he recalled signing a producers' agreement for\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   , but in a subsequent errata sheet he corrected his testimony, stating that he did not recall signing the agreement. (DE 230-3 at 37, 43). Thus, despite Jackson's statements, there is also record evidence to show that either (i) Jackson separately assigned his interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to FNG; or (ii) TNF was authorized to assign Jackson's interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to FNG. This issue is therefore inappropriate for resolution on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    (ii)\n    <em>\n     Failure Of Consideration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Harr and Jackson also argue that the agreement had no effect for another reason. They assert that the assignment was intended as consideration for FNG to act as publisher for Harr's interest and to\n   make royalty payments pursuant to the Royalty Agreement that is part of the SNS Producer Agreement. (DE 230-5/54, 56). But Plaintiffs contend that FNG never acted as publisher for Harr, never accounted to Harr, and never made any royalty payments to Harr for\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   (DE 228). Plaintiffs therefore believe that the agreement fails for lack of consideration, it had no effect whatsoever, and both Harr and Jackson retained a 25% interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 228 at 7-8; DE 228-11 \u00b6 7, 228-12 \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Once again, the Court determines that it cannot resolve this issue-whether the October 2005 SNS/TNF Agreement fails for lack of consideration-on summary judgment. The agreement, on its face, does not fail for lack of consideration, because in exchange for Harr and Jackson's services as producers, FNG promised to pay them cash and ongoing royalty payments. But such payments were never made, and Plaintiffs maintain that FNG is an owner of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   based on a transfer from Roberts, not Harr and Jackson. What happened after the agreement was signed, and whether the entire agreement is void as a result, is the subject of disputed and undeveloped facts. For example, at his deposition, Harr could not recall any significant details on the issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Q: And what-what do you mean by First-N-Gold did not act as your publisher? A: They didn't - I don't know the details, my lawyers know. But I'm just being told that they didn't - they never accounted or anything to me that I'm aware of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (DE 245-3 at 5). For these reasons, summary judgment on this discrete issue is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Beneficial Ownership\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that if they cannot sue as\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   owners of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin',\n   </em>\n   they can sue as\n   <em>\n    beneficial\n   </em>\n   owners. The Court disagrees. Plaintiffs' novel argument that beneficial ownership extends to an author whose separate, legally distinct company receives royalties-but who is not entitled to receive, and does not receive, royalties himself-fails as a matter of law. Based on the undisputed facts, Plaintiffs are not beneficial owners of the right to prepare derivative works of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     The Scope Of Beneficial Ownership\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \"The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled, subject to the requirements of section 411 [of the Copyright Act], to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner of it.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). \"The paradigmatic-and only-example of an approved 'beneficial owner' suit is set forth in the legislative history of the Copyright Act, which describes the term 'beneficial owner' as 'includ[ing], for example, an author who had parted with legal title to the copyright in exchange for percentage royalties based on sales or license fees.' \"\n   <em>\n    John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wildlife,\n   </em>\n   the court applied the example of a beneficial owner found in the copyright act's legislative history: \"A 'beneficial owner' for this purpose would include, for example, an author who had parted with legal title to the copyright in exchange for percentage royalties based on sales or license fees.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3686262\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/591/1542/#p1546\">\n    591 F.Supp. at 1546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). The court then said that this example \"describes exactly the contractual relationship between\" the plaintiff (named Ruthraven) and the assignee of his copyright, DeSales: \"Desales received certain reproduction and distribution rights\n   <em>\n    in exchange\n   </em>\n   for Ruthven's right to royalties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3686262\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/591/1542/#p1546\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After reaching this conclusion, the court hypothesized, without any legal support, that the artist could also be a beneficial owner \"[g]iven [his] position as owner and president of Wildlife and given that any reproduction by Wildlife was to be done under Ruthven's 'direct supervision and control[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3686262\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/591/1542/#p1546\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Drake,\n   </em>\n   the court relied exclusively on this statement in dicta to rule, on a motion to dismiss, that the plaintiff could proceed as a beneficial owner because, applying\n   <em>\n    Wildlife,\n   </em>\n   Malouf was an owner and officer of the company that retained control over the copyrights at issue. Setting aside that\n   <em>\n    Drake\n   </em>\n   is an out-of-circuit, district court case involving a motion to dismiss, it relies on dicta from one other case-\n   <em>\n    Wildlife v.

And even if\n   <em>\n    Drake\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wildlife\n   </em>\n   could be interpreted as expanding the definition of beneficial ownership, they would conflict with the only definition of beneficial owner that the Eleventh Circuit has recognized: an author who \"had parted with legal title to the copyright in exchange for percentage royalties based on sales or license fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897612\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/1236/#p1242\">\n    741 F.3d at 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, basic tenets of corporate law prohibit Plaintiffs from essentially treating their LLCs as shams. \"Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or the operating agreement, property acquired with limited liability company funds is limited liability company property.\" \u00a7 608.425(2), Fla. Stat (2006). Here, the\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   copyright is owned by Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   companies. Allowing Plaintiffs to call themselves \"owners\" of the copyright when the copyright is company property would ignore the corporate distinction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallert v.

To the contrary, that exclusive right belongs to the entities to which it was assigned. Because only a beneficial owner of the right to prepare derivative works would have standing to bring this infringement suit, Plaintiffs' vague references to \"control\" over other unrelated aspects of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin's\n   </em>\n   exploitation are irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fahmy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519163\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/383/#p394\">\n    908 F.3d at 392-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs' contention that a \"financial interest\" in a copyright is enough to confer standing belies the plain text of the copyright statute, which provides that only a legal or beneficial \"owner\" can sue for infringement. Being an owner of a copyright is different than having an interest in one. \"It is therefore not enough that a putative beneficial owner obtains a mere interest in a copyright, even if that interest is valuable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cortner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1947713\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/732/267/#p270\">\n    732 F.2d at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accepting Plaintiffs' argument that individuals with \"a current economic interest in the commercial exploitation of\" a copyright may sue for infringement would ignore the legislative requirement that only an \"owner\" can sue and greatly expand the number of individuals who may sue for infringement. As discussed, nothing in the law supports this result. Accordingly, the Court holds that a beneficial owner is a legal owner who has parted with legal title to an exclusive right under a copyright\n   <em>\n    in exchange\n   </em>\n   for the right to receive royalties based on the commercial exploitation of that right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs Are Not Beneficial Owners\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Having defined the contours of beneficial ownership, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs cannot sue as beneficial owners. After conducting a thorough and comprehensive review of the record on summary judgment, this Court explained that nothing in the record showed that Plaintiffs received, or were even entitled to receive, royalties relating to the right to prepare derivative works of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court has not found in the voluminous briefing, nor have the Parties identified, any record evidence demonstrating\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   royalty payment to Roberts, Harr, or Jackson relating to the right to prepare derivative works of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   Nor is there any evidence that Plaintiffs, themselves, are even entitled to royalties for the exploitation of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   Roberts has not produced any royalty statements showing any royalties he received from 3 Blunts or FNG in exchange for any transfer of his ownership interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   Likewise, Harr and Jackson have produced no royalty statements showing any royalties received from TNF or FNG in exchange for any transfer of any ownership interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   In addition, to the extent Harr and Jackson receive royalties for their compositions,\n   both testified that all royalties are paid to TNF, not to Harr and Jackson. As Harr and Jackson explain, all royalties earned \"from\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   (other than the writer's share which is paid to me personally) are paid initially to Trac N. Field. Harr and I are paid by Trac N Field through draws or distributions.\" And each of the agreements signed by TNF, 3 Blunts, Roberts, Harr or Jackson make clear that Roberts, Harr and Jackson do not have any right to authorize or create derivative works of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   ; rather, that exclusive right belongs to Sony/ATV, FNG, and Notting Dale/Warner. In sum, there is no evidence that Harr, Jackson, or Roberts personally receive any royalties for the licensing or commercial exploitation of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (DE 399 at 41-42) (internal citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   At the November 14 status conference, Plaintiffs repeated their claim that they have produced royalty statements showing they personally receive royalties from\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   But these six pages of purported royalty statements (DE 228-9) do not demonstrate beneficial ownership. To begin, Plaintiffs have not explained-through witness testimony or otherwise-what these documents show. And it is impossible for the Court to decipher them. The first page, for example, identifies Sony/ATV Music Publishing at the top, and the alleged royalty payment is directed to \"client\" 4 Blunts Lit At Once LLC and \"payee\" William Roberts. The following percentages are reflected: \"Song Share %\" (50%); \"Cntrl Coll %\" (75%); and \"Royalty %\" (75%). Plaintiffs do not explain, and the Court cannot determine, how any of these numbers align with royalty payments due to Plaintiff Roberts under any of the copyright transfer agreements in this case. The Court cannot tell, from this page or the five others, what the payments are, why the payments are being made, who is being paid, and whether the payments relate in any way to the right to prepare derivative works of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, they\n   are not useful or relevant to this Court's analysis on beneficial ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The documents cannot demonstrate beneficial ownership for other reasons. On the first page, the purported royalty payment is from Sony/ATV, an entity that is not a direct assignee of Roberts in any of the relevant transfer agreements. Instead, as explained, Roberts assigned his legal interest in\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   to 3 Blunts. The purported royalty statement from Sony/ATV therefore does not appear to show royalty payments being made in exchange for Roberts' assignment of his legal title to\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   The second and third pages of alleged \"royalty statements\" are from BMI, a performing rights society. As such, they likely reflect payment of \"writer's share\" or publishing royalties that, as explained above, do not demonstrate beneficial ownership. And finally, none of the statements are tied to the right to prepare derivative works of\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'.\n   </em>\n   As discussed, to demonstrate beneficial ownership Plaintiffs must show that they receive royalties based on the right to prepare derivative works.\n   <em>\n    Fahmy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519163\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/383/#p394\">\n    908 F.3d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ANALYSIS: DAMAGES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Parties also dispute the percentage of total infringement damages that the Plaintiffs are permitted to pursue and ultimately recover if they succeed. Plaintiffs argue that they \"are entitled to pursue and be awarded 100% of the damages in this case, subject to whatever contractual obligations exist among and between all of the various rights holders.\" Defendants disagree. They argue that Plaintiffs may only pursue, and ultimately recover, damages that are limited by their respective ownership interests in the\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   copyright. After careful review of the Parties' arguments and applicable law, the Court agrees with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"[R]ecovery in a copyright case is 'confined to the [plaintiff's] own part; that is to say, to its own actual damages, to its proper share of any statutory damages, and to its proper share of the profits.' \"\n   <em>\n    Manno v.

The rationale behind this rule is sound. A joint owner of a copyright is not required to join his other co-owners in an action for infringement, and where one co-owner acts alone in bringing suit, the co-owner cannot affect the rights of the other co-owners who are not parties to the action. Thus, if plaintiff co-owners \"were allowed to recover 100% of statutory damages in this case, defendants could be subject to multiple liability in the event that [the non-party co-owners] decide to pursue [their] own infringement claim. Second, limiting [Plaintiffs] damages based\n   on [their] ownership interest will not unjustly enrich defendants. To the contrary, it is [Plaintiffs] who would be unjustly enriched if [they] were permitted to recover a greater amount of damages than that to which [they are] entitled.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacino v.

In\n   <em>\n    Isbell,\n   </em>\n   the Fifth Circuit allowed the plaintiff co-owner to sue for 100% of the total damages because \"[t]here was testimony that [he] is the administrator of 100 percent of the royalties and is responsible for accounting to Tag Team.\" That is not the case here. No other case cited by Plaintiffs supports their position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For these reasons, at trial, Plaintiffs Harr and Jackson will have the burden of proving that they are legal owners of the\n   <em>\n    Hustlin'\n   </em>\n   copyright, and they further must prove the extent of their ownership interests.
