STORY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action comes before the Court on Defendant PSE's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint for Failure to State a Claim [21]. After reviewing the record, the Court enters the following Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is a product liability action in which Plaintiffs seek to hold Defendant Dick's Sporting Goods (\"Dick's\") and Defendant Precision Shooting Equipment, Inc., d/b/a PSE Archery (\"PSE\"), responsible for injuries their son JM, a minor, sustained in an accident on March 9, 2016, while he was shooting arrows with a bow. JM and his\n   parents purchased the bow and arrows the previous day from a Dick's retail location in Gainesville, Georgia. A store salesperson assisted the Morgans in their purchase by recommending the Bear Archery Apprentice III Compound Bow, fitting the bow to JM, and suggesting PSE Archery Explorer 28? fiberglass arrows, manufactured by Defendant PSE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When JM first used his new bow and arrows on March 9, 2016, he shot two brand-new arrows straight out of the package. The first arrow fired without incident. The second, exploded, splintering into pieces in the middle of the shaft. Some splintered fiberglass pieces went into JM's left hand and thumb, requiring immediate removal surgery. Unfortunately, the Doctor was unable to remove all shards of fiberglass. As a result, JM returns periodically for removal procedures as shards work their way up to the top of his skin. The injury has directly impacted JM's quality of life through the continued pain, procedures, and diminished use of his thumb on his dominant hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs maintain they and JM exercised due care at the time of the injury and that the arrows appeared in new condition. They claim the exploding arrow was Defendants' fault and advance a series of apparently alternative reasons the arrow could have exploded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    The Manufacturing Defect Theory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One explanation for the exploding arrow is a manufacturing defect. Plaintiffs argue the arrow contained a flaw or defect when it left PSE's control. (Am. Compl., Dkt [15] \u00b6 61.) As evidence for this theory, Plaintiffs point to JM's ability to shoot one arrow without issue, while the second, defective, arrow exploded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Because both arrows were manufactured together, Plaintiffs argue, it follows that the second arrow deviated from the prototypical product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Plaintiffs allege PSE did not adequately communicate a warning to inspect arrows for defects prior to use because the only warning was in \"extremely small lettering on the shaft of the arrows,\" stating: \"Warning! Inspect arrow for damage before each shot.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    The Damaged Arrow Theory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Another explanation for the exploding arrow is that it left PSE's control in good condition but was damaged before Plaintiffs' purchase. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege Defendant Dick's created \"a mechanism for damage\" by displaying \"the arrows for sale in such a manner that they stuck out in the isle [sic] of the store.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) By sticking out, Plaintiffs argue, the arrows could have been damaged by customers bumping into them, hitting the shelves, or being knocked to the floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also attribute liability under this theory to Defendant PSE for: 1) failing to instruct Dick's in the proper storage and display of the arrows (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.); 2) failing to warn \"that product failure could happen if there was damage to the arrow\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.); 3) failing to communicate \"what damage was acceptable for continued use and what damage was not acceptable\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); 4) failing to warn \"that unseen damages or defects could result in failure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    The Incompatibility Theory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the arrow exploded because fiberglass arrows\n   are not compatible with the compound bow used. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) According to Plaintiffs, the PSE arrows and packaging did not warn against using fiberglass arrows with compound bows. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, PSE did not provide Plaintiffs with any individual warning, written or verbal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Neither did Dick's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs maintain that had PSE provided such warning, they would have heeded it and not used the fiberglass arrows with the compound bow. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) That said, the compound bow did warn against use with fiberglass arrows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The arrow packaging also stated the arrows are of \"durable fiberglass construction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs first filed a complaint on February 6, 2018 in the Superior Court of Hall County. Subsequently, Defendant Dick's properly removed to this Court on March 8, 2018 with Defendant PSE's consent. On April 6, 2018 Defendant PSE filed a Motion to Dismiss [11]. Plaintiffs properly filed an Amended Complaint [15], mooting PSE's motion [11] and any responsive pleading [16]. (See Order [27].) PSE then filed this Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint [21]. Defendant Dick's filed an Answer [23] to Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint [15] along with cross claims against Defendant PSE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that Defendant Dick's has not moved to dismiss any claims against it, and Defendant PSE has not moved to dismiss Dick's cross claims. Thus, this Order is limited to PSE's Motion to Dismiss [21] Plaintiffs' Negligence (Count I), Failure to Warn (Count II), Products Liability (Count III), and Breach of Implied Warranty (Count IV) claims, as they pertain to PSE. The Court now considers PSE's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

While primarily lodged against Dick's, Plaintiffs do include some allegations against PSE. In sum, Plaintiffs allege PSE was negligent in its failure to warn Dick's that: 1) the arrows should be displayed to prevent damage; and 2) that youth fiberglass arrows should not be sold with compound bows. (Am. Compl., Dkt [15] \u00b6 39.) PSE was further negligent, Plaintiffs contend, for not \"implementing protocol with its retailers to ensure these safety measures are implemented.\" (Id.) In response, PSE argues it owed no legal duty to Plaintiffs to warn or instruct Dick's regarding the product. Further, even if such duty existed, PSE claims Plaintiffs have not alleged proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   General negligence principles play a limited role under Georgia products liability law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fletcher v.

While manufacturers are subject to common law negligence in addition to statutory liability, this cause of action is less common and is typically a negligent failure to warn claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under general negligence principles, a manufacturer has a duty to exercise reasonable care in manufacturing its products so as to make products that are reasonably safe for intended or foreseeable uses.\n   <em>\n    Battersby v.

The existence of a duty to warn the\n   <em>\n    consumer\n   </em>\n   , however, is measured not so much by reasonable care, but by the products liability failure to warn test of foreseeability of use, foreseeability of danger, and foreseeability of the user's knowledge of the product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239421\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/264/723/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs claim PSE, as the manufacturer, breached its duty of care to Plaintiffs by failing to properly instruct Dick's, as the retailer, about the product. The Court is not convinced that this a cognizable claim under Georgia law. Neither party nor the Court has found authority discussing a claim brought by a consumer against a manufacturer for failing to warn a\n   <em>\n    retailer\n   </em>\n   . The Court is skeptical that they even have standing to bring such a claim. This doubt is bolstered by PSE's proximate cause argument. That said, at this stage of the litigation, Plaintiffs have pled proximate cause, along with the other elements necessary for a general negligence claim. Thus, absent authority to support either party's position, this claim may move forward and the parties may develop evidence on the issue to help instruct the Court.

Thus, because the second arrow did not follow the objective standard when it exploded, there was a deviation.
