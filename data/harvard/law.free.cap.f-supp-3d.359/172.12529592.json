Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties have submitted a Joint Statement of Material Facts. That statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is part of the court's record and is summarized here, not repeated in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Baillargeon applied for SSI and DIB in May of 2013, claiming that he became disabled in September of 2012 due to diabetes, weight, joint pain, neuropathy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   knees, and a crushed disc. On the day on which he claims to have become disabled,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , his alleged onset date (\"AOD\"), Baillargeon was 46 years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June of 2012, approximately three months before his AOD, Baillargeon's primary-care physician, Dr. Brian Sponseller, referred him to an occupational therapist, Lynn Chauvette, for a Functional Capacity Evaluation. According to Ms. Chauvette, Baillargeon could perform each of the following activities occasionally (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , up to one third of the day): standing, walking, sitting, lifting 10 pounds, carrying 10 pounds, pushing 10 pounds, pulling 10 pounds, climbing, stooping, reaching forward, handling, working above his shoulders, pinching, and writing. Ms. Chauvette also opined that Baillargeon could never crouch, crawl, or kneel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In an October 2012 letter, Dr. Sponseller wrote: \"I have reviewed a functional capacity evaluation [by Ms. Chauvette] and I concur with its findings concerning [Baillargeon's] sitting, standing and manipulative limitations.\" Administrative Transcript (hereinafter \"Tr.\") 566.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In July of 2014, Dr. Sponseller completed a Medical Source Statement of Ability to do Work-Related Activities (Physical). In it, he opined that Baillargeon could frequently lift ten pounds, stand and/or walk for at least two hours in an eight-hour workday, and sit for about six hours in an eight-hour workday. He further opined that Baillargeon could occasionally climb ramps/stairs/ladders/ropes/scaffolds, kneel, and crouch, but could never balance, crawl, or stoop. Finally, he opined that Baillargeon had no manipulative, visual/communicative, or environmental limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The SSA denied Baillargeon's applications. In November of 2014, he received a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). The ALJ ruled that Baillargeon was not disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In her decision, the ALJ determined that Baillargeon had four severe impairments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but also found that none of them, either alone or in combination with any other impairment(s), met or medically equaled the severity of any of the impairments on the SSA's list of impairments that are per se disabling. Next, the ALJ assessed Baillargeon's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and described it this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [T]he claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(a) and 416.967(a) except he could lift and carry ten pounds; stand or walk for two hours and sit for six hours in an eight-hour day; [could] never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffold[s] and [needed to] avoid balancing\n   on narrowing or elevated surfaces; [needed to] avoid crawling or stooping; [could] occasionally climb ramps or stairs, kneel, or crouch; and [could] rarely stoop with rarely defined as less than five percent of the workday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Tr. 159. Based upon that RFC, the ALJ determined that Baillargeon could not perform his past work, all of which was performed at the medium exertional level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, in reliance upon the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\"), the ALJ determined that Baillargeon retained the RFC to perform three sedentary jobs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The SSA's Appeals Council (\"AC\") vacated the ALJ's decision and remanded the matter for a new decision. It did so because the ALJ made two conflicting findings about the same postural activity when she determined that claimant: (1) could not stoop at all; but (2) could stoop up to five percent of the workday. In its remand order, the AC directed the ALJ to: (1) \"[o]btain additional evidence concerning the claimant's impairments in order to complete the administrative record in accordance with the regulatory standards regarding consultative examinations and existing medical evidence ( 20 CFR 404.1512 - 1513 and 416.912 - 913 ),\" Tr. 175; (2) further consider claimant's RFC \"and provide [a] rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of the assessed limitations,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) obtain evidence from a VE, if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On remand, claimant received a second hearing before the same ALJ who had conducted his previous hearing and who had issued the decision that resulted in the AC's remand. At that hearing, the ALJ took testimony from Dr. John Kwock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following his review of claimant's medical records, Dr. Kwock opined that none of the impairments he considered met or medically equaled the severity of any of the impairments on the SSA's list of impairments that are per se disabling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then he assessed claimant's RFC and said, among other things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [H]e still remains capable of doing light work. That is to say that he can lift and carry up to ten pounds on a frequent basis, between 11 and 20 pounds on an occasional basis, and anything above 21 pounds on a never basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ... [H]e probably can still sit for four hours out of the eight ... stand for four hours out of the eight, and ... walk for four hours out of the eight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Tr. 89-90.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, Dr. Kwock clarified his opinion on claimant's capacity for standing and walking. He stated that he was not opining that claimant \"could stand for four hours out of an eight-hour day plus walk four hours out of an eight-hour day,\" Tr. 105, but rather, that claimant was capable of a total of four hours of\n   standing and/or walking in an eight-hour day,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"606032\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/877/#p885\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After the ALJ heard from Dr. Kwock, she took testimony from a VE. First, she asked a hypothetical question that posited a person the ALJ described this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [T]he individual can occasionally lift and carry up to 20 pounds and frequently lift and carry up to 10 pounds. I want you to assume the individual could ... stand and/or walk for up to four hours [in] an eight-hour day and sit for four hours out of an eight-hour day, all with normal breaks. I want you to assume that the individual would not be able to climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, would not be able to crouch or crawl. Other postural activities could be performed on an occasional basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The individual would have to avoid exposure to hazards, such as unprotected heights, dangerous moving machinery, and balancing on narrow surfaces, on wet or slippery surfaces, or uneven surfaces. The individual could drive while on the job on an occasional basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Tr. 111-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to the VE, the individual the ALJ described could not do claimant's past work as a delivery-truck driver, concrete-mixing-truck driver, fuel-oil delivery driver, heavy-equipment operator, dump-truck driver, or tractor-trailer truck driver, but could perform his past work as a security guard. The VE further testified that a person with the specified RFC would be able to perform the light-duty jobs of gate guard, merchandise marker, and cashier. After indicating the number of each of those jobs that exist in the national economy, the VE further explained: \"I'm going to reduce the number of cashier's nationally by 50 percent to allow for that sit/stand option based on work assignment; convenience store cashiers, for example, may not be able to, but a retail clerk could certainly use a stool.\" Tr. 112.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The VE did not, however, adjust the number of merchandise-marker jobs in the national economy to account for a sit/stand option. Moreover, the VE did not adjust either the number of cashier jobs or the number of merchandise-marker jobs to account for the shortfall between claimant's capacities for walking/standing and sitting and the six hours of walking/standing or sitting that are generally required to perform light work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ALJ asked a second question in which the hypothetical individual was limited to uncomplicated tasks. The VE testified that the additional limitation would eliminate the security-guard and gate-guard jobs, but would allow the individual to perform the merchandise-marker and cashier jobs, along with the job of storage-facility rental clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After the VE identified jobs that claimant could still perform, the following exchange took place between the ALJ and the VE:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q And since the hypothetical limited the standing and walking to four hours out of an eight-hour day, I'm assuming that that's a deviation from the\n   <em>\n    DOT\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Dictionary of Occupational Titles\n   </em>\n   ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A That's correct.\n   <em>\n    DOT\n   </em>\n   does not -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q So upon what did you base your opinion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A - specify the sit/stand option or talk about it at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q Okay. So upon what did you base your opinion regarding that -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A I am basing that on my professional experience and my analysis of these particular positions as well as professional literature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Tr. 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After claimant's hearing, the ALJ issued a decision. In it, she determined that claimant had five severe impairments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   but also found that none of them met or medically equaled the severity of any of the impairments on the SSA's list of impairments that are per se disabling. Then she assessed claimant's RFC, in the following way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [T]he claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) except he can stand and/or walk for four hours and sit for four hours total in an eight-hour workday with normal breaks; never climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds; never crouch or crawl; occasionally balance, stoop and kneel; must avoid exposure to hazards such as unprotected heights, dangerous moving machinery and balancing on narrow surfaces, wet/slippery surfaces or uneven surfaces; could drive while on the job on an occasional basis and he is limited to uncomplicated tasks (defined as tasks that can typically be learned in thirty days or less). Due to symptoms, the claimant's concentration, persistence, and pace would be diminished to the point that productivity would be reduced but would not be more than 10% below the norm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Tr. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Based upon the testimony of the VE, the ALJ determined that claimant could not perform his past work but retained the RFC to perform the light-duty jobs of merchandise marker, cashier, and storage-facility rental clerk. Accordingly, she ruled that claimant was not under a disability from September 15, 2012, through November 2, 2016, which was the date of her decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Thus, it seems beyond dispute that an inability to walk/stand for more than four hours coupled with an inability to sit for more than four hours would affect a person's capacity to perform the full range of light work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In her hypothetical question to the VE, the ALJ posited an individual who could walk/stand for only four hours a day and who could sit for only four hours a day. The VE testified that such a person could perform three light-duty jobs. The ALJ identified a potential problem with the VE's testimony that a person who could walk/stand for only four hours was capable of light work. She described that testimony as \"a deviation from the DOT,\" Tr. 113, and to her credit, she asked the VE about it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SSR 00-4p,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201898704\">\n    2000 WL 1898704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (explaining that \"[w]hen a VE ... provides evidence about the requirements of a job or occupation, the adjudicator has an affirmative responsibility to ask about any possible conflict between that VE ... evidence and information provided in the DOT\"). As the court has noted, the VE responded to the ALJ's inquiry by referring to a sit/stand option, and her own professional experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The VE's invocation of a sit/stand option to mitigate claimant's inability to walk/stand for more than four hours a day is unavailing. With regard to the effect of a sit/stand option, the SSA has explained that \"[i]n some disability claims, the medical\n   facts lead to an assessment of RFC\n   <em>\n    which is compatible with the performance of either sedentary or light work\n   </em>\n   except that the person must alternate periods of sitting and standing.\" SSR 83-12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%2031253\">\n    1983 WL 31253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (emphasis added). In those cases, where \"an individual is not functionally capable of doing either the\n   <em>\n    prolonged\n   </em>\n   sitting contemplated in the definition of sedentary work (and for the relatively few light jobs which are preformed primarily in a seated position) or the\n   <em>\n    prolonged\n   </em>\n   standing or walking contemplated for most light work,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%2031253\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added), a VE can identify jobs in the national economy that allow for a sit/stand option, and that can be performed by a person who cannot walk/stand or sit for long uninterrupted periods of time. But, as discussed in SSR 83-12, the sit/stand option comes into play\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when a person is capable of either the six hours of walking/standing or the six hours of sitting that are required to perform one or the other of the two kinds of light-duty jobs that are described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b). In other words, the function of the sit/stand option is to spread the required six hours of walking/standing over more than six hours, not to: (1) allow less than six hours of walking/standing to satisfy the six-hour requirement; or (2) decrease the six-hours of walking/standing that is required for most light-duty jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, claimant's RFC allows for only four hours of walking/standing and four hours of sitting. There is nothing in SSR 83-12 to suggest that a sit/stand option may be used to make up for either of those functional deficits, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b) do not describe a category of light work that can be performed by a person who cannot walk/stand for more than four hours and who cannot sit for more than four hours. Thus, neither the VE's invocation of a sit/stand option nor the AJL's adoption of the VE's testimony establishes that claimant is capable of the walking/standing requirements of most light-duty jobs or the sitting requirements of those light-duty jobs that are primarily performed in a seated position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   That said, an inability to walk/stand for six hours does not necessarily preclude a person from having the RFC to perform light work, as Judge McAuliffe recognized in the case on which the Acting Commissioner relies,\n   <em>\n    Putnam v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-cv-371-SM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203320518\">\n    2011 WL 3320518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.H.

Beyond that, while the ALJ in this case gave claimant an RFC that permits no more than four hours of sitting per day, the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Putnam\n   </em>\n   could sit for at least six hours per day with no particular limitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt.
