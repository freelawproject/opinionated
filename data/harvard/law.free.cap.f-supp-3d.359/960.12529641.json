SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case is about the City of Reno's authority to grant a monopoly for the collection and disposal of certain recyclable materials. Plaintiff Green Solutions Recycling, LLC (\"GSR\") contends that the City has no such authority and unlawfully has restrained trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Act\"). Before the Court are three motions for summary judgment: (1) Defendants Reno Disposal Company, Inc. (\"Reno Disposal\") and Waste Management of Nevada, Inc.'s (\"WMON\") motion for summary judgment regarding lack of subject matter jurisdiction/standing (\"Defendants' Jurisdictional Motion\") (ECF No. 105); Defendants Reno Disposal and WMON's motion for summary judgment regarding enforceability of franchise agreement (\"Defendants' Merits Motion\") (ECF No. 106); and Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment (\"Plaintiff's Motion\") (ECF No. 113).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court has reviewed the relevant briefing (ECF Nos. 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 126) and held a hearing on these motions on December 18, 2018 (ECF No. 134). For the following reasons, the Court denies Defendants' Jurisdictional Motion, grants Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Merits Motion, and denies Plaintiff's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nevada law allows the City to \"[g]rant an exclusive franchise to any person\" for the \"[c]ollection and disposal of garbage and other waste.\" NRS \u00a7\u00a7 268.081, 268.083. Accordingly, the City entered into an exclusive franchise agreement with Reno Disposal on November 7, 2012. (ECF No. 113 at 2; ECF No. 106 at 6.) The City entered into a second exclusive franchise agreement with another entity, but Reno Disposal eventually acquired the franchise rights under that agreement as well. (ECF No. 106 at 6.) The Court refers to both franchise agreements as the \"Franchise Agreement.\" The Franchise Agreement basically grants Reno Disposal the exclusive right to pick up and remove solid waste and certain recyclable materials from commercial entities, although the Franchise Agreement uses a number of terms of art that are defined in the Franchise Agreement itself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 113-1 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff contracted with various commercial entities in the City to pick up and remove certain recyclable materials from their premises. (ECF No. 113 at 4.) Plaintiff operates by providing its customers with recycling containers in exchange for payment offset by a rebate. (ECF No. 106 at 12, 17.) For example, Plaintiff charged one customer $ 440 per bin each month and provided that customer with a rebate of $ 2.52 per bin each month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City eventually took the position that Plaintiff was violating the Franchise Agreement based on its view that Plaintiff's customers were essentially paying for Plaintiff to remove waste when Reno Disposal had the exclusive rights to remove waste. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 113 at 4.) The City informed Plaintiff's counsel that Plaintiff could pick up and remove certain recyclable materials without violating the Franchise Agreement only if Plaintiff's customers actually sold the recyclable materials instead of paying for them to be removed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, Plaintiff's customers were essentially required to realize a net profit from the arrangement, and thus the rebate would have to exceed the container rental charges. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The City informed some of Plaintiff's customers that the customers were violating the Franchise Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) In addition, counsel for Reno Disposal and WMON sent demand letters to some of Plaintiff's customers asserting that the customers were violating the Franchise Agreement. (ECF No. 113 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff asserts five claims for relief in its First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"): (1) violation of Section 1 of the Act; (2) violation of the Commerce Clause under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) violation of the Nevada Unfair Trade Practices Act, NRS \u00a7 598A.060 ; (4) tortious interference with contractual relationship; and (5) trespass to chattels. (ECF No. 48 at 7-11.) The Court has already dismissed Plaintiff's second claim for relief. (ECF No. 86 at 236.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

(ECF No. 113 at 30.) The Court finds Plaintiff's argument unpersuasive because it mischaracterizes Defendants' activity as price-fixing. Rather than artificially fixing prices for recyclable materials, the City has adopted a definition of waste that-as it must-incorporates monetary value to the producer: the City has defined waste as materials that the generator pays someone to take away. (ECF No. 113-5 at 4.) Any effect that the City's definition has\n   on the price of recyclable materials is a necessary consequence of enforcing the exclusive franchise it is entitled to grant. And even if the Court accepted Plaintiff's characterization of Defendants' activity, Defendants still have not \"fixed prices\" in the typical sense. \"Horizontal price fixing occurs when retail competitors arrange to set prices and thus interfere with free market forces.\"\n   <em>\n    Taggart v.

In support of its argument, Plaintiff notes that the Nevada legislature has not amended NRS \u00a7 268.081 to address recyclable materials even though the Nevada legislature defined \"recyclable materials\" in another statute- NRS \u00a7 444A.013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff further notes that \"recyclable materials that are not treated as waste\" are not \"solid waste\" within the meaning of another statute- NRS \u00a7 444.490 -and therefore are not \"other waste\" within the meaning of NRS \u00a7 268.081.
