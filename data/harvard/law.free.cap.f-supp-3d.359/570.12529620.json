SCHENKIER, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On March 27, 2018, plaintiff Michael Pomerantz filed suit in state court against defendants Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 Franchise Group, LLC (\"Hard Rock Franchise\") and Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 International (USA), Inc. (\"Hard Rock International\") (collectively, \"Hard Rock defendants\") and International Hotel Company, LLC, d/b/a Palace Premier and Palace Elite (\"IHC\"), alleging breach of contract, common law fraud, consumer fraud and civil conspiracy (doc. # 1: Not. of Removal, Ex. 1). On August 10, 2018, defendant IHC removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ), and on September 4, 2018, plaintiff filed an amended complaint (\"Complaint\") in federal court (doc. # 17: Compl.). On September 25, 2018, the Hard Rock defendants and IHC filed separate motions to dismiss. IHC has moved for dismissal under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), (3) and (6) (doc. # 25), and the Hard Rock defendants have moved to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b), 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) (doc. # 23). Both motions are now fully briefed. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants IHC's motion to dismiss based on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   and grants the Hard Rock defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We first set out the well-pleaded factual allegations in the Complaint.

He alleges, \"based on information and belief,\" that IHC \"does business as Palace Premier and Palace Elite\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6). Further, plaintiff alleges that IHC and the Hard Rock defendants are Florida companies that do business in Illinois (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3-5). The Hard Rock defendants submitted an affidavit from one of their directors stating that Hard Rock Franchise is not registered or licensed to do business in Illinois (Hard Rock Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 1: Affidavit of Brian Alexander, \u00b6 5). Plaintiff asserts venue is proper in this Court \"because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district\" (Compl., \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 6, 2009, plaintiff signed a \"Membership Agreement\" with Palace Premier, S.A. de C.V. (\"Palace Premier\") (Compl., Ex. A: \"Agreement\"). Mr. Pomerantz paid a \"Membership Fee\" to Palace Premier in return for a 25-year membership entitling him to stay at fourteen Mexican resorts, which plaintiff collectively refers to as the \"Original Palace Resorts\" (Compl., \u00b6 10; Agreement, Pomerantz \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 6). Mr. Pomerantz paid \"VIP preferential rates\" to obtain additional resort benefits as a \"VIP Founding Member\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11; Agreement, attachments). The Agreement contains a clause stating: \"Jurisdiction -- The parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts and tribunals of the City of Cancun, Quintana Roo in the event of any controversy over the interpretation or execution of this Agreement, ... thereby renouncing any other jurisdiction that may correspond to them by reason of present or future domicile\" (Agreement, \u00b6 10). The Agreement also contains a clause stating: \"Applicable Law -- This agreement and the documents it comprises as well as the parties thereto will be subject to the Federal Consumer Protection Act and to the Official Mexican Standard (NOM-029-SCFI-1998) published in the Federal Gazette on January 29, 1999\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9). Mr. Pomerantz and a representative of Palace Premier signed each page of the Agreement and the documents attached to the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, \"upon information and belief, in or around 2012, IHC entered into an agreement whereby a number of the Original Palace resorts would be \"rebranded\" as 'Hard Rock Hotels,' and managed in conjunction with\" the Hard Rock defendants (Compl., \u00b6 12). Plaintiff alleges that the hotels that were re-branded as Hard Rock hotels have \"failed to honor many of the membership rights of VIP founding members and Premier Level members,\" including plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13-16). In addition, plaintiff alleges the rebranded hotels have increased their \"preferential rates\" more than the maximum amount listed in the Agreement, and plaintiff \"was informed that there would be additional charges for numerous benefits and services that Plaintiff had already paid for as a VIP founding member and Premier Level member\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). The Hard Rock defendants assert that neither of them is a franchisor or licensor of IHC (Alexander Aff., \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the Membership Agreement constitutes a valid and enforceable contract between him and IHC, and\n   that IHC breached the Agreement when the rebranded hotels refused to honor its terms (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 20-22). In addition, plaintiff alleges that IHC committed common law fraud and violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act by making false and deceptive statements, in reliance upon which plaintiff entered into the Agreement (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 25-39). Lastly, plaintiff contends that IHC and Hard Rock committed civil conspiracy because they \"entered into a partnership in which, among other things, IHC and Hard Rock combined, associated, agreed or acted in concert together and/or with others for the express purpose of injuring Plaintiff and other VIP founding members and Premier Level members, including but not limited to, by orchestrating a scheme to deprive Plaintiff and other VIP founding members and Premier Level members of the benefits and services due to them under the Membership Agreement\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We address first IHC's argument that the Membership Agreement \"makes clear that all disputes concerning the interpretation or execution of the contract are to be governed by the laws of Mexico and all legal actions arising out of the contract be decided by the courts and tribunal of the City of Cancun, Quintana Roo\" (doc. # 25: IHC Mot. at 5). In other words, IHC contends that Mexico, not the Northern District of Illinois, is the proper -- indeed, the exclusive -- forum for plaintiff's claims against IHC and that Mexican law applies to this dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before examining the impact of the forum-selection clause, \"we first must identify the law that governs [its] validity ...\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Plaintiff disputes that the laws of Mexico govern this action, and argues that Illinois law should apply because IHC \"made no argument\" to the contrary (doc. # 41: Pl.'s Resp. to IHC's Mot. at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"As a general rule, in diversity cases, we look to the substantive law of the state in which the district court sits, including choice of law rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

However, the Supreme Court \"has not yet decided the\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   issue of which law governs when, as here, a federal court, sitting in diversity, evaluates a forum selection clause in the absence of a controlling federal statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184189\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/765/#p774\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted).

However, the parties completely disregard either of these sources of Mexican law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   While IHC maintains that Mexican law applies, and plaintiff argues that Illinois law applies, both parties cite only to the federal law of the United States in their arguments on the forum-selection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although it is within our discretion to nevertheless attempt to determine Mexican law, it is well-settled that \"choice of law issues may be waived or forfeited by declining to assert them in litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Orgone Capital III, LLC v.

As each party cited only to the federal law of the United States in support of its choice of forum arguments, plaintiff and IHC have waived their arguments that Mexican or Illinois law should apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

In\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit reviewed an agreement to purchase timeshare interests in a resort based in Mexico. The contract stated, as relevant here, that \"in case of controversy on the interpretation and compliance with the rights and obligations of this Agreement, the parties hereby agree to submit themselves to the applicable laws and competent courts of the City of Mexico, Federal District, expressly waiving any other forum that may correspond to them by reason of their present or future domiciles.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645620\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/436/\">\n    702 F.3d at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants sought dismissal based on that contractual provision, but neither side sought to apply Mexican law to interpret the forum-selection clause; instead, \"their debate over its enforceability [wa]s framed entirely as a dispute about American law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645620\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/436/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Seventh Circuit held that \"[b]y ignoring Mexican law and citing only federal cases in their briefs, the parties have disclaimed reliance on any distinctive features of Mexican law in interpreting their forum selection clause.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645620\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/436/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the appeals court held that the issue of the applicable law had been waived.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645620\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/436/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

We therefore find that IHC has waived its argument that Mexican law applies, and plaintiff has waived his argument that Illinois law applies for purposes of IHC's motion to dismiss. Thus, we proceed, as the parties do, by applying\n   United States federal law to determine the effect of the forum-selection clause in the Membership Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   IHC argues that based on the forum-selection clause, plaintiff's lawsuit should be dismissed for improper venue under Rule 12(b)(3) (IHC Mot. at 5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As stated above, the forum-selection clause in the Membership Agreement provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Jurisdiction -- The parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts and tribunals of the City of Cancun, Quintana Roo in the event of any controversy over the interpretation or execution of this Agreement, including Attachment \"A\", thereby renouncing any other jurisdiction that may correspond to them by reason of present or future domicile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Agreement, \u00b6 10). Plaintiff advances several arguments to support his contention that this clause does not require him to bring his claims against IHC in Mexico.

Indeed, the Supreme Court has held \"a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a court ... 'improper' within the meaning of ... Rule 12(b)(3).\"\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine Const. Co. v.

Although IHC \"ha[s] not formally moved to dismiss based on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , the dismissal motion plainly invoked the forum-selection clause and asked th[is] [C]ourt to enforce.\"\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266102\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/890/#p895\">\n    880 F.3d at 894-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like the district court in\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   , we treat IHC's motion \"as, in substance, a\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   motion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266102\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/890/#p895\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266102\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/890/#p895\">\n    at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we reject plaintiff's argument that IHC has waived its forum-selection argument by attaching the wrong label to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition, to the extent plaintiff claims that Paragraph 10 of the Agreement is a forum-selection clause, we disagree. Plaintiff notes that Paragraph 10 does not use the word \"venue,\" and he contends that the language \"is at best ambiguous as to venue\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 7). But, the absence of the word \"venue\" does not render ambiguous the meaning of Paragraph 10: it clearly is directed to choice of forum. The language in the Membership Agreement is similar to that in the forum-selection clause at issue in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , which did not use the word \"venue\" but stated that the parties to that contract \"agree to submit themselves to the ... competent courts of the City of Mexico, Federal District, expressly waiving any other forum that may correspond to them by reason of their present or future domiciles.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645620\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/436/\">\n    702 F.3d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Seventh Circuit has held that \"[r]elevant public interest factors include the administrative difficulties stemming from court congestion; the local interest in having localized disputes decided at home; the interest in having the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the law that must govern the action; the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflicts of laws or in the application of foreign law; and the unfairness of burdening citizens in an unrelated forum with jury duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Fischer v.

These factors do not \"overwhelmingly disfavor\" dismissal for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff contends that there is no issue of congestion in this District, but he does not provide any factual or legal support for this contention, and he improperly ignores issues of congestion, if any, in the pre-selected forum of Cancun, Mexico (Pl.'s Resp. at 6-7).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff contends that \"there is an interest in having parties who do business in the United States and contract with citizens of the United States having their disputes heard in US Courts\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). However, not only does plaintiff again forgo factual and legal support for his contention, he also ignores Mexico's interest -- and, more particularly, Cancun's interest -- in having the dispute decided there, where the Agreement was executed and where the subject matter of the Agreement is based.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff argues that Mexican law does not apply, and thus, that there will be no issues with conflicts of laws or application of foreign law (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, as explained above, plaintiff and IHC have waived the choice of law argument for purposes of the instant motion. And, we do not know which law a Mexican court would apply in determining a dispute over the Membership Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff contends that \"there is no unfair burden on citizens sitting as jurors in a case in the Northern\n   District of Illinois involving a Cook County resident and businesses which did businesses in this District\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's argument again applies the wrong standard and lacks factual and legal support. Indeed, it is this district, not Mexico, that appears to be the forum \"unrelated\" to the dispute over the Agreement: plaintiff signed the Membership Agreement in Mexico to obtain membership in resorts located in Mexico. Therefore, we find that plaintiff has not met his burden of showing that public interest factors overwhelmingly disfavor dismissal for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff next contends that the forum-selection clause in the Agreement at most means that any dispute may be brought in Mexico, but \"does not require that venue must be in Mexico\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 7).

The parties to the Agreement not only \"agree[d] to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts and tribunals of the City of Cancun, Quintana Roo in the event of any controversy over the interpretation or execution of this Agreement,\" they further \"renounce[d] any other jurisdiction that may correspond to them by reason of present or future domicile\" (Agreement, \u00b6 10).

That argument is makeweight. IHC is free to offer alternative arguments in support of dismissal. And, as our foregoing discussion explains, plaintiff has not carried his burden of showing that he may disregard the forum selection clause to which he agreed.

Plaintiff argues that \"breaches of the Membership Agreement harmed\" him and constitute \"overt acts taken pursuant to the conspiracy\" to deprive him of the benefits and services due him under the Agreement (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff's reliance on IHC's alleged breach of contract to provide the requisite underlying conduct for a civil conspiracy is misplaced. The Illinois Supreme Court has explained that \"[a] cause of action for civil conspiracy exists only if one of the parties to the agreement commits some act in furtherance of the agreement, which is itself a tort.\"\n   <em>\n    Adcock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Ill.%20Dec.%20636\">\n    206 Ill.Dec. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=645%20N.E.2d%20888\">\n    645 N.E.2d at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This dismissal is without prejudice. If plaintiff seeks to amend his complaint, he should be mindful of two additional issues.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Court is not ruling here on the Hard Rock defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The parties have raised multiple disputes over material facts on this issue, and ruling on the pleadings at this point would be premature.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , although the Hard Rock defendants did not raise the issue of the forum-selection clause in their motion to dismiss, it is an issue worthy of the parties' consideration if there is an attempt to replead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645620\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/436/\">\n    702 F.3d at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"because Raintree was entitled to remove the case to Mexico under the forum selection clause ..., the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   clicks in and would require the dismissal of the claim against Starwood as well, even if it weren't entitled to enforce the forum selection clause....

Because we dismiss the claims against IHC based on\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    , we do not reach IHC's contention that it is not the party which contracted with plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The \"Federal Consumer Protection Law\" of Mexico is a 38-page English-language document whose purpose is \"to promote and protect the rights and culture of consumers, and to seek fairness, assurance, and legal certainty in relations between suppliers and consumers.\" https://www.profeco.gob.mx/juridico/pdfl_lfpc_06062006_ingles.pdf.
