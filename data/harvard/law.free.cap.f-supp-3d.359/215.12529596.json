Although the Felder Amendment does not refer to religious schools on its face, Young Advocates for Fair Education (\"\n   <strong>\n    YAFFED\n   </strong>\n   \"), a non-profit group that advocates for improved secular education in the Hasidic Jewish community, argues that the Amendment was designed to reduce the level of secular education that must be taught in private Hasidic Jewish schools without changing the educational requirements applicable to other private schools, including other religious schools. (ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   YAFFED brought this action on July 23, 2018, alleging that the Felder Amendment violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

For parents who choose a traditional yeshiva education for their children, it is an important pillar of continuity within the Hasidic community, assuring that their beliefs will be reliably passed on from one\n   generation to the next, and instilling an invaluable sense of Jewish identity and belonging. (ECF No. 44 (\"Twerski Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 5-12). Proponents argue that these schools are \"the primary vehicle responsible for inculcating Jewish values, Jewish learning and Jewish living, are responsible for the rebirth of the Jewish community out of the ashes of destruction in Eastern Europe, and are what today ensures and allows for the continuity and growth of the Jewish community in New York and around the country.\" (Twerski Decl. \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This lawsuit comes in the midst of an ongoing dispute over the quality and efficacy of the secular education being provided at Hasidic yeshivas.

The Felder Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Felder Amendment was introduced by State Senator Simcha Felder and passed both chambers of the State Legislature on March 30, 2018. It was signed into law by Governor Cuomo on April 12, 2018, whereupon it took immediate effect. The Amendment applies only to schools that are organized as a not-for-profit corporation, have a bilingual program, and operate during certain specified hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203204\">\n    N.Y.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76, 80; Moster Decl. \u00b6 39). Although there is little official legislative history accompanying the Amendment, statements by Senator Felder appear to confirm that the Amendment was drafted with these yeshivas in mind. (Bridges Ex. 11, at 7; Bridges Ex. 30, at 4). Because it is not certain to which schools the Amendment will apply in practice, the Court will simply refer to private schools covered by the Felder Amendment as \"\n   <strong>\n    covered schools\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Substantively, the Amendment has three basic parts. First, it provides that the Commissioner of Education, rather than local school authorities, shall determine whether a covered school's education is \"substantially equivalent\" to that of a public school within the city or district where its students reside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203204\">\n    N.Y.

Responsibility for making such determinations with respect to non-covered schools remains in the hands of local school authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, the Amendment provides that, in assessing whether covered schools provide a \"substantially equivalent\" education, NYSED \"shall consider ... if the curriculum provides academically rigorous instruction that develops critical thinking skills in the school's students,\" \"taking into account the entirety of the curriculum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3204(2)(ii), (iii). The statute clarifies, however, that NYSED's review is \"not limited to\" these considerations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3204(2)(ii), (iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Third, with respect to elementary and middle schools covered by the Amendment, NYSED's review must \"includ[e]\" an assessment of whether the school is adequately teaching four core classes: English; mathematics; history (which need not include United States history); and science (which the statute defines broadly as \"learning how to gather, analyze and interpret observable data, using deductive and inductive reasoning to support a hypothesis, and [learning] how to differentiate between correlational and causal relationships\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3204(2)(ii).

As indicated by the Amendment's use of open-ended language such as \"including\" and \"not limited to,\" the specific educational criteria set forth in the Amendment establish a floor rather than a ceiling. NYSED could deem schools to be compliant with the Education Law's substantial equivalence mandate if they meet these minimal requirements. Alternatively, NYSED could impose learning standards that go above and beyond these statutory requirements, and deem any schools that fall beneath these heightened standards noncompliant with the substantial equivalence mandate-even if the schools provide the basic level of instruction required in the Felder Amendment itself. Either is a permissible interpretation of the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, the Amendment permits NYSED to treat covered schools more leniently than non-covered schools, but it does not require that it do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Revised Guidelines\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 20, 2018, nearly four months after YAFFED filed this lawsuit, NYSED released revised guidelines that describe the factors that educational officials will consider when reviewing private schools for substantial equivalence (the \"Revised Guidelines\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Revised Guidelines were drafted over the course of a nearly two-year consultative process that commenced long before the Felder Amendment was conceived. (Coughlin Decl. \u00b6 4). These guidelines apply to all\n   private schools, not just covered schools, although they take the statutory mandates contained in the Felder Amendment into consideration. Like the Prior Guidelines, which they superseded, the Revised Guidelines do not have the binding force of law. Nevertheless, because the Commissioner has ultimate review power over all substantial equivalency determinations in the State, the Revised Guidelines are a reliable indicator of how the substantial equivalence requirement, including the Felder Amendment, will be enforced in practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With minor exceptions, the Revised Guidelines incorporate the curricular standards contained in the Education Law and its implementing regulations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.Y. Educ. L., Title I, Art. 17;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3204(3)(a); 8 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7\u00a7 100.2 - 100.5, 135.3 - 135.4, and apply them to all private schools. In this sense, the Revised Guidelines are largely a continuation of the Prior Guidelines, albeit with some changes and clarifications. The Revised Guidelines come with \"Toolkits,\" which are simply checklists of factors that will be reviewed by education officials when making their determination, and each factor corresponds to a specific provision of the Education Law or the regulations promulgated thereunder. The Toolkits are accompanied by an appendix, which sets forth a detailed list of course requirements for private schools at various grade levels and, for some grades, the number of hours per week that must be devoted to each subject. Core subjects such as mathematics, science, English, social studies, art and health must be taught throughout elementary, middle and high schools. In grades 7 and 8, the Revised Guidelines require approximately 3 \u00bd hours of secular studies per day. For high schools, the Revised Guidelines incorporate by reference Section 100.5 of the Commissioner's regulations, which also generally require more than three hours per day of secular studies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7\u00a7 100.1(a), 100.5 ; New York State Department of Education, \"Guidance on New York Diploma Requirements,\"\n   <em>\n    http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/currentdiplomarequirements2.pdf\n   </em>\n   . These course requirements \"may be met by incorporating, or integrating, the State learning standards\" into other courses. Although the Revised Guidelines do not say so explicitly, this would permit private schools to integrate secular subjects into religious classes, provided that the school meets all unit of study requirements and provides students with instruction that enables them to achieve State learning standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Critically, these requirements, including the specific curriculum and hours requirements set forth in the Toolkit appendices, are identical for all private schools in the state,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     regardless of whether they are covered by the Felder Amendment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Indeed, there are only two respects in which the Revised Guidelines differentiate between covered and non-covered schools. First, per paragraph (v) of the Felder Amendment,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L%20%C2%A7%203204\">\n    N.Y. Educ. L \u00a7 3204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(v), substantial equivalence is determined by NYSED for covered schools, albeit with an initial review and \"recommendation\" by local school authorities, which NYSED may in its discretion accept or reject. Second, for covered schools, NYSED is required to consider the educational standards imposed by the Felder Amendment-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether \"curriculum provides academically rigorous instruction that develops critical thinking skills in the school's students,\" \"taking into account the entirety of the curriculum,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L%20%C2%A7%203204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3204(2)(ii), (iii), and whether the Felder Amendment's learning standards in English, mathematics, history and science are being provided in covered elementary and middle schools,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L%20%C2%A7%203204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3204(2)(ii) -but these factors are\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supplemental to\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , rather than\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     in lieu of\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the\n   more detailed course and hour requirements applicable to (both covered and non-covered) private schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The great irony, therefore, is that even though YAFFED alleges that the Felder Amendment was designed to reduce the amount of secular education provided at Hasidic yeshivas, it may have precisely the opposite effect. As mentioned previously, the Felder Amendment is drafted permissively and affords NYSED great discretion in imposing curricular standards supplemental to what is set forth in the statute. By promulgating the Revised Guidelines, the Commissioner has exercised that discretion to require covered schools to comply with all of the same curriculum and hour requirements applicable to other private schools,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     plus\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the skill sets enumerated in the Felder Amendment. However, despite the positions it has taken elsewhere,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   YAFFED has not sought leave to amend its complaint, and it continues to seek an injunction against enforcement of the Felder Amendment and NYSED's guidelines, arguing that the Felder Amendment reflects an unconstitutional preference for Hasidic Jewish schools vis-\u00e0-vis other schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Legal formalities aside, it is apparent that the real question in this case is how to balance two competing values, both of which must be cherished in a free and democratic society, but either one of which, if allowed to expand to its logical conclusion, would swallow the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On one side is the right of every child to a sound basic education, the actualization of which \"is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Here, it is the first of these factors-whether YAFFED has established an injury in fact-that occupies our standing analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Naftuli Moster, YAFFED's founder and Executive Director, describes the purpose of YAFFED as advocating for the improvement of \"secular education in the Orthodox Jewish community, in particular in the Hasidic community,\" which YAFFED believes \"must include a real and substantial secular component.\" (Moster Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6). YAFFED's primary goal before the enactment of the Felder Amendment was to bring Hasidic schools into compliance with the Education Law's substantial equivalence mandate. These efforts have included lobbying State and local officials for greater oversight, direct outreach aimed at the Hasidic community, and educating the larger public about the issue. (Moster Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9). YAFFED also engages in other efforts, including compiling and publishing data on Hasidic education, providing resources and referrals to members of the Hasidic community seeking a secular education for themselves or their children, and publishing a Yiddish newsletter about the importance of secular education that reaches almost 20,000 Hasidic homes. (Moster Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   YAFFED primarily argues that it has standing because it has spent significant effort opposing the Amendment, both in this Court and through other avenues, and thereby \"shift[ed] valuable resources away from its traditional advocacy and education efforts.\" (Compl. \u00b6 92; Moster Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-58). However, if the Court were to accept this argument, it would be difficult to conceive of a case in which an organization or individual would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have standing to challenge a statute that they find politically or socially disagreeable. \"Individual persons cannot obtain judicial review of otherwise non-justiciable claims simply by incorporating, drafting a mission statement, and then suing on behalf of the newly formed and extremely interested organization.\"\n   <em>\n    National Treasury Employees Union v.

Cir. 1996). If any plaintiff with a strong objection to a statute could manufacture standing by spending time and money opposing that very statute-and then arguing that the expenditure of that time and money was itself an injury-there would be no real constraint upon standing at all, except perhaps the size of the plaintiff's bank account. This would conflict with the Supreme Court's admonition that the federal judiciary not be converted into \"publicly funded forums for the ventilation of public grievances.\"\n   <em>\n    Valley Forge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189548\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/464/#p472\">\n    454 U.S. at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189548\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/464/#p472\">\n    102 S.Ct. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he 'cases and controversies' language of Art.

Accordingly, the appropriate standing inquiry is whether the challenged state law, because of its detrimental effect on the community served by the organization (or upon the organization itself), will require the organization to devote resources remediating the law's harmful effects in a way that limits its ability to provide the same level of services as before. If so, the organization's institutional mission has been harmed. By contrast, an organization whose primary endeavor is to change or enforce the law, whether by communicating directly with government officials, community leaders, or the public, occupies no position different from that of a concerned citizen. And whatever else may be said of the standing doctrine, it clearly forbids citizen suits.

Such is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   YAFFED's diversion-of-resources argument, to the extent it has any merit, must be grounded in the prospect that the Felder Amendment will ultimately result in Hasidic yeshivas offering a substandard\n   secular education, compared to the instruction that they would offer if the Felder Amendment were declared void. After all, it is YAFFED's mission-\"to ensure that all students within the ultra-Orthodox community receive the critical tools and skill sets needed for long-term personal growth and self-sufficient futures\"-that the Felder Amendment is alleged to frustrate. (Compl. \u00b6 15). However, as discussed above, the Felder Amendment by its terms does not require education officials to grant any such accommodation, and NYSED has issued guidelines which, for all intents and purposes, impose identical curriculum requirements on all private schools in the state, regardless of whether they are covered by the Felder Amendment. While the Revised Guidelines also require NYSED to consider the criteria set forth in the specific statutory text of the Felder Amendment when evaluating covered schools, this requirement would, if anything, subject those schools to a\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   standard than non-covered schools. There is no indication that covered schools that fall short of the specific course and hour requirements in the Revised Guideline Toolkits will be deemed to comply with the substantial equivalence requirement so long as they meet the more relaxed Felder Amendment standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   What YAFFED essentially seeks is an advisory opinion as to the constitutionality of the Felder Amendment, based on the possibility that NYSED might, in the future, apply it in a manner that disadvantages students at Hasidic yeshivas.

For that reason, the Court denies YAFFED's motion for a preliminary injunction, and does not consider whether YAFFED would be likely to prevail on its claim that the Felder Amendment infringes upon the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, or whether, as the PEARLS Amici argue, the Felder Amendment is a necessary accommodation of religion under the Free Exercise and Due Process Clauses.

It prevents courts from declaring the meaning of the law in a vacuum and from constructing generalized legal rules unless the resolution of an actual dispute requires it. But when a court declares that a case is not prudentially ripe, it means that the case will be\n    <em>\n     better\n    </em>\n    decided later and that the parties will not have constitutional rights undermined by the delay. It does not mean that the case is not a real or concrete dispute affecting cognizable current concerns of the parties within the meaning of Article III. ... Prudential ripeness is, then a tool that courts may use to enhance the accuracy of their decisions and to avoid becoming embroiled in adjudications that may later turn out to be unnecessary or may require premature examination of, especially, constitutional issues that time may make easier or less controversial.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    <em>\n     National Organization for Marriage\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864425\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/682/#p688\">\n     714 F.3d at 688\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Simmonds v.
