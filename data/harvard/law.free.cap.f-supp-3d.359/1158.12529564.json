Plaintiff worked for Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (\"Asbury\"), a local car dealership. Stip. \u00b6 2. On March 5, 2011, Plaintiff was a passenger in a Nissan Altima owned by Asbury when he was rear-ended by the at-fault driver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the accident, Plaintiff was covered by an auto liability insurance policy identified as AV2-651-290229-021 (the \"Policy\") with a coverage limit of up to $ 2,000,000.00 for bodily injury, while the at-fault driver's policy had a coverage limit of $ 50,000.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. Defendant issued the Policy to Asbury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Policy was originally attached in a string of emails that passed from Defendant to Marsh USA, Inc. (\"Marsh\"), who was an insurance broker for Asbury. (Doc. 59.1 \u00b6 6). Marsh accepted the Policy on behalf of Asbury and Asbury contends that the Policy was never intended to provide UM coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Both Asbury and Defendant cite to the Policy under the \"Garage Liability\" section, which provides that UM coverage is \"Rejected/Statutory Minimum[.]\" (Doc. 59.1 at 33).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 25, 2011, Asbury, for the first time, sent Defendant a Florida UM insurance rejection form. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 14. The parties both move for summary judgment. Plaintiff claims that the undisputed facts show that Asbury did not reject UM coverage prior to the accident. Defendant claims that the undisputed facts show that Asbury\n   never had UM coverage. Both parties agree that it is Asbury's rejection of UM coverage vel non that that controls the outcome of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's argument is that Defendants provided personal injury protection insurance which, by operation of Florida statutes, means that Defendants provided an equal amount of uninsured motorist insurance absent express written rejection. (Doc. 44 at 5-6). Plaintiff contends that Asbury's written rejection occurred after the accident and therefore UM coverage was in place at the time of Plaintiff's accident. Defendant and Asbury claim that Asbury is a sophisticated purchaser of insurance and that the \"paper trail\" and testimony of Asbury and Defendant's agents establish that Asbury never intended to obtain UM coverage. (Doc. 59 at 8-9). Despite the lack of a timely written rejection on an approved form, Defendant argues that Florida case law allows for an insured to waive UM coverage orally or in \"other\" ways.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Florida Statutes section 627.727(1) requires insurance policies providing bodily injury coverage to also provide UM coverage unless \"an insured named in the policy makes a written rejection of the coverage on behalf of all insureds under the policy.\" Section 627.727(1) also reads that \"[t]he rejection or selection of lower limits [of UM coverage] shall be made on a form approved by the office.\" Yet, there are a string of Florida cases that conclude an insured can waive its right to UM coverage orally or without using the approved form.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Del Prado v.

Section 627.727(1)\"was amended, effective October 1, 1982, to require that the rejection of UM/UIM coverage specified in the statute be\n   <em>\n    in writing\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7522049\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/574/1142/#p1146\">\n    574 So.2d 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1146 (Fla. 1st DCA 1991) (emphasis in original). None of the cases cited by Defendant and none of those mentioned above reconcile\n   <em>\n    Del Prado\n   </em>\n   and the significance of the 1982 amendment and later versions of section 627.727(1), which required waiver of UM coverage to be in writing. Nor is the Court convinced by Defendant's argument that the requirement that waiver of UM coverage be in writing is merely a shifting evidentiary standard by relying on a separate sentence that reads \"[i]f this form is signed by a\n   named insured, if will be conclusively presumed that there was an informed, knowing rejection of coverage or election of lower limits on behalf of all insureds.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.727\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 627.727(1) reflects a \"legislative intent to place a heavy duty upon insurers to obtain a knowing rejection of statutorily provided for uninsured motorist limits and to reflect a public policy in Florida to favor full uninsured motorist coverage for Florida residents ....\"\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Marchesano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7595061\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/482/422/#p424\">\n    482 So.2d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424-25 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985),\n   <em>\n    approved,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7577338\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/506/410/\">\n    506 So.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1987). To allow an insured to orally waive its right to have UM coverage unless waived on a specific approved written form would frustrate the purpose of the 1982 amendment. Moreover, there are multiple rights provided in section 627.727, including (1) the right to UM coverage when purchasing bodily injury insurance (substantive right) and (2) to have the right to UM coverage waived\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when in writing (procedural right). To allow alternative or less onerous waivers of the procedural right to only have UM coverage waived through an approved written form renders the procedural right meaningless. The Florida Legislature would be left to answer the question, \"Why ever bother to require that a right only be waived in writing?\" The Legislature should not have to confront this question where it has made its intent clear.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larimore v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8157257\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/2/101/#p106\">\n    2 So.3d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 (Fla. 2008),\n   <em>\n    as revised on denial of reh'g\n   </em>\n   (Jan. 29, 2009) (holding that a \"statute should be interpreted to give effect to every clause in it, and to accord meaning and harmony to all of its parts.\") (internal quotations omitted). Finally, Defendant fails to offer an explanation as to why some rights, such as the one to have purchases of real estate made in writing are not waivable, while rights to have UM coverage unless waived in writing are waivable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   More importantly, Defendant's construction contradicts the plain language of section 627.727(1). The Florida Supreme Court held that when interpreting a statute, there is no need to resort to rules of statutory construction \"when the language of a statute is plain and its meaning clear....\"\n   <em>\n    Kimbrell v.

Section 627.717(1) unambiguously requires a waiver of UM coverage to be in writing before that waiver can be effective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jervis v.

However, it is also undisputed that Asbury did not waive UM coverage on an approved form prior to Plaintiff's accident. Defendant argues that other documents prove that Asbury rejected UM coverage in writing. When reviewing these documents, the Court resolves any ambiguities in the insurance contract against Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington Nat. Ins. Corp. v.

Starting on page 6, the \"Garage Coverage Form/Policy Declarations\" document provides that the reader should see the state schedule of limits for benefits and that the price for UM coverage is included in the premium. On page 7, the section providing for UM insurance schedule reads that \"[i]f UM coverage is afforded in ... FL ... UIM coverage is included[.]\" The email chain begins on page 9 and does not mention UM coverage or waiver thereof. On page 17 of the policy under \"Garage Liability\" UM coverage is listed as \"Rejected/Statutory Minimum\" and references \"symbol 26.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Page 28 reads that the amount of UM benefits available are \"[s]tatutory[.]\" Page 33 appears to mirror page 17 in all material aspects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   No reasonable jury could find that these documents waived UM benefits, much less unambiguously waives them or waived them in a manner consistent with section 627.717(1). In fact, while the record is that Asbury intended to waive UM benefits, the Court cannot find any evidence that Asbury actually waived (1) its rights to have\n   any waiver in writing or (2) its right to UM coverage, orally or otherwise. To the extent any waiver might have occurred orally or on a non-approved insurance waiver form, such waiver would not be effective because that waiver failed to comply with section 672.727(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The undisputed evidence is that there was not a timely waiver of UM benefits and alternatively, any alleged waiver in this case did not comply with 672.727(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, after due consideration, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1.
