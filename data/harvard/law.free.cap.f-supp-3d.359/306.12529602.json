MB Goldsmiths alleges breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and bad faith refusal to settle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [D.E. 1-2] \u00b6\u00b6 26-41. It seeks $ 25,000 in damages on each claim and $ 25,000 in punitive damages on its bad faith claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 26, 2017, Jewelers Mutual removed the action to this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [D.E. 1]. On May 3, 2018, Jewelers Mutual moved for summary judgment [D.E. 19], filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 20], and filed a statement of material facts [D.E. 21]. On May 24, 2018, MB Goldsmiths responded in opposition [D.E. 23] and moved for partial summary judgment on the breach of contract claim [D.E. 27]. As explained below, the court grants Jewelers Mutual's motion for summary judgment and denies MB Goldsmiths's motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   MB Goldsmiths, a jewelry store originally located in Raleigh, North Carolina, alleges that a foul odor began to permeate its leased premises during the fall of 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 1-2] \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 13; [D.E. 21] \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. The smell, which resembled \"rotten eggs and mold,\" prompted daily customer comments. [D.E. 21] \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 10. MB Goldsmiths hired plumbers to investigate the odor. The plumbers speculated that a grease trap on the adjacent Chinese restaurant's premises was the cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

MB Goldsmiths contends that the \"majority of the customer complaints indicated that the odor smelled like sewage\" as opposed to moldy. [D.E. 24] \u00b6 4 (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2014, Michael Borovsky (\"Borovsky\"), the owner of MB Goldsmiths,\n   first noticed a water leak on the premises.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 21] \u00b6 13. A water tank in an adjacent restaurant caused the leak.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    \u00b6 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The inspection found visible mold growth in the store and a high level of mold in the interior air sample.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 22-2] 2-3. Sometime during 2015, a store clerk noticed the mold begin to \"bubble.\" [D.E. 21] \u00b6 16. The store clerk could not recall the precise date on which she made this observation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 24] \u00b6 16. In June 2015, MB Goldsmiths closed its Raleigh location and operated online until November 1, 2015, when it opened a new location in Graham, North Carolina. [D.E. 21] \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20; [D.E. 1-2] \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 24, 2015, MB Goldsmiths submitted a claim to Jewelers Mutual for \"business interruption\" and claimed only \"loss of future business income resulting from the necessity of vacating the leased premises due to the presence of mold.\" [D.E. 21] \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26, 30. The parties dispute whether the foul odor or the high levels of toxic mold caused MB Goldsmiths to lose business income.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 21] \u00b6 30,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 24] \u00b6 30. In addition, MB Goldsmiths did not submit a claim for damage to its business personal property because, aside from one bookcase, MB Goldsmiths did not suffer any business personal property damage as a result of the issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 21] \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 27, 2015, Jewelers Mutual assigned the claim to an independent claims adjuster.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    \u00b6 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . MB Goldsmiths provided Jewelers Mutual with the foul odor petition from 2014, a report summarizing Raleigh Mold Inspection and Remediation's inspection, and other materials relevant to the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    \u00b6 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the report stated that it \"is unclear if [the odor] is related to the water damage,\" it recommended denying MB Goldsmiths's claim for coverage because the water leak fell within the insurance policy's exclusion for continuous water damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 22-15] 3-4; [D.E. 22-5] 93. The report also recommended denying coverage for the claim because the damage was limited to building materials for which MB Goldsmiths did not maintain coverage and because MB Goldsmiths did not provide prompt notice of the claim as required by the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 22-15] 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 2, 2015, Jewelers Mutual denied the claim because the insurance policy \"excluded coverage for loss or damage caused by a long-term water leakage and mold\" and because MB Goldsmiths failed to provide prompt notice of the loss. [D.E. 21] \u00b6 33. MB Goldsmiths contends that the water leak from the adjacent restaurant was not the sole cause of the odor, which it argues was never identified conclusively. [D.E. 24] \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Furthermore, MB Goldsmiths denies that it failed to submit a timely claim because Borovsky believed that the landlord would provide assistance and saw no immediate need to involve Jewelers Mutual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 23, 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when, after reviewing the record as a whole, the court determines that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the\n   moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
