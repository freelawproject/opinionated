INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Kevin Michael Brophy, Jr. brings this diversity action asserting various state law claims for privacy and publicity rights against Defendants Belcalis Almanzar, aka Cardi B, KSR Group LLC, Washpoppin, Inc., and Does 1 through 20. (Dkt. 1 [Complaint, hereinafter \"Compl.\"].) Defendant Cardi B is an entertainer whose popularity and notoriety are \"ever-increasing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 26.) Plaintiff's core allegation is that Defendants misappropriated his likeness by placing an image on the cover of one of Cardi B's albums that \"explicitly misrepresents [P]laintiff having sex with Cardi B.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss the Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim. (Dkts. 21 [Notice of Motion and Motion], 24 [Corrected Motion, hereinafter \"Mot.\"].) Plaintiff opposes Defendants' motion on various grounds and requests an opportunity to conduct jurisdictional discovery. (Dkt. 28 [Opposition, hereinafter \"Opp.\"] at 21.) For the following reasons, the Court finds that jurisdictional discovery should be allowed to resolve the issues of personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction in this case. As a result, Defendants' motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiff's request for jurisdictional discovery is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges the following facts in his Complaint. Plaintiff is a resident of Los Angeles who is employed by a \"surfing and lifestyle company.\" (Compl. \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff also formerly worked in the entertainment industry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Cardi B is a resident of New Jersey, a \"former stripper,\" and an \"entertainer from the Bronx who dabbled in reality television.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 19.) Cardi B is also the principal of Defendant Washpoppin, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Defendant KSR Group, LLC is Cardi B's agent, and is a New York limited liability company with its principal place of business in New York City, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For over ten years, Plaintiff has \"had a unique tattoo across his entire back depicting a tiger battling a snake.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1) Plaintiff includes the following picture of the tattoo on his back in his Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) \"Plaintiff has never seen his tattoo on another person, and he is informed and believes that the artist who inked it has not given it to any other person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff also claims that because his work requires him to \"wear board shorts but no shirt regularly, his back and tattoos are frequently exposed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) So, his back tattoo has become a unique feature recognized by his friends, his business, and the surfing community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff claims that \"[p]eople can instantly recognize him by his tiger snake tattoo,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and that his Instagram profile has nearly 10,000 followers, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Plaintiff, Defendants have misappropriated Plaintiff's back tattoo in \"a misleading, offensive, humiliating and provocatively sexual way to launch [Cardi B's] career in music and entertainment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Specifically, without Plaintiff's knowledge or consent, Defendants used an image of Plaintiff's back tattoo on the cover of Cardi B's \"career launching mixtape Gangsta Bitch Music Vol. 1 ('Gangsta Bitch').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This mixtape was released in March 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff describes the cover as depicting \"Cardi B forcing [P]laintiff to perform cunnilingus on her, holding him face-down between her legs-his unique back tattoo and likeness features conspicuously at the center of the image-while she drains a 24-counce bottle of Corona Extra beer and stares lustfully into the camera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Plaintiff includes the following copy of the Gangsta Bitch cover in his Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Gangsta Bitch was Cardi B's first mixtape, which launched her career as a rapper and a social media personality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff further claims that the image of Plaintiff on the cover of Gangsta Bitch boosted the popularity of the mixtape, and promotes Cardi B's \"no filter attitude.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also claims that image depicting \"[P]laintiff as her sex toy\" is \"designed to attract consumers to the [sic] Cardi B edgy persona, and to promote her music and her image as a hard, dominant and aggressive rapper.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he has never met Cardi B or any other Defendant, and did not consent to the use of his image. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Plaintiff only became aware of the Gangsta Bitch cover approximately eight months ago when his friend asked him about it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff claims that when he saw the cover he was \"shocked, outraged, humiliated, and appalled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff further claims that since he learned about the cover, he has had to face persistent uncomfortable questions and comments about the cover, and he has felt \"ridiculed, disgusted, and humiliated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff also alleges that his family life has been negatively affected, that his wife and children have experienced trauma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Plaintiff claims that his son, who is attending a Christian pre-kindergarten school, saw the Gangsta Bitch cover when Plaintiff and his wife were looking at it, and that his son refers to the cover periodically, \"to [P]laintiff's chagrin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that while he is suffering from the use of his image on the Gangsta Bitch cover, Cardi B's popularity is increasing and the cover is being widely displayed across the internet and other media. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.) Plaintiff further believes that the use of his image \"was fundamental to launching her popularity and notoriety, including sales of Gangsta Bitch and all of her later music and commercial value.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiff brings claims for misappropriation of likeness or identity, violation of California Civil Code \u00a7 3344, and false light. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-55.) Defendants move to dismiss these claims for lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim.

First, Plaintiff claims the Gangsta Bitch cover is widely displayed across the internet, in print, and in other commercial media. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.)

Plaintiff claims there is specific jurisdiction over Defendants because they actively promoted Gangsta Bitch to California consumers by holding a release party for the mixtape in Los Angeles and promoting the mixtape during a tour in the cities of Oakland and Los Angeles. (Opp. at 16.) Plaintiff also claims that Defendants sent copies of the Gangsta Bitch cover to California companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also claims that the Court should exercise general jurisdiction over Defendants based on \"the litany of Cardi B's contacts with and regular and routine appearances in California, and [D]efendants' revenue streams flowing from California consumers whom they target directly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.)

(Compl. \u00b6 30.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts supporting this estimation of his damages. (Mot. at 11.) In his opposition, Plaintiff argues that the amount in controversy requirement is met because it is appropriately pleaded on the face of his Complaint.
