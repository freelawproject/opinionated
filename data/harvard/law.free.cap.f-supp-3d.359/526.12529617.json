They wish to carry concealed firearms pursuant to the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (\"LEOSA\"), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926C. Subsection (a) of this statute permits \"an individual who is a qualified retired law enforcement officer and who is carrying the identification required by subsection (d)\" to carry a concealed firearm. As defined in subsection (c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a\n   \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" must, among other things, have \"separated from service in good standing\" and \"during the most recent 12-month period, ha[ve] met, at the expense of the individual, the standards for qualification in firearms training for active law enforcement officers\" and not be medically unqualified for reasons of mental health. Section 926C(c)(1), (4), (5). As set forth in subsection (d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the identification a qualified retired law enforcement officer must carry consists of photographic identification issued by the employing agency indicating that the person is a former law enforcement officer.

We have traditionally looked at three factors when determining whether a particular statutory provision gives rise to a federal right. First, Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Wright [v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority]\n   </em>\n   , 479 U.S. [418] at 430, 107 S.Ct.

Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so \"vague and amorphous\" that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217449\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/418/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 431-432, 107 S.Ct. at 774-775. Third, the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the States. In other words, the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms.\n   <em>\n    Wilder [v. Virginia Hosp.

To exercise this right a plaintiff must, in addition to meeting the criteria for being a qualified retired law enforcement officer, \"carry[ ] the identification required by subsection (d).\" Under subsection (d), the photographic identification is \"issued by the agency from which the individual separated from service.\" Critically, however, no provision of the statute\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   the agency to issue this identification. Cole has no right to this identification that is enforceable under \u00a7 1983 because LEOSA imposes no \"binding obligation on the States\" to provide it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This precise issue arose recently in\n   <em>\n    Burban v. City of Neptune Beach, Fla.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-CV-262-J-34JBT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201493177\">\n    2018 WL 1493177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Fla. Mar. 27, 2018). The plaintiff in that case was a qualified retired law enforcement officer who, like Cole, sued under \u00a7 1983 and \"allege[d] that the City ha[d] deprived her of the right to carry a concealed firearm under LEOSA by failing to issue her an identification card.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The court dismissed the complaint because LEOSA creates no right to the identification card. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Notably, nothing in the text of LEOSA directs a state to issue the identification required by subsection (d).\n   <em>\n    Mpras [v. District of Columbia]\n   </em>\n   , 74 F.Supp.3d [265] at 270 [ (D.D.C. 2014) ]. To the contrary, LEOSA leaves in place a state's own standards for \"deciding to whom subsection (d) identifications will be issued.\"\n   <em>\n    Henrichs [v.

As the\n   <em>\n    Mpras\n   </em>\n   court persuasively observed:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Subsection (d) contains numerous references to actions that must be performed and qualifications that must be determined \"by the agency from which the individual retired\" or \"by the State in which the individual resides\" or \"by a certified firearms instructor that is qualified to conduct a firearms qualification test for active duty officers within the State\" or \"by any law enforcement agency within that State.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Mpras\n   </em>\n   , 74 F.Supp.3d at 270. \"These repeated references to actions taken by the state suggest that Congress intended to leave the standards and procedures for issuing the required photographic identification required by subsection (d) to the states.\"\n   <em>\n    D'Aureli [v.

Feb. 2, 2018) ]. As such, the Court finds that LEOSA does not require the City's standards for issuing identification cards to mirror the standards set forth in the statute for being a qualified retired law enforcement officer. Accordingly, Burban's allegation that the City has deprived her of the federal right to carry a concealed firearm by setting the standards for acquiring an identification card higher than those enumerated in LEOSA is insufficient. Burban has failed to allege that she has been deprived of a federal right, and as a result she has failed to state a claim for\n   relief under Section 1983.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Aureli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20704733\">\n    2018 WL 704733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at **4-6 (dismissing a claim under Section 1983 because LEOSA does not confer the right to carry a concealed firearm upon those who lack identification cards);\n   <em>\n    Henrichs\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524809\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/1049/#p1056\">\n    306 F.Supp.3d at 1054-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20572708\">\n    2018 WL 572708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at **3-4 (same);\n   <em>\n    Mpras\n   </em>\n   , 74 F.Supp.3d at 270 (same).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Burban\n   </em>\n   went on to note that other courts have likewise determined that LEOSA creates no enforceable right to the issuance of subsection (d) identification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Notably, outside the context of Section 1983 claims, several federal and state courts have determined that States are under no obligation to issue identification cards to \"qualified retired law enforcement officers\" in order to permit the officers to exercise their right to carry concealed firearms.

Defs.' Br. at 22. They argue, however, that Cole has not proven the third element, namely, that Malone denied Cole's request for photographic identification because he supported Malone's opponent in the 2016 election. Defendants note that Malone first denied Cole's request for this identification in 2013, long before the 2016 election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cole Dep. at 12; Malone Dep. at 11. Malone\n   testified that Cole is the only retiree whose request for \"retirement credentials\" he has ever denied, and that he did so because Cole did not retire in good standing and did not have arrest powers for the last five years of his employment. Malone Dep. at 12, 15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In response, Cole argues that defendants \"are only quoting from the complaint filed by Cole\" and that he testified that he also supported Malone's opponent in the 2012 election. Pls.' Resp. at 25. Defendants cannot be faulted for \"quoting from the complaint,\" as it is the complaint, and not deposition testimony or anything else, that defines a plaintiff's claims. The complaint in the present case alleges retaliation only for Cole's support of Malone's opponent in \"this last election cycle.\" As the complaint was filed in September 2017, the \"last election cycle\" refers to the 2016 campaign, i.e., the months immediately preceding the election that took place in November 2016. This does not encompass any other campaigns or time frames. Whatever Cole may have done to support Malone's opponent in other elections is not alleged in his complaint and it is therefore not part of this case. Cole's support of Malone's opponent in the 2016 election cannot have caused Malone to deny Cole's request for identification in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Cole does allege that he repeated his request for \"retirement credentials\" in a letter to defendants in February 2017, and that defendants never responded to it. But this letter is not evidence of a causal connection between protected activity and adverse action. Malone testified that he denied Cole's request for retirement credentials when Cole first made this request in 2013 because \"I didn't believe Mr. Cole retired in good standing so I was not going to issue him his card.\" Malone Dep. at 11. Cole has presented no evidence to suggest that Malone disregarded his 2017 letter for reasons any different from those that led him to deny Cole's 2013 request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The mere fact that adverse action happened after protected activity is not evidence of a causal connection unless the two occur \"extremely close\" in time,\n   <em>\n    Holzemer v.

In the present case, Cole has produced no such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On this record, there is simply no evidence of any causal link between Cole's support of Malone's opponent in the 2016 election and Malone's decision not to issue Cole his photographic identification. Cole has therefore failed to make out a prima facie case of First Amendment retaliation.

The analysis of this claim is similar to that of Cole's claim regarding defendants' refusal to give him photographic identification.

But the only right that LEOSA confers upon qualified retired law enforcement officers is to \"carry a concealed firearm that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\" Section 926C(a). For the reasons explained above, and by the court in\n   <em>\n    Burban\n   </em>\n   , LEOSA does not grant plaintiffs the right to either the photographic identification or the firearms certification described in \u00a7 926C(d) because the statute imposes no binding obligation on any State or other entity to issue these credentials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, LEOSA plainly states that the required firearms certification may be obtained either from the \"agency from which the individual separated\" or \"by the State in which the individual resides or by a certified firearms instructor that is qualified to conduct a firearms qualification test for active duty officers with that State.\" Section 926C(d)(2)(B). The statute identifies three entities which\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   issue the certification; but the statute does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   that any of these entities do so. Therefore, plaintiffs have no right under the statute to demand that defendants provide them with the certification or, as they phrase it, \"access to the range to qualify.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that Burkey, Rod, and Johnson have no enforceable right to subsection (d) firearms certification, and that they therefore may not invoke \u00a7 1983 to compel defendants to issue them such certification or to grant them access to the range. Accordingly, the Court shall grant summary judgment for defendants on Count I of these plaintiffs' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Burkey's, Rod's, and Johnson's Count II - First Amendment Retaliation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In this count, Burkey, Rod, and Johnson allege that they \"publicly endorsed [Malone's] challenger\" during the 2016 election,\n   and that \"[t]he failure of Defendant Malone to allow the Plaintiffs access to be able to qualify with their weapons pursuant to LEOSA was in direct retaliation against the Plaintiffs for exercising [their] First Amendment Constitutional Rights.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As noted above, to succeed with this claim plaintiffs must show that they engaged in protected conduct, that adverse action was taken against them \"that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct,\" and that \"the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiff[s'] protected conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Sowards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11484735\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/426/#p431\">\n    203 F.3d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thaddeus-X\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720089\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/378/#p394\">\n    175 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   394 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Rod's claim fails because he has not shown that he engaged in protected conduct. Rod testified that he believed Malone denied him access to the range because Malone \"found out I had a sign for his opponent in the last election, and I feel that he thinks I voted for this man.\" Rod Dep. at 12. Yet Rod also testified that he did not put up the sign and that it \"wasn't really on my property. It was on the right-of-way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The fact that someone else erected a political sign near Rod's property, or that Rod believes Malone might have thought that the sign belonged to Rod, does not show that Rod engaged in protected activity. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Rod's First Amendment retaliation claim on this basis alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For purposes of this motion, defendants appear to concede that Burkey and Johnson engaged in protected activity. Nonetheless, defendants argue persuasively that denying them access to the shooting range was not adverse action because it would not \"deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct.\" Burkey proved this point at his deposition. When asked whether he is deterred from speaking his mind, Burkey responded, \"No, ... there ain't nobody going to stop me from saying what I want to say.\" Burkey Dep. at 12. If a similar exchange occurred during Johnson's deposition, it is not attached to the motion papers. But as a matter of law, the Court holds that no qualified retired law enforcement officer would be deterred from supporting a candidate for sheriff by the current officeholder denying access to the local shooting range. As noted above, LEOSA allows the firearms certification to be obtained from the State or from a certified firearms instructor. Both Burkey and Johnson acknowledged that they can obtain the required certification from the Michigan State Police at the state capital, Lansing, where such shooting takes place every other month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johnson Dep. at 16, 42; Burkey Dep. at 25. In fact, Johnson testified that he did so in 2017. Johnson Dep. at 43. The main difference between qualifying in Monroe and qualifying in Lansing appears to be the inconvenience of the 100-mile drive. This is not a sufficiently significant burden to qualify as adverse action for a First Amendment retaliation claim. Moreover, plaintiffs may also obtain the required certification from a certified firearms instructor, and Johnson testified to knowing of one in nearby Erie. Johnson Dep. at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Count II because plaintiffs have not stated a prima facie claim of First Amendment retaliation. Rod has not done so because he has not shown that he engaged in any protected activity. Burkey and Johnson have not done so because the denial of access to the local range did not constitute \"adverse action\" under the governing case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that defendants are entitled to\n   summary judgment on all of plaintiffs' claims in both 17-12928 and 18-10410.

[In] '97 or '98, they authorized charges against Mr. Cole. Those charges were dismissed. I believe the judge's words were: There may have been a crime here but I don't believe that there was any intent.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    I reviewed the investigation by the Monroe - or the Michigan Sheriff's association and I reviewed the ... investigation by the ATF agent. In those, Mr. Cole made contradictory statements, admitted to the improper purchasing and selling of firearms and the magazines that were illegal to sell to civilian employees.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    It became obvious to me that he was meeting with people outside of the state to try and cover up the fact that he was claiming they were reserve deputies at the time of purchase, and in their own statements they were not. He told them to backdate applications for the marine divisions in which at least one did. All that, along with the fact that he had no arrest powers, and he hadn't shot within the previous years is the reason why I made the determination he didn't retire in good standing.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Malone Dep. at 15-17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Cole made donations to Malone's opponent, David Uhl, in May and August 2016.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Ex.

Rod Dep. at 10. Johnson testified that he is aware of this option, but that \"[i]t was quite complicated, because you had to pay for it, you had to go to Lansing, [and] you had to buy your own ammunition.\" Johnson Dep. at 16. The Court notes that LEOSA defines a qualified retired law enforcement officer as one who, among other things, \"has met,\n    <em>\n     at the expense of the individual\n    </em>\n    , the standards for qualification in firearms training.\" Section 925C(c)(4). Burkey testified that he is aware he can qualify through the State but \"I don't feel I have to.\" Burkey Dep. at 11, 25.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
