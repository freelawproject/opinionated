INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Aurelio Bonilla, a former police officer with the City of Allentown, settled an employment-discrimination lawsuit against the City in 2013. Whether Bonilla would receive a disability pension was discussed during the settlement negotiations. Since that time, the City of Allentown Police's Pension Fund Association (\"Pension Board\" or \"Board\") denied Bonilla's application for a disability pension. Bonilla thereafter initiated the above-captioned action for damages, equitable relief, and declaratory relief. After the instant action was filed, however, the state court reversed and remanded the pension denial to the Board, where proceedings are ongoing. At issue here are the City Defendants'\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 5; the Pension Board Defendants'\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Motions to Dismiss, ECF Nos. 6 and 28; the City Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 50; Bonilla's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, ECF No. 51; and the City Defendants Motions in Limine, ECF Nos. 53-54. For the reasons set forth below, summary judgment is entered in favor of the City as to Bonilla's breach of contract claim, and all other claims are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bonilla was hired by the City of Allentown as a police officer in July 2008. City\n   SUD \u00b6 1, ECF No. 50-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 20, 2012, Bonilla filed a Complaint in this Court alleging that the City subjected him to race and disability discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    Bonilla v. City of Allentown\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:12-cv-06528 (E.D. Pa. filed Nov. 20, 2012). On April 17, 2013, the Honorable Henry S. Perkin held a settlement conference in that action. City SUD \u00b6 4. By the conclusion of the conference, the parties had reached a global resolution to dispose of Bonilla's discrimination claims and his worker's compensation claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. The parties placed some of the terms of the settlement agreement on the record.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7; Pl.'s Resp. City's SUF \u00b6 7. Counsel for the City stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"the City of Allentown agrees to pay [Bonilla] 5,000 dollars and agrees not to oppose any application or subsequent review for service-connected disability pension.\" City SUD \u00b6 8; Pl. dep. at Ex. 2, Settlement Conf. Tr. 3:8-11, ECF No. 50-3. Counsel for the City further stated that Bonilla agreed to execute a written settlement agreement. Pl. dep. at Ex. 2, 3:19-22. When Judge Perkin asked Bonilla, who was given an opportunity to consult with counsel (Donald Russo, Esquire), if he heard, understood, and agreed with the terms of the settlement, Bonilla responded, \"I do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:14-5:22. Under the terms stated for the record, the City of Allentown did not guarantee Bonilla that he would receive a pension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 2; City SUD \u00b6 12; Pl.'s SUD \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before a written settlement agreement was executed, Bonilla applied to the Pension Board for a disability pension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 5, ECF No. 50-4; Pl.'s SUD \u00b6 21. Bonilla attached to the application, which is dated June 26, 2013, reports from his treating orthopedic surgeon and from his primary care physician, each opining that Bonilla is permanently disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 5. The letter from Bonilla's primary care physician states merely: \"Mr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Aurelio Bonilla has had treatment for left knee injury. Due to ongoing patellofemoral chondromalacia, he is permanently disabled for performing duties as a police officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In early August 2013, before the Board ruled on the pension application, Bonilla and the City signed a written Settlement Agreement regarding the employment-discrimination lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 3, Settlement Agreement, ECF Nos. 50-3 and 50-4. As part of the Agreement, Bonilla resigned his employment with the City of Allentown and agreed to the dismissal of the employment-discrimination lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4. In exchange, the City agreed to pay Bonilla $ 5,000.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2(a). Further, under the terms of the written Agreement, the City agreed \"that should Mr. Bonilla apply for a service-connected disability pension, its [sic] will not oppose any such application or subsequent review.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2(b). The Agreement specifies that \"[t]he foregoing does not guarantee Mr. Bonilla's ability to obtain any such service-connected disability pension as any such determination is made by an independent agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Settlement Agreement further states that the written \"Agreement represents the complete and entire understanding of the parties,\" \"the parties acknowledge that they understand the terms of this Agreement, that such terms are acceptable, that there are no additional obligations, either oral or written, to be performed by any party....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 14(B).\n   <em>\n    See also id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 10 (\"Knowing and Voluntary Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 28, 2013, after the written Settlement Agreement was executed, the Pension Board held a meeting to review Bonilla's disability pension request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 6, ECF No. 50-4. The Board discussed the language in a governing ordinance that requires the Board to have the opinion of two physicians, whom were \"selected by\" the Board, that the pension applicant is totally disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Exs. 6-7, ECF No. 50-4; Ex. C at \u00a7 143.22(A),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 50-5. Neither of the physicians whose reports were attached to Bonilla's application was selected by the Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Exs. 6-7. Thus, the Board determined that before it could decide the pension application, Bonilla must have a physical examination by two physicians chosen by the Board from the approved city list.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Board notified Bonilla of this decision on October 7, 2013, and advised him to contact an orthopedic physician from St. Luke's Medical and from OAA Orthopedic Specialists, and to have each provide the Board with a written report opining that Bonilla is \"totally disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 24, 2013, Bonilla advised the Board that none of the Board's listed providers would agree to see him, and asked the Board to add Bonilla's treating physicians to the approved provider list or to identify additional acceptable providers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 8, ECF No. 50-4. This request was discussed at the quarterly meeting on November 19, 2013, when the Board, noting that the reports attached to\n   Bonilla's application were insufficient,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   voted to investigate and to select two new orthopedic physicians to examine Bonilla.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 9, ECF No. 50-4. The names of the two Board-selected physicians were provided to Bonilla on January 13, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 10, ECF No. 50-4. On January 22, 2014, the Board's counsel contacted Bonilla's counsel to determine the status of the examinations. City SUD \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about February 12, 2014, Bonilla filed a charge of retaliation against the City and the Pension Board with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). City SUD \u00b6 36; Ex. E, ECF No. 50-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Pension Board held a meeting on March 13, 2014, and discussed Bonilla's pension application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 4, ECF No. 50-4. John Marchetto, Esquire, addressed the Board on behalf of the City's Solicitor's Office, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I would like to give the Board a little bit of background on the city's administration's position on this proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 17, 2013, the city and Mr. Bonilla appeared before a federal magistrate judge with his lawyers, and we entered into a stipulation of settlement agreement whereby the city agreed that it would not oppose any pension request by Mr. Bonilla before this board, or would not participate in any such proceeding in opposition, which essentially is the way the city views this is that we are remaining neutral. We are not opposing this or bringing in any evidence into this proceeding that would be in opposition to Mr. Bonilla's pension request and likewise, if there was any type of appeal from any proceeding here, that the city would not participate in that as well. And that is in line with the colloquy that was done before the federal magistrate, Judge Perkin, and in accordance with the settlement agreement that was signed by the city and Mr. Bonilla, by Mr. Bonilla on August 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   , 2013, and the city, by me, on August 7, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   at N.T. 5:24-6:20. The Board also heard from Bonilla, who had yet to undergo two independent medical examinations, and from his counsel.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:18-8:2. Bonilla's counsel again asked the Board to accept one or both of the two previously submitted reports.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:7-11. Bonilla informed the Board that the City had agreed as part of the settlement negotiations that he could use the doctors who had previously submitted reports, that he was \"not going to go to any more doctors,\" and that he could not afford to pay for two independent medical examinations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:14 - 9:1. The Board explained to Bonilla that the pension ordinance requires two reports from Board-selected doctors and, after hearing concerns from Bonilla about the associated costs, discussed the possibility of paying for the exams.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:11-13, 16:17-22, 17:18-18:10. Although the Board, expressing concern about the amount of medical information it had on Bonilla's injuries,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:7 - 20:3, decided it would not accept the previously submitted reports, it did agree to pay for the independent examinations,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:9-31:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Bonilla failed to obtain the two examinations by the time of the Board's next meeting on April 7, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 11, ECF No. 50-4. Neither Bonilla nor his counsel appeared at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Board acknowledged that notice of the hearing was sent late, but because one of the Board members spoke with Bonilla's counsel and confirmed that he and Bonilla\n   knew about the hearing but would not be present, without any indication of a conflict or a continuance request, the hearing proceeded.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:20-8:15. After considering the information before it, the Board voted to deny the pension.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Board issued a written decision the following month explaining that because Bonilla refused to be examined by Board-selected physicians and presented no testimony concerning the circumstances under which he was injured, the Board had no alternative but to deny Bonilla's pension application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. F, ECF No. 50-5 (citing \u00a7 143.22(A)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). Bonilla filed a timely appeal to the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, ECF No. 50-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While the appeal was pending in the state court, Bonilla filed, on September 11, 2014, the above-captioned action alleging federal and state claims arising from the pension denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. Bonilla asserts retaliation claims under Title VII and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\"PHRA\"); a retaliation claim under the First Amendment; due process and conspiracy claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1985 ; and state tort and constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.

The Pension Board Defendants also filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that all claims should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Board's Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before the motions were decided, the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas, on December 4, 2014, reversed and remanded the denial of Bonilla's application for a disability pension to the Pension Board for further proceedings. Ex. 1, ECF No. 25; Ex. H, ECF No. 50-5. The court determined that Bonilla did not have a full and fair opportunity to present evidence at the hearing because the Board failed to timely advise Bonilla of the scheduling of the hearing and, also, failed to advise him that the Board was going to take additional evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court remanded with directions to the Pension Board to give ample notice \"of two appropriate physicians it selects for [Bonilla] to submit for\n   medical examinations,\" to conduct a hearing on the pension application with at least thirty days advance notice, to allow Bonilla to present any evidence supporting his claim that he suffered a work-related injury, and to create a record with evidence presented by all parties about whether the City's participation in the prior employment-discrimination lawsuit compels the Pension Board to approve Bonilla's pension request.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Pension Board Defendants, with leave of Court, thereafter filed a Supplemental Motion to Dismiss all claims, alleging that the counts are not ripe\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   for adjudication because there has been no final order denying a pension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Board's Supp. Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 28; Board's Brief Supp. Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 29. They contend that Bonilla's claims are predicated on the Board's decision to deny Bonilla's application for a pension and that the claims are not yet cognizable because a final order has not been issued regarding the pension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Board's Brief Supp. Mot.

The Court explained that most of Bonilla's federal claims require the denial of the pension in order to state a claim and are not ripe for adjudication.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Although it appeared that the Title VII claim, alleging that Defendants have retaliated against Bonilla for filing a prior Title VII action against the City by unnecessarily delaying the processing of his pension application, may be ripe, the Court reasoned that it could better assess whether the claims were ripe after the state pension proceedings concluded.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   More than three and a half years later, during a telephone conference with the parties on October 2, 2018, the Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   learned that the pension proceedings were still not complete.

Although certain legal theories within certain counts may not necessarily be dependent on the outcome of such declaration, other theories within the same counts are dependent. For example, whether the City Defendants failed to stop deprivation/supervise the city solicitor from allegedly making guarantees and false representations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. City Defs.' SJ Mot. 14, is not necessarily dependent on whether the Court declares that the Pension Board is under the control and authority of the City. However, whether the City Defendants failed to supervise the Pension Board is dependent on the declaration. Bonilla wants to pursue both theories for holding the City Defendants liable under Count III. Accordingly, Count III is dependent on whether Bonilla receives the declaration sought. On the other hand, Bonilla does not rely on the DJA for jurisdiction; rather, this Court has federal question jurisdiction and/or supplemental jurisdiction over all counts but Count XII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colo.

R. Civ. P. 56(d) (providing that if the non-moving party \"shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may\" deny the motion). Bonilla submits that the thirty-day discovery period allowed was not reasonable, noting that although the case was initiated in 2014, it was stayed until October 2018. He suggests that memories fade over time, and refers to the number of claims and defendants. Bonilla asks that the Court stay the Motion for Summary Judgment. Bonilla further complains that the absence of an answer by the City Defendants prevents him from knowing which pleadings are disputed. He contends that in the absence of an answer, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(b)(6) deems all allegations in the Complaint admitted. Bonilla also submits that because no answer has been filed, the City Defendants have not raised any defenses, but rely on defenses as the basis for summary judgment. Bonilla argues that the Motion for Summary Judgment is properly stricken under Rule 12(f).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) (allowing the court to \"strike from a pleading an insufficient defense\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Generally, the Court finds Bonilla's arguments unpersuasive. Bonilla has not shown \"by affidavit or declaration\" specified reasons why he cannot present facts essential to justify his opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). Although the Court initially granted only thirty days to conduct discovery, it honored the parties' request for an extension of time, and allowed approximately sixty days total for discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 43, 52. The dispositive motions deadline was also briefly extended, and the parties were granted leave to file supplemental responses to the motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 64. As Bonilla recognizes, allegations in a complaint are only deemed admitted under Rule 8(b)(6) if \"a responsive pleading is required\" and because the City Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is still pending, the time to file a responsive pleading has not begun.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(4). Moreover, this case was initiated in 2014. Although motions to dismiss were pending and the case was subsequently stayed, nothing prevented the parties from engaging in discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26. The basis of the stay was to allow Bonilla to complete the pension proceedings, which relate directly to the claims in the instant action. Thus, the pension proceedings and discovery therein, if any, are relevant to the instant action, thereby limiting the amount of discovery that would need to be conducted in the above-captioned action. However, Bonilla has made little, if any, effort since May 2016 to advance the proceedings before the Pension Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Footnote 11,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368164\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/491/#p495\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   . It was this Court's action that revived the case. Bonilla's requests to strike or stay are therefore denied. Nevertheless, because many of the claims are premature, those claims will be disposed of on the motions to dismiss, not summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor Inv., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11648936\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/1285/#p1290\">\n    983 F.2d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"unripe claims should ordinarily be disposed of on a motion to dismiss, not summary judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Bonilla first moves for summary judgment on his procedural due process claim, arguing that the City and the Pension Board deprived him of property (a pension) without proper notice and an opportunity to be heard. Bonilla relies on the state court's finding that he was not given a full and fair opportunity to be heard at his pension hearing. However, he ignores that part of the court's decision reversing the denial of his pension application and remanding for a new hearing. Importantly, because the state may cure a procedural deprivation by providing a later procedural remedy, a procedural due process violation is not complete \"unless and until the State fails to provide due process.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marchionni v.

Rather, counsel for the City advised the Pension Board at a meeting on March 13, 2014, that the City was not opposing Bonilla's pension request, but was instead \"remaining neutral.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 4, N.T. 5:24-6:20. Although Bonilla suggests in his brief that the City opposed his appeal from the Pension Board's decision, there are no facts that would support such a statement because merely being named, by Bonilla, as the appellee does not show that the City opposed the review of the pension application. Similarly, the City Defendants' motions in the above-captioned action do not establish breach. Bonilla initiated the instant action against the City Defendants seeking,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , monetary damages for alleged statutory, constitutional, and tort violations. Bonilla therefore forced the City to defend itself. The Settlement Agreement, while imposing a duty not to \"oppose [a pension] application\" or subsequent review, does not impose a duty on the City to simply sit by and allow itself to be sued on a dozen different claims. In the Complaint, Bonilla seeks judgment against all defendants \"for no less than 2.5\n   million dollars, of which 1 million is for punitive damages, and ... the full value of the pension, plus compensatory economic and punitive damages, reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs, and such relief allowed at law and in equity to make the Plaintiff whole.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 33. Bonilla's suggestion that the City's opposition to having an award of 2.5 million dollars entered against it constitutes a breach of the Settlement Agreement is wholly without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, the Settlement Agreement provides that \"any such determination [on Bonilla's pension application] is made by an independent agency.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement \u00a7 2(b) (emphasis added). This statement further clarifies the parties' understanding that the City did not guarantee Bonilla a pension. Also, because Bonilla had already filed his application for a disability pension with the Pension Board at the time the Settlement Agreement was executed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. dep. at Ex. 5, the parties clearly knew that the \"independent agency\" referenced in the Settlement Agreement was the Pension Board. This language therefore shows that the parties contemplated independent review by the Pension Board. Pursuant to this review, the Pension Board determined that it had no choice but to deny Bonilla's application because he did not have \"the opinion of two (2) reputable physicians who have been selected by the Association\" that Bonilla is totally disabled, as required by \u00a7 143.22(A). There is no evidence that the City amended this or any rule governing pension applications since the execution of the Settlement Agreement. Therefore, regardless of the connection between the City and the Pension Board, the City did not take any action to oppose the pension. Summary judgment is entered in favor of the City as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Many of Bonilla's claims are not ripe for adjudication.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Despite the passage of time since this case was initiated, the majority of Bonilla's claims are still not ripe. \"The function of the ripeness doctrine is to determine whether a party has brought an action prematurely, and counsels abstention until such time as a dispute is sufficiently concrete to satisfy the constitutional and prudential requirements of the doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Peachlum v.

Most of Bonilla's claims are dependent on the denial of his pension application, but because those proceedings are not complete, a decision on the merits is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Bonilla's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Bonilla contends that because the state court concluded its appellate process, but he has still not obtained a pension, all claims are ripe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. 2-3. This is incorrect. The state court addressing Bonilla's appeal from the Pension Board reversed and remanded the denial of Bonilla's application for a disability pension to the Pension Board for further proceedings. Those proceedings are ongoing. Thus, a decision on Bonilla's pension application is still pending and judicial review of any claims dependent on the denial of his pension application is premature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Felmeister v.

This includes the majority of the claims against the Pension Board Defendants, as well as the procedural due process claim against the City Defendants and aspects of Count III (Failure to Stop Deprivation).

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In its discretion and considering the parties' filings over the past few months, the Court exercises jurisdiction over the Complaint. Bonilla's claims are largely dependent on his allegations that the City guaranteed him a pension. Based on the plain language of the written Settlement Agreement, which is attached to the Complaint and as an exhibit to the summary judgment motions, this allegation is not true. The undisputed evidence shows that City agreed only that it would not oppose Bonilla's pension application, and there is no evidence of breach. The breach of contract claim, which is the second Count IX, is ripe for summary judgment and judgment is entered in favor of the City. The motions for summary judgment are otherwise denied. Instead, all claims are disposed of on the motions to dismiss. The following counts are dismissed without prejudice,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   either as premature and/or for failure to state a claim: Counts I though VII, the first Count IX, and Count XII. The remaining counts are dismissed with prejudice because they fail as a matter of law and any amendment would be futile:\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count VIII, the second Count IX, and Counts X to XI. Considering the ongoing pension proceedings and the significant amount of time that has elapsed without effort by Bonilla to complete those proceedings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court will not continue to stay the instant proceedings. However, Bonilla is granted leave to reopen this action by filing an amended complaint within thirty days of the completion of the pension proceedings and any related appellate\n   review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A separate order will be issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The \"City Defendants\" include the City of Allentown, Ed Pawlowski, Julio Guridy, Ray O'Connell, Joe Davis, Jeanette Eichenwald, Daryl Hendricks, Cynthia Mota, and Peter Schweyer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The \"Pension Board Defendants\" include the City of Allentown Police's Pension Fund Association, Garret Stratheam, Mary Ellen Koval, Louis Collins, Iboyla Balog, James Gress, Ryan Koons, Jeff Glazier, Michael Williams, and Eduardo Eichenwald.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    To the extent that the procedural history of the case may be relevant to disposition of the motions, the relevant history is included herein.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Where only one party's statement of material facts (\"SUF\") is cited, all parties have admitted the fact.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    City's SUF, ECF No. 50-7,\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp.

As to some of these facts, Bonilla claims to deny the fact; however, these denials are not so much a genuine dispute as to the asserted fact as needless and frivolous quibbling over the statement and superfluous legal argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2) (providing that if a party \"fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may ... consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion\"). For example, the City's sixth statement of material fact states in total: \"At the settlement conference, the parties achieved a global resolution of Bonilla's claims. N.T. Plaintiff, Exhibit 2, 2:16-22.\" City's SUF \u00b6 6. Bonilla's response to this statement begins: \"Denied as stated, but admitted only that The City of Allentown defendants and Mr. Bonilla (the parties) came to an understanding for terms to achieve a global settlement.\" Pl.'s Resp. City's SUF \u00b6 6. Although \"denied,\" clearly Bonilla admits the City's statement. However, Bonilla then goes on to argue about consideration, performance, and breach in his response to the City's statement, which is nonresponsive to the asserted statement and improper.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20103084\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ; Fed.
