COOPER, United States District Judge\n   The National Women's Political Caucus (\"NWPC\") brings this trademark infringement and unfair competition suit against Metropolitan Louisville Women's Political Caucus (\"MLWPC\"). MLWPC has moved to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue or, alternatively, to transfer the case to a more appropriate venue. For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny all of MLWPC's motions and retain jurisdiction over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court here provides a brief factual overview to orient the personal jurisdiction and venue analysis. Further details relevant to that analysis will be set forth later in the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Founded in 1971, NWPC is a multi-partisan, grassroots political organization that seeks to increase women's participation in politics. Compl. \u00b6 6. A nonprofit corporation organized under District of Columbia law, NWPC's lone office and employee are located in the District.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. In July 1971, NWPC began using in commerce the trademarks \"National Women's Political Caucus,\" \"NWPC,\" and an interlocking five-circle logo, intended to represent women of different races working together toward a common purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-11. In 2004, NWPC began using in commerce a modernized version of the logo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. NWPC contends that one or the other of the two designs have been in continuous commercial use since 1971. It also contends that it has acquired proper registration for these marks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   MLWPC was established in 1972 as a local chapter of NWPC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. It is a nonprofit corporation organized under Kentucky law and headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. NWPC says that it permitted MLWPC to use its marks so long as MLWPC remained a \"local chapter in good standing,\" which requires the payment of membership dues to NWPC, attendance at NWPC meetings, and compliance with NWPC's bylaws, among other things.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2016, however, NWPC \"became concerned that MLWPC was violating NWPC's bylaws, including by endorsing male candidates for office and by failing to collect and transmit membership dues to NWPC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. In December 2017, an NWPC attorney sent MLWPC a demand letter that purported to revoke MLWPC's permission to use any NWPC mark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. MLWPC refused to comply, even after NWPC repeated its demands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   NWPC filed suit in June 2018.

Though MLWPC now disputes that it was obligated to collect NWPC dues from its\n   members, exhibits submitted by NWPC tell a different story.

While these contacts are not as significant to the Court's analysis as are the paying of dues and the agreement to abide by NWPC's rules-especially because they speak more to the actions of individual MLWPC members rather than of the organization itself-they still counsel in favor of finding personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   So this is what we know: MLWPC regularly collected and sent dues to NWPC in D.C.; it agreed to conduct itself according to NWPC's rules and envisioned itself as furthering the goals of NWPC, as reflected in its bylaws and through its use of NWPC's marks; it encouraged its members to participate in NWPC activities; and it maintained regular communication with NWPC since its inception. Taken together, these are strong indicia that MLWPC maintained an ongoing relationship with a D.C.-based entity, such that it purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections\n   of D.C. law. It strikes the Court that these systematic and continuous contacts with the District ought to make MLWPC amenable to a lawsuit here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   MLWPC's efforts to challenge that intuition all come up short. As for the dues issue, MLWPC makes three points: first, that it was not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to collect dues on behalf of NWPC; second, that it merely gave local members the\n   <em>\n    option\n   </em>\n   to join the national organization; and third, that it never paid NWPC out of its own coffers and only served as a \"pass through\" for its members' dues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Reply at 6; Woodward Aff. \u00b6 11-12. The trouble with the first two arguments, however, is that they run counter to NWPC's allegations and supporting exhibits-which plausibly show that both NWPC and MLWPC, for at least some period of their relationship, believed the local caucus was required to collect dues on behalf of the national organization and that local members may have automatically paid national dues by joining the local organization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   4. And, on a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff's factual allegations must be accepted as true unless they are \"directly contradicted by an affidavit,\" which here they are not.\n   <em>\n    Azamar v. Stern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786843\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/662/166/#p171\">\n    662 F.Supp.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (D.D.C. 2009) (citation omitted). MLWPC's third dues argument likewise fails, because it is unimportant for personal jurisdiction purposes whether it was transmitting to D.C. the local group's own money or that of its individual members-what matters is that, in either case, MLWPC was in continuous contact with the national organization in D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As for MLWPC's attempts to paint itself an independent actor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def's Reply at 3, it is true that the local organization has its own bylaws, but it is equally true that those bylaws reflect the group's close affiliation with NWPC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   7; Pl's Opp., Ex. D to Lent Decl. Evidence of this relationship abounds throughout NWPC's supporting exhibits: MLWPC understood it had to abide by NWPC rules, the MLWPC mission statement tracks verbatim NWPC's mission statement, and the two organizations used the same five-circled design mark that is the subject of this suit,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A to Lent Decl.\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Ex. D to Lent Decl. In light of all this, MLWPC's attempts to minimize its relationship with NWPC, at least at the motion to dismiss stage, are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The cases MLWPC cites do not alter the analysis. Hoping to lessen the import of MLWPC's affiliation with NWPC, it cites both\n   <em>\n    Lapointe v. Van Note\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV. 03-2128,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%203609346\">\n    2004 WL 3609346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 9, 2004) and\n   <em>\n    Am. Ass'n of Cruise Passengers v.

But both cases involved far more attenuated contacts than this one. In\n   <em>\n    Lapointe\n   </em>\n   , the court held that Earth Island Institute's (\"EII\") membership in the media consortium Monitor-EII's lone contact with the District of Columbia-did not provide a basis for personal jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%203609346\">\n    2004 WL 3609346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Missing from\n   <em>\n    Lapointe\n   </em>\n   , however, is anything like MLWPC's solicitation, collection, and transmission of dues to a D.C.-based entity, or the understanding that one organization would have to abide by the other's rules and regulations.\n   <em>\n    Cunard\n   </em>\n   , meanwhile, is even further afield. There, the defendant's contacts with D.C. \"consist[ed] entirely of sporadic attendance at trade association meetings held in [D.C.]\" and limited communications with a national office in D.C. that had nothing to do with the plaintiff. 691 F.Supp.3d at 381. Needless to say, there is a stark difference between membership in a D.C. organization-replete with dues-paying obligations and conformity to rules and regulations of a governing body-and \"sporadic attendance at trade association meetings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In support of its argument that the collection and transmission of dues to NWPC does not create a basis for personal jurisdiction in D.C., MLWPC urges the Court to consider\n   <em>\n    COMSAT Corp. v. Finshipyards S.A.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7820587\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/900/515/\">\n    900 F.Supp. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 1995). MLWPC cites\n   <em>\n    COMSAT\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"[p]erforming 'administrative services' on behalf of a Washington, D.C. entity does not, standing alone, provide a basis for personal jurisdiction.\" Def's Reply at 7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    COMSAT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7820587\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/900/515/\">\n    900 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   522 ). There are several problems with MLWPC's reliance on\n   <em>\n    COMSAT\n   </em>\n   . As an initial matter, even if the case did stand for the proposition MLWPC claims it does, neither NWPC's argument nor the Court's conclusion is to the contrary; it is not the transmission of dues to NWPC in D.C.\n   <em>\n    standing alone\n   </em>\n   that renders MLWPC subject to personal jurisdiction in D.C., but instead all the various other contacts just described taken together. What's more,\n   <em>\n    COMSAT\n   </em>\n   is factually nowhere close to this case. There, a nonresident accounting firm (defendant Finshipyards) acted as an intermediary between a D.C.-based telecommunications firm (plaintiff COMSAT) and COMSAT's customers in Zaire. COMSAT would provide Finshipyards with invoices for its Zaire customers; Finshipyards would transmit those invoices to the Zaire customers; those customers would provide payment to Finshipyards; and Finshipyards would then transfer the funds to a COMSAT bank account in New York City.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7820587\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/900/515/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    COMSAT\n   </em>\n   court held that this was clearly insufficient to show \"any desire of Finshipyards to do business with COMSAT in Washington, D.C.,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7820587\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/900/515/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7820587\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/900/515/\">\n    at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and for good reason: its only real \"contact\" with D.C. was receiving phone bills for COMSAT's Zaire customers \"that reflected COMSAT's Washington, D.C., address.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That fortuitous and attenuated connection is nothing like MLWPC's longstanding relationship with NWPC in the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Perhaps recognizing the absence of helpful case law, MLWPC makes much of the fact that \"NWPC cites no case under which any court-much less a court in this jurisdiction-found specific personal jurisdiction over an organization based solely on its 'affiliation' with or membership in an in-state entity.\" Def's Reply at 4. But NWPC need not cite a case standing for that proposition, because a holding in favor of NWPC does not depend on that proposition. Far from finding personal jurisdiction based on the\n   <em>\n    status\n   </em>\n   of the relationship between MLWPC and NWPC, it is the specific contours of that relationship-including MLWPC's active efforts to affiliate with NWPC, its collection and transmission of dues to NWPC in D.C., and the fact that MLWPC had to conform to NWPC rules to retain its status as a local caucus-that expose MLWPC to suit in the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   And though no precise analog appears to exist, courts have suggested these sorts of contacts create a basis for personal jurisdiction. In\n   <em>\n    Burger King\n   </em>\n   , for example, a Florida-based franchisor sued a Michigan-based franchisee for breach of the franchise agreement and trademark infringement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    471 U.S. at 468-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though the defendants resided in Michigan and had hardly any physical ties to Florida, the Supreme Court concluded that a Florida court could exercise personal jurisdiction over them because they had \"deliberately reached out beyond Michigan and negotiated with a Florida corporation for the purchase of a long-term franchise and the manifold benefits that would derive from affiliation with a nationwide organization.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    at 479-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

While NWPC sues MLWPC for trademark infringement and unfair competition that occurred in Kentucky, NWPC contends that \"were it not for MLWPC's purposeful contacts with NWPC and this District, MLWPC never would have had the implied license [to use its mark] in the first place.\" Pl's Opp. at 18 (citing Lent Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11-21). Taking that allegation as true\n   for the purposes of this motion, this lawsuit \"arise[s] out of\" MLWPC's contacts with NWPC in the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Helicopteros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/#p414\">\n    466 U.S. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/#p414\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the test for trademark infringement and unfair competition-likelihood of consumer confusion-might well turn on the nature and closeness of the relationship between MLWPC and NWPC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Cir. 2018) (listing factors, including \"similarity of the marks, the proximity of the goods, ... [and] the defendant's intent in adopting the mark\"). In this way, then, MLWPC's contacts with NWPC in D.C. also \"relate to\" the subject of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Helicopteros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/#p414\">\n    466 U.S. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/#p414\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court will reject both requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Venue law ensures that only courts with some interest in the dispute or the parties adjudicate the claims at issue. Under the general venue provisions for federal question cases set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), venue is proper in the district where (1) a defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same state; (2) the events giving rise to the suit occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the suit is located; or (3) if venue would not be proper in any district for those reasons, wherever the defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction. Venue is plainly proper under section 1391(b)(1) : MLWPC is a corporation, and a corporation is \"deemed to reside, if a defendant, in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question.\" \u00a7 1391(c)(2). Because the Court has already held that MLWPC is subject to personal jurisdiction in D.C., the District is also an appropriate venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even where venue is technically proper, however, a case may be transferred to a more convenient forum. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), \"a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought\" if it serves \"the convenience of the parties and witnesses\" and is \"in the interest of justice.\" The first question is\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   this case have been brought in Kentucky? The answer is clearly yes, since MLWPC is at home there and the alleged infringement took place there. The second question is\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   the case, for the convenience of the parties and in the interest of justice, nevertheless be litigated in Kentucky? The Court thinks not, but that answer warrants a bit more discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \" Section 1404(a) is intended to place discretion in the district court to adjudicate motions for transfer according to an 'individualized, case-by-case consideration of convenience and fairness.' \"\n   <em>\n    Stewart Org., Inc. v.

MLWPC asserts that NWPC's choice of forum deserves less deference \"because the balance of convenience strongly favors Kentucky,\" Def's MTD at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted), but it offers little support for this claim. MLWPC obviously would\n   <em>\n    prefer\n   </em>\n   to litigate the case in Kentucky, but the Court is unconvinced that Kentucky would be any more convenient than D.C., let alone clearly so. It is likely the case will involve witnesses located in D.C., Kentucky, and elsewhere around the country; neither forum would eliminate the need for at least some witnesses to travel. As for the convenience of the parties, NWPC is based in D.C., and its key board member in the case, president Donna Lent, would prefer to litigate here. While it would be more convenient for MLWPC to litigate in Kentucky, where all its board members reside, transfer for this reason would simply \"shift inconvenience to the plaintiffs\" rather than \"lead to an overall increase in convenience for the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

The final convenience factor, the ease of access to sources of proof, is also a wash; MLWPC admits that the main sources of proof will consist of \"documentary evidence that can be readily exchanged electronically,\" and so this factor favors neither venue. Def's Opp. at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   To be sure, there are certain other situations where the plaintiff's choice of forum warrants substantially less deference, including where the venue chosen is \"not plaintiff's home forum\" and \"there is an insubstantial factual nexus between the case and the plaintiff's chosen forum,\"\n   <em>\n    New Hope Power Co. v.

But neither of those features is present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Not much need be said on the public-interest factors. MLWPC spends most of its single paragraph on this issue explaining why D.C. is not the superior forum rather than explaining why Kentucky is. But that argument supports the status quo, not transfer. MLWPC does claim that Kentucky has a stronger \"local interest\" in the case since MLWPC is a \"Kentucky organization, with Kentucky-based board members, and with an entirely local focus.\" Def's Reply at 17. All that is true, but much the same could be said for the other side: NWPC is a D.C.-based organization, with its only office and employee in the city. The Court therefore cannot see how Kentucky's interest in the parties' trademark infringement and unfair competition dispute is any stronger than D.C.'s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court will deny MLWPC's motion to transfer the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
