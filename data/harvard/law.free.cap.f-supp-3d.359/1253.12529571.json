Based thereon, Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration [D.E. 3] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiff's Motion for Remand and Incorporated Memorandum of Law [D.E. 4] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   arises from a series of all-risk insurance contracts collectively referred to as the \"Policy.\" [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 1-2; 1].

The Property suffered significant damages on September 10, 2017 because of Hurricane Irma. [D.E. 1-3]. Plaintiff sought coverage under the Policy for the damages sustained and requested that the claim be submitted to appraisal. [D.E. 1]. Defendants denied Plaintiff's request, arguing that the Policy does not provide for an appraisal. [D.E. 1]. According to Defendants, Plaintiff's claim must be resolved through arbitration.

[D.E. 1-3]. The gravamen of Plaintiff's claim is that the Service of Suit Provision, Applicable Law Provision, and the Suits Against Us Provision (collectively, the \"Provisions\") conflict with the Arbitration Clause rendering the Arbitration Clause unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants removed this action to this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   citing federal question jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the \"Convention\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 208. In its Motion for Remand,\n   Plaintiff avers that removal is premature, and the Convention's jurisdictional prerequisites are not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shortly after removal, Defendants moved under the Convention to stay or dismiss this action and compel arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Arbitration Clause. According to the Defendants, the clear and unmistakable terms of the Arbitration Clause commits issues of validity and enforceability to an arbitrator. Plaintiff disagrees. Furthermore, Plaintiff submits that the Motion to Compel is also premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Highlighting the purported inconsistencies between the Provisions and the Arbitration Clause, Plaintiff avers that the Policy is ambiguous. According to Plaintiff, the Defendants' contention that the Convention's jurisdictional prerequisites are met is based on the conclusory assumption that the Arbitration Clause is valid. Notably, Plaintiff cites no case for the proposition that a\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   court must find that the Arbitration Clause is valid and enforceable\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   a district court may exercise federal subject-matter jurisdiction under the Convention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiff's contentions, federal courts have original jurisdiction over any action or proceeding falling under the Convention regardless of the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    Indus.

Interpreting this language in accordance\n   with state law\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and remaining cognizant that the delegation clause is severable from the Arbitration Clause, the only reasonable interpretation is that the Parties \"clear[ly] and unmistakabl[ly]\" agreed to give an arbitrator exclusive authority to resolve\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   dispute relating to the Policy. Indeed, like the delegation clause in\n   <em>\n    Parnell\n   </em>\n   , this delegation clause contains both a broad delegation of \"all\" disputes and a specific example of one type of dispute, here \"validity.\" Furthermore, Defendants raised the delegation clause in their Motion to Compel and their Reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff's attempt to avoid the delegation clause is unavailing. Like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Parnell\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff urges this Court to essentially ignore the language of the Arbitration Clause to find that no delegation clause exists. Under\n   <em>\n    Parnell\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's argument fails to meet the\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   pleading standard because it does not constitute a challenge to the delegation clause specifically. Rather, it is merely a challenge to the validity of the Arbitration Clause as a whole, which does not defeat the delegation clause. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiff's argument can be construed as a direct challenge to the delegation clause, Plaintiff's argument still fails because the Arbitration Clause unambiguously commits to the arbitrator the power to determine issues of arbitrability, including validity and enforceability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    3.
