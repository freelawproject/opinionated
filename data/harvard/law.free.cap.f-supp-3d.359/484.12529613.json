BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 7, 2017, Mayorga was indicted on one count of illegal reentry into the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Mayorga a citizen of Nicaragua. The record does not reflect when he was initially apprehended by federal law enforcement. While in immigration custody, on December 22, 2011, Mayorga was served in person with a United States Department of Homeland Security form titled \"Notice to Appear.\" The form notice states that Mayorga was previously \"admitted to the United States, but are removable.\" The notice further states that \"you were admitted to the United States at Miami, Florida on or about January 23, 2001; as a nonimmigrant, B1 / B2 Visitor, with authorization to remain in the United States for a temporary period not to exceed July 22, 2001.\" Mayorga \"remained in the United States beyond July 22, 2001, without authorization.\" The notice informed Mayorga,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   YOU ARE ORDERED to appear before an immigration judge of the United States Department of Justice at: 800 Dolorosa Street Suite 300 San Antonio Texas US 78207, on (Date) to be set, at (Time) to be set, to show why you should not be removed from the United States based on the charge set forth above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The certificate-of-service portion of the notice indicates that Mayorga was provided with \"oral notice in the Spanish language of the time and place of his [ ] hearing and of the consequences of failure to appear,\" but that he \"refused to sign.\" Mayorga also did not sign a request for an expedited removal hearing or waive his right to a 10-day waiting period before appearing before an immigration judge. Mayorga received four Notices of Hearing that included a date, time, and a crossed out location of his immigration hearing. The first, dated January 6, 2012, was personally served on the Mayorga and notified him of a hearing on January 18, 2012, at 8:30 a.m. at 800 Dolorosa Street-Suite 300 San Antonio, TX 78207. The location, however, was crossed out and a stamp placed over the text of the notice, making the new location illegible. The second notice, dated January 18, 2012, was served on Mayorga's immigration counsel, and notified him of a hearing on February 2, 2012, but the location was again crossed out. The third notice, dated February 2, 2012, was served on Mayorga's counsel and notified him of a hearing on February 9, 2012. The location was crossed out, and \"STDC\" written in next to it. The fourth notice, dated February 9, 2012, was also served on Mayorga's counsel and notified him of a hearing on February 16, 2012, with the\n   location again crossed out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Removal proceedings occurred in San Antonio, Texas on February 16, 2012. The immigration judge rendered an \"order of the immigration judge,\" which was \"a summary of the oral decision entered.\" The order indicates that Mayorga's \"application for voluntary departure was denied,\" and Mayorga \"was ordered removed to Nicaragua.\" The order of removal, signed February 16, 2012, indicates that Mayorga was personally served with a copy of the order the same day. Although the record does not contain a signed waiver of appeal, \"Appeal: Waived\" is circled at the end of the order. Mayorga was removed from the United States on March 7, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The February 16, 2012 removal order was reinstated in May 12, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mayorga eventually came to the attention of federal law-enforcement authorities on or about January 3, 2017.

Did the immigration court lack jurisdiction to render removal order?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mayorga first argues that the immigration court was without jurisdiction to enter the 2012 removal order, thus, as a matter of law, the current indictment lacks a sound basis, and this prosecution cannot continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the Constitution and governing statutes lack any reference to the jurisdiction of an immigration court, Mayorga contends that, primarily based upon language in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , the immigration court lacked jurisdiction to enter the February 16, 2012 removal order, because the notice to appear given to Mayorga on December 22, 2011, was statutorily deficient-the notice failed to include a time at which the removal proceedings would be held.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (considering Section 1229(a) requirements for notice to appear in context of Section 1229b, request to cancel removal proceedings, and stop-time rule\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   );\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(G)(i) (notice to appear given to alien shall include \"time and place at which the proceedings will be held\"). Mayorga contends that the removal order resulting from the February 16, 2012 immigration removal proceeding was void and cannot now be used as a basis for of his illegal-reentry offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mayorga's contention is not novel. Illegal-reentry defendants around the country, relying on language in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , have filed similar motions to dismiss the Government's charges against them. The motions usually raise the same two contentions and similarly argue that based on a statutorily-deficient notice to appear, which fails to inform the defendant in writing of the scheduled time for the removal proceedings, the immigration court entering the initial removal order lacked jurisdiction to issue such an order. Thus, the initial removal order is void, and the subsequent indictment for illegal reentry must be dismissed. Courts presented with this issue have not spoken with one voice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This\n   court has made an effort to review all decisions issued as of the date of this order in considering the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   Court considered a similar statutorily-deficient notice to appear, but not in the context of an attack on an initial removal order in an illegal-reentry prosecution. The\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   Court was presented with a direct appeal from a Board of Immigration ruling and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit regarding a noncitizen's request for cancellation of removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Noncitizens subject to removal proceedings may be eligible for cancellation of removal proceedings if they have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of 10 years immediately preceding the date of the Government's request for removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A). Under this \"stop-time rule,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the period of continuous presence ends when the Government serves the noncitizen with a notice to appear under section 1229(a). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) (special rules relating to continuous residence or physical presence: \"[f]or purposes of this section, any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the United States shall be deemed to end ... when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a) of this title\"). The date the Government serves the noncitizen with a Section 1229(a) notice to appear at a removal proceeding stops the noncitizen's continuous presence in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pereira, a citizen of Brazil who had been present in the United States for several years, was served with a notice to appear stating that his removal proceeding would occur on a date and time \"to be set.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ahead of the removal hearing, the immigration court sent Pereira a notice of hearing with the date and time for the hearing, but the notice was mailed to the wrong address.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Without information about when the hearing would occur, Pereira failed to appear at the removal proceedings. The immigration court proceeded with the hearing and ordered\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   removed\n   <em>\n    in abstentia.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Several years later, Pereira was arrested and his removal proceedings reopened.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At that time, Pereira applied for a cancellation of the removal proceeding under Section 1229b, which the immigration court denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Pereira timely appealed the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals and then filed an appeal to the First Circuit; both appeals were denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On direct appeal from the First Circuit, the Supreme Court considered whether Pereira's notice to appear, which lacked the time and place of removal proceedings, was an adequate notice to appear under Section 1229(a) that would trigger the statutory stop-time rule provided in Section 1229b(d).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court held that \"[a] putative notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of the noncitizen's removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear under [ Section] 1229(a),' and so does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court reasoned that the time-and-place requirement is \"definitional\" for a document that purports to be a notice to appear and that \"the omission of time-and-place information is not, as the dissent asserts, some trivial, ministerial defect, akin to an unsigned notice of appeal.... Failing to specify integral information like the time and place of removal proceedings unquestionably would 'deprive [the notice to appear] of its essential character.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2116-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The plain text, the statutory context, and common sense all lead inescapably and unambiguously to that conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties now dispute how language in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   regarding a notice to appear applies in a context other than a direct appeal from an immigration-court ruling in cancellation-of-removal proceedings and the application of the stop-time rule. Issue is joined as to what effect, if any,\n   <em>\n    Pereira's\n   </em>\n   language regarding notices to appear applies in illegal-reentry prosecutions where, as here, the underlying notice to appear provided to the noncitizen and filed with the immigration court fails to specify the time and date of the removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The primary argument that Mayorga advances is that the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction to enter the underlying February 16, 2012 removal order, because the statutorily deficient notice to appear prevented\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   from ever vesting in the immigration court. Mayorga contends that \"removal proceedings commence,\" and\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   vests, in the immigration court only upon the filing of a notice to appear that complies with Section 1229(a) and\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   -that is, a notice to appear that includes time-and-place information for removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This court recognizes the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   -in the context of the stop-time rule-that a \"notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of the noncitizen's removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear under [ Section] 1229(a),' and so does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, this court observes and finds significant that neither Section 1229, which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , details the contents of a notice to appear, nor\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   makes any reference to an immigration court's jurisdiction. The court finds nothing in the applicable statutory provisions or in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   expressly providing that a defective notice to appear leaves an immigration court without jurisdiction to conduct removal proceedings. Nor is there an express indication in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   or the applicable statutes that a statutorily defective notice to appear, standing alone, leaves an immigration court without the power to proceed with removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court respectfully disagrees with district courts that have determined in the context of a criminal prosecution for illegal reentry that a statutorily defective notice to appear-one that lacks the time and date of removal proceedings-renders an immigration court without jurisdiction to conduct removal proceedings and issue an order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Characterizing a rule as jurisdictional renders it unique in our adversarial system,\" and the Supreme Court has cautioned against \"profligate use of the label 'jurisdictional.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sebelius v.

Instead, Mayorga argues that he need not show that the removal proceedings improperly deprived him of judicial review. Mayorga provides no Fifth Circuit authority for this assertion, however, and in the absence of such authority, this court will not set aside the statutory requirement that the noncitizen be deprived of the opportunity for judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court finds that Mayorga fails to show that he was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review. The order of removal indicates that Mayorga waived his right to appeal the order, and Mayorga did not, in fact, appeal the order.

Under the facts of this case, it is undisputed that the notice to appear delivered to Mayorga does not comply with Section 1229(a) because it does not include time-and-place information required by the statute. Although Mayorga contests whether he received the subsequent notices of hearing sent to his attorney, he concedes that he was present at his removal hearing. The court concludes that Mayorga was not deprived of the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. The Certificate of Service for the Notice to Appear states that \"[Mayorga] was provided oral notice in the Spanish language of the time and place of his ... hearing.\" At least one written notice of hearing was served on Mayorga, and three were served on his immigration counsel. Removal proceedings took place on February 16, 2012, and an immigration judge ordered Mayorga's removal. Mayorga waived his right to appeal and was personally served with a copy of the order on February 16, 2012. Although the Government may have, at the outset, violated Section 1229(a), the court concludes that the noncompliance does not rise to the level of a due-process violation that rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mayorga's motion also indicates that he was represented by immigration counsel at his hearing, and Mayorga alleges his counsel \"failed to provide the most basic services to Mayorga that would have allowed him a strong possibility of, at the very least, voluntary departure in lieu of deportation.\" Mayorga indicates in his motion to dismiss that he waived appeal \"presumably upon advice\" of his counsel. The motion points out a lengthy disciplinary record by Mayorga's counsel, which included public reprimands several suspensions, and eventual resignation in lieu of discipline. Mayorga states that he does not believe that \"his due process rights were protected\" by counsel. Although Mayorga's motion seems to raise issue with his immigration counsel, he does not do so with any specificity, does not tie the counsel's disciplinary record with particular errors, and did not introduce evidence to substantiate his claim. As such, the court concludes that Mayorga did not meet his burden in showing that the actions of his counsel rendered the removal proceedings fundamentally unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Moreover, Mayorga cannot show that he was actually prejudiced by the deficient notice to appear. To prove actual prejudice, Mayorga must show that \" 'there was a reasonable likelihood that but for the errors complained of the defendant would not have been deported.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190025\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/476/#p483\">\n    227 F.3d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Benitez-Villafuerte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857864\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/651/#p658\">\n    186 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   658-59 ). Mayorga argues that \"prejudice is a simple matter\" because he was ordered removed by an immigration judge who did not have authority to issue such an order. Mayorga does not make an argument that he was actually prejudiced and instead \"preserves for further review whether he must show actual prejudice.\" Because the record does not include evidence of prejudice, the court\n   concludes that Mayorga has failed to show actual prejudice by the deficient notice to appear when he did appear at his removal hearing. Therefore, Mayorga cannot meet the requirement of Section 1326(d)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
