The record demonstrates that Labor sought in its investigation (throughout the initial, reconsideration, and remand phases) to identify the appropriate subdivision of Honeywell.

Accordingly, the court remands the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   so that Labor may reconsider whether requiring separation of at least three workers from a subdivision consisting of only three employees is an ordinary situation that fulfills the statute's remedial purpose. Labor may revisit its determination that Honeywell-Procurement is an appropriate subdivision as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   are remanded for Labor to reconsider its regulation as applied in this matter where the selected subdivision consists of only three employees, and to possibly also reconsider its determination that Honeywell-Procurement is an appropriate subdivision; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Labor shall file its remand results on or before March 29, 2019; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that, if applicable, the parties shall file a proposed scheduling order with page limits for comments on the remand results no later than seven days after Labor files its remand results with the court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Further citations to the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by the Trade Act of 2002, are to the relevant provisions of Title 19 of the U.S. Code, 2012 edition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \"CD\" refers to a document contained in the confidential administrative record, which is found in ECF No. 15, unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Labor identified \"Honeywell International, Inc., Home and Building Technology Division, Honeywell Security and Fire Group, Integrated Supply Chain Unit, Procurement Function\" (\"Honeywell-Procurement\") as the \"appropriate subdivision\" for purposes of its investigation into Plaintiffs' TAA eligibility. Plaintiffs' challenge to the reasonableness of Labor's selection of Honeywell-Procurement as the \"appropriate subdivision\" as defined under the statute and Labor's implementing regulation is discussed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
