The Court held a hearing on November 21, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court should allow William Patterson, an economic consultant from Albuquerque, New Mexico,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Curriculum Vitae at 1, filed September 6, 2018 (Doc. 75), to testify to the hedonic damages that Plaintiff Shirley Walker suffered from her automobile accident with Defendant Gregory J. Spina, who Defendant Valley Express, Inc. employed; and (ii) whether the Court should exclude the Patterson Report (dated June 6, 2017), filed August 30, 2018 (Doc. 72-1). The Court will grant the Motion in part and deny it in part. Pursuant to the United States of America Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and persuaded by other New Mexico federal district court opinions, the Court will preclude Patterson from quantifying S. Walker's hedonic damages or providing a benchmark figure for her hedonic damages. The Court will allow Patterson to testify generally about hedonic damages, including what they are and the factors considered in valuing them. The Court will preclude admission of the Patterson Report at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court recited this case's facts and early procedural history in its Memorandum Opinion and Order,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528518\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/347/868/#p872\">\n    347 F.Supp.3d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 872-73 (D.N.M. 2018).

On July 27, 2018, the Defendants filed the Defendants' Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Expert Witnesses William J. Patterson, III, Keith W. Harvie, D.O., and Michael Rodriguez, filed July 27, 2018 (Doc. 58)(\"Disclosure Motion\"), in which they seek to exclude Patterson because S. Walker did not \"provide an expert disclosure.\" Motion at 2. The Court addresses the Disclosure Motion in a separate Memorandum Opinion and Order, filed January 9, 2019 (Doc. 111).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the Motion, the Defendants describe Patterson's proposed testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 2-3. The Court summarizes that, and other, information about Patterson here to provide context for the Motion. Patterson is an economic consultant with Legal Economics, in Albuquerque.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Curriculum Vitae at 1. Patterson has a B.A. in economics from Carleton College, in Northfield, Minnesota and has served as an expert witness in several cases in New Mexico state and federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Curriculum Vitae at 1, 4. According to Patterson, the collision with Spina cost S. Walker household services worth $ 141,599.00. Motion at 2 (citing Patterson Report at 1). Patterson specifies that S. Walker would pay $ 1,000.00 per year for medical expenses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3 (citing Patterson Report at 1). He also lists specific numbers for S. Walker's loss of enjoyment of life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3 (citing Patterson Report at 1). He estimates that S. Walker suffered $ 10,000.00 a year in hedonic damages and calculates that the present value of these damages is $ 102,707.00. Patterson Report at 1. In the Patterson Report, Patterson includes his calculations for this $ 102,707.00 number.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Patterson Report at 4. On Wednesday, April 4, 2018, the Defendants deposed Patterson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 2 (citing generally Patterson Report; Deposition of William Patterson (Excerpts)(taken April 4, 2018) ), filed August 30, 2018 (Doc. 72)(\"Patterson Depo.\"). The Monday before the Patterson Depo., Patterson received documents on S. Walker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 2 (citing generally Patterson Report; Patterson Depo.). The documents -- \"the Deposition Transcript of Shirley S. Walker's deposition; each of Ms. S. Walker's discovery responses and the supplements of those responses; medical records from various providers; Senior Olympics documents; and various pleadings,\" Motion at 2 n.1 (citing Patterson Depo. at 72:1-84:23) -- did not change Patterson's opinions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response at 2 (citing Patterson Depo. at 6:1-8;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 65:23-67:6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Defendants argue that Patterson bases his opinions on \"speculation and generalities,\" and not on facts, and that \"his methods are not supported by economic principles or literature.\" Motion at 5. In the Motion, the Defendants describe Patterson's methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 2-3. According to the Defendants, \"Patterson did not interview Ms. Walker prior to drafting the report of his opinions.\" Motion at 2 (citing Patterson Depo. at 32:15-19). The Defendants note that Patterson testified that his calculation for S. Walker's lost value in household services are based on Kathryn E. Walker and Margaret E. Woods' \"Time Use, the Value of Household Production of Goods and Services,\" Motion at 2 (citing Patterson Depo. 34:16-23), in which K. Walker and Woods \"compiled data regarding time spent on household services for women under 55 who were employed and unemployed, and women over 55 who were employed and not employed,\" Motion at 3, and draw data from a 1967 to 1968 study of 1,296 families in Syracuse, New York,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion at 2. According to the Defendants, \"[t]he Study did not take into consideration single women over 55 years of age who were not employed.\" Motion at 3 (citing Patterson Depo. at 39:8-22). The Defendants indicate that Patterson assumes such single women belong in the same category as married women over 55 years old but \"d[oes] not know whether his assumption [is] correct.\" Motion at 3. According to the Defendants, Patterson testified that the $ 1,000.00 per year for medical expenses represents a \"benchmark figure\" and not an actual figure for S. Walker's medical expenses. Motion at 3 (citing Patterson Depo. at 48:20-24;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:2-50:7;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:1-16). Further, the Defendants explain that Patterson bases S. Walker's hedonic damages on the value of statistical lives, and \"does not know what Ms. S. Walker's specific lost pleasure of life is.\" Motion at 3 (citing Patterson Depo. at 56:4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to the Defendants, the substance of Patterson's proposed testimony was found inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   \"), and\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The Defendants explain that courts and economic literature criticize \"hedonic damages,\" and the \"disparity of results reached in published value-of-life studies and trouble regarding their underlying methodology\" have led courts to reject hedonic damages. Motion at 6. The Defendants indicate that \"the trend is away from allowing expert opinion testimony on valuation of hedonic damages.\" Motion at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    McGuire v. City of Santa Fe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7769041\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/954/230/#p233\">\n    954 F.Supp. 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 233 (D.N.M. 1996) (Black, J.) ). Although the Defendants concede that courts have admitted \"explanations of hedonic damages,\" the Defendants aver that Patterson proposes to testify only to inadmissible information on value-of-life studies and the value of S. Walker's hedonic damages. Motion at 7. The Defendants explain that Patterson relies on statistical-life values drawn \"from governmental studies, such as wage differential or willingness to pay studies,\" which courts have recognized as \"based on assumptions that have not been, and cannot be, validated.\" Motion at 8. According to the Defendants, because the statistical-life valuations are anonymous, hedonic damages valuations do not reflect the \"injured individuals' loss of enjoyment of life.\" Motion at 8. The Defendants further note that Patterson has not \"purport[ed] to give an opinion\" on the\n   value of S. Walker's loss of enjoyment of life or \"a specific value the jury should award,\" but proffers only a \"benchmark for the jury to consider.\" Motion at 8-9 (citing Patterson Report at 7; Patterson Depo. at 21-53:5). Courts, the Defendants note, have rejected such benchmark figures, because the figures do not reflect individual loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 9. According to the Defendants, Patterson's valuation assumes that S. Walker will live until ninety-one, but this estimation ignores S. Walker's \"lifestyle,\" \"medical history,\" age, and employment status. Motion at 10. The Defendants additionally argue that a jury can \"understand and calculate\" hedonic damages, and so, such damages do not aid the jury. Motion at 9. The Defendants further allege that Patterson points to no \"peer-reviewed literature\" supporting his methodology, Motion at 10, and that Patterson does not know in which category in K. Walker and Woods' \"Time Use, the Value of Household Production of Goods and Services\" S. Walker belongs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion at 10 (citing Patterson Depo. at 41:11-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Defendants also contend that Patterson speculates about S. Walker's \"future medical expenses.\" Motion at 10. Patterson does not know S. Walker's required future medical treatment, or the actual and inflationary rates for her medical treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. Patterson, the Defendants argue, therefore, \"proposed general future medical expenses.\" Motion at 11. Further, the Defendants aver that S. Walker does not distinguish between \"timeframes for different forms of medical treatment,\" Motion at 11, but \"lumps all treatment together into one of three general categories,\" Motion at 11. The Defendants note that, although Patterson knows of no future medical expenses, he \"proposes\" to give the jury \" 'benchmark' figures of future expenses.\" Motion at 11. The Defendants argue that, given that Patterson bases such figures on \"speculative and unidentified treatment,\" the testimony will not help the jury but will instead confuse the jury. Motion at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   S. Walker replied on September 6, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Defendants' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of William Patterson at 6, filed September 6, 2018 (Doc. 75)(\"Response\"). S. Walker begins by asserting that New Mexico law governs the issue, because the Court sits in diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 1, at 1. S. Walker asserts that New Mexico state courts have permitted expert testimony on hedonic damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 3, at 2. According to S. Walker, New Mexico courts have repeatedly admitted Patterson's expert testimony on the substance to which he proposes to testify here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 2, at 2. S. Walker notes that Patterson has a B.A. in economics; has taught economics; has written on \"legal-economic topics,\" such as the value of life; and has testified \"over 100 times\" \"in court.\" Response at 2. S. Walker indicates that, in\n   <em>\n    Gurule v.

In response to the Court's questions about New Mexico state courts' attitude toward expert testimony on hedonic damages, the Defendants explained that New Mexico state courts permit such testimony, including testimony on benchmark figures for hedonic damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:9-20 (Court, Ball).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court inquired what Patterson would testify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:21-22 (Court). The Defendants responded that Patterson will give the jury a figure of $ 102,707.00 for S. Walker's hedonic damages, and that Patterson reaches that number by choosing $ 10,000.00 a year as a benchmark for S. Walker's lost value of life, multiplying that $ 10,000.00 by S. Walker's life expectancy, and adjusting that number to its present value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:23-21:5 (Ball);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:8-18 (Ball). The Court questioned why Patterson could not testify to this figure and methodology, because the Court does not know how to make this calculation, and the Defendants explained that no reliable methodology for calculating hedonic damages exists and that New Mexico federal district courts have repeatedly concluded that such testimony is unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:19-23:23 (Ball, Court). In response to the Court's question regarding what Patterson could testify, the Defendants noted that Patterson could define hedonic damages for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:1-15 (Court, Ball).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   S. Walker indicated that the \"real issue in this case,\" Tr. at 25:21-22 (A. Ayala), is whether New Mexico law or federal law should determine whether Patterson can testify to hedonic damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 25:22-26:2 (A. Ayala). S. Walker complained that, in a New Mexico state court, under\n   <em>\n    Gurule v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   , Patterson could testify as an expert to hedonic damages, because New Mexico state courts do not apply rule 702 to non-scientific testimony, and expressed that S. Walker suffers from the Defendants' forum shopping.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   25:22-28:11 (A. Ayala). S. Walker admitted that the Defendants' concerns about Patterson's methodology form grounds for impeachment, and noted that Patterson's opinions did not change after he read S. Walker's deposition, medical records, and other documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28:13-29:18 (A. Ayala). According to S. Walker, if the Court applies New Mexico law, the Court must decide whether Patterson's opinions have a proper basis and whether he has the knowledge and experience to testify to hedonic damages, and S. Walker notes that, in\n   <em>\n    Gurule v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals of New Mexico decided these questions in Patterson's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 29:18-30:12 (A. Ayala).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Defendants responded that, in\n   <em>\n    Sims v.

The Court stated that it is not inclined to allow Patterson to quantify hedonic damages or to allow S.

First, as the Court discussed in the \"New Mexico Law Regarding Hedonic Damages\" section, the Court predicts that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would allow an expert to quantify a party's hedonic damages.

The Court anticipates that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would identify rule 11-702 as procedural. The Supreme Court of New Mexico has not identified any substantive purposes to rule 11-702.

The written opinions are a goldmine for figuring out what the trial judge is going to do with the new expert's report. Lawyers should research their judge thoroughly through Lexis and Westlaw. In the 21st century, litigants can know their judge like the hand knows the glove.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    When the Court was a young associate at a large law firm after its clerkships, the Court and a co-associate, and the Court's future partner, would swing by the University of New Mexico School of Law every evening after work, alternating days, to go through a box of slip opinions by the federal judges. The lower federal judges in the early 1980s would send the opinion to the counsel of record by mail but also send a copy to the law library. The Court and the other associate would copy almost every opinion and create binders by subject matter: rule 12(b)(1), rule 32, etc. Some binders got so large that they got dividers to divide the opinions by specific judges. The Court and the other associate kept up the laborious data collection even when the Court and the other associate started their own firm. The Court and its firm would cite, quote, and discuss the opinions of the local federal judges back to them in its briefing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    If the Court went to this much travail to locate all the opinions of the judge before whom it was appearing, imagine what it thinks when it receives a brief citing, discussing, or quoting mostly other courts' opinions on topics on which the Court has written, sometimes extensively and exhaustively. In contrast to the paper world in which the Court lived in the early and mid-1980s, all an associate has to do with Lexis and Westlaw is put in the judge's name and the subject to be researched. With research by judge and topic so easy today, there is no excuse for a lawyer not to know the opinion of the judge before whom they are practicing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Rule 702's most prominent hurdle is the sufficiency of basis.

The Judicial Conference runs the federal judiciary through committees.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     About the Judicial Conference\n    </em>\n    , U.S. Cts., https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/governance-judicial-conference/about-judicial-conference (last visited Jan. 5, 2019)(\"The Conference operates through a network of committees ...\"). The Judicial Conference has a Standing Committee on Rules. The Standing Committee has five Advisory Committees: (i) Civil Procedure; (ii) Criminal Procedure; (iii) Evidence; (iv) Bankruptcy; and (v) Appellate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     How the Rulemaking Process Works\n    </em>\n    , U.S. Cts., https://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/about-rulemaking-process/how-rulemaking-process-works (last visited Jan. 5, 2019).

The reporter position is more prestigious if the reporter can get new rules promulgated. They have to justify their existence. There is thus a very smart, likeable, and well-liked person putting pressure on the committee to amend the rules. While judges are more conservative about promulgating new rules, they too often succumb to the reporter's pressure. The result is that the federal judiciary and the bar gets a host of new rules almost every year. The development of new rules burdens the federal judiciary and the bar -- all of which are overworked -- with mandatory changes each year, often constituting little more than stylistic changes. Everyone has to get new rule books every year. The burden of new rules often does not justify the meager benefits of the changes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The Court is clipping the wings of experts all the time.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Abraham v.

The danger for the legal system is that this empowerment of the expert witness will result in undue deference to his or her opinion.\"). Appellate judges often do not have extensive or any trial experience, particularly as Presidents want to rule from the grave, and appoint younger and younger appellate judges, who often -- because of their years -- have not spent a lot of time trying cases in the courtroom before juries. Academics, corporate lawyers, general counsel, and appellate judges -- without considerable courtroom experience -- think that experts will easily mislead juries. Yet, the Court talks regularly to juries after jury trials, and the Court listens to trial lawyers talking to juries after jury trials. Juries often expressly state that they disregarded the parties' experts. The Court often hears comments like the \"expert arrogant and/or incomprehensible.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Part of the problem is that academics and, often, appellate jurists do not appreciate or understand modern American jurors. Jurors have become very independent, and do not take direction well or easily from anyone -- the judge, lawyers, or experts. The days of dressing up for court in coats and ties, and doing what the judge tells them to do are fading. Jurors question everything. If the Court tells them to go in one door, they want to use another. Whereas jurors used to complement the Court's jury instructions as giving a roadmap to the jurors' decisions, jurors now criticize even the uniform or pattern jury instructions. Modern American jurors do not like to think that they are being told what to do. And they certainly do not like experts telling them what to do; modern American jurors do not like the idea of \"experts\" who are smarter than they are.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    At the same time that modern American jurors are showing more independence, paternalistic\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    hearings have proliferated.

The challenge to forensic evidence comes from two areas: (i) the federal courts; and (ii) the scientific community. The reports of the National Academies of Science (\"NAS\") and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (\"PCAST\") raise challenges to the reliability of forensic methods.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Executive Office of the President President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology,\n    <em>\n     Report to the President, Forensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods\n    </em>\n    (Sept. 2016); Committee on Identifying the Needs of the Forensic Sciences Community, National Research Council,\n    <em>\n     Strengthening Forensics Science in the United States: A Path Forward\n    </em>\n    (July 2009).

The Court is not a big fan of addressing the topic of forensic evidence through rulemaking. No rule, procedures manual, or note is needed to tell judges that there is no certainty with forensic opinions. There is also no reasonable degree of certainty. These opinions are now considered overstated: in the old days -- like last week -- attorneys would routinely ask: \"Doctor, in your opinion, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the plaintiff's appendix was on the left side of the body?\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The nation does not need another rule. An examination of Article VII -- Opinions and Expert Testimony -- shows six rules: (i) rule 701 -- Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses; (ii) rule 702 -- Testimony by Expert Witnesses; (iii) rule 703 -- Bases of an Expert's Opinion Testimony; (iv) rule 704 -- Opinion on an Ultimate Issue; (v) rule 705 -- Disclosing the Facts or Data Underlying an Expert's Opinion; (vi) rule 706 -- Court-Appointed Expert Witnesses (a bad idea in about all cases).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 701 -06. If the reporter would drop rule 706, perhaps there would be room for a rule pertaining to forensic evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The Court is concerned with what a new rule would look like. The judiciary could make its point in a committee note, but without a new rule, there is no need for a new note. The PCAST report does not propose a change to the Evidence Rules. Rather, PCAST proposes a best procedures manual.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 145. It would be better if legal leaders do like Duke University School of Law has done for class actions and the Sedona Conference has done for electronic discovery.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Class-Action Settlement Conference\n    </em>\n    , Duke Law, https://law.duke.edu/judicialstudies/conferences/oct2016/ (last visited Jan. 7, 2019);\n    <em>\n     The Sedona Conference Working Group Series\n    </em>\n    , The Sedona Conference, https://thesedonaconference.org/wgs (last visited Jan. 7, 2019). Rather than a new rule or note, the Court believes that a best practices manual -- prepared by professional leaders that come together to write -- and not the judiciary -- would be the better approach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The Court expects several difficulties with a new rule. The first difficulty with any rule on forensic evidence will be determining to whom it should apply. A new rule would presumably apply to forensic witnesses' testimony. Such witnesses include people testifying about evidence about through scientific means, by comparing patterns, or by \"experimental or scientific analysis.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Evidence,\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    (10th ed. 2014). After the Court and the bar have identified the universe of experts to whom the rule applies or the best practices apply, the new rules' requirements must be determined. An expert must already satisfy all of rule 702's requirements. Under a new rule, the expert will also need to satisfy all of the new requirements. With more handles, the chances of exclusion or limiting are enhanced. Rule 702's requirements, however, are enough, and the law should not require more.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    In performing its\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    -mandated duty to predict what a state supreme court would do if faced with a case,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state-law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit -- or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves -- would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point -- regardless whether it accurately reflects state law -- at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long as federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination -- the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants -- if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion -- have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' decisions are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. Accordingly, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind state law developments -- developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states. The Tenth Circuit used to follow this rationale in applying a clearly erroneous standard of review to district judge decisions of state law with no controlling state supreme court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weiss v.

Since the mid-1980s, however, the Tenth Circuit has abandoned that rationale and applied a de novo standard of review to district judge decisions applying state law with no governing state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

The Court regrets the Tenth Circuit's retreat from the clearly erroneous standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court concludes that the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding -- what the state law was on the day the opinion was published -- but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x.\n    </em>\n    Its holdings are descriptive and not prescriptive -- interpretive and not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court concludes that the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions --\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law -- in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This statement may not be the most precise formulation if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court -- the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, former United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Labs. v.

Ill. 1983) (Shadur, J.)(noting that the approach of predicting the state supreme court's holdings will often lead to litigants obtaining a different result in federal court than they would in state court, where only the law of the circuit in which they filed -- and certainly not nonexistent, speculative state supreme court law -- governs) -- but it is a workable solution that has achieved consensus.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Allstate Ins. v. Menards, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446224\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/630/#p637\">\n     285 F.3d 630\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 637 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"[W]e adhere today to the general rule, articulated and applied throughout the United States, that, in determining the content of state law, the federal courts must assume the perspective of the highest court in that state and attempt to ascertain the governing substantive law on the point in question.\"). This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court -- considerations that would never inform a federal court's analysis of federal law -- may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time -- forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous) -- federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases -- even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law -- alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree. In\n    <em>\n     Wankier v.

From this passage, it seems clear that the Tenth Circuit permits a district court to deviate from its view of state law only on the basis of a subsequent case \"of the state's highest court.\"\n    <em>\n     The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n    </em>\n    1402 (William Morris ed., New College ed. 1976)(defining \"unless\" as \"[e]xcept on the condition that; except under the circumstances that\"). A more aggressive reading of the passage -- namely the requirement that the intervening case \"resolv[e] the issue\" -- might additionally compel the determination that any intervening case law must definitively and directly contradict the Tenth Circuit interpretation to be considered \"intervening.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    It is difficult to know whether the Honorable Michael W.

Corp.\n    </em>\n    of \"intervening decision\" to cases from the highest state court was an oversight or intentional. Most of the Tenth Circuit's previous formulations of this rule have defined intervening decisions inclusively as all subsequent decisions of \"that state's courts,\" a term which seems to include trial and intermediate appellate courts.
