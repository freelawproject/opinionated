Crabtree, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the court is defendants Kris Kobach and Scott Schwab's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It presents two vexing questions of constitutional law: Does the Constitution recognize a right to informational privacy? And, if so, does that right prohibit public disclosure of purportedly private voter information? Regrettably, the Supreme Court has not decided either one of these questions. And though our Circuit has decided the first question, it has not addressed the second one. Consistent with Circuit precedent, the court concludes that such a right exists and, though it is a close\n   question, the court holds that the Complaint's allegations plead a plausible claim for relief. The pages that follow explain why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court emphasizes that two procedural requirements play a prominent part in these conclusions. One, the questions come to the court on a motion to dismiss. The standard for surviving such a motion is a relatively forgiving one. Two, the court must assume that the \"facts\" pleaded in the Complaint are true, and view them in the light favoring plaintiffs. While the court applies that standard in this Order, it does not imply that plaintiffs ultimately will prove their version of the facts is true. Time will tell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before describing the facts that control the current motion, the court briefly summarizes the case's overarching legal issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Constitution does not explicitly recognize a right to informational privacy. On this everyone agrees. But a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions has assumed, without deciding, that such a right exists.\n   <em>\n    NASA v.

Here, plaintiffs Scott Moore, James Long, and Nancy Perry bring this lawsuit, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, against defendant Kris Kobach. They have sued defendant Kobach in his individual capacity and official capacity as Kansas Secretary of State. Defendant Kobach no longer serves as Kansas Secretary of State, so, by rule, current Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab becomes the defendant on the official capacity claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs' two claims take aim at the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program (\"Crosscheck\"), a data comparison program used to compare voter registration information among participating states. The Kansas Secretary of State's (\"KSOS\") Office runs Crosscheck. In Count One, the Complaint alleges that the Kansas Secretary of State-acting in his official capacity-has violated their Fourteenth Amendment right to informational privacy in two ways: (1) failing to adopt adequate safeguards for Crosscheck; and (2) disclosing part of plaintiffs' Social Security numbers and other personally identifiable information. And, because plaintiffs allege these constitutional violations are continuing ones, they seek injunctive and declaratory relief requiring the KSOS to stop exchanging plaintiffs' voter data until the KSOS can ensure their information will not be subject to public disclosure. In Count Two, plaintiffs allege that defendant Kobach-in his individual capacity-has violated the Kansas Public Records Act (\"KPRA\"). Plaintiffs seek civil penalties on their KPRA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss both claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Doc. 11. Plaintiffs have filed a Response in Opposition. Doc. 14. And, defendants have submitted a Reply. Doc. 15. After considering the parties' arguments the court denies the Motion to Dismiss for reasons explained, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As referenced above, the court must accept the facts asserted in the Complaint as\n   true, and view them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Burnett v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049512\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/1231/#p1235\">\n    706 F.3d 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1235 (10th Cir. 2013) (citing\n   <em>\n    Smith v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3482373\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/1090/#p1098\">\n    561 F.3d 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1098 (10th Cir. 2009) ). The following facts thus come from plaintiffs' Complaint (Doc. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Former Kansas Secretary of State Ron Thornburg launched Crosscheck in 2005 to help Kansas and neighboring states compare voter data and detect double registrants. The KSOS Office administers Crosscheck by collecting voter registration information from participant states and cross-referencing lists for potential matches. The KSOS then generates reports listing potential duplicate records for each participating state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Crosscheck uses a two-point match criteria, identifying registered voters who share the same first name, last name, and date of birth. Participating states also are asked to provide additional voter data, including part of the Social Security number, voter status, middle name, voter identification number, mailing address, county, date of registration, and whether the voter cast a ballot in the most recent election. In 2017, at least 10 states did not provide partial Social Security numbers for the KSOS to use to narrow results of the program's cross-checking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Crosscheck participants principally share data through a File Transfer Protocol (\"FTP\") website, which the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office previously hosted. The KSOS now hosts this site. Participants share data with the KSOS by uploading their voter rolls to the FTP site. Specifically, each participant state extracts voter data from its registration rolls and formats that information to coincide with the formatting used by Crosscheck for data. The participating states then encrypt their files using a free encryption program and upload the data to the FTP site. Before 2017, defendant Kobach used the AxCrypt software to encrypt files; plaintiffs allege that 7-zip, another free encryption program, is now used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Participating states are asked to upload their data each January. Once they upload their extraction files, the KSOS pulls the files from the FTP site, runs a comparison of each state's voter information, and uploads result files to the FTP site. The KSOS then notifies each state that its results file is available and emails a decryption passphrase enabling the state to open its results file. The results file contains a potential match list, which identifies voters registered in that state who share a name and date of birth with a voter in another state. Once states have received their potential match lists, they may contact the other state where the voter, at least potentially, is double registered. When processing potential match results, the KSOS advises participating states to procure the voter's middle name, a partial Social Security number, and signature to help determine whether the voter has registered to vote in more than one state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Each state participating in Crosscheck is directed to inform the KSOS about its preferred method for communicating information requests. While the Crosscheck participation guide cautions against transmitting personally identifiable information about voting registrants via e-mail, no provision of the Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") restricts unsecured transmissions. Plaintiffs allege that the MOU contains the only requirements governing states' participation in Crosscheck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Policies and Practices for Requesting and Transmitting Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a participant in Crosscheck, the KSOS analyzes potential matches by comparing\n   secondary data about voters. Secondary data includes voters' partial Social Security numbers and middle initials. Once the KSOS narrows the number of potential matches, it submits information requests to the other state where double voting may have occurred. The KSOS provides the name and date of birth of potential match voters to the other participating states and requests documentation about voting history and the voter's signature in the other state. Plaintiffs allege that the KSOS requests states to supply voter signatures as unencrypted email attachments. Plaintiffs also allege that the KSOS lacks a method to narrow potential matches when the other participating state does not provide a partial Social Security number or a middle initial. So, plaintiffs contend, when a state does not include partial Social Security numbers or middle initials in its extraction file, the KSOS maintains a practice of sending full potential match lists in unencrypted email attachments to the other participant state. These full match lists include partial Social Security numbers and other personal identifying information about hundreds of voters. About half the states participating in Crosscheck provide partial Social Security numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. States Begin to Join Crosscheck\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   From 2005 to 2011, Crosscheck had just four participating states: Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska. When defendant Kobach took office in 2011, he pledged to expand Crosscheck, declaring \"I have taken it under my wing and want to build it as one of my personal missions.\" Doc. 1 at 18. In 2012, 10 new states joined Crosscheck, expanding the number of participants to 14 states. By 2016, 30 states participated in Crosscheck. So, plaintiffs allege, in 10 years Crosscheck's participants increased from four to 26 states and 100 million voter records were added to its comparison database. Despite this increase in the number of participating states and voter records, defendant Kobach never developed a more sophisticated protocol for sharing potential matches or ensuring that states maintained the shared voter data in a secure fashion. Also, defendant Kobach downsized his IT staff after the program expanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Industry Standard Protocols for Data Maintenance and Transmission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Office of Management and Budget requires federal executive agencies to \"[e]ncrypt all...moderate-impact and high-impact information at rest and in transit.\" Doc. 1 at 19. The National Institute of Standards and Technology suggests multiple factors to determine the \"impact level\" of information. They include the following factors: how identifiable the information is; how sensitive the information is, both individually and in the aggregate; and how sensitive the information is, given its purpose. Under these factors, transmitting one Social Security number by itself is sufficient to trigger moderate-impact protocols and, therefore, an encryption requirement. The aggregation and transmission of Social Security numbers with other information warrants additional security protocols.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Similarly, the Kansas Information Technology Executive Council (KITEC)-which is responsible for approving and maintaining all information technology policies for Kansas's governmental agencies-has promulgated minimum technology security requirements. KITEC's minimum standards mandate that users protect all restricted-use information from unauthorized disclosure and encrypt such information when sending it outside a secure boundary. KITEC's encryption requirement explicitly applies to information that \"is not subject to public release by an entity in accordance\n   with statute or court order,\" including partial Social Security numbers provided as part of voter registration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Defendants' Collection, Maintenance, and Transmission Protocols as the Operator of Crosscheck\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendant Kobach, as Crosscheck's operator, exposed the confidential personal information of Kansas voters by his practice of collecting, maintain, and transmitting data. On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that defendant Kobach sent usernames, login information, and decryption passwords (which provide access to Crosscheck results files) in clear text emails to dozens of recipients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   From 2012 to 2017, defendant Kobach uploaded and extracted voter files by using an unsecure FTP. Plaintiffs allege that Crosscheck's FTP is not a secure method of transmission, and it lacks additional layers of security. Also, plaintiffs allege that Crosscheck's FTP server lacked a valid secure socket layer (\"SSL\") certificate and was not fortified by secure shell (\"SSH\") software. So, extraction files and results files containing personal identifying information about Kansas voters and partial Social Security numbers were transmitted to and from the host server by unsecure methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At some point in or near October 2017, defendant Kobach began hosting the Crosscheck database on a server operated in the KSOS's Office. Plaintiffs allege that the server lacked and still lacks industry standard security protocols. For example, currently, the Crosscheck server uses a single-factor authentication system. This kind of system allows access to the Crosscheck program without detection. And, plaintiffs allege, Crosscheck's database is linked to other Kansas governmental networks that are not password protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Defendants' Maintenance and Transmission Protocols as a Participant in Crosscheck\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a Crosscheck participant, defendant Kobach exposed the confidential personal information of Kansas voters by collecting, maintaining, and transmitting their data. Plaintiffs allege that defendant Kobach has sent voters' personal identifying information, partial Social Security numbers, and voter signatures as unencrypted email attachments to other participating states. Plaintiffs allege this exposure is ongoing. Also, plaintiffs allege defendant Kobach directed counties to send voters' personal identifying information and partial Social Security numbers as unencrypted email attachments to other participating states. Last, plaintiffs allege that defendant Kobach shared confidential personal information about Kansas voters with other states who could release that personal voter information to the public in response to open records requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Defendant Kobach Declines to Share Voter Information with Election Integrity Commission Because He Believes It Would Violate State Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On May 12, 2017, President Donald J. Trump appointed defendant Kobach to serve as Vice-Chair of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. And, on June 28, 2017, defendant Kobach addressed a letter to himself and election officials in 49 other states requesting \"the publicly-available voter file data for [your state], including, if publicly available under the laws of your state, the full first and last names of all registrants, middle names or initials if available, addresses, dates of birth, political party (if recorded in your state), last four digits of social security number if available, voter history (elections\n   voted in) from 2006 onward, active/inactive status, cancelled status, information regarding any felony convictions, information regarding voter information in another state, information regarding military status, and overseas citizen information.\" Doc. 1 at 22. Defendant Kobach directed himself and the other election officials to \"submit your responses electronically to ElectionIntegrityStaff@ovp.eop.gov or by utilizing the Safe Access File Exchange (\"SAFE\"), which is a secure FTP site the federal government uses for transferring large data files.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On July 3, 2017, Kansas House Minority Leader Jim Ward sent a letter to Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt. This letter requested an opinion \"whether the Secretary of State may disclose to the federal government [certain voter registration information without voter consent].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. The Attorney General issued his opinion on or around July 11, 2017. It opined that \"the Secretary of State is forbidden to release the last four digits of a voter's Social Security number submitted as part of a voter registration and must redact that information from any records that may be released [to the public].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Attorney General Schmidt also opined that the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity was a \"person\" for purposes of the Kansas Open Records Act, and any information shared with the Commission was tantamount to releasing the information to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant Kobach publicly stated that he would not share voters' partial Social Security numbers with the Commission, asserting that \"[i]n Kansas, the Social Security number is not publicly available.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, defendant Kobach claimed that it may be legal to share voters' partial Social Security number with the Commission if Kansas uploaded the information. He asserted, \"If the Commission decides that they would like to receive Social Security numbers to a secure site in order to remove false positives, then we would have to double check and make sure Kansas law permits\" it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    H. States Express Concern About Defendant Kobach's Security and Transmission Protocols\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   States participating in Crosscheck expressed concerns that voters' partial Social Security numbers would be subject to release by other participating states under certain state open records laws. According to Kansas Elections Director Brian Caskey, half of the states participating in Crosscheck do not provide voters' partial Social Security numbers in their extraction files. When Florida participated in Crosscheck, the Director of the Florida Division of Elections (\"FDE\") declined to provide Social Security information because defendant Kobach could not ensure that the voters' Social Security numbers would not be subject to release in response to an open records request. The FDE suggested that defendant Kobach create and share a list of the information closed from disclosure under each participating state's laws. Defendant Kobach declined to implement this practice even though his staff acknowledged that it \"[has] been concerned about [records requests] for several years,\" and \"would like to find firmer legal footing for denying those requests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that at least four states either have left or stopped participating in Crosscheck based on concerns about defendant Kobach's ability to secure private voter information. According to a survey, New York left Crosscheck, in part, because \"there was no guarantee [that Social Security numbers] would be private.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And, Kentucky Secretary of State Allison Grimes suggested that Kentucky withdrew\n   from Crosscheck because defendant Kobach could not protect voter data from public disclosure: Secretary Grimes linked a story about defendant Kobach's release of voter and state employee Social Security numbers. She also wrote, \"Another example of why KY doesn't participate in KS #Crosscheck program[.]\" Illinois and Idaho both have stated publicly that they will not send information to Crosscheck until defendant Kobach can guarantee the voter data's security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plaintiffs' Voter Information is Disclosed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Scott Moore\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff Scott Moore is a 46-year-old United States citizen living in Mission Hills, Kansas. Mr. Moore first registered to vote in Kansas in Douglas County in 1992, while attending the University of Kansas. He re-registered to vote in 1998 after moving to Johnson County. Mr. Moore is registered as an unaffiliated, or \"independent\" voter. He has voted in every general election contest in Kansas since 1992.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In 2013, defendant Kobach compared Mr. Moore's information with voter data submitted from Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Moore shares a birthdate with a man named Scott Moore, who lives in Naples, Florida. As a result, Mr. Moore was one of 945 voters who defendant Kobach identified as potential double registrants in 2013. On April 29, 2013, defendant Kobach sent the list of potential double registrants, a list that included Mr. Moore, to the FDE in an unencrypted email attachment. In November 2017, the FDE released defendant Kobach's email containing the name, date of birth, address, and partial Social Security number of 945 voters. This disclosure included Mr. Moore's information. Others could view the exposed information because defendant Kobach's office shared the information in an unencrypted attachment to an email sent to the FDE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In November 2017, Mr. Moore learned that his information was disclosed from his neighbor, Anita Parsa. Ms. Parsa had received the list from Florida in response to an open records request, and she contacted Mr. Moore. And, in March 2018, Mr. Moore received a letter from the FDE offering him a year-long subscription to Lifelock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2. James Long\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff James Long is a 74-year-old United States citizen. He is a Navy veteran living in Topeka, Kansas. Mr. Long first registered to vote in Kansas in 1961 and never has registered to vote in another state. He has lived in Shawnee County for most of his life, except for several years while he served in the Navy. Mr. Long has voted in every presidential election in Kansas since 1964. He also has voted in the majority, if not all, of the state and municipal elections conducted in Topeka, Kansas, since 1990.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In 2013, defendant Kobach compared Mr. Long's information with voter data submitted from Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mr. Long shares a birthdate with a man named James Long, who lives in South Palm Beach, Florida. As a result, Mr. Long was one of 945 voters who defendant Kobach identified as a potential double registrant in 2013. On April 29, 2013, defendant Kobach sent the list of potential\n   double registrants, a list that included Mr. Long, to the FDE in an unencrypted email attachment. In November 2017, the FDE released defendant Kobach's email containing the name, date of birth, address, and partial Social Security number of 945 voters. This disclosure included Mr. Long's information. Others could view the exposed information because defendant Kobach's office shared the information in an unencrypted attachment to an email sent to the FDE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Long does not recall receiving a letter from the FDE notifying him that his information was disclosed. Also, he does not recall receiving an offer for a year-long subscription to Lifelock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Nancy Perry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nancy Perry is a 61-year-old United States citizen living in Topeka, Kansas. In 2005, Ms. Perry registered to vote in Kansas. She is registered as an \"independent\" or \"unaffiliated\" voter and has voted in every general election in Kansas since 2010. Ms. Perry has not lived or registered to vote in another state since registering in Kansas in 2005. She never has lived in or registered to vote in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In 2013, defendant Kobach compared Ms. Moore's information with voter data submitted from Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Ms. Perry shares a birthdate with a woman named Nancy Perry who lives in Osceola County, Florida. As a result, Ms. Perry was one of the 945 voters defendant Kobach identified as a potential double registrant in 2013. On April 29, 2013, defendant Kobach sent the list of potential double registrants, a list that included Ms. Perry, to the FDE in an unencrypted email attachment. In November 2017, the FDE released defendant Kobach's email. It contained the name, date of birth, address, and partial Social Security number of 945 voters, including Ms. Perry's information.

The letter also offered Ms. Perry a year-long subscription to Lifelock if she enrolled before April 21, 2018. Ms. Perry was confused why the Florida Secretary of State would have possessed her Social Security number. Because Ms. Perry believed she may have received the letter mistakenly and wanted to get more information, she did not enroll before the April 21 deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    J. Florida Division of Elections Releases Plaintiffs' Voter Information in Response to an Open Records Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On November 20, 2017, the Florida Division of Elections released more than 200 emails in response to an open records request submitted by Anita Parsa about Florida's participation in Crosscheck. One email that defendant Kobach had sent to the FDE included attachments of unencrypted documents. These documents contained partial Social Security numbers and personal identifying information about Kansas voters. The documents were not password protected. Also, defendant Kobach failed to redact the partial Social Security numbers of the 945 Kansas voters identified in the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The FDE also produced a second email from Harvey County, Kansas Election Clerk Rick Piepho. This email included a\n   PDF attachment of the Kansas Voter Registration application for a resident of Newton in Harvey County, Kansas. This attachment divulged the voter's name, address, driver's license number, phone number, and partial Social Security number. The PDF attachment was neither encrypted nor password protected. The Election Clerk also had failed to redact the voter's partial Social Security number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    K. Voters Learn About the Disclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, in March 2018, the FDE mailed letters to Kansas voters whose information had been disclosed publicly in response to Ms. Parsa's open records request. Plaintiffs Moore and Perry received the FDE's letter. The FDE's letter notified the Kansas voters that part of their Social Security numbers had been disclosed and offered them a complimentary year-long subscription to Lifelock identity theft protection services. The letter did not explain how the disclosure had occurred or why Florida possessed sensitive information about Kansas residents. The Lifelock subscription would have provided the Kansas voters with reimbursement benefits worth $25,000, identity restoration support services, and an identity theft alert system. To receive the Lifelock subscription, the Kansas voters had to subscribe for the service over the phone no later than April 21, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The question, then, is not whether the allegation uses the words, \"information and belief.\" Instead, the question is whether such allegations are supported by specific facts asserted by the Complaint. Close review of the disputed allegations in this Complaint reveals that specific facts support the challenged allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As an example, plaintiffs allege \"On information and belief, [that] Kansas requests states to supply voter signatures as an unencrypted email attachment.\" Doc. 1 at 17 (Compl. \u00b6 55);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (Compl. \u00b6 72) (\"On information and belief, Defendant Kobach has sent and continues to send voter personal identifying information and partial social security numbers as an unencrypted email attachment to other participant states.\").

The court concludes that specific facts alleged in the cited email support these allegations sufficiently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The other allegations challenged by defendants' argument follow a similar pattern. The Complaint alleges \"On information and belief, Kansas lacks a method for narrowing potential matches when a state does not provide partial social security numbers or middle initials.\" Doc. 1 at 18 (Compl. \u00b6 56);\n   <em>\n    but see id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 57 n.29) (citing email from Mr. Beckner stating, \"I didn't know of any other way to really examine if any double votes occurred between [Kansas and Florida] without middle initial or SSN to narrow the results.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Also, the Complaint alleges \"On information and belief, the server continues to lack industry standard security protocols.\" Doc. 1 at 21 (Compl. \u00b6 69). The next sentence provides the factual basis for this assertion: \"For instance, the Crosscheck server currently only uses a single-factor authentication system, allowing potential access to the program without detection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Compl. \u00b6 10) (\"In January 2018, security firm, Netragard performed an audit of Crosscheck's server security and found the system still lacked industry standard security features and remained vulnerable to hacking.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   And, the Complaint alleges, \"on information and belief, [that] the database is linked to other Kansas government networks that are not password protected.\" Doc. 1 at 21 (Compl. \u00b6 70). The Complaint alleges that defendants began hosting the Crosscheck data on a server in the KSOS's Office, and that the server lacks industry standard security protocols. Doc. 1 at 21 (Compl. \u00b6 69). The Complaint further alleges, \"Defendant Kobach's office maintained a practice of emailing the server URL and encryption passwords in plain text, [and] the audit revealed that any reader of the emails would easily be able to access and download voter records.\" Doc. 1 at 5 (Compl. \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Last, defendants contest the sufficiency of these allegations: \"On information and belief, Defendant Kobach has sent and continues to send voter personal identifying information and partial social security numbers as an unencrypted email attachment to other participant states[,]\" Doc. 1 at 21 (Compl. \u00b6 72); \"On information and belief, Defendant Kobach sends voter signatures as an unencrypted email attachment to other participant states[,]\" Doc. 1 at 21 (Compl. \u00b6 73); and, \"On information and belief, Defendant Kobach shares the confidential personal information of Kansas voters with states that could release voter information to the public in response to an open records request[,]\" Doc. 1 at 21 (Compl. \u00b6 75). But the Complaint lends factual support to these allegations with specific facts: \"In November 2017, the Florida Department of State Division of Elections...released the name, date of birth, address, and partial social security number of 945 Kansas voters, including that of the Plaintiffs. The exposed information was shared by Defendant Kobach's office as an unencrypted attachment to an email sent to FDE.\" Doc. 1 at 6 (Compl. \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants' \"information and belief\" argument is unpersuasive. The court thus rejects defendants' request to exclude these allegations from the facts accepted as true for purposes of the current motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    V. \u00a7 1983 Right to Informational Privacy Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\"\n   <em>\n    West v.

Plaintiffs here allege that the Fourteenth Amendment recognizes a right to informational privacy. And, plaintiffs allege, the KSOS has deprived them of that right by failing to adopt adequate security procedures for the Crosscheck program-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by sharing plaintiffs' Crosscheck profiles with other states without proper security measures. In sum, plaintiffs claim that defendant Kobach has allowed-and defendant Schwab continues to allow-public disclosure of plaintiffs' private data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Before addressing this argument, the court returns to the distinction between plaintiffs' Complaint-which brought official and individual capacity claims against defendant Kobach- and the current procedural status now that defendant Kobach no longer serves as Kansas Secretary of State. Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d) provides that an \"action does not abate when a public officer who is a party in an official capacity...ceases to hold office while the action is pending. Instead, \"[t]he officer's successor is automatically substituted as a party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519515\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/973/1518/#p1523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lamb v.

Kan. 2017). Scott Schwab replaced defendant Kobach\n   as Kansas Secretary of State in January 2019. Consistent with Rule 25(d), the court substitutes Mr. Schwab as the correct defendant on plaintiffs' official capacity claim, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief for ongoing violations of their constitutional right to informational privacy. The court thus turns to defendant Schwab's official capacity arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant Schwab's motion to dismiss the official capacity claim relies on two arguments. First, he contends, qualified immunity bars plaintiffs' claim from proceeding. Second, defendant Schwab contends that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy; and so, without a constitutional right, defendant cannot be liable under \u00a7 1983. The court addresses each argument, in turn, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Qualified Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As Section V.B explains, significant uncertainty exists about the substance of the law governing plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leiser v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518512\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1137/#p1141\">\n    903 F.3d 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1141 (10th Cir. 2018) (\"[T]he Supreme Court has made clear that the existence of such a right [to informational privacy] is an open question and it has not abandoned a third precedent which suggests that any right to informational privacy is limited.\"). It would seem, therefore, that qualified immunity would apply. But, qualified immunity can't apply because plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claim does not seek to recover damages from defendant Schwab. Doc. 14 at 13. \"Under the\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   doctrine, the Eleventh Amendment generally does not bar a suit against a state official in federal court which seeks only prospective equitable relief for violations of federal law, even if the state is immune. Thus, because plaintiffs in this case name state officers as defendants and seek only prospective injunctive relief, it seems to fit squarely within the traditional application of\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857766\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/1280/#p1286\">\n    186 F.3d 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1286 (10th Cir. 1999) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Here, plaintiffs have named a state officer as the only defendant on the official capacity claim and only seek prospective injunctive relief on that claim. The court thus concludes qualified immunity does not apply to the kind of \u00a7 1983 claim asserted in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Existence of a Constitutional Right to Privacy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The motion to dismiss also asks the court to dismiss the Complaint because it fails to state a claim. This argument relies on a single premise: The Constitution never establishes a right to informational privacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 12 at 3-4; Doc. 15 at 2-4. Defendant Schwab's Memorandum relies primarily on just two cases to support this argument:\n   <em>\n    NASA v. Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n    562 U.S. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n    178 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), and\n   <em>\n    Leiser v.

Doc. 12 at 4; Doc. 15 at 2-4. This approach is far too narrow. And this argument misreads at least one of the two cited cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Below, in Section V.B.1, the court outlines the Supreme Court's intermittent analysis of this controlling legal issue. This part of the discussion includes the KSOS's lead case-\n   <em>\n    NASA\n   </em>\n   . Finding no controlling answer in any Supreme Court case, the court turns to decisions from our Circuit in Part V.B.2. This part of the analysis addresses the second case relied on by defendant-\n   <em>\n    Leiser\n   </em>\n   . For reasons it explains, Part V.B.2 concludes that our Circuit has recognized the right posited by the Complaint-\"a right not to have one's private affairs made public by the government.\" Finally, in Section V.B.3, the court briefly evaluates the Complaint's allegations in light of the Circuit authority. Section V.B.3's analysis is abbreviated because defendant\n   Schwab's Memorandum never argues that the Complaint's allegations are deficient. He just argues that the right doesn't exist. In sum, the court denies defendant Schwab's motion because its basic premise is wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

This Act was designed to address concerns that wrongdoers were diverting drugs properly prescribed for therapeutic purposes to persons who abused these drugs. A state commission found no existing means to prevent the use of stolen or revised prescriptions, or to prevent doctors from over-prescribing such drugs. The New York legislature responded with the 1972 Act.

Though NASA owned the JPL, the California Institute of Technology (\"Cal Tech\") operated it under a government contract. So, employees who worked at JPL were Cal Tech employees, including the case's 28 plaintiffs. They objected to a new federal mandate requiring them to complete the same governmental background investigation as NASA employees. Specifically, this background check required Cal Tech employees to respond to a questionnaire asking if they had used, supplied, or possessed illegal drugs during the last year. And, if so, the questionnaire required them to provide details and disclose any treatment or counseling for recent drug use.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n    at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It held that parts of both questionnaires likely were unconstitutional and should be enjoined. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that many of the inquiries were not problematic, but the questions about illegal drugs required closer scrutiny. Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit held, the questions about employees' recent involvement with drugs furthered a legitimate governmental interest. But it also held that other questions-ones requiring disclosure of drug treatment or counseling-furthered no legitimate interest and thus likely were unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    NASA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n    562 U.S. at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the Tenth Circuit, courts employ a two-prong test. First, the information must be entitled to a legitimate expectation of confidentiality. \"Information falls within the ambit of constitutional protection when an individual has a 'legitimate expectation...that it will remain confidential while in the state's possession.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sheets v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sheets\n   </em>\n   , our Circuit explained that the \"legitimacy of this expectation\n   depends 'at least in part, upon the intimate or otherwise personal nature of the material which the state possesses.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573792\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/836/#p839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mangels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573792\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/836/#p839\">\n    789 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   839 ).

But, plaintiffs cite persuasive law from other jurisdictions in support of such a theory, at least with respect to full Social Security numbers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Greidinger v.

And so, the court finds it plausible that plaintiffs have pleaded facts sufficient to establish a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in their Crosscheck data. Plaintiffs allege that defendant exposed a spreadsheet identifying the name, address, date of birth, and partial Social Security number for 945 voters. Based on these cases, the court predicts that the Tenth Circuit would find-as a matter of law-that the Crosscheck files in this case are \"highly personal and intimate\" and trigger an expectation of privacy. The court recognizes the issue isn't one-sided. It is possible that the Circuit could reach the opposite conclusion. But though the boundaries of the right remain in flux, plaintiffs have the better of the argument for now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leiser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518512\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1137/#p1141\">\n    903 F.3d at 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   To state a valid\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   claim, plaintiffs also must plead facts alleging an ongoing violation of their informational right to privacy. Plaintiffs carry their burden. Plaintiffs allege that the KSOS deliberately has disclosed their personal data to the FDE as part of the Crosscheck program, which was then publicly disclosed. And, plaintiffs allege, defendant Schwab continues to send plaintiffs' Crosscheck data to states where this information can be disclosed to the public through open records request, in part, because of defendant Schwab's failure to take adequate security precautions. The court thus finds that plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim for prospective injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The court now turns to the second requirement of the analysis: Did disclosing plaintiffs' Crosscheck data advance a compelling state interest, and, if so, was it accomplished in the least intrusive manner? Defendant never addressed this question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheets\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415879\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/1383/#p1387\">\n    45 F.3d at 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting\n   that defendants provided no reason why disclosure was warranted when detective shared plaintiff's wife's diary with third party author, who ultimately published diary excerpts in book). In short, the briefing made to support the motion fails to provide the kind of cogent analysis that a motion to dismiss requires. Given the absence of meaningful argument or analysis, the court presumes that the disclosures did not serve a compelling state interest, and was not done in the least intrusive manner. The court thus holds that plaintiffs have pleaded facts sufficient to state an informational privacy claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Kansas State Law Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Count Two of the Complaint alleges that defendant Kobach is liable in his individual capacity for violations of a Kansas state statute.

Plaintiffs cite Florida's indirect disclosure of one such match list to support their claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, plaintiffs contend, by sharing these match lists with participating states, these documents become records available for public inspection and copying. In response, defendant Kobach argues, first, that plaintiffs fail to state a claim because the full match lists-such as the one sent from Kansas to Florida in 2013-is not a \"document available for public inspection or copying\" under \u00a7 75-3520(a)(1). But, the court predicts the Kansas Supreme Court would conclude that full match lists qualify as a \"document available for public inspection or copying\" under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   To reach this conclusion, the court finds-in the absence of Kansas case law-the reasoning of the Kansas Attorney General analogous and persuasive. The Attorney General opined that if the KSOS's Office shared the last four digits of a registered voter's Social Security number with the federal government-specifically, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity-it would violate Kansas election law under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2025-2309\">\n    Kan.

And, the slight variation that the KSOS allegedly shared this information with state governments, instead of the federal government, does not produce a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Second, defendant Kobach argues that \u00a7 75-3520(a)(2)(6) exempts KSOS filings from the requirements of \u00a7 75-3520(a)(1). Plaintiffs respond, arguing that, when read with the preamble, this exemption only applies to documents filed in the official records of a recorder of deeds or a court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-3520\">\n    Kan.

The court predicts the Kansas Supreme Court would agree with plaintiffs' argument.

Defendant Kobach does not argue that the full match lists of Crosscheck data are official documents of a Recorder of Deeds or a court. The court thus concludes that the Crosscheck data is not exempt, and this conclusion means plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-3520\">\n    Kan.
