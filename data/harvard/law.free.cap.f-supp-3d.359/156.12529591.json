Administrative R. (\"Admin. R.\") 334, ECF No. 19. Bowden seeks relief pursuant to section 1132(a)(1)(B) of chapter 29 of the United States Code, which provides that \"[a] civil action may be brought ... to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 5, 9, ECF No. 1.

Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") 1, ECF No. 48. Aetna offers two ripostes. Aetna asserts that (i) Bowden has not met his burden to prove that he is totally unable to fulfill his occupational duties due to his subjective dizziness and (ii) Bowden shifted the burden to Aetna to obtain information to support his claim.

For instance, Dr. Romanowsky acknowledges that Bowden could \"drive a car,\" \"constantly lift up a hundred pounds or more, and \"walk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 742. Moreover, notwithstanding Bowden's dizziness, Dr. Romanowsky asserted that Bowden could \"perform repetitive motion,\" \"stoop,\" and \"stand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These descriptions of Bowden's day-to-day activities do not show any severe limitations. Moreover, Dr. Romanowsky does not explain how he is able to infer Bowden's total disability given the information he provided in the CLW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The conclusion that Bowden's disability is not just total but also long-term\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   is also inconsistent with Dr. Romanowsky's earlier finding that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \"may help mitigate the symptoms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 924-25. If medication eventually could ameliorate his symptoms, Dr. Romanowsky could not conclude that these symptoms are permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, the record does not show that Dr. Romanowsky, as Bowden's primary care physician, treated Bowden with a frequency and intensity that would be justified were Bowden's symptoms as severe as Bowden characterizes them. Dr. Romanowsky's CLW is from June 2014, and, at that time, Bowden had not even scheduled another appointment with him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 739, 742.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Likewise, Bowden put forward Dr. Viereck's findings to show his limited functionality. Pl.'s Mem. 16. Bowden, however, quoted Dr. Viereck's report out of the context of its overall findings. Admin. R. 500-04. Far from finding that Bowden is totally disabled, Dr. Viereck determined that Bowden had normal motor strength and sensory abilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 504. He did not prescribe any medications for Bowden but suggested that Bowden's current treatment with Fluoxetine was \"reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 503-04. Even if Dr. Viereck's finding about Bowden's inability to maintain a tandem stance with his eyes closed were read out of context, Dr. Viereck never opined on how his finding affects Bowden's fulfillment of his job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Dr. Viereck's finding needs to be compared to other treating physicians' findings on Bowden's purported impairment. From December 2014 until April 2015, Dr. Saro treated Bowden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 541, 590. In March 2015, Dr. Saro found \"in general, the patient considers himself to be in good health\" and reported that Bowden \"state[d] that he performs moderate exercise on a regular basis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 590.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Thus, Drs.

If the Court ordered Bowden to pay Aetna's costs, other similarly situated claimants - some of whom may have stronger claims than Bowden -- might not try to seek review of their claims if they face a much higher financial risk than claimants with physical disabilities which are easier to prove.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colby II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192762\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/818/365/#p384\">\n    818 F.Supp.2d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[P]olicyholders benefit from plan administrators' equal treatment of claims arising from physical and mental disabilities.\").
