Yemer contends the denial was improper because USCIS erroneously concluded that Yemer was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. USCIS responds that its conclusion was correct and that Yemer's application fails for the additional reason that Yemer cannot establish that she has good moral character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue now are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The parties, by counsel, have fully briefed and argued the motions, and they are now ripe for disposition. For the reasons set forth herein, USCIS's motion must be granted and Yemer's motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate only where there are no genuine disputes of material fact, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Accordingly, the record facts as to which no genuine dispute exists must first be identified. The following undisputed facts are derived from the parties' respective factual narratives and their responses thereto:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Yemer is a native and citizen of Ethiopia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Yemer gave birth to a daughter, E.Y.B., in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1999. Yemer was not married to E.Y.B.'s father. As is customary in Ethiopia when a child is born to unwed parents, Yemer's mother cared for E.Y.B. Yemer, Yemer's mother, and E.Y.B. lived together in Addis Ababa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 In late 2008, Yemer submitted an electronic entry for the Diversity Immigration Visa Program (\"DV program\"). Yemer did not include E.Y.B. on her Electronic Diversity Entry Form (\"eDV Form\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Yemer was selected by lottery for further processing in the DV program, and she completed a DS-230 Visa Application, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration, (\"Form DS-230\") in June 2009. In response to the question instructing Yemer to \"List Names, Dates and Places of Birth, and Addresses of ALL Children,\" Yemer wrote \"NA.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 In connection with the process of submitting Form DS-230, Yemer was placed under oath and interviewed by a consular official in Ethiopia on November 4, 2009. During the interview, Yemer stated that she did not have any children. She also swore that \"all statements which appear in [her DS-230] ... are true and complete to the best of [her] knowledge and belief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 The Department of State granted Yemer a diversity immigrant visa, and Yemer was admitted into the United States as a lawful permanent resident on November 28, 2009.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 On May 13, 2015, Yemer, seeking to become a United States citizen, filed a Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, with USCIS. Form N-400 instructed Yemer to list all children, and Yemer listed E.Y.B. Additionally, Yemer responded \"no\" to the following two questions: (i) \"Have you\n   <strong>\n    ever\n   </strong>\n   given any U.S. Government official(s)\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   information or documentation\n   that was false, fraudulent, or misleading?\" and (ii) \"Have you\n   <strong>\n    ever\n   </strong>\n   lied to any U.S. Government official to gain entry or admission into the United States or to gain immigration benefits while in the United States?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 In connection with her application for naturalization, Yemer was interviewed under oath\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on September 1, 2015. The USCIS official asked Yemer whether she (i) had ever given a United States government official information or documentation that was false, fraudulent, or misleading or (ii) had ever lied to any U.S. government official to gain entry or admission into the United States or to gain immigration benefits while in the United States. Yemer orally answered \"no\" to both questions. Yemer also confirmed that she knew that E.Y.B. was her daughter when she filled out Form DS-230 in 2009 and that she has always known her daughter. Finally, Yemer, under oath, confirmed that the contents of her Form N-400 were \"true and correct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 USCIS sent Yemer a letter on March 7, 2016 denying her naturalization application because she was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. USCIS reaffirmed its decision to deny Yemer's naturalization application on February 9, 2018 following a hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Yemer subsequently brought this action seeking\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of her naturalization application. In her motion for summary judgment, Yemer requests remand to USCIS with instructions to grant her naturalization application. USCIS opposes this relief and, in its cross-motion for summary judgment, seeks a finding that Yemer is not eligible for naturalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The summary judgment standard is too well settled to require extensive elaboration. In essence, summary judgment is appropriate under Rule 56, Fed. R. Civ. P., only where \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" A genuine factual\n   dispute exists \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Importantly, however, the non-movant may not rely on \"mere allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551659\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/209/#p213\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).

She denied she had ever given any U.S. government official any information or documentation that was false, fraudulent, or misleading, whereas the undisputed summary judgment record reveals that Yemer told a consular official during her immigration interview in November 2009 that she did not have any children. This was clearly false. Yemer also responded \"NA\" on her Form DS-230 when instructed to \"List ... ALL Children.\" Further, Yemer swore during her immigration interview that all statements in her DS-230 were true and complete. These responses were also false because Yemer in fact had a child, E.Y.B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, when Yemer denied ever giving a U.S. government official information or documentation that was false, fraudulent, or misleading, the undisputed summary judgment record reflects that Yemer had indeed given such information or documentation. Yemer's statement to the contrary was thus false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bijan v.

At the time of her naturalization interview, Yemer knew she had previously given false, fraudulent, or misleading information to a U.S. government official,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and yet Yemer denied that she had done so. There can be no doubt that one who falsely denies during a naturalization interview that she has previously given false or misleading information to a government official does so for the purpose of obtaining naturalization benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bijan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518270\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/942/#p946\">\n    900 F.3d at 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The undisputed facts show that [the naturalization applicant] was aware of the misrepresentation on his visa application\n   <em>\n    and thus\n   </em>\n   that he intended to obtain an immigration benefit-naturalization-by denying that he had made it.\") (emphasis added). Indeed, Yemer has not established that her purpose in falsely denying she had ever given false, fraudulent, or misleading information to a government official was anything other than obtaining naturalization benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berenyi v.

Yemer argues she lacked the requisite purpose because she was unaware that she needed to disclose that E.Y.B. was her child during her visa application interview. But it is Yemer's knowledge at the time of her naturalization interview, and not Yemer's knowledge at the time of her visa application interview, that is dispositive here. Whether Yemer was aware of her obligation to disclose E.Y.B. as her child, and thus Yemer's knowledge that she gave false information to a government official, at the time of her visa application interview is immaterial. What is material-and dispositive-is that Yemer gave false information when she denied having children during her visa application interview, that Yemer was well aware that she had given false information during this interview by the time of her naturalization interview,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Yemer nonetheless denied having ever given false, fraudulent, or misleading information to a government official.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, it is undisputed that Yemer gave this false testimony within the five-year statutory window. Indeed, the testimony was given in connection with Yemer's naturalization application. As such, the undisputed factual record establishes that Yemer has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining naturalization benefits, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(6) thus precludes a finding that Yemer was a person of good moral character for the five years preceding the filing of her petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Yemer attempts to avoid this conclusion by advancing several arguments, each of which is discussed and rejected below. Yemer first argues that her moral character is beyond the scope of this proceeding\n   because USCIS did not identify Yemer's lack of good moral character as a basis for its denial of her naturalization application. In this respect, Yemer relies on the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    De Lara Bellajaro v. Schiltgen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9216121\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/1042/#p1043\">\n    378 F.3d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1043-44 (9th Cir. 2004), which held that review of the denial of a naturalization application was \"limited to the ground for the denial.\"\n   <em>\n    De Lara Bellajaro\n   </em>\n   is inapposite here; that decision was based on the interaction between \u00a7 1421(c) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201429\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an interaction that is not relevant here inasmuch as the relevant provision of \u00a7 1429 does not operate in this case. Section 1429 provides, in relevant part, that \"no application for naturalization shall be considered by the Attorney General if there is pending against the applicant a removal proceeding pursuant to a warrant of arrest.\" The Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    De Lara Bellajaro\n   </em>\n   held that when both \u00a7 1421(c) and \u00a7 1429 are triggered-namely, when a naturalization applicant seeks review of a decision denying her application on the ground that removal proceedings are pending, which is not the case here-review pursuant to \u00a7 1421(c) is limited to the threshold issue of whether removal proceedings are pending against the applicant.\n   <em>\n    De Lara Bellajaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9216121\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/1042/#p1043\">\n    378 F.3d at 1046-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nor did the Ninth Circuit hold that \u00a7 1421(c) review is limited in scope in the absence of pending removal proceedings. Accordingly, Yemer's argument that\n   <em>\n    De Lara Bellajaro\n   </em>\n   limits judicial review of the denial of a naturalization application to the bases on which USCIS denied the application when there is not a pending removal proceeding extends the decision beyond its scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Furthermore, the INA provides that \"the court ... shall, at the request of the petitioner, conduct a hearing\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   on the application.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201421\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The statute thus explicitly provides for\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the naturalization application, not merely review of the USCIS's decision denying the application. Indeed, several circuits have explicitly stated that the scope of review under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201421\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) is not limited to the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kariuki v.

It is true, as Yemer points out, that \u00a7 1421(c) authorizes \"[a] person whose application for naturalization ... is denied, ... [to] seek review of such denial .... Such review shall be\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201421\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Yemer argues that because \"such review\" refers to the denial, that review is limited to the bases on which USCIS denied the application. However, the statute's final directive-that \"the court ... shall, at the request of the petitioner, conduct a hearing\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   on the application\"-is clear and must be given its full effect, namely that the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing is\n   <em>\n    on the application\n   </em>\n   , and not merely the USCIS's denial of application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201421\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consistent with this view, the Fifth Circuit has explained that the first reference to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   \"simply explains that the deferential 'arbitrary and capricious' standard often applicable to administrative reviews does not apply in this context.\"\n   <em>\n    Kariuki v.

The INA defines \"child,\" as relevant here, as \"an unmarried person under twenty-one years of age who is a child born out of wedlock, by, through whom, or on whose behalf a status, privilege, or benefit is sought by virtue of the relationship of the child to its natural mother.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(D). According to Yemer, because E.Y.B. was born out of wedlock and no status, privilege, or benefit was sought by, through, or on behalf of E.Y.B. by virtue of E.Y.B.'s relationship to Yemer when Yemer filled out the visa application forms, E.Y.B. was not a \"child\" under the INA. As such, Yemer argues, Yemer's \"NA\" response to Form DS-230's instruction that she list \"ALL children\" was not false, nor was her oral statement to the consular official that she did not have children. This argument fails because the INA's definition of \"child\" does not apply to Form DS-230 or to the consular official's and Yemer's oral references to \"children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The INA's definition of \"child\" does not apply to Form DS-230's reference to \"children,\" as evidenced by the INA's text, Form DS-230's context, and the anomalous result Yemer's interpretation would produce. First, the INA stipulates that the definition of \"child\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   applies \"[a]s [the term is] used in subchapters I and II\" of the INA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The definition does not purport to apply to references to \"children\" in immigration forms, nor does Yemer argue that Form DS-230 references the INA's definition. Such a reference would be expected if the INA's definition of \"child\" were intended to apply to Form DS-230 because of the length and complexity of the INA's definition. Indeed, the INA's definition of \"child\" contains seven subsections-some with multiple subparts-and spans\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)-(G). Given the length and complexity of this provision, it would be strange indeed for \"children\" in Form DS-230 to refer only to these seven precise categories of \"child\" in the INA despite no mention of these categories on Form DS-230. Second, the context in which \"children\" appears in Form DS-230 confirms that the ordinary meaning of \"children,\" and not the INA's definition, applies to that form. Specifically, Form DS-230 instructs applicants to \"List Names, Dates and Places of Birth, and Addresses of ALL Children.\" The emphasis on \"ALL\" indicates that \"children\" is to be interpreted broadly. This emphasis makes little sense if \"children\" is interpreted under the limiting definition in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(D).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Yemer's\n   approach would allow applicants to choose whether to include biological children born out of wedlock on their immigration forms, an anomalous result. Indeed, such an approach could allow aliens to circumvent the statutory cap on diversity visas, further confirming that the INA's definition of \"child\" was not intended to apply Form DS-230. This is because derivative diversity visas issued to the spouses and children of diversity visa lottery winners count toward the total number of diversity visas awarded each year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201151\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (authorizing the award of 55,000 diversity visas each year);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (entitling the spouse and children of a diversity visa lottery winner to the same right of admission as the lottery winner).

Red question marks appear next to both of these questions on Yemer's Form N-400.

It makes little sense to conclude the eDV Form-which specifically requires disclosure of children who do not seek immigration benefits-was meant to exclude children born out of wedlock who do not seek immigration benefits, particularly in the absence of any reference to the to the child's legitimacy in the form or regulations. It thus cannot be concluded that the INA's definition of \"child\" was intended to apply to immigration forms.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
