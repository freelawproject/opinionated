Both defendants have moved to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The alleged facts are taken as true for the purposes of the motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs are twenty-one soybean farmers from eight states: Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Tennessee. Each plaintiff alleges that its soybean crop was damaged by the herbicide dicamba when neighboring farmers planted genetically modified dicamba-resistant seeds and sprayed that crop with dicamba. Plaintiffs challenge Monsanto's commercialization of its dicamba-resistant cotton seeds in 2015 and soybean seeds in 2016 (collectively, \"Xtend seeds\"). The United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") deregulated (or permitted for sale) the dicamba-resistant seeds in January 2015. However, plaintiffs contend that their commercialization was premature and improper because the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") had not yet approved a dicamba herbicide for use over the top of crops grown from those seeds. Plaintiffs add that the dicamba-resistant seeds were also tolerant to application of other herbicides, like Monsanto's glyphosate-based Roundup-branded herbicides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Bader Farms, a peach-growing plaintiff in this MDL (which has not joined the Master Complaint), filed one of the first complaints of its kind in 2016, alleging that neighboring farms planted Xtend seeds and then sprayed dicamba over the top of that crop. Bader alleged that the dicamba then drifted to the Bader peach orchard, damaging many trees and seriously diminishing the year's peach crop. Bader filed its lawsuit, eventually added BASF as a defendant, and this Court denied both defendants' motion to dismiss and Monsanto's motion for partial summary judgment. As stated, Bader grows peaches, not soybeans, and Bader is not part of the Master Complaint in this MDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Only one plaintiff in the Master Complaint brings claims related to 2016, the year Monsanto sold Xtend seed but did not sell the corresponding herbicide. That plaintiff, Jerry Franks of Missouri, represents himself and a class of \"Missouri 2016\" plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The other plaintiffs allege that in 2017 they grew non-dicamba-tolerant soybeans that were damaged by dicamba herbicide used on fields that were planted with dicamba-tolerant Xtend seeds. In 2017, however, the EPA approved Monsanto and BASF's new low-volatility dicamba herbicides (respectively named XtendiMax and Engenia). Earlier versions of dicamba had been on the market since the 1960s (though none manufactured by Monsanto), but it was not approved for in-crop use due\n   to its volatility and propensity to drift (sometimes taking other herbicides with it), meaning it could cause damage to other, off-target growing plants. XtendiMax and Engenia were developed to address original dicamba's volatility problem so that they could be used over-the-top of crops, during the growing season, without harming nearby, non-tolerant crops.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The 2017 plaintiffs (that is, all plaintiffs other than Franks), challenge the design and sale of Monsanto and BASF's dicamba herbicide products. Plaintiffs contend, despite defendants' representations to the contrary, that both are unsuitable for in-crop use because they too, like the earlier versions of dicamba, are volatile and prone to move off-target and damage nearby, sensitive crops. The claim, then, is that the defendants, in their pursuit of increased profits, pushed the Xtend seeds and XtendiMax and Engenia herbicides forward and misrepresented the system as safe, knowing that non-dicamba-resistant crops and plants would be damaged. In fact, plaintiffs contend that such damage was to defendants' benefit, as it would cause farmers to defensively purchase dicamba-resistant seed to avoid damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Each plaintiff, on behalf of itself and a state-wide class, brings claims under its own state's laws, and they also seek to represent a nationwide class pursuing claims under the Lanham Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint so as to eliminate those actions \"which are fatally flawed in their legal premises and deigned to fail, thereby sparing litigants the burden of unnecessary pretrial and trial activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Young v.

BASF makes only 11. With only a couple of exceptions, the defendants' arguments are largely overlapping and complementary, and each is discussed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Failure to plead Monsanto product caused plaintiffs' injuries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Monsanto's first point is a challenge to all plaintiffs' products liability-related counts. Monsanto contends that, to establish causation, plaintiffs must identify the manufacturer responsible for placing the injury-causing product into the stream of commerce. That is, Monsanto suggests plaintiffs must demonstrate that it was\n   Monsanto's product-XtendiMax-that landed on plaintiffs' fields. To be sure, a \"threshold requirement for a products liability action is that the plaintiff identify the manufacturer or supplier responsible for placing the injury-causing product into the stream of commerce; this is the traditional requirement that plaintiff establish causation.\" 63 Am. Jur. 2d\n   <em>\n    Products Liability\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 75 (2016). Monsanto contends that this is a fatal problem for both the 2017 and 2016 plaintiffs: the 2017 plaintiffs do not plead that Monsanto's new dicamba moved off-target and caused damage to their crops, and Franks, the 2016 plaintiff, did not plead that old dicamba herbicide had been applied to Monsanto's Xtend seeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   These are merely variations of defendants' earlier causation challenges. This Court has already ruled on the causation issue as it relates to the several products liability claims in the Bader Farms case, and the result is the same here. \"The fact that Monsanto did not manufacture, distribute, or sell the old dicamba herbicide that actually caused the [2016] damage is irrelevant-it is not part of the causal link under plaintiffs' theory of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Dicamba Herbicides Litig.\n   </em>\n   , 1:16-CV-299-SNLJ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202117633\">\n    2018 WL 2117633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D. Mo. May 8, 2018) (the \"May 8 order\"). As this Court explained, causation could be established if it is proved that Monsanto marketed and sold its dicamba-resistant seed to third-party farmers knowing that they would spray dicamba that may harm nearby, non-resistant crops.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202117633\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For 2016 damage, this Court has already held that causation has been pleaded. Although Monsanto suggests that plaintiff Franks's similar 2016 claims lack an allegation that a non-Monsanto dicamba herbicide had been applied to Monsanto's Xtend seeds, the complaint does exactly that. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , # 137 \u00b6 944.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Monsanto also argues that the May 8 order does not apply to the 2017 claims because the 2016 claims are based on the launch of dicamba-resistant seed without a corresponding low-volatile herbicide. Monsanto explains that to plead but-for causation for the 2017 claims, plaintiffs were required to allege that it was the new XtendiMax that allegedly moved off-target and damaged crops.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The key to both the 2016 and 2017 claims, however, is not the herbicide-it's the Xtend seed. The only reason to purchase and plant Xtend seeds is, according the plaintiffs, to use it with either the new or the old dicamba herbicides. For the 2016 claims, as with Bader's claims, plaintiffs plead their damages were caused by foreseeable misuse of dicamba with the Xtend seed. For the 2017 claims, causation is supplied by either the third-party farmers' legitimate use of new dicamba herbicide that did not work as promised, or their foreseeable misuse of old dicamba herbicide. As with the 2016 allegations, which entity manufactured the dicamba herbicide is not part of the causal link under plaintiff's theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202117633\">\n    2018 WL 2117633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Whether XtendiMax, Engenia, or some other dicamba was used on the crops (or even other over-the-top herbicides), the allegations are that Monsanto and BASF were in a partnership, joint venture, joint enterprise, or otherwise agreed to share technologies in bringing the Xtend seed and \"new dicamba\" to market. Thus, under that theory, both defendants could be liable for injuries caused by third party farmers' use of the seed, regardless of which entity manufactured the dicamba herbicide itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Lanham Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs' Count 1-a nationwide class action-claims that Monsanto made misrepresentations in violation of the Lanham\n   Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). These were statements, plaintiffs explain, that were false or misleading in convincing third-party farmers to purchase and use dicamba-resistant seed and dicamba herbicide, causing injury to their neighbors' non-resistant soybeans. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants stated that the Xtend Crop System could be safely employed utilizing over-the-top application of dicamba herbicides and that the dicamba would not drift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Zone of interest\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To state a claim under the Lanham Act, plaintiff must plead: (1) an injury within the \"zone-of-interest,\" that is, \"to a commercial interest in sales or business reputation,\" (2) that was \"proximately caused by the defendant's misrepresentations.\"\n   <em>\n    Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/118/#p134\">\n    572 U.S. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134, 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Monsanto first argues that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their claim under the Lanham Act because there is no alleged injury within the \"zone of interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In that regard, Monsanto maintains that plaintiffs must be competitors of the defendant to state a claim, citing\n   <em>\n    POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20102\">\n    573 U.S. 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581234\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2228/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581234\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2228/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\"the cause of action is for competitors, not consumers\"), and indeed, in that case the parties were competitors. But the Act contemplates other relationships as well. For example,\n   <em>\n    Lexmark\n   </em>\n   , on which Monsanto also relies, was a case between a printer toner cartridge supplier and the manufacturer of components necessary for remanufacture.\n   <em>\n    Lexmark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/118/#p134\">\n    572 U.S. at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The component manufacturer claimed that the toner manufacturer violated the Lanham Act when it made statements asserting that the component manufacturer's business was illegal. The Supreme Court explicitly stated that \"although diversion of sales to a direct competitor may be the paradigmatic direct injury from false advertising, it is not the only type of injury cognizable under \u00a7 1125(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Lexmark\n   </em>\n   held that a plaintiff must \"allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales proximately caused by the defendant's misrepresentations.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/118/#p134\">\n    572 U.S. at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Kan. 2015), is instructive. In that case, the plaintiffs were farmers who did not purchase the defendant's genetically modified (\"GM\") seed, but they claimed they were damaged commercially because other farmers did grow corn from the GM seeds, and the GM corn was mixed with plaintiff farmers' corn before sale. Plaintiffs claimed defendant had misled the other farmers that China-the primary purchaser of the corn-had approved the GM seed. In fact, however, China had not approved the seed and refused to buy corn from the \"contaminated corn supply,\" thus harming plaintiffs commercially.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153980\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/1177/#p1222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court therefore denied the defendant's standing-based motion to dismiss the Lanham Act claims. Like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Syngenta\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs here are commercial actors, not consumers, and as such their allegations fall within the \"zone of interest\" required for standing under the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Lack of standing for 2016 claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Monsanto next argues that plaintiff Franks lacks standing for his separate 2016 Lanham Act claims for the additional\n   reason that his claim is based on intervening unlawful conduct. Monsanto recognizes that this Court has previously held that intervening criminal conduct did not necessarily cut off the chain of causation under Missouri state law. But Monsanto maintains that such conduct does break the causal nexus under federal standing requirements. The Supreme Court has held that Article III standing exists if an injury in fact is \"fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party who is not before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

In rejecting a similar proximate cause argument, the\n   <em>\n    Syngenta\n   </em>\n   court noted, \"the Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Lexmark\n   </em>\n   that there may be an intervening step of consumer deception, as a plaintiff can be directly injured by a misrepresentation even in a case in which a third party, and not the plaintiff, relied on it.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153980\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/1177/#p1222\">\n    131 F.Supp.3d at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Syngenta\n   </em>\n   , of course, the third party farmers who planted the GM seeds also suffered losses when China would not buy the GM corn. Monsanto argues that in this case, in contrast, the direct \"victims\"-those who bought the Xtend seed-are not alleged to have lost any sales at all. But this Court does not understand why that should matter. Plaintiffs have undoubtedly alleged commercial injury because Monsanto's misrepresentations caused third parties to use dicamba that destroyed plaintiffs' crop, so there were no soybeans to sell. In other words, it is a commercial interest in sales because plaintiff lost all its sales. Plaintiffs have properly pleaded proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Arkansas Plaintiffs' Counts 2-13\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Arkansas plaintiffs bring the following claims on behalf of themselves and an Arkansas class of plaintiffs: Strict Liability (Ultrahazardous); General Negligence; Strict Liability (Design Defect); Strict Liability (Failure to Warn); Negligent Design; Negligent Failure to Warn; Negligent Training; Breach of Implied Warranty (Fitness); Breach of Implied Warranty (Merchantability); Breach of Express Warranty; Trespass; and Civil Conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Monsanto's XtendiMax herbicide was not for sale anywhere in 2016. In 2017, it was available in most areas-but it was not for sale in Arkansas. BASF's dicamba-based herbicide, Engenia, was the only dicamba herbicide registered for in-crop use in Arkansas in 2017. Monsanto argues the Arkansas claims thus fail to meet the requirement of alleging that a product manufactured by Monsanto caused plaintiffs' alleged crop damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As discussed above, however, the allegations are that Monsanto and BASF were in a partnership, joint venture, joint enterprise or otherwise agreed to share technologies in bringing the \"new dicamba\" to market with dicamba and resistant seeds. Thus, under that theory, both defendants could be liable for injuries caused to third parties by the use of the seed system. Defendant Monsanto cannot hide behind the Arkansas XtendiMax ban when it intended for its seed to be used with XtendiMax or, allegedly, its BASF equivalent. Monsanto relies on pharmaceutical cases holding that a plaintiff cannot sue the name-brand drug manufacturer when the plaintiff consumed only the generic drug.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

Apr. 13, 2018) (the \"April 13 Order\") that \"each company sells its own products-separately\". Monsanto takes that statement out of context-this Court was not discussing joint venture liability related to 2017 damages. The language Monsanto cites pertains to 2015 and 2016 damages and the absence of a relevant BASF product at that time. This Court ultimately held that BASF could be liable under a conspiracy theory for counts that did not involve negligence, even in years when BASF did not have a relevant product on the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. That Monsanto may not have manufactured the herbicide used in Arkansas with Xtend seeds in 2017 does not defeat plaintiffs' theory of causation; as stated in Section I,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the key to this case is the seed, not the herbicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Next, Monsanto argues that the Arkansas plaintiffs have not shown Monsanto owed them a duty of care. \"As a general rule, a manufacturer has a duty to warn the ultimate user of the risks of its product.\"\n   <em>\n    Pfizer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569585\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1087/#p1092\">\n    716 F.3d at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is not the situation presented here, in which it is alleged that Monsanto's Xtend seed was being used by third parties with their intended herbicides and caused damage to third parties (the plaintiffs). In addition, Arkansas law does impose a duty to provide products that are not unreasonably dangerous and to give adequate warning and instruction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-116-101\">\n    Ark.

Ultrahazardous Activity Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Each group of plaintiffs bringing 2017 claims brings state-law strict liability claims for \"ultrahazardous activity.\" (Counts 2, 14, 25, 37, 50, 60, 71, and 84.) As in the other counts, they allege that Xtend Crop System has a high risk of serious harm to growers of non-dicamba-resistant plants and crops like soybeans. Despite this risk, plaintiffs allege, Monsanto and BASF together designed and promoted the system to accelerate and increase the system's use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The parties appear to agree that the jurisdictions at issue here (except Nebraska) have adopted the approach set out in the Restatement (Second) of Torts for determining whether activity may be considered ultrahazardous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Restatement sets forth the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   1.

Again, no case has so held. Perhaps it is enough to say that it would be presumptuous for this Court to impose such an extension on these several states' laws. In any event, plaintiffs' theory is untenable. Their theory, which they admit is unique, is that the defendants' dicamba products are so hazardous that they cannot be used safely \"over the top\" under any circumstances and that the fraudulent (or at least misleading) marketing of the dicamba products makes its use irresistible to the consumer. Their claim seems to be that it is\n   an ultrahazardous activity to mislead others to engage in an ultrahazardous activity. This is essentially a repackaging of what is more properly pleaded-and what plaintiffs have indeed pleaded in the Lanham Act and other counts-as a claim for misrepresentation. And it is simply too much a stretch from the conventional notion of an ultrahazardous activity, which involves only the actual use of the product in question, without regard to any misconduct by defendants. After all, the rationale behind the doctrine is that an activity may carry a risk that \"is so unusual, either because of its magnitude or because of the circumstances surrounding it, as to justify the imposition of strict liability for the harm that results from it, even though it is carried on with all reasonable care... and despite any usefulness it may have for the community....\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 520, cmt. f. In contrast, plaintiffs' theory is dependent on defendants' misrepresentation to third-party farmers that they may safely use dicamba, when in fact, or so they allege, it is not an activity that can be carried out with reasonable care. Ultimately, plaintiffs' claim is that \"lying\" about the safety of an ultrahazardous activity-the spraying of dicamba-is itself an ultrahazardous activity. That claim is certainly actionable, but not under the ultrahazardous activity doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For those reasons, the plaintiffs' Strict Liability - Ultrahazardous Activity counts will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

This appears to be a tacit recognition of the truism that parties cannot conspire or intend to commit negligence under subsection (a). In contrast, aiding-abetting liability under subsection (b) does not depend on an agreement to commit an underlying tort, whether intentional or negligent. Notably, cases relied upon by plaintiff, in which the courts approve of a conspiracy to commit negligence, do not address this dichotomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In this case, plaintiffs allege a scheme to market, sell, and expand sales and profits from the Xtend Crop system, and they describe the defendants' intertwined activities at length. However, plaintiffs are not entirely clear which tort claims may serve as the underlying tortious conduct to the conspiracy count, much less do they identify which prong of the Restatement they are proceeding under. It appears that they have alleged intentional tortious conduct on the parts of both defendants to sustain a conspiracy claim for, at least, false advertising and fraudulent misrepresentation under the Lanham Act. As for counts going to negligence, it unclear whether plaintiffs are grounding their claims under the Restatement's subsection (a), the conventional conspiracy theory, or under subsection (b), the aiding-abetting theory. If brought under subsection (b), it is irrelevant, as noted, whether the underlying tortious act is intentional or negligent. On the other hand, if the negligence claims are brought under subsection (a), this Court would be faced with the difficult task of reconciling the claims with the truism that parties cannot conspire to commit negligence.\n   <em>\n    Halberstam,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858707,3642414\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/472/\">\n    705 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   478 ;\n   <em>\n    Ridenhour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477363\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/248/919/#p937\">\n    248 Kan. at 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477363\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/248/919/#p937\">\n    811 P.2d 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, this Court need not decide the propriety of the underlying negligence claims until plaintiffs have clarified whether those claims are grounded in subsections (a) or (b), and the parties have fully briefed these additional issues. And if indeed plaintiffs make clear that the underlying negligence claims are being brought under subsection (b), the conundrum posed under subsection (a) need not be addressed.

First, they argue their failure to warn claims are, at least in part, based on matters other than labeling, so they are not preempted. Plaintiffs allege that Monsanto misrepresented the safety of the crop system, concealed and failed to warn of risks, in a variety of ways, including in-person discussion, websites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Pinterest, and Linked In. None of these other matters, plaintiffs argue, involves a label, which is defined as \"the written, printed, or graphic matter on, or attached to, the pesticide or device or any of its containers or wrappers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20136\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(1). At least one federal Court of Appeals has held that FIFRA does not preempt state law claims going to something other than the label, such as a marketing brochure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indian Brand Farms, Inc. v. Novartis Crop Prot. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771429\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/617/207/#p221\">\n    617 F.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (3d Cir. 2010). There, the plaintiff's claims related to the marketing brochure were for negligent misrepresentation and fraud. In addressing the marketing brochure, the Third Circuit stated\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   [The brochure] cannot be read as providing a supplement to the [pesticide] label. Its function is to point out the advantages of the new product to wholesalers and retailers, as well as farmers. Importantly, it contains no instructions for the use of [pesticide]. If we were to construe the term \"labeling\" as including the [pesticide] brochure, then all sales and marketing materials would necessarily be included within the scope of that term. We are confident that such was not the intent of Congress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771429\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/617/207/#p221\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771429\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/617/207/#p221\">\n    at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Monsanto relies on two cases in support of its position that any failure to warn claim is ultimately based on the labeling. In the first case, the Eleventh Circuit held \"any claims that point-of-sale signs, consumer notices, or other informational materials failed adequately to warn the plaintiff necessarily challenge the adequacy of the warnings provided on the product's labeling or packaging.\"\n   <em>\n    Papas v. Upjohn Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514127\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/985/516/#p519\">\n    985 F.2d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (11th Cir. 1993). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Kansas, relying on\n   <em>\n    Papas\n   </em>\n   , held that a \"claim that\n   communication by means other than labeling was inadequate necessarily challenges the label and is preempted.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v. Amchem Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"740724\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/256/602/\">\n    256 Kan. 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"740724\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/256/602/\">\n    886 P.2d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 882 (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    Indian Brand Farms\n   </em>\n   , though, a more recent case, is more persuasive because it is based on a more literal reading of the statute, limiting its reach to labeling and packaging. And in fact, Monsanto makes no attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Indian Brand Farms.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, this Court is unsure just why failure to warn claims involving matters other than labeling \"necessarily\" challenge the label. Accordingly, this Court agrees that plaintiffs' claims for non-label-related marketing efforts are not preempted, even to the extent that those claims are based in part on failure to warn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Second, plaintiffs insist, with respect to failure-to-warn claims they do make regarding labels, that they do not seek to impose requirements that are \"in addition to or different from\" FIFRA. Rather, they maintain that the state laws upon which their claims rely are consistent with FIFRA. Like FIFRA, laws of each relevant state require adequate warning. As explained above, FIFRA requires that a label comply with FIFRA's prohibition on \"misbranding,\" which occurs if a label contains a \"false or misleading\" statement or if it \"does not contain adequate instructions for use, or if its label omits necessary warnings or cautionary statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p438\">\n    544 U.S. at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p438\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, as noted, \"although FIFRA does not provide a federal remedy to those injured as a result of a manufacturer's violation of FIFRA's labeling requirements, nothing in \u00a7 136v(b) precludes States from providing such a remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p438\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p438\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that respect,\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   instructs that \"To survive preemption, the state-law requirement need not be phrased in the\n   <em>\n    identical\n   </em>\n   language as its corresponding FIFRA requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p438\">\n    at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p438\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the allegation Monsanto cites appears in plaintiffs' Missouri 2017 Negligent Training count (Count 56), the Court agrees that such an allegation-by omitting the word \"unreasonable\"-appears to set forth a more stringent rule than FIFRA.

Design Defect\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Plaintiffs bring strict-liability and negligent design defect claims against both defendants in Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri (both 2016 and 2017), Nebraska, South Dakota, and Tennessee. As part of their strict liability - design defect claim, plaintiffs allege that defendants \"designed, manufactured, distributed, marketed, promoted, and sold the dicamba-resistant trait and seed containing [the dicamba-resistant seed] trait for the express and intended purpose of in-crop use of dicamba herbicide as an integrated crop system.\" Further, they allege the \"Xtend Crop System was and is unsafe for the anticipated, foreseeable use by Xtend Crop System users of spraying dicamba herbicide over the top of crops grown from seed containing the dicamba-resistant trait in summer months and foreseeable in the vicinity of susceptible non-dicamba resistant plants and crops including soybeans.\" Monsanto-but not BASF-has moved to dismiss both the strict liability and negligent design defect claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Monsanto argues that the design defects claim fail as a matter of law because dicamba-resistance is an intended feature of the product. As a result, Monsanto says, plaintiffs are challenging the product, not its design. In support, Monsanto cites cases in which plaintiffs complain not\n   about a design, but about the product itself-e.g., in an Illinois handgun case, the \"plaintiffs complain[ed] not of the product's particular design, but of the product itself,\" which was a small, concealable handgun.\n   <em>\n    Riordan v.

Ct. App. 1985). The Court disagrees that plaintiffs' claim challenges the fact of the dicamba-resistant trait. Rather, they allege the crop system was ill-designed in that the use of dicamba over-the-top of the seed necessarily resulted in harm to other, non-resistant crops.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Monsanto's motion on this point will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    XII.

That section goes on to state that \"Any person who has been damaged by a violation of this section shall have a cause of action under section 537.353.\" \u00a7 569.132.4. Then, \u00a7 537.353 states that \"any person or entity who knowingly damages or destroys any field crop product that is grown for personal or commercial purposes...shall be liable for double damages pursuant to this section.\" \u00a7 537.353.1 RSMo. Negligent damage to field crops also entitles the victim to compensatory damages under the Act. \u00a7 537.353.2. RSMo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Monsanto, but not BASF, moves to dismiss these counts. Monsanto argues plaintiffs have not alleged that Monsanto knowingly damaged or destroyed any of the Missouri plaintiffs' crops, as required by \u00a7 537.353.1. Plaintiffs clearly allege, however, that Monsanto and BASF \"did cause loss of and damage to field crops...knowingly and intentionally for the purpose of escalating purchases of dicamba-resistant seed and herbicide for their own financial gain.\" Plaintiffs also allege that, \"[a]t minimum, Monsanto and BASF negligently damaged field crops\" and are thus liable for compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Monsanto's motion is denied on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    XIII. Duty and Proximate Cause for Missouri 2016 Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Finally, BASF argues that the Court must dismiss plaintiff Franks's Missouri 2016 claims because it already held, in\n   <em>\n    Bader Farms\n   </em>\n   , that negligence and strict liability claims premised on 2016 damages cannot proceed because BASF did not sell the seed that was released without its corresponding herbicide.\n   <em>\n    Bader Farms, Inc. v.
