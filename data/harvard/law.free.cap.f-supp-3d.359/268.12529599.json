Richard Caputo, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   When an oil and gas company suspects valuable fossil fuels rest below swaths of land, it leases mineral rights from the people who own that land on the surface. These leases typically allow the company to build wells to capture oil and gas, in exchange for a portion of the profit (a \"royalty\") payable to the landowners. The Plaintiffs in this case-the landowners-allege that the Defendant oil and gas companies skirted the terms in their leases governing royalties and well-building. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30). The Defendant companies, Chesapeake Appalachia and Equinor USA Onshore Properties, responded with Motions to Dismiss (Docs. 34 and 35 respectively), which are presently before me. Defendants contend that they have complied with the unambiguous terms of the leases. But because crucial portions of the leases are unclear, and because Plaintiffs have adequately pled their claims, Defendants' Motions to Dismiss will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are all landowners in Tunkhannock and neighboring Mehoopany, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 12-21). In October of 2007, Plaintiffs entered into oil and gas leases with Magnum Land Services, a \"landman\" that leases mineral rights from landowners on behalf of oil and gas companies. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22). Magnum accordingly assigned its interests in the leases to Defendants, Chesapeake and Equinor, making them the lessees. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   There are two clauses of the leases which form the basis of Plaintiffs' complaint: the \"unitization\" clauses and the royalty clauses. As a brief aside, a unitization clause permits a lessee to group a lessor's land with neighboring lessors' lands into a single oil and gas production unit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stewart v. SWEPI, LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305099\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/333/#p337\">\n    918 F.Supp.2d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337-38 (M.D. Pa. 2013). The purpose of unitization is to more efficiently\n   capture underground oil and gas resources, which, by their nature, are not neatly divided between landowners on the surface.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704676\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/177/190/#p209\">\n    177 U.S. 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704676\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/177/190/#p209\">\n    20 S.Ct. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704676\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/177/190/#p209\">\n    44 L.Ed. 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1900). Even in the absence of an agreement between a landowner and a prospector, states can mandate unitization for \"securing a just distribution\" of resources and \"preventing waste.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704676\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/177/190/#p209\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704676\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/177/190/#p209\">\n    at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704676\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/177/190/#p209\">\n    20 S.Ct. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Back to this case. The unitization clauses at issue provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Lessor hereby grants to the Lessee the right at any time to consolidate the leased premises or any part thereof or strata therein with other lands to form a oil, gas, and/or coalbed methane gas development unit of not more than 640 acres, or such larger unit as may be required by state law or regulation for the purpose of drilling a well thereon and Lessee shall be required to maintain a well density of at least 1 well per 160 acres contained in such unit. (Doc. 30-1, Exhibits A-1 through A-3, \u00a7 8 (hereinafter \"Leases\") ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Some of Plaintiffs' lands have been consolidated into the \"Wootten North Unit,\" a production unit of about 300 acres. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 38). But the Wootten North Unit only has one well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38). Plaintiffs allege this violates the unitization clauses because, under their understanding, the well density of any unit must be \"at least 1 well per 160 acres.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 39). Furthermore, because the current well-to-acre ratio violates the unitization clauses, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have correspondingly breached the clauses governing the leases' length (the \"habendum\" clauses). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The dispute over the royalty clauses is more complex. The royalty clauses require that the lessee\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   pay to the Lessor as royalty for the oil, gas, and/or coalbed methane gas marketed and used off the premises and produced from each well drilled thereon, the sum of one-eighth (1/8) of the price paid to Lessee per thousand cubic feet of such oil, gas, and/or coalbed methane gas so marketed and used. Payment of royalty for oil, gas, and/or coalbed methane gas marketed during any calendar month to be on or about the 60th day after receipt of such funds by the Lessee. (Leases \u00a7 4(B) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   All the leases included additional language which was crossed out by the original contracting parties. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 53-54). The crossed-out language provided that the one-eighth (1/8) royalty would be \"less or net any post-production costs paid by the Lessee to prepare for and/or deliver the oil, gas, and/or coalbed methane gas for sale[.]\" (Leases \u00a7 4(B) ). Before the leases were executed, John Przepiora, Magnum's representative, explained to Plaintiffs \"that crossing out the language ... would guarantee that any lessee would be prohibited from deducting post-production costs from their royalty payments.\" (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 56-57). Despite this, Chesapeake \"has routinely levied such deductions against Plaintiffs' royalty payments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Equinor was craftier in reducing its royalty burden, according to Plaintiffs. \"Instead of paying royalties based on the actual 'price paid to Lessee' for 'gas marketed and used off the premises,' as the Leases require, Equinor has paid, and continues to pay, royalties based on artificially low, artificially set book prices for transfers between Equinor and its marketing arm, [ENG].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61 (quoting the leases) ). Equinor avoids paying Plaintiffs the royalties they are allegedly entitled to via a three-step process: (1) Equinor sells the gas captured from Plaintiffs' properties to\n   its fellow subsidiary, ENG, at an artificially low price, one-eighth (1/8) of which Plaintiffs receive as royalties; (2) ENG in turn \"markets and sells the gas to end users at significantly higher prices;\" and then (3) Equinor ASA (Equinor and ENG's parent company) pockets the difference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-68). Plaintiffs allege they are instead entitled to one-eighth (1/8) of \"the ultimate sales price received for the gas downstream,\" not the \"artificial price that Equinor applies to transfers of gas to [ENG] at the wellhead [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , when the gas leaves the ground but before it is processed for sale.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67). Additionally, Plaintiffs allege Equinor has \"improperly and unilaterally manipulated the depressed 'reference price' \" it charges ENG to further lower Plaintiffs' royalties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-88, 139). These practices, Plaintiffs claim, violate both the express terms of the leases and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Besides damages, Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the unitization clauses, or in the alternative, a judgment terminating the leases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146). Chesapeake moves to dismiss only Counts I through III of the complaint, which allege violations of the leases' unitization and habendum clauses, leaving the dispute over their royalty calculations for another day. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 34, 39). Equinor, on the other hand, moves to dismiss all claims brought against it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 35, 38). The Motions to Dismiss have been fully briefed and are now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides for the dismissal of a complaint, in whole or in part, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

The clauses provide the lessee may form a \"development unit of not more than 640 acres, or such larger unit as may be required by state law or regulation for the purpose of drilling a well thereon and Lessee shall be required to maintain a well density of at least 1 well per 160 acres contained in such unit.\" (Leases \u00a7 8). The clauses thereafter refer to \"said development unit\" and \"said unit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants insist that the requirement \"to maintain a well density of at least 1 well per 160 acres contained in\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   unit\" unambiguously applies only to \"\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   larger unit as may be required by state law or regulation,\" not a unit it creates of \"not more than 640 acres.\" (Doc. 39 at 9-12 (emphasis added) ). The parallel use of the word \"such,\" Defendants argue, unambiguously shows that the well density requirement only applies to units larger than 640 acres. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). So does the placement of a comma and the word \"or,\" which separate the \"not more than 640 acres\" provision from the rest of the clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). Plaintiffs respond that the well density requirement unambiguously applies to all units, not just those larger than 640 acres. (Doc. 42 at 17). They point to the fact that 640 acres is neatly divisible by 160 acres, \"demonstrating an intent on the part of the original contracting parties\" to make the well density requirement applicable to all units; Plaintiffs also argue the unitization clauses use the word \"unit\" to refer both to a \"unit of not more than 640 acres\" and to \"such larger unit as may be required by state law or regulation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   What is clear is that the well density provisions are patently ambiguous as to whether they apply to all development units. Starting with Plaintiffs' proffered interpretation, the fact that 160 divides into 640 neatly is a sign that the well density requirement may apply to units of not more than 640 acres. And \"such unit\" may refer to both smaller and larger units: the omission of the modifier \"larger\" could indicate \"such unit\" is used in a broad sense rather than a narrow one, encompassing all development units.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Northway Village No. 3, Inc. v.

If the well density requirement applied only to larger units, the drafter might have used the phrase \"such larger unit\" in parallel. Indeed, the clauses following the well density provisions use the phrases \"said development unit\" and \"said unit\" to refer to both kinds of units. That, in combination with the rest of the language used, tends to show the contracts create a genus (units or development units) and species thereof (larger units required by state law or regulation, and smaller units of not more than 640 acres). In this context, the general term \"unit\" would include both species of units.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins.

D. &amp; C. 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231 (Allegheny Cty. Ct. 1932). Finally, only Plaintiffs' interpretation avoids the result that a 640-acre unit could have only one well, but a\n   641-acre unit would need to have at least four-this may be an absurd result, considering the purpose of unitization is efficiency and waste-reduction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bohler-Uddeholm Am., Inc. v.

The parallel use of \"such\" may indicate the qualifying phrase \"as may be required by state law or regulation\" modifies both \"such larger unit\" and the later phrase \"such unit,\" even though the qualifying phrase is sandwiched between the two. Courts have held that parallel or related phrasing can surmount the rule of the last antecedent-a rule that provides \"a limiting clause or phrase ... should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows,\"\n   <em>\n    Barnhart v.

Additionally, the unitization clauses use the phrases \"said development unit\" and \"said unit\" to refer to all units; the slightly different phrases \"such larger unit\" and \"such unit\" may thus refer to only one kind of unit. Defendants finally rely on the comma and \"or\" that separate the two types of units. Punctuation, on its own, is not of interpretive aid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richter v. Com.

But the fact that a comma and \"or\" split the unitization clauses in half supports Defendants' interpretation, given the more deliberate use of commas elsewhere in the unitization clauses and the lack of a comma offsetting the well density requirement.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BL Partners Grp., L.P. v.

Plaintiffs and Defendants have proffered reasonable but conflicting interpretations of the unitization clauses. Thus, Plaintiffs' claims for breach of the unitization and habendum clauses survive, but only if it is clear or at least ambiguous that the well density requirement would require the Wootten North Unit to have at least two wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The well density requirement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The next dispute is accordingly over the meaning of the well density requirement. Again, the parties are at odds. Plaintiffs insist that \"at least 1 well per 160 acres\" means a 300-acre unit cannot have just one well, because that creates a ratio of one well to 300 acres. (Doc. 42 at 15-16). Defendants respond that \"\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   160 acres\" means \"\n   <em>\n    for each\n   </em>\n   160-acre\n   <em>\n    group\n   </em>\n   ,\" which in turn means a 300-acre unit has one 160-acre group to which the density requirement applies and one 140-acre group to which it does not. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 39 at 12-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I agree with Plaintiffs. The text of the unitization clauses is clear: there must be\n   a well density of \"at least 1 well per 160 acres.\" Because it is impossible to maintain a fraction of a well, a unit of more than 160 acres but less than or exactly 320 acres must therefore have at least two wells. Defendants' proffered interpretation contradicts the plain language used. There is no mention of the 160-acre \"groups\" within units that Defendants read into the clauses. Nor do the clauses suggest Defendants cannot breach the density requirement by only maintaining one well unless the unit contains at least 320 acres (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , two 160-acre groups). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 39 at 13 n.5). That would result in a ratio of one well per 160 acres\n   <em>\n    at most\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   , which is not what the original contracting parties agreed to.\n   <em>\n    Hutchison v.

For example, by Defendants' logic, the royalty clauses' requirement that Defendants pay Plaintiffs \"one-eighth (1/8) of the price paid to Lessee per thousand cubic feet\" of gas, (Leases \u00a7 4(B) ), would mean Defendants need only pay royalties if a thousand-cubic-foot \"group\" of gas is sold. That is an absurd and unreasonable interpretation, because it would permit Defendants to sell slightly less than thousand-cubic-foot groups of gas and avoid paying royalties entirely. Defendants cannot create a latent ambiguity without contradicting the plain meaning of the text, let alone establish their preferred absurd and unreasonable interpretation as unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bohler-Uddeholm Am., Inc. v.

A brief procedural digression is necessary here.

Comparing the clauses at issue to those featured in other cases, it is clear that they are \"proceeds\" clauses because of the phrase \"price paid to Lessee.\" A proceeds clause sets the lessor's royalty as a percentage of the proceeds received by the lessee from the sale of oil or gas.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tana Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v.

Pennsylvania recognizes this duty, which requires a lessee operating under a proceeds lease \"to market the gas found 'but only at a reasonable profit[,]' taking into consideration 'the distance to market, the expense of marketing, and everything of that kind.' \"\n   <em>\n    Canfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201078184\">\n    2017 WL 1078184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *22 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Iams v.

But, the royalty clauses state that royalties are to be paid on gas \"\n   <em>\n    marketed\n   </em>\n   and used off the premises.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4(B) (emphasis added) ). Plaintiffs argue they have proffered a reasonable interpretation of that phrase which incorporates the implied duty to market as an express obligation. Plaintiffs use the word \"marketed\" as their textual hook in a bid to establish a latent, if not patent, ambiguity. Their interpretation boils down to this: the gas that the lessee sells is supposed to be \"marketed\" by the lessee rather than an affiliate, and the word \"marketed\" means brought \"downstream\" in marketable form to the \"point of sale.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 42 at 24-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' interpretation is reasonable. Section 6 of the leases, for example, provides for a \"shut in\" royalty \"[i]n the event a well drilled hereunder is a producing well and the Lessee is unable to market the production therefrom[.]\" (Leases \u00a7 6). That provision presumes the lessee-defined in the leases as a single party, Magnum Land Services-is marketing the gas produced from the lessor's land. And \"marketing\" must mean something more than simply \"selling\" gas, because Section 6 distinguishes between the two. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (employing the phrase \"marketed and sold off the premises\") );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riverside Sch. Dist. v. Career Tech.

To Plaintiffs' credit, the original leases-without the post-production cost deduction provisions crossed out-calculated royalties by what is called the \"net-back method.\"\n   <em>\n    Kilmer v.

To \"market\" under Plaintiffs' leases may well mean to incur post-production costs to prepare gas for sale, based on the fact that the original parties crossed out the language \"less or net any post production costs paid by the Lessee to prepare for and/or deliver the [gas] for sale[,]\" but retained the marketing language. This understanding of \"marketed\" would impose on Equinor a duty to reduce gas to marketable form and sell it at a price higher than it would command \"at the wellhead\"-or, a duty to market. Supporting that understanding is the fact that the leases appear to equate \"marketed and used off the premises\" (Leases \u00a7 4(B) ) with \"marketed and\n   <em>\n    sold\n   </em>\n   off the premises (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6 (emphasis added) ), and gas transferred at the wellhead to an affiliate is not sold \"off the premises.\" Finally, Plaintiffs' interpretation avoids the absurd and unreasonable result that Equinor could sell gas to ENG for a nominal fee and still comply with the leases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.W. McDonald Land Co. v. EQT Prod.

Va. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Equinor maintains that the leases are unambiguous: there is no duty to market. As noted before, the leases purport to disclaim all implied covenants and obligations. Interpreting the royalty clauses to include an express duty to market arguably circumvents that disclaimer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hutchison v.

And the language requiring royalties to be paid on gas \"marketed and used off the premises\" does not necessarily require that gas be so marketed and used-Section 14 of the leases allows Equinor to use gas on the premises for operations, for instance (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Leases \u00a7 14).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gates v.

All this, in Equinor's view, corroborates its point that \"marketed and used off the premises\" merely describes the class of gas that is subject to royalty payments, but does not prescribe the manner in which payments are calculated or create any duties. (Doc. 38 at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   That could be the case, but I am not convinced at this early stage that the royalty clauses are unambiguous in the way Equinor suggests. I am mindful that oil and gas leases are laden with terms of art and that my \"linguistic field of expertise\" may not overlap with the parties'.\n   <em>\n    Mellon Bank, N.A. v.

Accordingly, for now, it is enough to say that Plaintiffs have proffered a reasonable interpretation of the royalty clauses, and that Equinor has not established that the clauses are unambiguous. That entitles Plaintiffs to pursue their breach of contract claims and permits both sides to muster evidence in support of their interpretations through discovery. Furthermore, because Plaintiffs have stated their breach of contract claims using the express terms of the leases, I need not address their implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
