Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The SAC identifies statements that are fraudulent due to material omissions.

Plaintiffs then basically repeat the same set of omitted facts for each statement, without explaining why the omission rendered the statement misleading or why Defendants had a duty to disclose the omitted fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For example, Plaintiffs identify several statements that failed to disclose certain information on the Barracuda-Caratinga project. There does not appear to be any relation between these statements and the omitted facts. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 219 (comparison to Enron), \u00b6 221 (asbestos litigation), \u00b6 224 (investment grade rating), \u00b6 225 (investment grade rating), \u00b6 239 (liquidity), \u00b6 240 (investment grade rating and asbestos litigation), \u00b6 256 (asbestos litigation)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 243 (\"Barracuda/Caratinga Mega Project was 77 days behind schedule\") ). To the extent Plaintiffs suggest\n   that an omission is so significant that any statement not disclosing the omission is misleading, the Court rejects the argument as inconsistent with the particularity requirement of the PSLRA.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Odyssey Healthcare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2806729\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/424/880/#p893\">\n    424 F.Supp.2d at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"This view would require a defendant to choose between an affirmative duty to disclose everything if anything is said and a vow of silence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Overall, there simply is too attenuated a relationship between the allegedly misleading statements and the omissions, and the SAC makes no attempt to bridge this analytical gap. The SAC simply asserts that the statements were misleading and asserts what the omitted information was, without drawing any kind of connection between the two. Given the deficiencies, the Court is also unable to determine whether scienter as to the omissions is properly alleged.

Allegations Regarding Asbestos Liability and Reserves\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for alleged misrepresentations regarding Halliburton's asbestos reserves. Halliburton's 2001 10-K and the First Quarter 2002 10-Q disclosed the figures for its asbestos reserves. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 254, 292). The financial statements cautioned that accrued reserves were based on estimates of Halliburton's liability for known, open asbestos claims and that Halliburton had \"not accrued reserves for unknown claims that may be asserted against [it] in the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The statements further noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   We estimate settlement payments for open claims by applying our average historical settlement costs by type of claim to the corresponding open claims.

Plaintiffs further allege that \"Halliburton's reserve for its accrued asbestos liabilities had not been objectively measured or determined or subjected to any expert review or consultation and, thus, represented nothing more than a self-interested management's claim, which managements [sic] knew was grossly inadequate.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2806729\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/424/880/#p893\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 257g, 268h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   There are no allegations in the SAC of what the allegedly misstated reserves should have been.\n   <em>\n    In re Capstead Mortg.

As discussed, the 10-K and the 10-Q cautioned that accrued reserves were based on estimates of Halliburton's liability for known, open asbestos claims. Halliburton hired Dr. Rabinowitz to estimate liability for asbestos claims that may be filed in the future, and his results were disclosed in a July 24, 2002, press release and Halliburton's Second Quarter 2002 10-Q, filed on August 13, 2002.

Plaintiffs also fail to allege that the statements were made with the requisite scienter. In fact, the 10-K disclosed that the potential insurance recovery was an estimated amount based on certain assumptions and even noted that if estimates differed from actual recoveries, Halliburton \"may have uncollectible receivables that [it] may be required to write-off.\" (SAC \u00b6 254c;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 292 (\"In those instances in which [insurance] agreements are still in negotiation or in litigation, our estimate is based on our expectation of our ultimate recovery from insurance companies.\") ).

Allegations Regarding the Harbison-Walker's Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for alleged misrepresentations regarding the bankruptcy of Harbison-Walker, a supplier of refractories products and services. Harbison-Walker was formerly a subsidiary of Dresser Industries, but had spun-off in 1992 and had agreed to indemnify Dresser against all costs associated with asbestos claims filed after the spin-off. (SAC \u00b6 248). Dresser merged with Halliburton in 1998. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 271). On February 14, 2002, Harbison-Walker filed for bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In a January 4, 2002, press release, Halliburton announced that \"there is no basis to the spurious rumor that it [i.e. Halliburton] has filed for bankruptcy or that such a filing is contemplated.\" (SAC \u00b6 246). Plaintiffs allege that the statement is misleading because \"Defendants had commenced, contemplated, or discussed with Harbison-Walker and its parent, having Harbison-Walker seek bankruptcy organization.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 238). Plaintiffs fail to explain how the press release, which discusses rumors regarding Halliburton's supposed bankruptcy, is even relevant to the Harbison-Walker bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9100335\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/238/#p245\">\n    340 F.3d at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs next identify Halliburton's February 14, 2002, and February 22, 2002, press releases disclosing the Harbison-Walker bankruptcy and the stay of asbestos-related claims against Dresser that Harbison-Walker had assumed since the spin-off. (SAC \u00b6 248-49). Plaintiffs allege that the statements were misleading by omission because \"[b]ankruptcy courts do not in Chapter 11 extend a stay to a nonbankrupt company without some assurance, express or implied, that company is going to provide a benefit\" and Halliburton did in fact give assurances that it would ultimately fund the trust that would resolve the claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 250). Notwithstanding the defects in alleging omissions as\n   discussed above, this argument is undercut by the press releases disclosing that Dresser/Halliburton would cooperate with Harbison-Walker's parent in creating the bankruptcy plan and provide various kinds of financing related to the bankruptcy and the trust creation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 267 (First Quarter 2002 10-Q disclosing that \"Dresser Industries Inc. may make a contribution to a trust in order to achieve a confirmed plan\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs point to Halliburton's June 4, 2002, and July 16, 2002, press releases announcing further extensions to the stay of asbestos-related claims due to the bankruptcy. The SAC highlights the failure to disclose information\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding a global settlement for all claims against Dresser and Halliburton. (SAC \u00b6 277). These allegations suffer from the same defects in alleging omissions discussed above, such as explaining how the failure to disclose the details of negotiations about a settlement for all Halliburton asbestos claims makes misleading a statement about a stay of claims assumed by Harbison-Walker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs do not adequately allege loss causation. Plaintiffs identify the June 4, 2002, and July 16, 2002, press releases as \"partial\" corrective disclosures, but do not allege how announcing further extensions to the stay of asbestos-related claims arising from the bankruptcy \"reveals a previously concealed truth.\"\n   <em>\n    Magruder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20854656\">\n    2009 WL 854656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11.

Allegations Regarding the Barracuda-Caratinga Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for alleged misrepresentations regarding financial losses from the Barracuda-Caratinga project. On July 6, 2000, Halliburton received a $ 2.5 billion, fixed-price contract to develop oil wells in the Barracuda and Caratinga offshore fields in Brazil. (SAC \u00b6 49). Plaintiffs allege that Lesar and other officers were aware of cost overruns on the project and failed to promptly disclose these losses until July 22, 2002, where a press release announced a $ 119 million loss on the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 317). Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Lesar should have disclosed, at various points during the class period, that the project was behind schedule, subject to liquidated penalty damages, had cost overruns that could not be recouped, and was expecting significant losses. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 226, 242, 243, 257, 258, 268, 269).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also allege that the\n   2001 10-K and the First Quarter 2002 10-Q were false because over $ 40 million in the Barracuda-Caratinga project was recorded as \"probable recoveries\" of unapproved claims in the project when in fact recovery was unlikely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 258e, 269e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Even if the SAC contained the proper allegations required for omission, Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead facts raising a strong inference of scienter, whether for the omissions or the representations. Plaintiffs repeatedly make mere conclusory allegations that Lesar was \"well aware\" of the \"mounting millions of dollars in losses\" in the Barracuda-Caratinga project without supporting allegations of when and what exactly he knew. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 94;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114 (\"[Lesar] knew the cost overruns at every step, knew the cost overruns were losses and knew the anticipated losses.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116 (\"[T]he accounting for the Barracuda/Caratinga Mega Project was affirmatively false or misleading based on facts known to the CEO Lesar.\") ). Plaintiffs seemingly allege that Halliburton entered into the Barracuda-Caratinga contract knowing that it would cost significantly more than the contract amount and that there would be no possibility of recovering those losses. The more reasonable and compelling inference to be drawn is that Halliburton entered into an agreement that turned out to be a loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs further note that the 10-K and the 10-Q were misleading because, at the time of their release, Lesar knew, but failed to disclose, that the Barracuda-Caratinga project was 77 to 260 days behind schedule, with $ 77 to $ 260 million due in liquidated penalty damages, and had over $ 40 million in cost overruns that could not be reimbursed. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 258d-e, 269d-e). A later disclosure revealed that the liquidated penalty damages were not asserted by the customer and that change orders by the customer and claims for schedule extension were expected to cover any exposure based on the liquidated damages. (ECF No. 68 at App. 100 (Second Quarter 2002 10-Q, filed August 13, 2002) ). Not only does this undermine an inference of scienter, Plaintiffs fail to explain why damages not asserted by the customer should have been preemptively disclosed as a loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that $ 40 million recorded in financial statements as probable recoveries of unapproved claims on the Barracuda-Caratinga project should have been recorded as losses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, Plaintiffs note how the customer of the project had refused to pay unapproved claims in a previous, unrelated contract from 1998. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6 226f). Plaintiffs fail to explain whether and how the claims from this previous project were similar to the unapproved claims in the Barracuda-Caratinga project; the mere fact that a customer refused to pay a claim on one occasion does not plausibly suggest that collection in another instance would be improbable. To the extent Plaintiffs allege accounting fraud, Plaintiffs fail to plead \"who in particular was instructing the employees to make the arbitrary accounting adjustments, what particular adjustments were made, how those adjustments were improper in terms of reasonable accounting practices, how those adjustments were incorporated into [the defendants'] financial\n   statements, and if incorporated, whether those adjustments were material in light of [the defendants'] overall financial position.\"\n   <em>\n    Shushany v.
