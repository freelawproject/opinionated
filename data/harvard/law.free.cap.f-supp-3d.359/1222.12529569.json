You will send your Notice to the address on the first page of this Agreement to the attention of the ViaSat Legal Department and we will send our Notice to your billing address.

Plaintiff further alleges that the impersonal and generic nature of the Text Message demonstrates that Defendants used an automatic telephone dialing system (\"ATDS\"), to which he never consented, in violation of the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On September 26, 2018, Plaintiff filed his Response in Opposition to the Motion to Compel Arbitration (hereafter, \"Arbitration Response\") arguing that his claims are outside the scope of the Arbitration Provision [D.E. 25].

On October 12, 2018, DIRECTV filed its Reply in Support of its Motion to Dismiss (hereafter, \"Dismissal Reply\") [D.E. 32].

Notwithstanding the Eleventh Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Gamble\n   </em>\n   , ViaSat argues that Plaintiff's TCPA claim is subject to arbitration because it meets this definition of a \"Claim.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Reply [D.E. 27 at 5]. Specifically, ViaSat contends that the Privacy Policy, which was incorporated into the Agreement, expressly covers, among other things, ViaSat's collection of customer information, including phone numbers, and the use of such information to market its services or to engage third parties to help it market its services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Privacy Policy [D.E. 27-1 at 7]. Consequently, ViaSat argues that because the issue of whether Plaintiff consented to the Text Message requires an examination of the Agreement and the incorporated Privacy Policy, Plaintiff's TCPA claim relates to the Agreement and is thus a \"Claim\" covered by the Arbitration Provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Reply [D.E. 27 at 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   However, ViaSat's argument fails because the portion of the Privacy Policy on which it relies conflicts with the Contact Provision, which stated that ViaSat could use Plaintiff's information to contact him \"for: (a) any account-related issues by calling\n   or texting [him] at such number(s) using a prerecorded/artificial voice or text message delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system and/or using a call made by live individuals, and/or (b) for any account-related issues\n   <strong>\n    or for marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to such e-mail address.\"\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreement [D.E. 15-1 at 6] (emphasis added).
