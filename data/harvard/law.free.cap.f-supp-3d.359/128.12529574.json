This Court need only make a cameo appearance in this episode, however, because it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Flinn's cause. Therefore, the Court remands the case to Massachusetts Superior Court for it to unspool in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court briefly summarizes Flinn's allegations relating to subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Flinn's wife, Joyce Flinn, passed away, his sister-in-law, Joan Oliveira (\"Oliveira\"), convinced him that his wife had left all her assets to Oliveira in a will. Compl. Jury Demand (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 15, ECF No. 1-1. Flinn now asserts that his wife passed away intestate, Compl. \u00b6 12, and that Oliveira stole from Flinn's estate assets due to pass to him, Compl. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Flinn alleges that Oliveira squirreled away more than $ 800,000 of Flinn's funds in Santander Bank, N.A. (\"Santander Bank\") accounts. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. According to Flinn, she set up a fiduciary account in Flinn's name, using a forged power of attorney for Flinn. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21, 24. Flinn further asserts that Santander Bank and its holding company, Santander Holdings USA, Inc. (\"Santander Holdings\" and, collectively with Santander Bank, \"Santander\") stood by while Oliveira pillaged the account for her personal expenses. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-41. Flinn alleges that Oliveira frittered away all the account's cash on herself, her husband, and her mother -- and that she never once paid Flinn from the account. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Flinn discovered Oliveira's alleged fraud and filed a state court suit against her in May 2015. Compl. And Jury Demand,\n   <em>\n    Flinn\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Oliveira\n   </em>\n   , Civ. A. No. 15-3581 (Mass. Super. Ct. May 26, 2015), Dkt. No. 1. Oliveira eventually filed for bankruptcy, leading Flinn to \"recover[ ] only a fraction of the funds stolen.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. Flinn subsequently initiated this suit in Middlesex Superior Court against Santander on June 25, 2018. Compl. 1. In this action, Flinn alleges that Santander is liable to him for negligence, breach of contract, various\n   violations of Massachusetts law governing bank deposits, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A (\"Chapter 93A\"). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-149.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although Flinn's complaint alleges that both Santander entities maintain principal places of business in Boston, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6, Santander removed the case to this Court in July 2018.

Consequently, Santander did not misfire when it forsook reliance on\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   generating jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But it did misfire for two reasons when it compared Flinn's complaint to that of the\n   <em>\n    Lawless\n   </em>\n   plaintiff. First, the cases' facts clash, so\n   <em>\n    Lawless\n   </em>\n   does not directly control. There, the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Lawless\n   </em>\n   determined that the Labor Management Relations Act provided the sole recourse for a plaintiff seeking unpaid wages under a collective bargaining agreement,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517540\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/9/#p17\">\n    894 F.3d at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , whereas Flinn does not invoke any such labor issues here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, and more generally, Santander fails to provide an argument -- and the Court can see none itself -- for why federal banking law completely preempts these Chapter 93A claims.

It is not deemed a citizen of every State in which it conducts business or is otherwise amenable to personal jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     Reading \u00a7 1348 in this context, one would sensibly \"locate\" a national bank for the very same purpose\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , qualification for diversity jurisdiction, in the State designated in its articles of association as its main office.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 318,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5919625\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/303/#p306\">\n     126 S.Ct. 941\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added) (internal citations and quotations omitted).

The House Report on the amendments adding \"principal place of business\" to section 1332 states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    The underlying purpose of diversity of citizenship legislation (which incidentally goes back to the beginning of the Federal judicial system, having been established by the Judiciary Act of 1789) is to provide a separate forum for out-of-State citizens against the prejudices of local courts and local juries by making available to them the benefits and safeguards of the Federal courts.\n    <em>\n     Whatever the effectiveness of this rule, it was never intended to extend to local corporations which, because of a legal fiction, are considered citizens of another State\n    </em>\n    . It is a matter of common knowledge that such incorporations are primarily initiated to obtain some advantage taxwise in the State of incorporation or to obtain the benefits of the more liberal provisions of the foreign State's corporation laws. Such incorporations are not intended for the prime purpose of doing business in the foreign State. It appears neither fair nor proper for such a corporation to avoid trial in the State where it has its principal place of business by resorting to a legal device not available to the individual citizen.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    H.R. Rep. No. 1706, at 4 (1958) (emphasis added). Congress thus intended to clarify section 1332, not so much to change it, so that it conformed to the purpose of diversity jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179039\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/707/#p708\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Because section 1332's drafters seemed to have thought that they merely had specified the two sites where a corporation may be deemed to be located, the Court would hesitate before reading too much into the absence of a contemporaneous amendment to section 1348. For these reasons, the Court reserves the issue of whether a national association may be deemed a citizen of not only its main office, but also its principal place of business.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Santander first indicated that the Court had federal question jurisdiction at the December 13, 2018 hearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
