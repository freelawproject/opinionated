INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This case is before me on defendant's motion (Doc. No. 171) for partial summary judgment on plaintiffs' retaliation claim and motion (Doc. No. 172) for decertification of the hostile work environment class. Plaintiffs have filed resistances (Doc. Nos. 187, 188)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and defendant has filed replies (Doc. Nos. 197, 198). I also allowed plaintiffs to file a sur-reply (Doc. No. 201) as to both motions. I find that oral argument is not necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 7(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs are female truck drivers who assert claims of hostile work environment and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) against their employer, CRST Expedited, Inc. (CRST). On March 30, 2017, I entered an order certifying the following classes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   a. The Hostile Work Environment Class: All women who were or are employed as team truck drivers by CRST Expedited, Inc. at any time from October 12, 2013 to the present, who have been subjected to a hostile work environment based on sex as a result of any of the following alleged CRST policies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) failing to find their complaints were corroborated without an eyewitness or admission,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) failing to discipline drivers after complaints were corroborated; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (3) failure to discipline DMs for failing to promptly respond to sexual harassment complaints.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   b. The Retaliation Class: All women who were or are employed as team truck drivers by CRST Expedited, Inc. at any time from October 12, 2013 to the present, who have been subjected to retaliation based on sex as a result of CRST requiring them to exit the truck in response to their complaints of sexual harassment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 85 at 54-55. I also certified the following issues pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(a):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   a. As to the Hostile Work Environment Class, whether CRST has any of the following policies, patterns or practices that create or contribute to a hostile work environment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (1) failing to find their complaints were corroborated without an eyewitness or admission,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (2) failing to discipline drivers after complaints were corroborated and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (3) failure to discipline DMs for failing to promptly respond to sexual harassment complaints and\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   b. As to the Retaliation Class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Whether CRST has a policy, pattern or practice of retaliating against women complaining of sexual harassment by requiring them to exit the truck except when they are a lead driver or owner-operator\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. I noted the order could be altered or amended as appropriate before final judgment pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1)(C).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. CRST now seeks summary judgment on the retaliation claim and decertification of the hostile work environment class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Retaliation Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Parties' Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   CRST argues that plaintiffs' retaliation claim fails for four reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   1. Plaintiffs cannot show that they suffered any materially adverse employment action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   2. Plaintiffs cannot show that their removal from their trucks was motivated by retaliatory animus against them for complaining of sexual harassment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   3. CRST has legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for its remedial actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   4. The record lacks any evidence of pretext.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 171.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs argue an unpaid suspension or pay cut in response to sexual harassment complaints constitutes a materially adverse employment action. They contend they have direct evidence of retaliatory intent based on CRST's admission that its policy is to remove women who complain about harassment from their trucks and, depending on whether the removal occurred before or after July 2015, to pay them nothing or reduced pay. Plaintiffs also rely on a Human Resources (HR) PowerPoint presentation in which CRST considered whether female drivers were \"punished for raising concerns\" by having to get off the trucks and lose money while the accused drivers were allowed to stay on and continue earning money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 191-1 at 22. Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden shifting analysis, one could infer a retaliatory motive, for which CRST has no legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for removing women who complain of harassment from the trucks, resulting in a loss of pay. Even if CRST's reasons of safety and prompt investigation could be viewed as legitimate, they argue the evidence demonstrates these reasons are pretextual. They argue CRST's reasons for removing women from the trucks have shifted and that the temporal proximity between plaintiffs' complaints and CRST's actions indicates pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In reply, CRST argues plaintiffs have not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to a standard operating procedure of retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 198 at 7-11. Specifically, it argues plaintiffs cannot rely on their summary exhibit because it is inadmissible and unreliable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14. With regard to retaliatory intent, they argue plaintiffs have not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact based on either direct or indirect evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

CRST's drivers include individuals who own, or are leasing to own, the vehicles they operate (owner-operators) and other individuals. CRST's training regimen requires student drivers to work alongside experienced drivers (lead drivers) for a designated period of time. Once the student drivers complete their training, they\n   may team up with a co-driver of their choosing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   All driving teams are supervised by a driver manager (DM). Drivers communicate with DMs over phone, email and CRST's messaging system, known as Qualcomm. DMs are evaluated based on metrics such as time percentage, overall mileage and truck utilization. Plaintiffs point out that expenses (amount spent per mile) and trucks in service are also metrics. Doc. No. 191-2 at \u00b6 13. They note that factors such as the number of trucks working, and a bus ticket to relocate a driver from one location to another, count against these metrics.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050378\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/1372/#p1376\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   DMs are also responsible for retaining drivers and addressing conflicts between team drivers. When that conflict is a complaint of harassment or discrimination, plaintiffs point out that CRST's human resources (HR) department is also responsible for investigating that complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Drivers are paid per mile using a \"split mileage system.\" Each driver is paid at his or her personal rate for half of the total miles driven by the truck regardless of the number of miles each driver personally drives. The personal rate depends on the driver's length of experience. A driver may also receive layover pay for the time between when a truck is empty (not under a load) to the dispatched pickup time. This may occur when drivers are away from the terminal or home due to a breakdown or impassable highway conditions. Plaintiffs add that the time period required to receive layover pay is \"no less than 48 hours.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. After 48 hours, each driver of the truck may receive $ 40 for each subsequent 24-hour period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Layover and breakdown compensation is based on standard daily rates unrelated to a driver's length of experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii. CRST Written Policies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   CRST has a written policy prohibiting sexual harassment in its workplace. The policy also prohibits unlawful employment discrimination and retaliation. The policy is contained within the handbooks that are distributed to CRST drivers and home office employees, including DMs. CRST emphasizes the policy during a dedicated session at driver orientation, where qualified trainers present the policy and provide drivers with a stand-alone copy. The policy states that CRST \"prohibits sexual harassment\" and that those who report it \"will NOT be subject to ANY form of retaliation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 171-2 at \u00b6 25. It also sets forth the complaint procedure and outlines reporting responsibilities for personnel. CRST's Code of Business Ethics prohibits harassment based on sex and mandates immediate reporting \"to the appropriate Supervisor or the Human Resources Department.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. The handbook instructs that \"[i]f an employee believes he or she is being subjected to verbal or physical harassment, the employee should immediately contact his or her [DM] or [HR] to inform them of the situation and to request a new lead driver.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. The handbook states: \"[a]n employee has the right to request a new driver without fear of retaliation. Any employee who reports any act of harassment and/or discrimination will NOT be subject to ANY form of retaliation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   All drivers sign an acknowledgement that they have received and reviewed the handbook and statement of policy, including the policy on sexual harassment and retaliation. Drivers are also required to certify their understanding that employees who complain about harassment will be removed from the harassing situation. The acknowledgment states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   I also understand and agree that if I believe I am being subjected to harassment or discrimination, no matter how severe or pervasive, I will immediately report it to my fleet manager or [HR] directly so that I may be removed from the harassing situation and so that CRST may conduct a prompt investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iii. CRST Practices in Responding to Complaints of Sexual Harassment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   CRST states that its first priority in responding to a complaint of sexual harassment is the safety of the complaining driver. Plaintiffs deny this. When a dispatcher receives a communication from a driver alleging sexual harassment, the dispatcher is required to take immediate steps to ensure the safety of the complainant and advance the investigation. Plaintiffs admit this is CRST's written policy, but deny that CRST's pattern or practice is to take immediate steps to ensure the safety of the complainant or advance the investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 191-2 at \u00b6 32. Dispatchers may respond to complaints of sexual harassment by separating the drivers and arranging for necessary accommodations for the complainant (including a hotel stay and transportation) and to pay or reimburse for those accommodations. Plaintiffs state that while dispatchers may have this authority, they do not in fact arrange for accommodations or travel or pay or reimburse these expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   CRST states it takes steps to separate drivers quickly and safely. Plaintiffs deny this, stating there are frequent delays in separating drivers, which creates unsafe conditions for women subjected to sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. When one driver makes a complaint against another driver - regardless of the nature of the complaint - DMs are instructed to remove the complainant from the situation unless the complainant is the lead driver or an owner-operator. Plaintiffs admit this to the extent it applies to sexual harassment complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. All employees receive notice of CRST's policy of removing the complaining employee when they join the company. Plaintiffs clarify that this policy concerns only harassment or discrimination complaints. They also add that the policy states only they will be \"removed from the harassing situation\" and does not state whether they will be removed from their truck. Plaintiffs allege that CRST's policy is to remove women who complain about sexual harassment from their trucks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   CRST sets forth several purported rationales for the separation policy, many of which plaintiffs dispute. First, CRST states that removing the complainant allows her to seek necessary resources, such as law enforcement assistance, medical attention or mental health care. Plaintiffs take issue with the evidence cited in support of this statement and contend this shows that female drivers are forced to\n   rely on police intervention to protect themselves from harassing co-drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. They add that complainants would be equally able to obtain these resources if the harasser was removed from the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Second, CRST claims the policy gives the complainant the opportunity and resources to gather and transmit necessary information to HR as part of the investigation. Plaintiffs disagree and state that HR gathers whatever information it seeks from the complainant in a single telephone conversation, which could easily take place while the complainant remains on the truck. Plaintiffs also deny that the policy provides the complainant with resources to gather and transmit information to HR because the policy leaves the complainant on unpaid suspension while off the truck, or receiving less compensation than she would have received had she stayed on the truck. Plaintiffs also note that the complainant is often responsible for the transportation and lodging costs once removed from the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Third, CRST states that removing a complainant from the truck better facilitates the investigation by allowing her to have a confidential conversation with HR and giving her the opportunity to gather and submit corroborating evidence. Plaintiffs deny this, stating that a confidential conversation could just as easily take place by removing the accused from the truck. To the extent CRST claims that allowing the complainant to stay on the truck while communicating with HR poses a safety concern, plaintiffs state that a complainant can speak with HR while the truck is not moving. They also point out that HR has conducted investigations and communicated with accused drivers while they remain on the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Fourth, CRST states its policy complies with various licensing and ownership rules. For instance, when the complainant is a student driver, she cannot operate the truck alone and when the accused is an owner-operator, CRST has no authority to remove him from his own truck. Plaintiffs admit that removing a student driver or a driver who has been harassed by an owner-operator complies with licensing and truck ownership rules. They deny that other aspects of the removal policy comply with those rules, such as cutting the pay of the removed driver or allowing the lead driver or owner-operator accused of harassment to continue working and earning pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   CRST states that it works with the removed driver to investigate the complaint and to locate a new co-driver for the employee's next job. Plaintiffs admit that CRST does this in some, but not all instances, and adds that this does nothing to alleviate the consequences of spending the intervening time off the truck, wholly unpaid or with a pay cut, until a new co-driver can be located.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On July 1, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   CRST authored a new Layover Pay Policy, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   CRST provides team drivers with multiple venues to report concerns related to harassment and discrimination. Upon a report of harassment or discrimination, CRST staff actively engages with each driver to ensure their safety. Normally, the driver making the complaint (Complainant/Accuser) is removed from the truck expeditiously and routed to a safe haven. The objective here is safety first. If the situation warrants, police will be called to ensure that no incidents transpire while the driver is packing up and exiting the truck. CRST exemplifies a\n   culture that is fair and consistent with regard to pay and lodging to employees who report Title VII concerns. A team driver will not be penalized, financially, for reporting a bonafide concern. In addition, CRST enforces zero tolerance for retaliation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 171-2 at \u00b6 45. The Policy further provides that when a complaint of harassment or discrimination is made, the dispatcher will \"make arrangements to remove the Accuser from the truck\" unless the removal of the accuser means that there will not be a qualified driver for the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   CRST claims that when a driver is removed from a truck, it ensures she has sufficient funds for lodging and transportation costs (which she does not have to pay back) and CRST immediately investigates. Plaintiffs argue the lodging, transportation costs and timing of CRST's investigation are not relevant. They deny that CRST provides sufficient funds for lodging and transportation, stating that removed drivers often bear these costs on their own and CRST will often recoup any advance it has made from a driver's paycheck later. Doc. No. 191-2 at \u00b6 47. They also deny that it was CRST's practice prior to July 2015 to cover any lodging or transportation costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   CRST states that it pays HR layover pay to a complainant removed from a truck starting on the date of removal and ending the date the employee is paired with a new co-driver. Plaintiffs deny this with respect to all times prior to July 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. After July 1, 2015, plaintiffs deny that HR layover pay was always paid to women removed from their truck due to a sexual harassment complaint. They claim that in 31 out of the 84 occasions on which a woman was removed from a truck due to sexual harassment from July 1, 2015, to the end of the class period, CRST paid no HR layover pay at all.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They add that CRST's policy states that the HR layover pay ends on the date the employee is offered a new pairing, which does not always coincide with the date she is actually paired with a new co-driver and is able to begin driving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The amount of HR layover pay is based on the highest minimum wage in the country, which CRST multiplies by ten hours per day. Doc. No. 171-2 at \u00b6 49. CRST paid $ 100 per day when it implemented HR layover pay. It then paid $ 110 per day based on California's increase to its minimum wage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   CRST states that prior to July 2015, a delay in pairing and continuation of driving exceeding 48 hours qualified the driver for layover pay of $ 40 per day. Plaintiffs deny this, stating that CRST's policy provided \"[t]he truck must be available from empty time to dispatched pickup time no less than 48 hours to qualify for 1 layover.\" Doc. No. 191-2 at \u00b6 50. They argue this excludes situations where a driver is off the truck. Plaintiffs also deny that CRST had a policy or practice of paying standard layover pay prior to July 1, 2015, stating that at least 49 out of 51 female drivers who had to leave their trucks due to sexual harassment during that time frame did not receive any layover pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Plaintiffs' Statement of Additional Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Karen Carlson, CRST's Manager of Employee Relations, has authority over the investigation of harassment or discrimination complaints made by all drivers in the CRST fleet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 198-1. Carlson reports to Angela Stastny, CRST's Director of HR. Stastny in turn, reports to Brooke Willey, CRST's Vice President of HR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As of August 2016, women comprised approximately 13 percent of all drivers and\n   five percent of lead drivers for CRST. CRST contends that it is approximately three to four times more successful than the industry average in attracting and retaining women as drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54, 55. With regard to its policy of removing drivers who complain of sexual harassment (aside from the two exceptions concerning lead drivers and owners/operators), CRST states its policy is not limited to female drivers who complain of sexual harassment, but applies regardless of the gender of the complaining driver or accused driver and regardless of the nature of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiffs have compiled an exhibit identified as \"Figure 1,\" which they contend is a chart summarizing information provided by CRST consisting of complaint files documenting occasions in which a female driver had to get off her truck due to sexual harassment, \"trip archive\" records for these female drivers documenting each trip they made and payroll records documenting how much they were paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57. CRST admits that it produced the information identified by plaintiffs but denies that \"Figure 1\" is an accurate compilation of such information. It disputes Figure 1 is evidence that would be admissible at trial for several reasons that I will discuss below.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   I will consider CRST's objections to Figure 1 to apply to all of the assertions described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   According to Figure 1, there were 135 occasions in which a female driver had to get off her truck due to sexual harassment between October 12, 2013, and December 5, 2017. CRST denies the legal conclusion that these women were all subjected to \"sexual harassment.\" CRST states that in several of the cases plaintiffs rely on, the complaining driver exited the truck for reasons unrelated to alleged harassment. These reasons included things such as: update of commercial driver's license, truck maintenance and other disrespectful behavior. CRST also states that in many instances, the complaining driver requested to exit the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. Out of the 135 occasions plaintiffs cite, they contend 50 women were co-drivers and 85 women were students. CRST clarifies that Figure 1 does not list 135 different women, but admits that out of the 135 instances cited by plaintiffs in Figure 1, CRST's records show that 50 allegations were made by co-drivers and 85 allegations by student drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. None of the women in the 135 instances continued on their truck after complaining of sexual harassment. CRST states that the evidence shows that in some cases, the complainant did not make a complaint until she was already off the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. It cites one instance in which the female driver reported allegations three days after exiting the truck and another instance in which the female driver reported her allegations the day after she got onto a different truck. It also states again that some complainants exited the truck for reasons unrelated to the alleged harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   According to plaintiffs, in nine of the 135 cases the female driver was physically kicked off the truck by the harasser and HR followed its policy of allowing the accused to continue driving. CRST denies that its files show that any female driver was \"physically kicked off the truck by the harasser\" and states that its files show that none of the named individuals stated that the alleged harasser \"physically\" removed her from the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. CRST also states that none of the named individuals complained until after her co-driver or lead driver reported her for unsafe driving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In 20 of the 135 cases, plaintiffs contend the female driver physically jumped off the truck due to harassment and the alleged harasser was permitted to keep driving\n   pursuant to CRST's policy. CRST denies that its files show that the named individuals \"physically jumped\" off the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62. In one instance, it states the files show that the complainant and alleged harasser both exited the truck because it required maintenance. In another instance, CRST states the file shows the complainant was quitting employment and had already put in her notice when she got of the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With regard to whether it permitted the alleged harassers to keep driving, it notes that its files show that in one instance, the alleged harasser quit and did not continue on the truck. In many of the instances, CRST states the files show that the driver did not complain until several days after getting off the truck. It cites examples in which complainants waited four days, two days and a week after getting off the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In the remaining 106 cases, the driver complained to HR while on the truck and CRST followed its policy of removing the complainant from the truck and allowing the alleged harasser to continue driving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63. CRST denies that its files show that each of these women complained to HR while on board the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It states that in many instances, the women complained to individuals outside of HR and exited the truck prior to HR commencing its investigation. It provides three examples in support.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CRST also denies that the alleged harassers continued driving the truck in all instances. It cites two examples in which the alleged harassers resigned before or during the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that male drivers accused of harassment are routinely allowed to continuing working and earning money while HR investigates complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64. In support of this assertion, plaintiffs have submitted responses from male drivers subject to investigation indicating that, at the time of their interview with HR, they were either working solo or with a new co-driver or student.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CRST argues that this assertion relies on inadmissible hearsay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also denies that the driver statements do not indicate whether the accused individual was actually operating the truck at the precise time of the interview by HR. It explains that HR does not interview the accused individual until it has an opportunity to interview the complainant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It contends it attempts to interview the driver when he is not operating the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   A complainant pulled off a truck must find a new co-driver before driving again.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. CRST contends it works with the employee to locate a new co-driver. The complainant may have to travel, by bus or rental car, to meet her next potential co-driver or to pick up her next truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. CRST admits that drivers sometimes have to travel between loads but denies that this situation is unique to female drivers who complain of sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also notes that CRST covers these travel expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiffs state that out of the 135 cases in which a female driver had to get off her truck due to sexual harassment, 51 of those complaints occurred between October 12, 2013, and July 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67. Prior to July 1, 2015, women who complained of sexual harassment and were removed from their trucks did not receive any pay during the time they had to spend off the truck in accordance with CRST's policy, pattern or practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68. CRST denies that Figure 1 shows it maintained the alleged policy, pattern or practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It states that prior to July 2015, when a delay in pairing or continuation of driving exceeded 48 hours, the driver was eligible to receive standard layover pay of $ 40 per day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs assert that layover pay was provided on only one occasion out of the 51 instances during October\n   12, 2013, through July 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69.

CRST admits that various lengths of time elapsed, but denies the assertion to the extent it implies a cause for the length of time. It notes that some complainants failed to return calls or respond to DMs or other CRST representatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It cites examples in which some drivers failed to get on a bus, kept the rental vehicle longer than authorized or refused lead drivers who were offered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other instances, the driver was terminated, quit, or requested vacation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   CRST produced two PowerPoint presentations from January and February 2014 that state the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   When drivers raise allegations of sexual or other issues of harassment, and we remove them from the truck ... why is it that the accused can stay on earning money and the accuser gets stranded at a motel and loses money every day and has to wait for a new codriver ...

CRST states that these documents reflect its ongoing efforts to strengthen its gender-neutral remedial policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CRST instituted its new HR Layover Pay policy on or after July 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73. The policy, providing for payment of $ 100 per day, was based on the highest state law minimum wage at the time, which was $ 10 per hour in California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74. The HR layover pay policy is not announced to all drivers, but drivers are informed of it once they are involved with an allegation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75.

They state it reflects the number of days the driver was off her truck until she started driving her next truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs then calculated how much a driver would be paid per day based on HR layover pay or other layover pay and how much she would be paid per day while on her truck (based on the same time period and two prior paystubs).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 82, 83.

If the records themselves are admissible, then it will be possible for plaintiffs to present a summary exhibit, similar to Figure 1, based on these records that would comply with Eighth Circuit requirements for admission of that exhibit. At this stage, however, in considering whether plaintiffs have put forth admissible evidence in defense of CRST's motion for partial summary judgment, I will primarily consider the underlying CRST records as opposed to plaintiffs' Figure 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii. Is There a Policy, Pattern or Practice?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The next question is whether plaintiffs have demonstrated there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether CRST maintained a policy, pattern or practice of requiring female drivers who complained of sexual harassment to get off the truck without pay or with a significant reduction in pay. Plaintiffs' evidence must allow a reasonable jury to conclude that such an action was not isolated or accidental, but CRST's standard operating procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In my order certifying the class, I found that the deposition testimony of Karen Carlson, CRST's Manager of Employee Relations, along with declarations from some of the plaintiffs, were sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement with regard to CRST's alleged policy, pattern or practice of requiring women complaining of sexual harassment to get off the truck upon making a complaint, thus resulting in a loss of compensation. Carlson testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   During the training that I have conducted a couple of times a year, it is communicated that the accuser is the individual that gets off the truck because we want to make sure that they are in a safe location, a safe environment. If the accuser - Let's see - If the accuser is the lead driver, then the accuser has to stay on the truck because the student can't remain on the truck and drive the truck because they are not qualified yet. So in that particular case the student would have to get off the truck. But in the majority of cases, it would be the accuser that gets off the truck. So we engaged in a dialogue with the driver managers when these situations arise and if they have questions, they call us on the telephone, whether it be me or any of our employee relations representatives. And we reaffirm that the accuser needs to get off the truck, we need to get them a hotel and cab, then we need to do so immediately so that we can begin the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Doc. No. 85 at 36. Plaintiffs now submit \"a complete set of all examples of [CRST]'s policy in action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 191-1 at 3, n.1. As noted above, plaintiffs contend there were 135 occasions in which women who complained of sexual harassment were not permitted to continue working on their trucks after complaining. Doc. No. 191-1 at 3. They state that in nine cases the woman was kicked off the truck by the harasser, in 20 cases the woman voluntarily got off the truck due to the harassment and in the remaining 106 cases, the woman complained to HR while on board the truck and CRST told her to get off the truck. Having reviewed the records plaintiffs cite in support of these figures, I find that this evidence would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that CRST maintained a standard operating procedure of requiring female drivers complaining of sexual harassment to exit the truck. That is only one half of the relevant question, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The other half is whether, in requiring the female complainants to exit the truck, CRST subjected these drivers to an unpaid suspension or a significant pay cut. Prior to July 1, 2015, plaintiffs allege it was\n   CRST's policy, pattern or practice to pay the drivers nothing for the time they spent off a truck. They state that on 49 out of the 51 occasions from October 12, 2013, to July 1, 2015, in which a woman had to get off her truck due to sexual harassment, CRST paid the driver nothing. CRST argues that drivers during this time were eligible to receive the standard layover pay of $ 40 per day. Plaintiffs state that this occurred in only one instance on October 23, 2014, for class member Claudia Lopez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Based on the record before me, I find plaintiffs have demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether CRST maintained a policy, pattern or practice from October 12, 2013, through July 1, 2015, of failing to pay drivers complaining of sexual harassment after removing them from the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The situation is far different for the period after July 1, 2015, plaintiffs state there are 84 cases where a woman had to get off her truck due to sexual harassment. These complaints occurred between July 1, 2015 and December 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 191-1 at 8.

No. 198 at 8. Moreover, it argues that its removal policy does not have the intent or effect of suspending employees without pay, or with a significant pay cut, because its working environment routinely requires employees to move from truck to truck with periods of time in between.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. It states that \"removing a complaining employee from the specific truck where that employee claims to be experiencing harassment is not equivalent to suspending the employee and withholding pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These arguments go directly towards the jury question of whether plaintiffs' alleged policy, pattern or practice (removal with unpaid suspension and a significant pay cut) exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   I do find significant problems with regard to the alleged policy, pattern or practice after July 1, 2015. First, plaintiffs allege that CRST either failed to pay complainants who were removed from their truck or paid them significantly less than they would have made had they stayed on the truck. However, their evidence does not reflect this. Rather, their evidence reflects whether they experienced a \"pay cut\" based on their previous two weeks of pay, not the miles remaining to the truck's destination and their rate of pay. Plaintiffs' calculations of a percentage pay cut for complaints after July 1, 2015, cannot fairly be said to be a reflection of a standard policy of CRST, but a comparison to the complainant's prior two weeks of work. Given that the payment records demonstrate that mileage could differ drastically from week to week, this is not a fair comparison. In other words, the percentage pay cut identified in Column N of plaintiffs' Figure 1 does not depend on CRST's alleged policy, pattern or practice, but on how much the complainant drove in\n   the previous two weeks. Indeed, for nearly all the women who purportedly experienced a 100 percent pay cut after July 1, 2015, plaintiffs did not even have a \"comparison period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   I find that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether CRST maintained a policy, pattern or practice after July 1, 2015, of not paying female drivers who were removed from their truck following a complaint of sexual harassment or paying them substantially less than they would have made had they stayed on the truck. The records indicate that CRST maintained a policy, pattern or practice of removing sexual harassment complainants from the truck and paying HR layover pay (based on some sort of formulation regarding a variety of circumstances), but the records do not demonstrate that this pay was consistently less than a driver would have made had she stayed on the truck. Plaintiffs have demonstrated only that for some women, the HR layover pay per day was less than they made per day driving the truck during the previous weeks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The differences in pay are more attributable to circumstances that vary from individual to individual and the HR employee's discretion rather than to the application of a standard operating procedure by CRST. For these reasons, I find CRST is entitled to summary judgment for all complaints after July 1, 2015, as plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact from which a jury could conclude that CRST maintained a policy, pattern or practice of failing to pay female drivers complaining of sexual harassment or paying them significantly less than they would have made had they stayed on the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Because I have found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether CRST maintained a policy, pattern or practice from October 12, 2013, through July 1, 2015, of failing to pay drivers complaining of sexual harassment after removing them from the truck, I will now focus on that alleged policy, pattern or practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iii. Does the Alleged Policy, Pattern or Practice Involve an Adverse Employment Action?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   CRST argues that the alleged policy, pattern or practice does not, as a matter of law, involve an adverse employment action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   CRST notes that in its working environment, employees routinely move from truck to truck with periods of time in between when they are not paid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 198 at 9. It emphasizes that removal from the truck does not constitute disciplinary suspension without pay, but removal from the harassing environment. Plaintiffs argue that a policy, pattern or practice of removing women from their trucks without pay following complaints of sexual harassment is materially adverse. Because driving a truck is the means by which CRST pays its employees, this situation is akin to an employer who temporarily suspends or reduces the hours of an\n   hourly employee. In this case, CRST temporarily suspended the mileage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   I find this question should go to a jury. Under\n   <em>\n    Burlington Northern\n   </em>\n   , an adverse employment action is one that \"a reasonable employee would have found ... materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Burlington Northern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    548 U.S. at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the evidence plaintiffs have presented, reasonable jurors could conclude that a reasonable employee in plaintiffs' position would be dissuaded from making a sexual harassment complaint based on the alleged retaliatory action. A suspension of pay may be considered materially adverse under this standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A reasonable employee facing the choice between retaining her job (and paycheck) and filing a discrimination complaint might well choose the former.

Given that periods of time without pay seem to be the norm, a female driver who had received an assignment and was actually driving - thus earning money - might very well have been dissuaded from reporting that sexual harassment, knowing that she would be required to get off the truck and go back to a non-pay status for an indefinite period of time.

Plaintiffs note that CRST admits its policy prior to July 2015 was to remove women from their truck when they complained of sexual harassment and that they did not receive their regular pay while off the truck. Plaintiffs rely on PowerPoint presentations dated January and February 2014 from HR's Weekly Employee Relations Meetings, which state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   When drivers raise allegations of sexual or other issues of harassment, and we remove them from the truck ... why is it that the accused can stay on earning money and the accuser gets stranded at a motel and loses money every day and has to wait for a new co-driver ...

CRST disagrees, stating that its legitimate non-retaliatory reasons are: to protect employee safety and well-being, to comply with licensing and truck ownership rules and to facilitate a prompt and efficient investigation into the complaint. Doc. No. 171-1 at 23. CRST contends plaintiffs have no evidence to suggest these reasons are pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   For purposes of its summary judgment motion, CRST assumes that each individual plaintiff could demonstrate a reasonable and good faith belief that the behavior about which she was complaining violated Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 171-1 at 15, n.2. However, CRST contends the record is undisputed that female complainants were removed from trucks for the legitimate and non-retaliatory reasons in the preceding paragraph.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. It contends that the removals were remedial rather than retaliatory and that the record lacks any evidence of pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   As noted above, plaintiffs contend CRST's HR PowerPoint presentations from January and February 2014 are direct evidence of retaliation. \"Direct evidence of retaliation is evidence that demonstrates a specific link between a materially adverse action and the protected conduct, sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that the harmful adverse-action was in retaliation for the protected conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Lors v.

The PowerPoint presentations do not demonstrate retaliatory intent on the part of CRST in response to sexual harassment complaints. These presentations were part of Employee Relations weekly meetings, during which HR employees considered alternatives to the policy in place at the time. I agree with CRST that, if anything, they demonstrate the opposite - that CRST was seeking to avoid any negative consequences for employees who brought sexual harassment complaints. The PowerPoint slides show an acknowledgment of potential negative effects stemming from CRST's policy, pattern or practice, but do not suggest any improper motivations by\n   CRST. I also do not find that evidence of CRST's layover pay or HR layover pay constitutes direct evidence of retaliatory intent. Again, that evidence shows an intent to avoid negative consequences as a result of the removal, rather than an intent to impose them. Because I do not find a genuine issue of material fact based on direct evidence, I will consider whether plaintiffs are able to demonstrate a fact issue under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden shifting analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Assuming plaintiffs can establish a prima facie case, CRST argues that it has legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for removing sexual harassment complainants from the trucks in which they experienced the harassment and that plaintiffs have no evidence to suggest those reasons are pretextual.

They argue that each of CRST's proffered reasons could be maintained while continuing to pay the removed driver at her regular rate of pay. They contend that CRST's purported safety concern of interviewing complainants while they continue driving is not credible because CRST routinely interviews the male alleged harasser as he continues driving the truck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 191-1 at 28. They further contend that if CRST believed communicating with HR while driving a truck posed a safety concern, it would remove the male harasser from the truck as well.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564299\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/906/#p918\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   As for CRST's purported concern of assuring the safety of others on the road by preventing women from \"operat[ing] trucks while simultaneously experiencing distress from the alleged harassment,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 171-1 at 24, plaintiffs argue this is \"a patronizing and highly questionable generalization ... that female truck drivers who have experienced any form of sexual harassment are emotionally incapable of driving a truck safely.\" Doc.

They argue that CRST's asserted reasons for removing women from the trucks without pay have shifted and that temporal proximity indicates pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \"Substantial changes over time in the employer's proffered reason for its employment decision support a finding of pretext.\"\n   <em>\n    Wierman v.

Plaintiffs rely on CRST's arguments in opposing class certification to argue that it has changed its reasons for the alleged adverse action. They contend that in opposing class certification, CRST stated that the decision to remove a complainant depended upon practical circumstances that could not be reduced to a single policy and now it argues that it is its practice to remove a complaining employee unless prohibited by licensing requirements (if the complainant is an owner-operator or a lead driver with a student).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 191-1 at 32. Given that the class certification issue involved a completely different standard, against which CRST was attempting to show lack of commonality, among other things, I find no \"shifting\" of a suspicious nature. Moreover, the difference in CRST's reasons goes toward the issue of whether a policy, pattern or practice exists, not whether it is retaliatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   With regard to temporal proximity, the alleged adverse action is very close in time to the protected conduct, but because CRST's reasons (safety of the complaining employee) support that immediacy, I do not find this to be a situation in which the temporal element alone could create an inference of pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wierman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199379\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/984/#p995\">\n    638 F.3d at 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that an argument \"built on temporal proximity, is undermined where the allegedly retaliatory motive coincides temporally with the non-retaliatory motive.\");\n   <em>\n    Sprenger v.

This situation is unique because the working environment that caused the employee to engage in the protected conduct (reporting sexual harassment) is the only environment immediately available through which that employee could earn money, at least prior to July 1, 2015. While CRST then instituted an additional payment source for sexual harassment complainants, through its HR layover pay, I do not find that to be relevant as to whether CRST's reasons for removing female drivers from their trucks without pay prior to July 1, 2015, is evidence of pretext. Indeed, evidence that CRST changed its policy may be inadmissible as a subsequent remedial measure under Federal Rule of Evidence 407.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Ultimately, I find that plaintiffs have failed to point to anything in the record that would allow a jury to conclude that CRST's stated reasons for removing sexual harassment complainants from the truck without pay during the time they waited to get assigned to another truck was pretext for retaliation. Plaintiffs have not put forth sufficient evidence for a jury to infer that (a) CRST's articulated reasons were false and (b) the real reason was retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lors v. Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215100\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/831/#p834\">\n    595 F.3d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 834 (8th Cir. 2010). Plaintiffs' best argument is that CRST's reasons for removing the complainant could just have easily been fulfilled by removing the alleged harasser. However, even if CRST could have accomplished its objectives in a better way, it does not follow that CRST's stated reasons of: (1) ensuring the safety of the complainant, (2) complying with licensing and truck ownership rules and (3) facilitating a prompt and efficient investigation into the complaint are not true, or that the jury could infer a retaliatory motive based on CRST's chosen course of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Plaintiffs' attempt to demonstrate a fact issue as to pretext by showing that they made complaints of sexual harassment and CRST took adverse employment action shortly thereafter is insufficient. They offer no evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that CRST's stated reasons for removing the complainant from the truck (resulting in no pay until the complainant could be re-paired) were pretextual. As such, CRST is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

No. 172-1 at 7. It further argues that plaintiffs' approach to proving the claim based on a compilation of recorded complaints by divining a pattern or practice out of the underlying circumstances, without the aid of an expert, is not \"common evidence\" that is typically necessary for classwide proof.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. It emphasizes that plaintiffs must provide \"significant proof\" of a \"general policy\" to proceed as a class and plaintiffs cannot meet that burden with anecdotal evidence from only two percent of class members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CRST further contends that plaintiffs' approach makes certification unmanageable because the first phase of trial to resolve liability will result in hundreds of mini-trials, eliminating any efficiency of the certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, it argues that the current class definition creates an improper, \"win-win\" situation for the plaintiffs,\n   as they will either prevail as to liability at the first phase or, by virtue of losing, would not be considered members of the class such that this litigation would have no preclusive effect on them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that CRST has not made any new arguments with regard to certification and that for the reasons stated in my original order (Doc. No. 85), certification of the hostile work environment class remains appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 192-1 at 44-45. They argue they intend to rely on the evidence that supported their original motion for class certification as well as new evidence consisting of Rule 30(b)(6) testimony, testimonial evidence from CRST managers and documentary evidence (such as sexual harassment complaint investigation files) produced by CRST.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50.

Plaintiffs argue the class is manageable, relying on the arguments in their initial motion for class certification and the reasons stated in my order granting certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-66. Finally, they argue the class is ascertainable, but suggest that the class definition could be revised to those who \"have made a documented complaint\" to satisfy any of CRST's concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   In reply, CRST argues that plaintiffs' proposed approach of proving their case with inadmissible and unreliable \"summary exhibits\" prepared by their trial counsel, rather than relying on testimony from female drivers, does not establish the requirements of commonality and predominance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 197 at 5. It contends that at trial, it would be entitled to present evidence concerning the full story with respect to each and every recorded entry in the summary exhibits, which demonstrates why plaintiffs' proposed approach is unworkable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. It argues that proof through anecdotal evidence alone (without statistical analysis or the aid of an expert) is appropriate only in a limited number of circumstances (such as when the number of employees is small) and that the use of such evidence in this case is particularly problematic given the unique nature of CRST's workplace.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. CRST summarizes its argument as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   Plaintiffs have no evidence, and certainly not the\n   <em>\n    common\n   </em>\n   evidence required by\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   , to prove their class-wide liability theory that highly confidential [HR] decisions about investigating and resolving individual complaints could somehow incite severe, pervasive, sex-based harassment by male drivers, each working on a different truck. They lack support for their assumption that any particular disciplinary failure overrode CRST's explicit anti-harassment policy, became known outside the strict confidentiality of [HR], was part of a routine everyday company policy of tolerating sexual harassment, and engendered a hostile work environment so severe as to alter the terms of employment of any other female driver - let alone of hundreds of other female drivers.

Doc. No. 172-1 at 13. Upon receiving the complaint, an HR employee logs it into its \"Positive Work Environment Employee Relations\" spreadsheet and immediately commences an investigation, which includes gathering pertinent records, developing a line of questioning and speaking with the accused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It states that each investigation depends on the circumstances of the complaint and the available sources of proof. After speaking with the accused regarding the nature and circumstances of her complaint, the HR employee then looks at whether there are any prior complaints against the accused driver and considers any relevant documents or communications, interviews any available witness and interviews the accused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The HR employee then determines whether the complaint can be corroborated. CRST states that corroboration can come from a variety of sources and that the test if whether HR is \"able to identify that the action was confirmed and that it took place.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. It further states it does not have a policy or practice of requiring an eyewitness statement or admission to corroborate a complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Even if the HR employee cannot corroborate the complaint, CRST states it nonetheless takes remedial measures. It changes the accused male driver's status to \"male only\" and assures the driver will never again be assigned to drive with the complainant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. These designations last indefinitely and can be removed only by HR. The accused driver also receives a copy of CRST's written policy prohibiting harassment via certified mail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the complaint is corroborated, the accused driver faces disciplinary action up to and including termination. HR itself does not impose the discipline but recommends a course of action to the driver's DM. Discipline depends on individual circumstances, including the nature and severity of the corroborated harassment.

That summary is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   Women who worked as team truck drivers for CRST were subjected to verbal sexual harassment; offensive sexual conduct; and unwanted physical contact including attempted sexual assault. This conduct frequently occurred on the team trucks while the drivers were in route. Examples of the verbal harassment female drivers experienced include requests or demands for sex (Ex. 5 \u00b6 16, 18, 27, 36; Ex. 8 \u00b6 11; Ex. 9 \u00b6 7, 9; Ex. 7 \u00b6 9, 16, 24, 26, 36, 53); comments about their bodies, come-ons, and other forms of verbal harassment (Ex. 4 \u00b6 9-10, 13-15, 22, 27, 32, 56; Ex. 8 \u00b6 38; Ex. 9 \u00b6 7; Ex. 7 \u00b6 9, 12, 17, 32, 34, 44, 50, 52; Ex. 5 \u00b6 14, 26, 34-35). Examples of offensive conduct they experienced include requests or attempts to get into bed with them (Ex. 4 \u00b6 29; Ex. 6 \u00b6 12; Ex. 7 \u00b6 13-14, 53, 60), being stared at while they slept (Ex. 6 \u00b6 11; Ex. 7 \u00b6 60), and men intentionally being unclothed or exposing themselves (Ex. 4 \u00b6 42, 44; Ex. 7 \u00b6 15). Examples of the unwanted physical contact include attempted sexual assault (Ex. 4 \u00b6 44; Ex. 5 \u00b6 28-29), and physical touching, including kissing or touching with genitals (Ex. 4 \u00b6 12, 28, 29; Ex. 6 \u00b6 8; Ex. 8 \u00b6 8, 29-30; Ex. 9 \u00b6 13; Ex. 7 \u00b6 59). When women resisted the harassment or rejected sexual advances, the men harassing them retaliated against them. Examples of such retaliation included men kicking them off the truck and abandoning them (Ex. 6 \u00b6 17; Ex. 7 \u00b6 27), claiming they left the truck with no authorization (Ex. 4 \u00b6 34), taking measures to stop them from communicating with dispatch (Ex. 8 \u00b6 13; Ex. 7 \u00b6 19-21), spreading rumors about them (Ex. 7 \u00b6 29), threatening to harm them (Ex. 5 \u00b6 42-43; Ex. 8 \u00b6 12; Ex. 7 \u00b6 18, 31, 55), making false reports about the woman to dispatch (Ex. 6 \u00b6 18; Ex. 8 \u00b6 35; Ex. 7 \u00b6 45), calling the police on them (Ex. 8 \u00b6 31), destroying their belongings (Ex. 6 \u00b6 19), holding them captive (Ex. 5 \u00b6 41-46), and/or physically assaulting them (Ex. 6 \u00b6 21; Ex. 8 \u00b6 19).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Doc.

Plaintiffs contend that although HR considers whether there are prior complaints against the accused driver as part of its investigation into a sexual harassment complaint, Carlson stated in her capacity as a Rule 30(b)(6) witness that the existence of prior complaints will not impact CRST's determination as to whether the instant complaint is deemed corroborated.

Plaintiffs contend that CRST's business records confirm this policy, which plaintiffs have compiled in summary fashion pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 1006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Figure 1 and 2. They state that the records reveal that either an eyewitness or an admission was the basis of 54 out of the 56 total corroborated cases. Doc. No. 188 at 16. Plaintiffs rely on the anecdotal examples from their motion for class certification demonstrating that CRST disregarded evidence that could have corroborated sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Now that they have compiled a list of all documented complaints of sexual harassment made by female drivers against male drivers during the class period that CRST deemed not to have been corroborated, plaintiffs contend the basis for their pattern or practice claim is even stronger. They state that CRST found 209 sexual harassment complaints made by female drivers not to be corroborated during the class period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They note that in 60 percent of those cases (124 out of 209), CRST's investigation records show that it disregarded evidence that could have potentially corroborated the victim's complaint, but did not consider that evidence to be eyewitness testimony or an admission of sexually harassing conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. In 36 cases, a witness was identified who could have provided evidence supporting that victim's complaint (such as witnesses who heard harassment over the phone or saw the harasser's conduct before or after the time the drivers were on the truck).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 19 cases, evidence existed that could have supported the victim's complaint (including text messages, pictures, a police report, or some other document that CRST either did not obtain or refused to credit).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 52 cases, the alleged harasser made admissions that could have supported the victim's complaint, but that CRST did not deem an admission of sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, in 17 cases more than one of these additional forms of evidence was available.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs conclude that in nearly 60 percent of \"uncorroborated\" cases, CRST either refused to obtain or credit evidence that could have distinguished the case from a true \"he said/she said\" situation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that when confronted with examples of CRST refusing to find a complaint had been corroborated in light of this evidence, Carlson said she could not answer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. For instance, when Leslie Fortune complained about her lead driver, Carlson confirmed that this lead driver lied to HR when he stated he had not required Fortune to share a hotel room with only one bed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Carlson deemed Fortune's complaint uncorroborated. When asked why the lead driver was terminated only for texting while driving when she was able to confirm that he had required a student to stay in a hotel room with only one bed in it and lied to HR about it, Carlson replied, \"I can't answer that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Fortune also complained that a co-driver called her a \"lot lizard\" (truck driver slang for prostitute) to another driver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The investigation form shows that Carlson left a message for the driver to whom the statement was made but never followed up, even though she conceded that drivers are required to cooperate with HR investigations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also did not make any further efforts to reach out to three other witnesses Fortune had identified beyond leaving them a single telephone message.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Plaintiffs identify one other specific example involving Fortune and an additional\n   example involving Claudia Lopez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. In both instances, Carlson deemed the complaint uncorroborated, even though there was evidence that could have suggested it was true, such as statements by the accused or witnesses who were never contacted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs discuss two additional examples of uncorroborated complaints with supporting evidence that were handled by the two employee relations representatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Plaintiffs state that these examples and others in the investigation forms demonstrate the alleged policy, pattern or practice of failing to find a complaint is corroborated in the absence of eyewitness testimony or an admission by the accused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Failure to Discipline When Complaints are Corroborated\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Plaintiffs argue CRST has a policy, pattern or practice of failing to discipline drivers when complaints are corroborated. While CRST states that HR merely makes a recommendation to DMs and operations managers regarding any discipline following a harassment complaint, plaintiffs provide deposition testimony from a DM and operations manager stating that he had no personal involvement in disciplining drivers outside of what HR instructed him to do.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Another DM during the class period also stated that \"I just, in the end, was either told 'male only,' 'female-only,' 'terminated.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs state that these designations of \"male only\" are not disciplinary, as they do not reduce a driver's pay and are not considered a disciplinary warning. Plaintiffs state that these same designations were used in many cases even when CRST found a sexual harassment complaint to be uncorroborated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23. They also note that even CRST does not claim that its practice of sending the accused driver a copy of CRST's sexual harassment policy is a disciplinary action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   In addition to the anecdotal examples provided in their motion for class certification, plaintiffs argue that based on CRST's own records, CRST imposed no discipline in over 60 percent of cases (34 out of 56) where CRST deemed some sexually harassing conduct to have been corroborated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Plaintiffs summarize 12 instances where HR corroborated some sexually harassing conduct, but none of the harassing drivers were disciplined in any way, warned, or directed to sit through a PWE training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Failing to Discipline DMs Who Do Not Promptly Respond Appropriately to Complaints\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Plaintiffs note that Stastny stated in her deposition that DMs who receive sexual harassment complaints and do not immediately convey those complaints to HR should be disciplined if they permit the truck to continue driving after learning of the sexual harassment complaint.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   Q: If a driver manager doesn't immediately convey a sexual harassment complaint that they have learned of to HR, they should receive some form of discipline, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   Q: And same with a situation where the driver manager has permitted the truck to continue onward past the point where they learned about a sexual harassment complaint situation on the truck, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Doc. No. 192-1 at 27. An operations manager also admitted that DMs are required to notify HR of a sexual harassment complaint \"[a]s soon as they conclude the conversation\" in which they become aware of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Carlson also testified as CRST's Rule 30(b)(6) witness that a DM who receives a sexual harassment complaint is required to split the drivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs note that HR does not regularly review how DMs respond to sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Stastny could not recall a single instance in which a DM was terminated for failing to comply with CRST's policy of reporting sexual harassment complaints to HR or disciplined for failing to appropriately handle a sexual harassment complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   HR decides whether to discipline a DM for mishandling a sexual harassment complaint. When discipline is imposed upon a DM who has failed to appropriately handle a sexual harassment complaint, a disciplinary action form is filled out and stored in the employee's file and within the HR employee relations files.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. In discovery, plaintiffs requested all disciplinary action forms relating to any DM's failure to timely or properly respond to a complaint of sexual discrimination or sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Only three forms were produced for the class period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   None of those disciplinary actions related to the anecdotes plaintiffs referenced in their motion for class certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Plaintiffs then summarize 29 examples in which a complaint was allegedly mishandled and the DM did not receive any discipline, beyond a written warning in one instance and a three-day suspension in another.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-31. Plaintiffs note that those examples are not an exclusive list of all failures by a DM to appropriately handle a sexual harassment complaint. Because there are only three documented occasions of a DM being disciplined, plaintiffs contend the extent of this failure can only grow as they uncover more examples.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Plaintiffs further argue that failing to discipline DMs exacerbates the problem because the DMs can continue mishandling complaints without consequence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They cite an example of a DM who failed to immediately separate the drivers upon receiving a complaint but was not disciplined - even though HR had knowledge of how the DM handled the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33. They cite another instance of the same DM taking no action regarding a complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. HR spoke with the DM and the DM admitted telling the complainant to \"put her big girl panties on.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   HR told the DM the comment was unprofessional and should not be used going forward. The DM was not disciplined for the comment, or failing to separate the drivers and escalate the complaint to HR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   The same DM then handled a complaint from a student driver against a lead driver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The DM forwarded an email chain between the two drivers to HR, which revealed that the DM failed to promptly separate the drivers and ultimately had them deliver the load before separating them. The DM also made the following comment to the complainant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   That is strange because I have never had any one ever complain about that about him .. and he trains most women because we don't' [sic] have very many that will train women, . [sic] Unfortunately I will need to address this immediately in the morning with HR ..and it is too bad because he is a good trainer w/ good knowledge. I will figure out where to get you to ..are you okay for the night?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. The DM was not disciplined for how this complaint was handled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   On a fourth occasion, this same DM handled another complaint by telling the complainant to deliver the load and then the drivers could separate at a CRST terminal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When interviewed by HR, the complaining driver explained the DM's response. When HR spoke to the DM, the DM made admissions revealing the complaint had been mishandled and HR told the DM that when a driver mentions\n   harassment, the DM should remove her right away. The DM, again, was not disciplined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Plaintiffs cite examples with another DM in which a driver complained that her lead driver slept in the truck nude and refused to stop when she told him it bothered her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. She told HR that her DM asked if she could deal with it one more day. This DM was not disciplined for failing to immediately separate the drivers. On another occasion, a driver similarly reported to HR that upon complaining of her co-driver's inappropriate behavior, the DM tried to require her to keep driving to move the load. The DM was not disciplined and was subsequently promoted to operations manager, a position supervising other DMs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that under this operations manager's supervision, other DMs engaged in similar behavior. They cite an example of a female driver who reportedly got off the truck after her co-driver approached her in his boxers, sat on her bed while she was lying down, watched videos of half-naked women in the cab of the truck and slapped her on the back several times while she was driving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The driver reported that her DM hung up on her and did nothing to assist her with getting a hotel or transportation. The DM admitted that he probably should have sent an email to HR conveying the sexual harassment complaint, but neither the DM nor the operations manager were disciplined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   In sum, plaintiffs contend that CRST repeatedly failed to discipline DMs for failure to follow its policy of immediately separating drivers upon receipt of a sexual harassment complaint and escalate that complaint to HR. They suggest that DMs are incentivized to keep the trucks moving because stopping them due to sexual harassment complaints will affect their compensation metrics. Plaintiffs allege sexual harassment is allowed to thrive under this purported policy, pattern or practice of failing to discipline DMs for mishandling complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Applicable Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 governs class certification. Under Rule 23(a), the party seeking certification must demonstrate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n   (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The proposed class must also satisfy at least one of the three requirements under Rule 23(b).

Such relief might take the form of an injunctive order against continuation of the discriminatory practice,\n   an order that the employer keep records of its future employment decisions and file periodic reports with the court, or any other order \"necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights\" protected by Title VII.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1670\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/324/\">\n    431 U.S. at 360-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1670\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/324/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

We do not mean to suggest that there are any particular limits on the type of evidence an employer may use. The point is that at the liability stage of a pattern-or-practice trial the focus often will not be on individual hiring decisions, but on a pattern of discriminatory decisionmaking. While a pattern might be demonstrated by examining the discrete decisions of which it is composed, the Government's suits have more commonly involved proof of the expected result of a regularly followed discriminatory policy. In such cases the employer's burden is to provide a nondiscriminatory explanation for the apparently discriminatory result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1670\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/324/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1670\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/324/\">\n    at 360-61, n. 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1670\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/324/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While that approach worked in\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   (a race discrimination case), it does not fit neatly into the pattern or practice claim of hostile work environment. As one court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n   [I]n a race discrimination case[,] it is clear why a pattern or practice should have an effect on an employer's liability to individual claimants. If an employer has an established policy of making employment decisions with racial animus in violation of Title VII, it is likely that any specific employment decision also violates Title VII, and if a particular decision was not discriminatory, the employer is in the best position to show why. However, the impact of a pattern or practice finding in a hostile work environment sexual harassment case is not so clear. In contrast with a race discrimination case - where the focus is on the employer's basis for making an employment decision that adversely affected the claimant - a sexual harassment case centers on the gravity of the conduct to which a claimant was exposed. The sexual harassment suffered by the claimant must have been severe or pervasive enough (measured both objectively and subjectively) to constructively alter the terms or conditions of the claimant's employment by creating a hostile work environment. Otherwise, no Title VII violation has occurred. Therefore, a finding that an employer had a pattern or practice of tolerating sexual harassment in violation of Title VII does not necessarily establish that an individual claimant was exposed to harassment or that the harassment an individual claimant suffered violates Title VII. It is thus unclear what effect a pattern or practice finding should have on an individual claimant's suit for damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

It rejected the EEOC's argument that the objective element of the hostile work environment claim could be determined at the pattern or practice phase. The EEOC had essentially argued that it intended to prove the objective component by showing that sexual harassment that occurred company-wide was sufficiently severe or pervasive such that a reasonable person would find the work environment as a whole to be hostile. The court rejected this approach with the following reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n   The EEOC's belief that it can meet its burden of proof on the objective element by aggregating the acts of harassment to which\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the claimants were subjected to derives primarily from\n   <em>\n    Mitsubishi\n   </em>\n   , which eliminated the objective component of the severe or pervasive test at the individual stage. As discussed above, the court's rationale for doing so was that \"[a]lthough 'isolated' or 'sporadic' instances of harassment ... are typically not enough to establish hostile environment sexual harassment, single instances of conduct must be taken together with the continuous pattern of harassment in the workplace, which was established at the pattern or practice phase.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitsibishi\n   </em>\n   [sic],\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"238132\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/990/1059/#p1069\">\n    990 F.Supp. at 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the EEOC's proposed method of proof - and, in the court's opinion, that endorsed by\n   <em>\n    Mitsubishi\n   </em>\n   , et al. - would strip the limitation of its significance in a pattern or practice case. Under the EEOC's theory, if IPA is found to have a policy of tolerating severe or pervasive sexual harassment, then every woman who was exposed to any form of sexual harassment at IPA, however trivial, would be entitled to damages so long as she was subjectively offended by the conduct she was exposed to. In other words, a woman who experienced only an untoward glance or an isolated remark could nonetheless recover compensatory and punitive damages so long as she was subjectively offended. This scenario is inconsistent with the principles announced in\n   <em>\n    Meritor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , and the court does not believe that the Supreme Court would sanction such a result, even in the context of a pattern or practice case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n   This is not to say, however, that the terms or conditions of employment are not altered when an employer has a policy of allowing severe or pervasive harassment to occur in its workplace. A policy of tolerating such behavior is itself a Title VII violation, but proof of such a policy establishes only that the employer behaved improperly with respect to a protected group\n   <em>\n    in general\n   </em>\n   , and therefore justifies only injunctive relief under\n   <em>\n    Teamsters.\n   </em>\n   That an employer has such a general policy does not mean that every employee who was harassed has been exposed to harassment meeting the\n   <em>\n    Meritor\n   </em>\n   threshold, and thus does not mean that the terms and conditions of employment have been altered for each employee who experienced harassment. It is entirely possible for an employee to work at a business with a\n   policy of tolerating actionable sexual harassment, yet be exposed to harassment in only the most superficial of ways.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   Of course, the extent to which a particular employee was\n   <em>\n    exposed\n   </em>\n   to the conduct relied on by the EEOC to prove the company's hostile work environment (at the pattern or practice phase) is relevant to that employee's individual hostile environment claim. But this is only to say, as\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   instructed, that the totality of each employee's circumstances, not isolated instances, determine whether sexual harassment is actionable. The court therefore agrees with\n   <em>\n    Mitsubishi\n   </em>\n   that the work environment as a whole\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be relevant to an individual claimant's experience,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"238132\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/990/1059/#p1069\">\n    990 F.Supp. at 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but disagrees that an individual claimant can satisfy her burden on the objective element by aggregating all claimants' experiences. Instead, the court will focus on the conduct to which\n   <em>\n    each individual claimant\n   </em>\n   was exposed. This approach is more consistent with the Court's admonition in\n   <em>\n    Meritor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   that a Title VII violation occurs only when the harassment to which a particular claimant is exposed is so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would be offended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   The court therefore agrees with IPA that the claimants cannot be relieved of their burden to make an objective showing at the individual phase of this lawsuit if the EEOC prevails on the pattern or practice aspect of this case in Phase I. An objective showing will be required at both Phase I and Phase II. At Phase I, the EEOC will be required to prove that a reasonable person would find the sexual harassment occurring globally at IPA so severe or pervasive that the work environment as a whole was hostile or abusive toward women. At Phase II, the EEOC must also show that the harassment to which each individual claimant was exposed is severe or pervasive enough to be actionable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   <em>\n    Int'l Profit Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203120069\">\n    2007 WL 3120069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   I agree with this approach as it applies to this case, particularly given the manner in which the sexual harassment is alleged to have occurred here - in trucks and by one individual against another. It would be unfair to conclude that a work environment as a whole is hostile by tallying up all instances of sexual misconduct when each person in the class may have been subject to only one of those instances and unaware of the others. For that reason, Phase II must involve the question of whether the conduct particular to each individual is objectively and subjectively offensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   The district court in\n   <em>\n    Int'l Profit Assocs.\n   </em>\n   explained this as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-291\">\n   As discussed above, proof that the employer had a policy of tolerating unlawful sexual harassment does not necessarily make it more likely that any particular claimant was subject to actionable sexual harassment. Rather, a particular claimant could have experienced only mundane comments, even though the employer had a practice of tolerating far more objectionable actions. Thus, to remain consistent with the goals of Title VII, as articulated by the Supreme Court, each claimant must demonstrate that the harassment she experienced meets the objective threshold of\n   <em>\n    Meritor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris.\n   </em>\n   Nor would the employer be in a better position than the employee to demonstrate that the harassment experienced by a given plaintiff was not sufficiently severe or pervasive. To the contrary, each individual claimant should have knowledge of the specific harassment she experienced,\n   and the relevant inquiry is whether this conduct, taken as a whole, would render the work environment hostile to a reasonable person. Thus, shifting the burden on the objective element to the employer at the individual phase does not make sense under\n   <em>\n    Teamsters.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15.

When applying the above framework in the context of a class action, it becomes obvious that individual issues will predominate common ones under Rule 23(b)(3).

No. 197 at 20. CRST argues that plaintiffs have failed to describe how they\n   intend to prove the other elements of a hostile work environment at Phase I and contends that proof of these elements cannot involve common evidence because each alleged incident of sexual harassment took place in isolation from any other. This raises the question of whether an employer's common response to individualized hostile conditions can form the entire basis of a hostile work environment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   I find that it cannot. Plaintiffs are not alleging that CRST's policies, patterns or practices themselves are the harassing conduct, but the means by which CRST tolerates, encourages and allows sexual harassment in the workplace. As CRST notes, this addresses the second part of a hostile work environment claim (the employer's response), but the first part (the unwelcome sexual harassment and the severity of such harassment), is equally important to establish liability. Aside from the employer's alleged negligence, plaintiffs must prove: (1) that they are members of a protected group, (2) that they were subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment, (3) that the harassment was based on sex, (4) that the harassment affected a term, condition or privilege of their employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

Here, the harassment primarily took place one-on-one in a truck by a codriver against another codriver or by a lead driver against a student driver. While some women experienced multiple offensive encounters, most women reported only one instance of sexual harassment, as evidenced by plaintiffs' summary exhibits. Of course, these women could have been subjected to other offensive conduct that was not reported or that is outside of the class time period. Nonetheless, the nature of the offensive conduct at issue is isolated and sporadic when viewed from each plaintiff's perspective, even if appears severe and pervasive when all of the complaints are viewed together. Any commonality concerning CRST's alleged response (or lack of response) to each reported incident of harassment has no bearing on the isolated nature of the harassing conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Considering that at Phase II, the conduct will have to be evaluated again (regarding whether it is objectively and subjectively offensive), the class structure, even with regard to one issue (the employer's negligence), loses its efficiency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Profit Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203120069\">\n    2007 WL 3120069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3 (\"Therefore, a finding that employer had a pattern or practice of tolerating sexual harassment in violation of Title VII does not necessarily establish that an individual\n   claimant was exposed to harassment or that the harassment an individual suffered violates Title VII.

The class claim of unlawful retaliation is hereby\n   <strong>\n    dismissed\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   2. Defendant's motion (Doc.

The plaintiffs may pursue their hostile work environment claims against defendant on an individual basis. In addition, while I have granted summary judgment as to the class claim of retaliation, this does not preclude the possibility that an individual plaintiff might have a viable retaliation claim based on the specific facts and circumstances of that plaintiff's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-309\">\n    Pursuant to the court's order at Doc.
