The Court agrees with the Petitioner that the term \"ex parte\" could be misleading in this context, and the Court removed the phrase from the Respondents' paragraph 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    The Petitioner objects to the inclusion of the Brann Declaration as inadmissible under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56(c)(2) and (c)(4), arguing first that the Declaration is an \"impermissible attempt to offer in the guise of 'fact' an opinion as to the ultimate issue presented to the court.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    PRDSMF \u00b6 9 (citing DSMF (ECF No. 136), Attach. 3,\n    <em>\n     Brann Decl.\n    </em>\n    (ECF No. 136-3) (\n    <em>\n     Brann Decl.\n    </em>\n    ) ). The Petitioner cites\n    <em>\n     Lamarche v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company\n    </em>\n    in support of its contention.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9336909\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/236/34/\">\n     236 F.Supp.2d 34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 42 n.9 (D. Me. 2002). The Court is aware of the distinction between fact and argument, and, as FERC has pointed out, an attorney representing a party may not present an argument as fact with the intention of forcing the Court to accept a contested legal argument as a proffered fact. The Court will enforce the distinction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    Second, the Petitioner argues that the Brann Declaration should be excluded because Attorney Brann did not disclose himself as a fact witness. PRDSMF \u00b6 9. The Court views the Brann Declaration as a vehicle for presenting uncontested facts to the Court for the purposes of the motion. His statement in paragraph 4, for example, that he was never permitted to conduct any discovery on behalf of the Respondents, is presumably a statement of uncontested fact, which involves the conduct of the litigation based on Attorney Brann's role as counsel for the Respondents, not as a witness to the facts underlying the dispute. Either Attorney Brann was or was not allowed to engage in discovery on behalf of his clients. If the Petitioner contends that Attorney Brann's assertion is erroneous, Respondent would have an undoubted right to contest those asserted facts. But it appears that the Petitioner is contending not that the Attorney Brann statement is false, only that he may not make it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    The alternative would be for Attorney Brann to file a request for admission, which-if true-Petitioner would have to admit. If Attorney Brann had moved to be allowed to file a request for admission, the Court would likely have granted it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). In this sense, Attorney Brann's sworn declaration is simply another way of placing uncontested facts before the Court for purposes of the motion. Indeed, as Respondents point out, when Petitioner thought it advantageous to place facts underlying the process before the Court, it supported its facts with an attorney affidavit, an irony Respondents did not hesitate to point out. PSAFM \u00b6 2; DRSAMF \u00b6 2 (\"Proving that irony is no stranger to the law, FERC's sole support for this allegation is a declaration from counsel, Demetra Anas, as to the procedure employed in the investigation\"). The Court overrules the Petitioner's objection and denies Petitioner's request to be allowed to depose Attorney Brann.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    Third, the Petitioner argues that the Brann Declaration attempts to offer \"facts\" for summary judgment not found in the Respondent's Statement of Material Facts. The Court will not consider a statement in the Brann Declaration but not in the Respondents' Statement of Material Facts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    The Respondents' paragraph 87 states: \"In this litigation, FERC disclosed the identities of people with 'relevant knowledge' who had been interviewed as part of the investigation, and who had not been disclosed to the Respondents prior to the time FERC issued the Orders Assessing Penalties.\" DSMF \u00b6 87. The Petitioner denies the statement as unsupported by the cited record, because the only cited support for the statement is paragraph 37 of the Brann Declaration, which refers only to the fact that FERC had interviewed individuals from Constellation and ISO-NE who were unfamiliar to Attorney Brann.\n    <em>\n     Brann Decl.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 37. The Court finds that cited record supports the Respondents' paragraph 87.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    The Petitioner also denies the Respondents' paragraph 87 based on the argument that the Respondents interacted with the individuals FERC interviewed, and therefore the Respondents were aware of their identities. The Court views this denial as non-responsive to the Respondent's statement and overrules the denial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    The Petitioner denies the Respondents' paragraph 88 as \"mischaracterizing the Notice of Filing of the Administrative Record\" because the Notice of Filing contained not only the contents of the administrative record, but also additional materials \"for the convenience of the Court and the Parties.\" PRDSMF \u00b6 88 (citing\n    <em>\n     Notice of Submission of Administrative R.\n    </em>\n    (ECF No. 26) ) (\n    <em>\n     Notice of Administrative R\n    </em>\n    ).

The Petitioner further states in its qualified response: \"Deponents and their counsel in the investigation were instructed regarding the testimony of witnesses in accordance with the requirements of section 1b.16 of the Commission's regulations, requiring sequestration of witnesses.\" PRDSMF \u00b6 12.

The Petitioner also argues that the Brann Declaration is improper and should be stricken. The Court denies the request to strike.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 9.

The Court views the Respondents' use of the word \"claim\" in their statement in a manner consistent with Petitioner's position, namely reflective of the fact that the Petitioner stated that it had provided all materials it relied upon in its preliminary findings and analysis. The Court, therefore, overrules the Petitioner's denial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-270\">\n    The Petitioner further denies the Respondents' statement because of quotation marks around the word \"preliminary.\" The Court removed the punctuation.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 26.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-271\">\n    The Petitioner admits the Respondents' paragraph 25 in part but denies the statement that \"Enforcement agreed to disclose some, but not all of the cited materials, provided that they were not shared with Defendants' co-counsel or anyone at CES other than Dr. Silkman.\" DSMF \u00b6 25, citing\n    <em>\n     Brann Decl.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.

See, e.g., SUMF (ECF No. 135) \u00b6\u00b6 7-10, 12-17, 30-39. The Commission's Statement of Administrative Policy Regarding the Process for Assessing Civil Penalties,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C317\">\n     117 FERC \u00b6 61,317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2006) (hereinafter, \"2006 Policy Statement\") does not, itself, require anything, and does not supersede any statutory requirements; rather, the Statement \"outlines the basic procedures to be followed\" while \"retain[ing] the right to modify these procedures to fit the circumstances presented by specific cases, while still providing process that meets the applicable statutory criteria.\" See Statement of Administrative Policy Regarding the Process for Assessing Civil Penalties,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C317\">\n     117 FERC \u00b6 61,317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at P 2 (2006). Even though the 2006 Policy Statement refers to an \"immediate penalty assessment\" by the Commission, the FPA does not use such language and requires that the Commission \"promptly\" assess such penalty \"by order\" after \"notice and opportunity for public hearing, in accordance with the same provisions as are applicable under section 823b(d)\" after taking into consideration mandatory statutory factors, namely, \"the seriousness of the violation and the efforts of such person to remedy the violation in a timely manner.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SUMF (ECF No. 135) \u00b6\u00b6 13-16;\n    <em>\n     D.

Moreover, the 2006 Policy Statement articulates that an \"immediate penalty assessment by the Commission\" (as opposed to an Initial Decision by an ALJ that will then be considered by the Commission together with any exceptions filed) involves a procedure by which the Commission will first determine whether a violation or violations occurred and then issue an order setting forth its factual findings and assessment of any penalty determined to be appropriate. See Statement of Administrative Policy Regarding the Process for Assessing Civil Penalties,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C317\">\n     117 FERC \u00b6 61,317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at P 5 at 1.b.i (2006) (\"Immediate Penalty Assessment. If the Commission finds a violation, the Commission will issue an order setting forth the material facts that constitute the violations and assess any appropriate penalty.\") (bold text in original). Further, although the 2006 Policy Statement does not \"require\" a hearing, the 2006 Policy Statement notes the Commission's use of paper hearings in various circumstances, including the procedure by which civil penalties are to be assessed under the Natural Gas Act which \"draws on existing processes for the FPA and [Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978] for the administrative process the Commission generally will follow in assessing civil penalties under the NGA.\" See Statement of Administrative Policy Regarding the Process for Assessing Civil Penalties,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C317\">\n     117 FERC \u00b6 61,317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at PP 6-7 (2006). Finally, although the 2006 Policy Statement does not \"require\" discovery, respondents to a show cause proceeding have the ability to request discovery via motion under the procedural rules promulgated by the Commission pursuant to its express delegation of authority by Congress under the FPA. 12 Under the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure codified at 18 C.F.R. Part 385, which apply to show cause proceedings (see SUMF (ECF No. 135) \u00b6\u00b6 11, 30-31; D. Anas Decl. (ECF No. 137) \u00b6 12, Ex.

The Commission's regulations regarding discovery, moreover, expressly state that the provisions apply \"to discovery in proceedings set for hearing under subpart E of this part [i.e., ALJ hearing], and to such other proceedings as the Commission may order.\" See D.

The Court finds that, in large part, the Petitioner's qualification adds unnecessary detail to the Respondents' statement. However, the Court does find that the statement \"although the 2006 Policy Statement does not 'require' discovery, respondents to the show cause proceeding have the ability to request discovery via motion under the procedural rules ...\" should be included as it ensures the Respondents' statement is not misleading. The Court declines to incorporate the remainder of the qualification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"130\">\n   <p id=\"p-397\">\n    <em>\n     Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.
