This matter is before\n   the Court on Defendant Coastal Carolina University's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 6. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendant's motion, granting it as to the state law claims on the basis of Eleventh Amendment immunity but denying it as to the Title IX and gender discrimination claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The complaint and attachments thereto allege and describe the following. John Doe (\"Plaintiff\") and Jane Doe (\"Jane Doe\") were students at Coastal Carolina University (\"CCU\" or \"Defendant\") during the 2016-2017 school year. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 43 [ECF No. 1]. Plaintiff was a male, freshman student in good standing and a member of the CCU football team.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Jane Doe was a female student, a member of the CCU cheerleading team, and an acquaintance of Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. On August 27, 2016, after attending an off-campus pool party and consuming alcohol, Plaintiff and Jane Doe had consensual sex in Jane Doe's apartment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-56. Later that evening, several officers with the City of Conway Police Department (\"Conway PD\") were dispatched to Conway Medical Center to respond to a complaint by Jane Doe that she was sexually assaulted earlier that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 at 3. The responding officers determined that a sexual assault had occurred, and the police report names two suspects: Plaintiff and another male CCU student (\"Roe\") who had been in Jane Doe's apartment after Plaintiff's encounter with her. Compl. at \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 at 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Subsequently, on October 14, 2016, after investigating Jane Doe's complaint, Conway PD officers presented their findings to a state prosecutor who reviewed the case and determined there was sufficient evidence to charge Roe with criminal sexual conduct in the third degree in violation of S.C. Code \u00a7 16-3-654 but insufficient evidence to proceed with a charge against Plaintiff. Compl. at \u00b6 62; ECF No. 1-1 at 2; ECF No. 1-2 at 2. Upon learning of Jane Doe's sexual assault allegations against Plaintiff, Defendant notified him that he was being formally charged with violating Defendant's Code of Student Conduct (the \"Student Code\"), specifically, its Sexual Misconduct Policy. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 44, 64. Pursuant to the Student Code, Defendant assigned a Title IX investigator to examine the allegations, who, in Plaintiff's case, was Defendant's Dean of Students and Vice President of Student Rights and Responsibilities, Travis Overton (\"Overton\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 45. The Student Code requires an investigator to receive appropriate training and maintain complete impartiality during the course of an investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant convened a panel of its Student Conduct Board to determine if Plaintiff violated the Student Code with his alleged sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. On or about November 29, 2016, Defendant notified Plaintiff and Jane Doe that a Student Conduct Board hearing was scheduled for December 6, 2016, where Plaintiff would have the opportunity to respond to his alleged violation of the Student Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16; ECF No. 1-3. On December 6, after reviewing documents and hearing testimony from witnesses, including Plaintiff and Jane Doe, the panel found in Plaintiff's favor, determining the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he violated the Student Code. Compl. at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 15, 2016, Jane Doe appealed the panel's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. However, Jane Doe's appeal did not conform to the procedures set forth in Defendant's Student Conduct Handbook, which require an appeal to be submitted in writing within three days of the panel's decision and to enumerate the panel's errors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 25. Jane Doe's appeal was not in writing, untimely, and failed to list specific errors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 26. Nevertheless, Defendant's Provost and Executive Vice President Ralph Byington (\"Byington\") reviewed the appeal and requested a new hearing, the basis of which was to determine whether Defendant followed its disciplinary procedures providing notice of the charges and an opportunity to respond and whether \"new information exist[ed] sufficient enough to alter the original decision and why such information was not available at the original hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27 (citing Jan. 5, 2017 Letter [ECF No. 1-7] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 31, 2017, an appeal panel convened for a second hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. Without hearing any witness testimony, the appeal panel \"found a preponderance of evidence to indicate that [Jane Doe] was incapacitated by alcohol consumption, based on the statements provided. [Plaintiff] was familiar with [Jane Doe] from previous interactions and therefore reasonably should have known that [she] was incapacitated and therefore unable to give consent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32 (citing Apr. 3, 2017 Letter [ECF No. 1-8] ). As a result, Plaintiff was permanently dismissed from CCU effective March 31, 2017. [Apr. 3, 2017 Letter].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 31, 2018, Plaintiff filed suit in federal court against Defendant, styling his causes of action as: (1) violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; (2) violations of Title IX Office for Civil Rights (\"OCR\") Rules; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (5) promissory estoppel; (6) negligence; and (7) a declaratory judgment. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 77-146. As relief, Plaintiff seeks unspecified money damages and equitable relief, requesting the Court to reverse the outcome of his erroneous disciplinary proceeding, restore his reputation, expunge his disciplinary record, remove the record of his expulsion from his education file, permanently destroy any record of the complaint against him, readmit him to CCU for the Spring 2018 semester, allow him to withdraw from any courses he may have failed as a result of his expulsion, and find Defendant's rules, regulations, and guidelines unconstitutional as applied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 7, 2018, Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss. On May 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed a response, and on May 24, 2018, Defendant filed a reply thereto. The matter is now ripe for the Court's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"A motion filed under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint ... considered with the assumption that the facts alleged are true[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Francis v.

According to a case from the Eastern District of Virginia, although similar allegations \"passed muster in\n   <em>\n    Yusuf\n   </em>\n   ..., mimicking the\n   <em>\n    Yusuf\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's allegations is not necessarily sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss\" because under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , \"both decided after\n   <em>\n    Yusuf\n   </em>\n   ,\" a plaintiff \"must plead facts sufficient to support a plausible inference of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Thus, the question here is whether Plaintiff's allegations about widespread anti-male bias are \"plausible\" such that they satisfy the pleading requirements of\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   . In response, Plaintiff points out that the records to support these allegations are within Defendant's control, so discovery is needed. Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court believes that Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient at this stage. Furthermore, the Court does not believe that Plaintiff should be barred from discovery because he is unable to give more precise details about this alleged widespread gender bias at CCU; as he points out, such evidentiary materials are within Defendant's control. Given the confidential nature of disciplinary proceedings against students accused of sexual misconduct, it is difficult to imagine how Plaintiff could plead the existence of such proceedings in greater factual detail. The Court finds that Plaintiff has pled or alleged \"particular circumstances suggesting that gender bias was a motivating factor\" behind Defendant's allegedly erroneous finding. Whether the evidence Plaintiff culls from discovery is sufficient to support his allegations may be a question for future proceedings. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendant's motion to dismiss with respect to Plaintiff's Title IX claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court examines the\n   <em>\n    Ram Ditta\n   </em>\n   factors to determine if Defendant is an arm of the State of South Carolina, particularly whether its treasury will be responsible for paying any judgment against Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With respect to the first and fourth factors (state treasury's liability and how state law treats the entity), under the plain language of the SCTCA defining \"state\" and \"agency\", CCU clearly falls within the ambit of South Carolina's Eleventh Amendment immunity. \"State\" is defined as \"the State of South Carolina and any of its offices, agencies, authorities, departments, commissions, boards, divisions, instrumentalities ... and\n   <em>\n    institutions, including state-supported\n   </em>\n   government health care facilities,\n   <em>\n    schools, colleges, universities, and technical colleges\n   </em>\n   .\" S.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15-78-30(a) (emphasis added). Similarly, \"agency\" is defined as \"the individual office, agency, authority, department, commission, board, division, instrumentality, or institution,\n   <em>\n    including a state-supported governmental\n   </em>\n   health care facility,\n   <em>\n    school, college, university\n   </em>\n   , or technical college, which employs the employee whose act or omission gives rise to a claim under [the SCTCA].\" S.C. Code \u00a7 15-78-30(a), (e) (emphasis added). When the South Carolina legislature established CCU from Coastal Carolina College-which had been a four-year regional branch of the University of South Carolina-it did so by stating that CCU \"shall be a separate and distinct\n   <em>\n    institution\n   </em>\n   of higher learning\n   <em>\n    of the State of South Carolina\n   </em>\n   .\" S.C. Code \u00a7 56-13-100 (emphasis added). Thus, South Carolina law treats CCU as part of the State of South Carolina. With respect to liability, the SCTCA makes the State and its agencies liable for certain torts, providing recovery of damages up to $ 300,000 per occurrence on state law tort claims. S.C. Code. \u00a7 15-78-120(a)(1). Given the SCTCA's language treating CCU as part of the State, the South Carolina treasury would be liable for Defendant's alleged torts. Thus, this first-and most significant factor-as well as the fourth factor, weigh heavily in favor of finding CCU an arm of South Carolina. The Court briefly addresses the second and third factors (degree of autonomy from the State and local versus statewide concerns).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to the second factor, the Fourth Circuit instructs the Court consider \"who appoints the entit[ies'] directors or officers, who funds the entit[ies], and whether the State retains a veto over the entit[ies'] actions.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Oberg v. Pa. Higher Educ. Assistance Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356712\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/646/#p668\">\n    804 F.3d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 668 (4th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). \"Also relevant to the autonomy inquiry is the determination whether the entity has the ability to contract, sue and be sued, and purchase and sell property, and whether it is represented in legal matters by the state attorney general.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356712\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/646/#p668\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). South Carolina law provides that CCU's board of trustees is composed of the governor or his designee and sixteen members, fifteen of whom are elected by the South Carolina legislature and one of whom is appointed by the governor. S.C. Code \u00a7 59-136-110. The CCU board of trustees has various enumerated powers, including the ability to make contracts, purchase and sell real estate, make bylaws and regulations for the management of its affairs, fix tuition fees, and confer degrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   S.C. Code \u00a7 59-136-130. This factor weighs slightly in favor of finding CCU an arm of South Carolina because although South Carolina has endowed the CCU board of trustees with powers of governance, management, and operation of CCU, it is nevertheless an alter ego of the State as evinced by the board's composition of the governor, and governor and legislature-elected members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, with respect to the third factor, the Fourth Circuit has held that \"[h]igher education is an area of quintessential state concern and a traditional state governmental function.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellerbe Becket\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8971511\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/255/#p262\">\n    407 F.3d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a public institution of higher learning, CCU's existence is not confined to local interests but rather to statewide interest. Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of finding CCU an arm of the South Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In conclusion, the\n   <em>\n    Ram Ditta\n   </em>\n   factors all weigh in favor of finding Defendant an arm of South Carolina. South Carolina has clearly retained its sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the fullest extent on behalf of itself and its arms, which includes CCU.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.C. Code \u00a7 15-78-20(a) (\"[I]t is declared to be the public policy of the State of South Carolina that the State, and its political subdivisions, are only liable for torts within the limitations of this chapter and in accordance with the principles established herein.\"); S.C. Code \u00a7 15-78-20(a) (providing that the South Carolina legislature \"intends to grant the State, its political subdivisions, and employees, while acting within the scope of official duty, immunity from liability and suit for any tort except as waived by this chapter\"). Accordingly, Defendant is an arm of the State of South Carolina entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to Plaintiff's state law claims against it. As such, Defendant's motion to dismiss the state law claims with respect to Eleventh Amendment immunity is granted, and those claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smyth v.
