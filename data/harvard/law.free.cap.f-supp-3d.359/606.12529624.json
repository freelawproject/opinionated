(Doc. 53). For the reasons that follow, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 49),\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 50), and\n   <strong>\n    denies as moot\n   </strong>\n   defendant's motions to Strike Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence (Doc. 52) and to Exclude Expert Report and Testimony. (Doc. 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On November 19, 2015, plaintiff filed a one-count complaint against defendant alleging a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), Title 47 United States Code, Section 227, claiming defendant placed \"at least seventy-one (71) collection calls to Plaintiff\" after plaintiff had requested defendant cease placing such calls. (Doc. 2, at 2-3). Defendant filed an answer on January 28, 2016 (Doc. 11), and subsequently filed a motion to stay proceedings pending the outcome of cases before the United States Supreme Court and the District of Columbia Circuit Court\n   of Appeals. (Doc. 12). On March 23, 2016, the Court granted the motion to stay. (Doc. 13). Approximately two years later, on March 26, 2018, the parties notified the Court that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had issued its opinion, and the parties jointly requested that the Court lift the stay. (Doc. 28). On March 29, 2018, the Court entered an Order lifting the stay. (Doc. 29). After the stay was lifted, the Court entered a Scheduling Order and a Trial Management Order, which set certain deadlines, including an October 26, 2018 deadline for filing dispositive motions. (Docs. 35, 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On October 26, 2018, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. (Docs. 49, 50). Defendant also filed a motion to strike the Interactive Intelligence Interaction Dialer Administration Guide exhibit contained in plaintiff's brief (Doc. 52), and a motion to exclude plaintiff's expert's testimony and report pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 702 and 703. (Doc. 53). The parties filed their final reply briefs on December 7, 2018, and the Court considers the motions now fully submitted. Neither party requested a hearing on the pending motions and the Court finds a hearing unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. FACTUAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Credit Card Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 14, 2007, plaintiff acquired an American Express credit card with defendant. On August 12, 2014, plaintiff entered into an Online Agreement with defendant regarding that credit card account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Online Agreement states:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-37\"><strong>TELEPHONE CONTACTS</strong> <em>We may contact you at the phone numbers in your profile.</em> You authorize USAA to contact you at the telephone numbers in your profile. For example, we may contact you by telephone when we detect suspidous activity on your accounts, or when we have other important information to convey to you. To revoke this authorization, you may edit your profile by removing telephone numbers on which you do not want to receive such calls.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff provided a telephone number with the last four digits 9507 in her online\n   profile as her contact number (\"plaintiff's telephone number\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff did not thereafter reject or withdraw from the Online Agreement, nor did plaintiff edit her profile to remove her telephone number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Defendant's Telephone Calling Equipment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant used an Aspect Unified IP, Model No. 7.3 and/or Aspect Initiated Contact Systems (\"Aspect Dialer\") to make calls to its clients regarding their credit card accounts. To call a client using the Aspect Dialer, defendant had to upload the client's telephone number into the Aspect Dialer for dialing. Defendant could use the Aspect Dialer to create different \"Campaigns\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for dialing specific telephone numbers based on different criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To dial any specific number on a Campaign, the Aspect Dialer allows a user to manually dial the telephone number, or the Aspect Dialer may be configured to automatically dial the stored telephone numbers without the need for a human being to physically dial or push a button to make the call. The Aspect Dialer can only call the specific stored telephone numbers on a Campaign, and cannot independently generate any other telephone numbers to be called. The Aspect Dialer is incapable of using a random number generator to generate random telephone numbers for dialing. Plaintiff's expert, Randall Snyder, agreed in a deposition that the Aspect Dialer is not capable of generating random telephone numbers or sequential blocks of telephone numbers for dialing. Although a collection company defendant engaged used another type of dialing system called an Interaction Dialer, defendant itself did not use that type of system. Even if defendant is liable for that company's use of an Interaction Dialer, however, plaintiff's own expert admits that like the Aspect Dialer, an Interaction Dialer is incapable of generating random or sequential number lists for dialing, and can only dial specific telephone numbers it is provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Defendant's Telephone Calls to Plaintiff\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On August 1, 2015, defendant began using the Aspect Dialer to call plaintiff's telephone number regarding plaintiff's credit card account. Plaintiff admitted the calls were not random and that defendant was specifically trying to get in contact with plaintiff-using a telephone number plaintiff provided-regarding plaintiff's existing debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   During the August 1, 2015 telephone call, plaintiff informed defendant that plaintiff was working with a consumer credit counseling service, and plaintiff complained about defendant's call, but was advised that the calls would continue. Defendant called plaintiff again on August 5, 2015. During this call, plaintiff informed defendant that plaintiff had previously tried to make payment arrangements and was working with debt consultants. Plaintiff alleges that during this call, she asked\n   defendant to stop calling her; defendant denies this allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Between August 8, 2015, and September 17, 2015, defendant used the Aspect Dialer to place thirty-four telephone calls to plaintiff using the Aspect Dialer. During a telephone call on August 13, 2015, plaintiff asked defendant not to call her, which request was noted in defendant's account notes. During a telephone call on August 25, 2015, plaintiff again stated that she was working with a credit counseling service and wondered why defendant was still calling her. Plaintiff asserts that during this call she requested that defendant stop calling her; defendant denies that plaintiff requested that defendant stop calling plaintiff during the August 25, 2015 telephone call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On September 18, 2015, defendant assigned collection of plaintiff's account to United Recovery Systems (a/k/a Alltran Financial) (\"URS\"). URS then placed fifty-three calls to plaintiff's telephone number between September 22, 2015, and January 11, 2016. Twelve of these calls were made using equipment from Interactive Intelligence Group, Inc., using an Interaction Dialer; the remaining calls \"were made with manual-only dialing equipment, which is separate and distinct from the Interaction dialer, and for which a human being is required to manually initiate any and all calls made using that equipment (including all calls to the x9507 Number).\" (Doc. 5, at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Defendant's Internal Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant maintains an internal policy manual regarding making calls to clients. The manual sets out procedures for its employees to follow. One such procedure states: \"Revocation of Consent-Members may revoke their prior express consent to receive autodialed and prerecorded calls at any time through reasonable means.\" (Doc. 49-3, at 125). Another procedure provides: \"Note: Revocation of Consent may be revoked orally or in writing by members.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant's clients do not have access to and are not provided with copies of defendant's internal policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the movant shows that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). A movant must cite to \"particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations, ... admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials.\" FED.

According to plaintiff, the placement of the adverbial phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" indicates that the phrase modifies only the verb \"produce\" and not the verb \"store.\" (Doc. 49-1, at 10). In other words, plaintiff argues that an ATDS is \"equipment which has the capacity-(1) to store numbers to be called or (2) to produce numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator-and to dial such numbers automatically.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ). Conversely, defendant argues that \"when a comma precedes a dependent clause ('using a random or sequential number generator'), the dependent clause applies to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   antecedents preceding the comma ('to store or produce telephone numbers to be called').\" (Doc. 51, at 11 (emphasis in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court finds that the adverbial phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" modifies both \"produce\" and \"store.\" In other words, the Court finds that a device meets the definition of an ATDS only when it is capable of randomly or sequentially producing, or randomly or sequentially storing telephone numbers. Plaintiff's interpretation would only be correct if subsection (a)(1)(A) read: \"to store or, using a random or sequential number generator, to produce telephone numbers to be called.\" Rearranging the text in that manner would make it clear that \"using a random or sequential number generator\" modifies only \"produce\" and not \"store.\" In the statute, however, the adverbial phrase is preceded by a comma and follows both verbs. The words \"using a random or sequential number generator\" is set off from both verbs (\"store\" and \"produce\") with a comma. For example, if the statute read \"The term ATDS means equipment which has the capacity-(A) to dial, and to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and ...,\" the words \"to dial\" would still be tied to \"telephone numbers to be called,\" but \"to dial\" would not be modified by \"using a random or sequential number generator\" because the phrase has been isolated from \"to dial,\" and is set off from \"store\" and \"produce.\" The TCPA thus defines as an ATDS a device that has the capacity \"[1] to store or produce [2] telephone numbers to be called\" and then \"to dial such numbers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

As a result, were the phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" understood to refer to how telephone numbers to be called are produced rather than to how they are generated, the phrase would be superfluous, as it would simply encompass the universe of possible permutations in which numbers could be dialed. Further, if \"using a random or sequential number generator\" referred to the order in which numbers are dialed and not the process of generating telephone numbers, the phrase would have followed, rather than preceded, \"dial such numbers\" in section (a)(1)(B). Accordingly, the phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" necessarily conveys that an ATDS must have the capacity to generate or store telephone numbers, either randomly or sequentially, and then to dial those numbers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dominguez v.

(Doc. 55, at 9). Plaintiff reasons that it makes no sense for the TCPA to apply only to devices that can generate random or sequential numbers and then call them because a caller could not, under those circumstances, give prior consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's logic fails, however, because a device can both (1) have the capacity to generate numbers randomly or sequentially, and (2) can be programmed to avoid dialing certain numbers, including numbers that belong to customers who have not consented to receive calls from a particular company. A violation of the TCPA, therefore, would not be a matter of coincidence, but, rather, would result from a company's failure to program an ATDS device correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the TCPA's exemption for calls made to collect government debt,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii), would be nonsensical if subsection (a)(1) excluded predictive dialers because debt collectors target particular numbers they believe are likely to belong to debtors who owe money to the federal government, rather than generate and call phone numbers at random. (Doc. 55, at 9-10). That reasoning does not change the fact that the best reading of Section 227(a)(1) requires that an ATDS have the capacity to generate numbers randomly or sequentially and then to dial them, even if that capacity is not utilized for practical reasons. Moreover, the TCPA regulates more than just the use of ATDS devices; it also prohibits the use of \"an artificial or prerecorded voice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii). Therefore, the existence of this statutory exception does not render the Court's conclusion nonsensical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In summary, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the nature of the equipment defendant used to call plaintiff, and applying the law to the facts, the Court finds that the equipment used does not qualify as an ATDS. The Court therefore finds that defendant did not violate the TCPA by calling plaintiff simply by using equipment to store and call the number that plaintiff gave defendant. The critical missing feature that would have brought the device within the scope of the TCPA is the capacity to randomly or sequentially produce or store a number and then call that number. Because the Court has found that plaintiff will be unable to satisfy the second element of her claim, the Court finds that summary judgment in favor of defendant is appropriate. Nevertheless, the Court will continue to analyze the evidence regarding\n   the third element of plaintiff's TCPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Whether Defendant Called Plaintiff Without Plaintiff's Prior Consent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The third element of a TCPA violation is that defendant called plaintiff without prior consent. The parties agree that when plaintiff signed the Online Agreement, she granted consent for defendant to contact her on her cellular telephone. The parties disagree, however, on whether and when plaintiff withdrew that consent. More importantly, the parties disagree on whether plaintiff's purported oral withdrawal of consent was legally sufficient under the TCPA. The Court will address these disputed issued in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Oral Withdraw of Consent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the evidence shows she orally withdrew consent on August 5, 2015, when she told defendant to stop calling her. (Doc. 49-1, at 1). Plaintiff argues she again told defendant to stop calling her on August 13, 2015, and August 25, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 49-2, at \u00b6\u00b6 28-34). Defendant denies that plaintiff asked defendant to stop calling her during a telephone conversation on August 5, 2015. (Doc. 51-1, at \u00b6 28). Defendant admits, however, that plaintiff asked defendant to stop calling her during a telephone conversation on August 13, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 30). Finally, although defendant offers a qualified denial to the assertion that on August 25, 2015, \"Plaintiff questioned why Defendant continued to call her and asked Defendant a third time to stop calling her,\" it is not clear whether defendant denies that plaintiff requested that defendant stop calling plaintiff, or whether defendant merely denies that the alleged request was the third such request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 30 (\"The cited evidence does not reflect that Plaintiff 'asked Defendant a third time to stop calling her' based on its plain text.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff asked defendant to stop calling her on August 5, 2015. Plaintiff says she did, defendant denies plaintiff made such a request, and the caller's notes do not reflect such a request. Nevertheless, there is no genuine issue that plaintiff orally asked defendant to stop calling her on August 13, 2015. There is also no genuine issue that defendant continued to call plaintiff after August 5, 2015. Given these findings, it is immaterial for purposes of ruling on the parties' motions for summary judgment whether plaintiff again orally asked defendant to stop calling her on August 25, 2015. Finally, there is no genuine issue that plaintiff never removed her telephone number from her online profile. As such, the question now becomes whether plaintiff's August 5, 2015 oral request that defendant stop calling her was legally sufficient to trigger a TCPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Legally Sufficient Oral Withdrawal of Consent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As noted, the TCPA prohibits companies from using certain devices to call consumers on their cellular telephones without prior consent. The statute is silent, however, as to whether a party that has consented to be called can subsequently revoke that consent. Moreover, the statute does not prescribe a process by which consumers are to withdraw consent. Although the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has not addressed this issue, other federal circuit courts have found that the TCPA contemplated that consumers could withdraw consent that was previously given.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gager v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff disagrees, arguing that the TCPA is a consumer protection statute that imposes limitations beyond the scope of contracts with consumers. (Doc. 49-1, at 6). Further, plaintiff argues that the Online Agreement's provision that a consumer \"may\" withdraw consent by removing the telephone number from the online account merely suggests one way to withdraw consent but does not dictate the only means of doing so. (Doc. 55, at 4-5). Finally, plaintiff argues that even if plaintiff was bound to withdraw consent strictly by removing her telephone number from her online account, defendant assented to allow plaintiff to withdraw consent orally by way of defendant's internal policy manual, which provides that consumers may revoke consent orally. (Doc. 49-1, at 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Thus, the Court must first determine if, as a matter of law, parties can contractually limit the means by which customers can withdraw consent. If so, the Court must then determine whether, in this case, the Online Agreement limited the means by which plaintiff could withdraw consent. Finally, the Court may need to determine whether defendant's internal policy expanded the means by which plaintiff could withdraw consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

In\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit explained that the 2015 Declaratory Ruling \"did not address whether contracting parties can select a particular revocation procedure by mutual agreement\" and that \"[n]othing in the Commission's order thus should be understood to speak to parties' ability to agree upon revocation procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p693\">\n    885 F.3d at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

Plaintiff argues that the use of the word \"may\" means that a signatory may revoke his or her consent by means other than editing his or her profile to remove a telephone number. (Docs. 55, at 4-5; 58, at 3). In other words, plaintiff reads this provision as identifying only one way in which consent could be revoked, but reasons that plaintiff could use any reasonable means, including orally requesting that defendant stop calling her. (Docs. 55, at 4-5; 58, at 3). Plaintiff does not cite any legal authority in support of her interpretation of the contractual language. Plaintiff further argues that if the language of this provision is ambiguous as to its meaning, then \"any\n   ambiguities must be held against the drafter of the Agreement.\" (Doc. 58, at 3 (footnote omitted) ). Defendant disagrees with plaintiff's interpretation, and argues that the word \"may\" does not suggest that a consumer is free to withdraw consent by other means. (Doc. 57, at 2).

That it is the desired manner, however, does not necessarily mean that it is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Further, defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Tauese\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. In that case, the defendant argued that the government could not impose a fine because the defendant never received any benefits from his fraudulent\n   conduct. The defendant pointed to the statutory language: that \" 'any person who violates subsections (a) and (b)\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be subject to the administrative penalties of restitution of benefits or payments fraudulently received ..., and one or more' of the administrative penalties enumerated in HRS \u00a7 386-98(e)(1)-(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Tauese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258475\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/113/1/\">\n    147 P.3d at 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis altered). The\n   <em>\n    Tauese\n   </em>\n   court held that the language did not mean that defendant must have received some benefit before any fine could be imposed. Rather, the court found that restitution of benefits was one of the multiple punishments that could be imposed. In other words, the\n   <em>\n    Tauese\n   </em>\n   court read the use of the word \"may\" as permissive, not mandatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    American Heritage\n   </em>\n   is equally misplaced. That case involved a dispute over two sections of a statute. One section provided two ways by which a taxpayer \"may\" bring an action to contest a tax assessment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

The following section stated: \"An action may not be brought to contest an assessment of any tax ... more than 60 days after the assessment becomes final.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802649\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/516/#p520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting FLA.

The dispute in that case was whether the action the plaintiff \"brought\" was \"to contest\" a tax assessment or a refund.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802649\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/516/#p520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802649\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/516/#p520\">\n    at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The use of the word \"may\" in the statute in that case showed the permissive meaning of the word, giving two options for how a taxpayer could contest an assessment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802649\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/516/#p520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It also used \"may not\" in a way to identify what was not permissive: contesting an assessment more than 60 days later.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802649\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/516/#p520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802649\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/516/#p520\">\n    at 519-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Contracts and statutes must be read as a whole to discern meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v.

Reading the Online Agreement as a whole makes it clear that \"may\" is used in the permissive. The word \"may\" appears, in isolation, at least 28 times throughout the Agreement and, where it is used, the context demonstrates that it is used as a permissive term. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 50-3, at 22 (\"USAA may amend this Agreement at any time.\") ). Moreover, defendant, in drafting the Agreement, used \"may not\" when intending to restrict the customer's options. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222957\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/215/#p221\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 26 (\"You may not pursue any type of collective action or class action against [USAA] in court or in arbitration.\") ). With respect to revocation of consent to be contacted via telephone, the Online Agreement sets forth only as follows: \"To revoke [consent], you may edit your profile by removing telephone numbers on which you do not want to receive calls.\" (Doc. 50-3, at 23). The quoted sentence marks the conclusion of the section regarding consent, and the following sentence addresses privacy. That is, defendant, in drafting the Online Agreement, stated only one method in which a signatory \"may\" revoke consent, but defendant did not include any subsequent limitations or qualifications. Had defendant in this case followed the use of the permissive \"may\" by going on to state that a signatory \"may not\" withdraw consent by any means other than by removing the telephone number from the online profile, then defendant would have clearly delineated the one and only way a customer could withdraw consent. Defendant did not do this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   It does not follow that the use of the word \"may\" implies \"may not.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saxton v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518389\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/954/#p958\">\n    901 F.3d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 958 (8th Cir. 2018) (refusing to find an\n   implied \"may not\" in a statute where Congress stated that FHFA \"may\" take certain actions). This is especially true when, as here, defendant, in drafting the contract, used the words \"may not\" at least eleven times in other sections of the Online Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 50-3, at 26 (3 times), 28 (1 time), 29 (7 times) ). Moreover, defendant used other mandatory language when it chose to do so. The Online Agreement uses the words \"may only\" in at least two places (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 22, 24), \"must\" in at least eleven places (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 25 (1 time), 26 (10 times) ), \"shall\" in at least ten places (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 25 (2 times), 26 (5 times), 27 (3 times) ), and \"shall not\" at least three times (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 26 (1 time), 27 (2 times) ). Thus, in reading the Online Agreement as a whole, it is apparent that when the Agreement provides that \"[t]o revoke this authorization [to be called via telephone], you may edit your profile by removing telephone numbers on which you do not want to receive such calls,\" the Agreement is providing one way, but not necessarily the only way, in which a signatory can revoke authorization to be called.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Even if the Court were to conclude that the use of the word \"may\" is ambiguous, in applying the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    contra proferentem\n   </em>\n   , the Court would construe ambiguous language against the drafter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw Hofstra &amp; Assocs. v. Ladco Dev., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741542\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/819/#p828\">\n    673 F.3d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 828-29 (8th Cir. 2012) (holding that district courts have discretion to apply the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    contra proferentem\n   </em>\n   ). Without engaging in a discussion of the propriety of relying upon the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    contra proferentem\n   </em>\n   , the Court will note that the Court's application of the doctrine would be due, in part, to the parties' unequal bargaining power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terra Int'l, Inc. v.

The Court therefore concludes that under the TCPA, plaintiff was free to withdraw her consent by any reasonable means, including by making an oral request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Defendant's Internal Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Having concluded that the Online Agreement permitted plaintiff to revoke her consent orally, the Court need not reach the issue of whether defendant's internal policy-which instructs its employees that customers can revoke consent through any reasonable means, including orally-somehow altered the Agreement. Nevertheless, the Court concludes that the internal policy did not change the Agreement. The policy is an internal policy and is not made available to defendant's customers. A company may adopt an internal policy that provides more benefits to its customers than those benefits required under a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cross v.

CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In summary, the Court finds there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding\n   the type of equipment defendant used to dial plaintiff's telephone number and concludes as a matter of law that the equipment does not fall within the definition of an ATDS. As such, the Court finds that defendant did not violate the TCPA by using the equipment to assist its employees and agents in calling the telephone number plaintiff provided. Plaintiff's inability to establish the second essential element of plaintiff's claim renders summary judgment in favor of defendant appropriate. Having found summary judgment in favor of defendant appropriate, the Court will not reach the question of whether plaintiff could have pursued treble damages on these facts. Likewise, it is not necessary for the Court to address defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence (Doc. 52) because the Court reached its conclusion in spite of plaintiff's proffered evidence. Finally, given the Court's ruling, defendant's Motion to Strike Expert Testimony and Report of Randall Snyder (Doc. 53) is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 49) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 50) is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   Defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence (Doc. 52) is\n   <strong>\n    denied as moot\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   Defendant's Motion to Exclude the Expert Witness Testimony and Report of Randall Snyder (Doc. 53) is\n   <strong>\n    denied as moot\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 9th day of January, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, the facts set forth herein have been derived from admitted portions of the parties' statements of material fact. (Docs. 49-2, 50-2, 51-2, 56, 59). To the extent one of the parties disputes a material fact, and the Court finds the fact to be material in its analysis, the Court notes herein its resolution of the factual dispute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Defendant asserts that the Online Agreement is a separate agreement from the account between plaintiff and defendant and that plaintiff was not required to enter into the Online Agreement in order to apply for, or to maintain, her credit card account. (Doc. 50-2, at \u00b6 4; Doc. 51-2, at \u00b6 6). Plaintiff has provided conflicting responses to the assertions that the Online Agreement is a separate agreement from the Account between plaintiff and defendant and that plaintiff was not required to enter into the Online Agreement in order to apply for, or to maintain, her credit card Account. Plaintiff admitted these facts in her Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts. (Doc. 56, at \u00b6 4). In responding to defendant's Statement of Additional Material Facts, however, plaintiff objected, stating that these assertions \"[c]all[ ] for a legal conclusion as to any requirement on behalf of Plaintiff regarding the Online Agreement.\" (Doc. 59, at \u00b6 6). The Court finds that whether the Online Agreement is a \"separate agreement,\" and what, if any, legal consequences would flow from its characterization as a \"separate agreement,\" are legal conclusions. Whether plaintiff was required to enter into the Online Agreement to maintain her account, however, is a mixed conclusion of fact and law, but the Court finds that this issue is immaterial to resolution of the pending motions for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    The parties dispute whether the evidence shows that this number is assigned to a cellular telephone. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docs. 49-2, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7, and 51-1, at \u00b6 3). The Court resolves this dispute\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    by finding that the there is no genuine issue as to whether the telephone number was a cellular telephone number and that the number was, in fact, plaintiff's cellular telephone number.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Although neither party explained in their briefing what a \"campaign\" is, the Court understands it to be some type of program containing lists of stored telephone numbers that causes the dialing of those numbers based on various criteria. Regardless, the precise definition of a campaign does not appear to be material to resolution of the parties' motions for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    The Court notes that plaintiff objects to paragraph fourteen of defendant's Statement of Additional Material Facts on the basis that the purported fact \"calls for legal conclusions as to the incorporation of Defendant's internal policy.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docs. 51-2, at \u00b6 14; 59, at \u00b6 14). Defendant's paragraph fourteen states in its entirety: \"[Defendant's] members do not have access to, and are not provided with, [defendant's] internal policies, and they are not incorporated into the Online Agreement (or any other agreement a member has with [defendant] ).\" (Doc. 51-a, at \u00b6 14). The Court finds that plaintiff's objection is misplaced as to the first portion of defendant's paragraph fourteen because the assertion that \"members do not have access to, and are not provided with, [defendant's] internal policies\" states facts. The Court accepts that the second half of the objected-to sentence, dealing with incorporation of the policy into an agreement, does call for a legal conclusion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Plaintiff alleges defendant is vicariously liable for URS using the Interaction Dialer to contact plaintiff. (Doc. 49-1, at 7 n.2). Defendant does not directly respond to this assertion in its briefing or seriously contest its vicarious liability. Accordingly, for the purposes of this Order, the Court will assume that defendant is vicariously liable for URS's use of the Interaction Dialer to call plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The parties treat\n    <em>\n     ACA International\n    </em>\n    as binding authority, and the Court will treat\n    <em>\n     ACA International\n    </em>\n    as precedential for purposes of this case. (Docs. 50-1, at 11 n.4; 49-1, at 8-9 (differentiating between FCC orders that arguably remain good law following\n    <em>\n     ACA International\n    </em>\n    , and the 2015 Order, which defendant concedes is no longer good law following\n    <em>\n     ACA International\n    </em>\n    ; such concession carries the implication that\n    <em>\n     ACA International\n    </em>\n    is binding nationwide) ).
